WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.550
A welcome everyone.
Uh,

2
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.030
today we introduce Dr Keidrick golf from,
uh,

3
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.060
Argonne national lab.
Uh,

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.100
he's currently a principal scientist and group leader and Argonne national lab

5
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.310
and a senior fellow at a Northwestern university and a previous CTO in ibt

6
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.560
international,
uh,
business technology service.

7
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.630
And he's going to talk about how to define the digital universe.
Thank you.

8
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.500
<v 2>Thanks.
Thanks you.
Yeah,
thanks.</v>

9
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.220
So this is a title of Nighthawk.
Um,
my name is [inaudible].

10
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.290
So that's a start of where is everybody using this kind of slide,
right?

11
00:00:56.291 --> 00:01:01.291
We talk about for 10 years change how the amount of data change our words,

12
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.630
right?
So for 10 years now,
everybody has cell phones,
have tablet,

13
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.920
they record everything and the upload everything to the cloud,
right?

14
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.160
We go back to the fundamental storage technology.

15
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.380
We like to see a little bit different.
We wango about how we define the data,

16
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:22.090
how we defined the digital universe.

17
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.180
Then we go back to see how we look at from our perspective what kind of a data

18
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:32.320
story in technology we need moving forward in the next five to 10 years.

19
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.330
Okay.
So we go back to those are dates,
how the project data,

20
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.510
amount of data from the IDC,
right?
This is a kind of uh,
um,
um,

21
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.470
several years old,
but you know,

22
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.160
the projection is every year we get about a 30,

23
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.500
30%,
uh,

24
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.760
data increase and this is the amount of data that we actually need to store it.

25
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.600
So by 2020 people project about or 40 billion,
um,

26
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.360
is that a byte of data?

27
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.990
So at least until right now,
over the past 10 years,
this trend,

28
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:09.670
they almost follow in the same way.
Have No,

29
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.060
we have no seen any of the slowdown yet.
Right?

30
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.490
So when we actually look at this,
you know how we define the digital universe,

31
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.530
right?
So when we talk about Dj who worked with Hawk,

32
00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:23.290
how about the amount of data that we actually created?

33
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.440
So we generated and stored and the utilized we can use typically categorized

34
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.760
into four computation for storage and for communications,

35
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.400
right?
So many of talk about this,

36
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.670
we use the basic units are baits to measure that.

37
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.970
And then my mapping this technology and by mapping tools,

38
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:47.800
the fundamental physics and units like a time,
like a,
you know,

39
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.750
and like a lens,

40
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.460
we defined the beat per second for communication and beat for scoring for the

41
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:58.870
storage.
Okay,
so now let's look at right at the,

42
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.460
on the Lens how basic unit for the physical world and the older two define the

43
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.820
phaser who were,
did we have someone basically unit and people use?
How about,

44
00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:12.370
so the digital universe,
right?
Historically,
when we talk about the pit,
right?

45
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:16.720
We saying so basically you'll need for information mostly based on the

46
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.340
definition people post posted and you can actually see the talk about computing

47
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:22.240
and communication.

48
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.010
So people have really putting those a definition in those word,

49
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.190
but most of the time the Misa storage apart,
right?

50
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.120
This is all right when we talk about this,
a different definition,

51
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.430
but we want to add what does that means when the we including the storage
aspect.

52
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.730
So let's look a little bit right when we add in the storage aspect,

53
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.600
right?
Instead of having beat and mapping where a time.

54
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:54.601
So or the frequency we have beat per second and bid per square inch or define

55
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.000
anything related to the communication and this storage.

56
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.150
Now as all the data migration to the cloud,

57
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.770
what we found out is we want to add in another uh,
data,

58
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.640
uh,

59
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.120
property definition where we give them the definition called the data time page.

60
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.530
That is the new definition we tried to put for the digital data property so that

61
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.460
he is just about CFA tailored towards the cloud data storage.

62
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.000
So what he's he,
cause I could that definition,
right.

63
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.970
So that's he's the only a formula I'm going to show today,

64
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.650
which is the data temperature formula,
which is shown here,
right?

65
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.060
So the time,
the job of data in here,
we try to define,

66
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.020
we take a 10 times logo bay based on 10 for the Fowler,

67
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:45.010
assess the frequency and then file that,
assess the frequency hippy guy.

68
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.690
He suggested you find by the number of assassins of divided by the time,

69
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.350
right.
The time most of the people define as a second.

70
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.980
And so you can actually using that.
If we choose the,
the,

71
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.320
the units of time to be one year,
that means that we're adding accounts on here.

72
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.030
Then we can't find our universe or linear response of,
you know,

73
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.800
in the acts acts as a logarithmic off number assessed per second.

74
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.060
The way I access is actually the temperature defined by the degree of G.
Right?

75
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.950
So why are we using this a specific unit and Super Safia formula,
right?

76
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.330
And the next page around them to see that you have somewhere interesting aspect

77
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.750
that kind of actually mapping people's uh,
you know,

78
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:30.670
understanding of all the physical world.

79
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.740
If you pick up those typical data storage or device,
my hard drive,
right?

80
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.450
The highest RPM hard drive goes up by 1500 Rpm,

81
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.320
uh,
uh,
uh,
15,000 rpm.

82
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.320
So the average kind of sensor data about 300 times per second when you're using

83
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:52.680
this formula that's cross funding to the highest,

84
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.980
the time future capability of the,
of the data temperature,

85
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.300
about 100 degree.
That's mapping to our physical word,

86
00:06:01.301 --> 00:06:05.570
a feeling about the heart and the barley.
Tom Pitcher,
mummy.

87
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.100
It talks about the average people using their laptop or you will have daily work

88
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.220
meetings.
You are Sassy or data a few times a day.

89
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.500
And that's again coming back using this data temperature back to about 25
degree,

90
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.770
which he exactly mapping to about a room 10 page or value.

91
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.500
And then people using this to say,
hey,
you know what,
if I try to store my data,

92
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.420
I use maybe once a year family photos,
right tax,
uh,
uh,

93
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.930
without those getting back to about zero degree.

94
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.510
Not exactly the freezing zero temperature freezing the,

95
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.610
the in the uh,
freezing the water,
right?

96
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.810
And then you can further extended,
right?
If you look at all of this,
you can see,

97
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:50.750
hey,
you know,
for this definition and why spy,

98
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.430
you talk about all the data story technology.
You,
you talk about the run,

99
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.810
you can talk about the flash,
he'd talk about Hudd,
you talk about blue and tape.

100
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.410
The actuary can,
oh,

101
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.200
mapping in their spar and all my opinion the same chart.

102
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.860
And you can see exactly each different hardware technology,

103
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:14.330
how they corresponding to different the capability to handle the input and

104
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:18.770
output and rewrite of the data.
And when you actually look at those,

105
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:23.240
the first data digital data I recruited,
um,
you know,

106
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:28.241
and the store are they in the first generation of hard drive by 1956 if those

107
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:31.190
data have never been read back,

108
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.790
not corresponding to the time picture of your freezer at home,

109
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.280
that is miners 18 degree.
Right?

110
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.700
So this definition is not only very interesting to mapping to the average of

111
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:46.760
people's dailies,
a feeling,
but also they have lots of impact.
Right?

112
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.740
So that on the next few minutes I'm going to talk about a little bit about how

113
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:56.741
does that impact in terms of the data story of technology and then located or

114
00:07:57.011 --> 00:08:02.000
how does that impact and what kind of future technology solution may exist.

115
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.960
Right.

116
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.960
And then at the same time we're also trying to see what's a digital universe.

117
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:11.330
I have a Lucia,
how does this compare to the physical universe?

118
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.430
And how does this compare to our human society evolution?
Okay.

119
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:23.590
So before we doing everything like that and the primary reason we give this a

120
00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:29.771
deaf Nasia is by trying to help people to have better definition when the,

121
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.230
to their business,
right?
So one of the reason is this time period,

122
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:38.360
the definition,
we'll give this a,

123
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:43.430
a very accurate prediction or a description about how your charges your cloud

124
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:47.630
service,
right?
So this is where the money goes.

125
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.980
If you look at all the it cloud service provider,
right?
Typically it says,
oh,

126
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:56.820
I give you a service,
you can have this x amount of the data storage.

127
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.310
And typically a lot of time they sense this x amount of data stories for free.

128
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.960
What the charter is.

129
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.060
It's actually how many gigabyte or terabyte of data you can access.

130
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.550
And those he is to come from the random manner.

131
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.980
So they talk about this Pan Lewis,

132
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.340
which is actually cross funding to oral proportional to your data 10 page.

133
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.210
So every different company using the different terms,

134
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.700
but there is no universal rules by polluting the teacher toll,
um,

135
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.970
data temperature definition,
we can give them a universal definition.

136
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:38.190
Okay,
so let's look at how does that map to the hardware technology,
right?

137
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.370
This is a wild,
the roadmap from hudd industry.

138
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:46.371
You can actually see a different technology helping to improve the IRO density.

139
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.740
The project they roadmaps are trying to have the Arrow dance that he kept being

140
00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:52.620
increased.
I had around 30%.

141
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.660
And if you're using that projection compared to the SSD,

142
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.900
you can see solid state memory actually grows at a slightly higher rate.

143
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.660
But when you actually look at as a volume metric density,
right?

144
00:10:07.661 --> 00:10:10.560
The hudd Nando based storage,

145
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:15.090
a product and the tape there are roughly about the same one,

146
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:17.640
a metric density.
So why people's,

147
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:20.310
how they steal from product strategy from price.

148
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.610
That's because the assessor or that the,

149
00:10:24.611 --> 00:10:29.400
the frequency for doing input output is drastically difference.

150
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.300
That's cross bounding tool,
that data temperature difference,
right?

151
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.420
So the actually amount of data is stored is not as important as the compare

152
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:43.050
tool.
How high the temperature you'll can tolerance in terms of data 10 picture,

153
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.123
right?

154
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.730
So another interesting aspect is if you look at all these data story of

155
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:52.010
technology particular for example,

156
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.770
Hudd the actor I wrote down said he coverability has slowed down.

157
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.550
So that means now as we try to pack a more data,

158
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:04.620
we have to build a more hardware,
right?
If you look at the,
over the last 50,

159
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:05.490
60 years,

160
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.840
this is actually the every single time for the hardiest strife.

161
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.190
You can see as a very beginning and they start to draw.
But seeing,

162
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:17.070
seeking introduction of the,
you know,
uh,
uh,

163
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.870
personal hard drive and all of these,
uh,
assess time,

164
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:25.730
it's plateaued and the flat at our round to Amelie second.

165
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:31.530
On the other hand,
I wrote down city keeping increase.
So as soon as,
as a area,

166
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.170
seek time become flat,

167
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:40.190
your time to spend to write her for this four drive start or going up is going

168
00:11:41.641 --> 00:11:43.800
on up homeless or like linearly.
Right?

169
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.250
So this is also means that's,

170
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.880
it takes more time to put a more data on the same drive.

171
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.610
So if you try to assess how those fine lines the same time you realize you are

172
00:11:55.611 --> 00:11:57.100
experience a longer delay,

173
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.460
that means I read your data time Pedro of the drive or snare to drop as you have

174
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:07.240
more files on there.
So we run the standard simulation.

175
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:12.241
What we really find is regardless how you assume number of US users,

176
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.040
number one,
assess the the,
ultimately what you'll find is you feel peaker,

177
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.970
any given storage device here.

178
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.220
Then you increase the amount of our assess and then you increase the amount of

179
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:24.970
data you store.

180
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.590
You just keep packing more and more files there and as you grow,

181
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:32.170
so the number of files stored on that device,

182
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.520
what you'll find is the average temperature of that drive start to drop.

183
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.610
That means you'll have more files there,

184
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.510
but you have limited bandwidth to do the read write operation.

185
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:48.550
So on average each fell can be assessed.
That frequency starts to drop.

186
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.850
And if you think about,
you know,

187
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.940
all the story device we ever created and we ever put in surveys as one big

188
00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.340
device,
what you can find is over the past 20 years,

189
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.470
the dd or do you only words the amount of data keeping increase as 30% per year

190
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.740
that we stored
the amount,

191
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.830
the files that could be increased about a similar ratio.
But at the band,

192
00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:18.400
the way it's done,
the increased as much.

193
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.380
That's why you also see the monotonic decrease of the whole digital universe.

194
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.640
So you can see this is the same trend.

195
00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:31.250
Therefore the hardiest drive as well as you can use the same analysis for all

196
00:13:31.251 --> 00:13:32.830
different other technologies.

197
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.610
So we've been low cat tower,
um,
different the way,

198
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:45.010
so using the data,
right?
You can see from the Nike 50th Until 98,

199
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.790
he's primarily all this data using enterprise space,

200
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.810
people only in the larger business kind of for to have that.

201
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.200
Then you get to the PC era and then every family start to using and having their

202
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.910
data story in their own home.

203
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.840
And then after a year or two sound and we start to migrate to cloud,

204
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.940
people start with store more information over the cloud until now,
not family,

205
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:14.680
don't even store match information in their local a storage device.

206
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.200
So as this change,

207
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:22.230
what's really happening is there is a fix a number of user for a long time.

208
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.180
But as you migrate to the cloud,

209
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:29.610
each storage device in the Google server,
you know,

210
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:34.450
Amazon servers start to have to host the data from many different user.

211
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.060
And this goes very rapidly.

212
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.980
And so what are happened is that's actually creating a different requirement in

213
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:46.270
terms of the data 10 pitch.
So this,
you know,

214
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:50.420
a blue [inaudible] is actually a illustrations of the hardest strive kappa

215
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.360
capacity or the last 25 years.

216
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.700
You can actually see the hardiest strive actually increased at about 43% per

217
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:03.230
year in terms of all capacity until last year.

218
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.710
Okay.
I don't have the new data for this year yet,

219
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.740
but so far found your last year for last 30 years.

220
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:14.450
It's almost 43% per year.
And you can see,
you know,

221
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:17.560
as we migrate to the cloud,
the files,

222
00:15:17.561 --> 00:15:19.670
how does doesn't necessarily increased by allowed.

223
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.570
So what's we really see is the number of files on the right hand side.

224
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:28.530
Also you know the number of houses and go monotonically where's the the,

225
00:15:28.531 --> 00:15:28.870
the,

226
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:33.870
the drive capacity and the average of data time picture of the drive start to

227
00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:37.970
draw simply because you take a similar amount of time,

228
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.860
you run them selector to read and write data.
But you know,

229
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:47.610
now you have to go over a lot more files,
right?
This is the,

230
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.640
the case that even 10 years ago,

231
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:54.020
people here I Google already find out it'd become a problematic because you guys

232
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.450
were all in that,

233
00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:00.180
how do you strive become archive solution rather than actually real time,

234
00:16:00.181 --> 00:16:03.440
sorry solution.
Right?
So this is nothing new,
right?

235
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.890
But when we actually look at this is typically the average data temperature of

236
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:13.730
our drive and it's a pico temperature value is different.

237
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.480
They can be very by as much as 40 50 degree.

238
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.910
We are located at 40 to 50 degree.

239
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:23.960
That means you're talking about the five older magnitude,
your difference.

240
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:29.470
The reason that people can tolerance that is because in reality when we're using

241
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:34.040
that hard drive for the data storage or using any of those storage device,

242
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.660
what we really have is that we only have very tiny percent hedge or file,

243
00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:41.840
which are heart,
which we need them.
We are frequent assess.

244
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.340
We pay 99% of our money for the data.

245
00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.930
We're very infrequently to assess them,
but think about it,
right?

246
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:52.280
When we put the service,

247
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.240
we charge our customer by the frequency of ourselves.

248
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.750
So that is where are we making the money?
Right?
So in that regard,

249
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:02.480
when they are putting this into the cloud,
the data storage,

250
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.800
our curtness stories,

251
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.800
Kim is very inefficient because we use a high,
high cost,

252
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.720
more expensive hardware solution store.
Lots of data we almost never use,

253
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.730
right?
But on the other hand,

254
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.330
that's also means because these things that exists,

255
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.780
therefore we can't use the low data temperature capability,

256
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:28.781
hardware set up to make our complex surveys because it's very hard to predict

257
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.080
which particular piece of information becomes so hard.

258
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.960
And I need them a lot more frequent to assess,
right?

259
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.610
But here is the same when you are actually increased the file sites,

260
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.760
you can actually slow down this data temperature drop to the temperature

261
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.320
comparability drug.
Right?
So as we move forward a little bit,

262
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:51.700
right when we look at the Hod on,
nice,

263
00:17:51.701 --> 00:17:55.650
I see if this is an average day time period habitability [inaudible] how do you

264
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:59.430
strive?
We know that I have some people in migration to the cloud.

265
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.620
You'll have more new now,
right?

266
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:06.150
So human you will have small percentage of data me the high time who trust,
uh,

267
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.830
have high time pitcher but seeing so you'll have more users.
So the,

268
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:15.120
the number of a frequency and number of assess.
So the will increase.

269
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:20.150
So once a wound to is the actually the Manders start creeping up as you will

270
00:18:21.051 --> 00:18:25.950
have more user to our sense of same storage device,
but at the same time,

271
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:29.970
because as you'll capacity increase your data temperature,

272
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:31.260
comparability drop.

273
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:36.710
Therefore what you really have seen is the gap between the market demand as well

274
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:40.380
as your hardware be a billion.
He become larger and larger.

275
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.460
That's gap will be fulfilled about our new technologies.

276
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.880
So in the past 10 years,
solely stay,
drive,

277
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.740
start to oak hill by hand.

278
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.970
How do you strife market is because of this particular reason,
right?

279
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.530
So it's not saying,
oh,

280
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:59.940
the takeover hottie strife market is to be called how to strive and can no

281
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:04.530
longer fulfill the new requests from the,
the market,
right?

282
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.450
Because of the migration to the cloud.

283
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.450
So as we can see it,
right?
Five,
10 years later,
right,

284
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:16.610
we probably have more centralized storage,
right?

285
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.470
Have more user tried to assign a certain set of data.

286
00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.900
Now means you need a email,

287
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:25.410
higher data time period culpability as to the device level.

288
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:30.650
So that is a word a new emerging technology can potentially come in and start to

289
00:19:32.161 --> 00:19:35.970
take him over some of the hand as this space.
Right?

290
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.250
So
let me skip this.

291
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.790
So now let's look at our little bit,
uh,
um,
um,

292
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.770
uh,
different,
uh,
from a different angle to look at this,
right?

293
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.390
If we think of the whole universe is one big or gigantic drive,
right?

294
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.260
We know that's the total amount of data monotonically increase.

295
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.170
So this is the whole digital unit where we only have one drive,

296
00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:09.060
but we have all the possible way to assess the data,
right?

297
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.390
And we know that if we increase the amount of data faster than the band,

298
00:20:14.391 --> 00:20:18.420
the ways that we can actually retrieve the data or to do the radar,
right?

299
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:22.370
Operation there is a monotonic relationship.
The data temperature,

300
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.860
Keith drama,
right?
You'll have more data.

301
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.280
You created your whole state,
you'll have more requests,

302
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.120
but there's a racial keep withdrawal,
therefore your data temperate,
star drop.

303
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.880
If you compare the answer to the physical world,

304
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.230
you'll see a very similar things right after the big man.

305
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.750
Right now as we did tag our universe,

306
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.590
if we find the all the galaxies starting moving our way faster from us,
right?

307
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:48.420
We know the universe is expanding.

308
00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.720
Now the direct evidence is when we imagined the actually physical time picture

309
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.790
of the universe,
the background radiation temperature starts to drop,
right?

310
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.470
It's straw him over time,
right?
So this are follow the same pass,
right?

311
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.760
There are a lot of similarity between all of this larger scale system,
right?

312
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.320
They look how they satisfy.

313
00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:11.650
Look at our little bit about as we migrate to the cloud,

314
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.480
how the behavior of the cloud service worst as how the human,

315
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:20.200
so Santiago evolution,
right?
So there is another aspect,
very interesting.

316
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.910
When we have a justice small amount of people,
right?
People create on village,

317
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.640
right?
They,
they leaving ice hole is spouse.

318
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.740
So they tried to build a very small pass.

319
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.920
People work to each other and connect to each other and as a very beginning,

320
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:39.550
we have the PC,
everybody having their own storage unit.

321
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:44.230
Then they tried to have a cable connect to each other and then 10 years later,

322
00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:48.430
right?
Then people that society has started quit.
We storm to build town.

323
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:53.410
Then we start by multifamily house.
People are leaving closer to each other,

324
00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:55.810
more high,
wider role they spilled.

325
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.410
And in the stories space that we try to put the drive to gather,

326
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:02.950
we tried to put a storage server,
really try to have them to holds,

327
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.890
host the data that have multiple people or tens or hundreds of people.

328
00:22:07.891 --> 00:22:12.640
It says that's underpriced storage server.
Another 10 years later,

329
00:22:12.641 --> 00:22:16.030
you know our teachers who words,
right?
We tried to have the crowd.

330
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.100
When you look at human society,

331
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.570
people concentrate more population density canteen higher you snare to building

332
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:23.800
a skyscraper,
right?

333
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.840
You'll have all of these multifamily home condos and in the Google and Facebook,

334
00:22:30.071 --> 00:22:33.970
right?
You guys building all of this,
right?
The concentration of dryers,

335
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.720
the density or drives can't even to a much higher level,
right?

336
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.760
So when you compare these kinds of larger scale,
he's,

337
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.930
you see a lot of similarity in between,
right?

338
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.430
So given the of that,
right,
we can learn from each other,
right?

339
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:53.650
We have lots on the smart way to manage our data center,
but we can also see,
oh,

340
00:22:53.651 --> 00:22:57.700
there might be some problem that's a human society is facing.

341
00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:02.080
Our physical university is facing that kind of mapping to our Dj with worse,

342
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:02.680
right?

343
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.600
Which is something we need to anticipate those thing happening and finding the

344
00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:12.601
solution right now with a very simple example with how or data archive system on

345
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:17.570
the hardware side,
right?
Because for the archive,

346
00:23:17.571 --> 00:23:19.900
say some you want the lowest cost solution.

347
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.180
So anything the Kols below the hardiest rife blueray and tape.

348
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.930
Right?
So those have the examples of their data archive season.

349
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:34.150
So they talk about,
you know,
steel,
we have billion dollar market and you know,

350
00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:38.080
we primarily a host of data,
there's a lower than 10 degrees.
He,

351
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.140
the time degrees roughly about you,
you know,

352
00:23:41.141 --> 00:23:45.860
you an assessor data as once per month or lower frequency.
Okay.

353
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.620
Even Ramey team,
most of the people putting their data in the archive,

354
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:54.440
Cesa after data,
they're actually expand their hope.
They never need to assassin.

355
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.740
Right?
That's why they tried to drive the lowest cost.
So here as a scene,

356
00:23:59.741 --> 00:24:02.340
the rail,
right?
When you actually look how the state,

357
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.390
you'd still want them to be really reliable.

358
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.460
They kind of keep the data for a long time.

359
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.050
They have low costs for longterm and tennis and the,

360
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.910
hopefully it will be rewriteable.
Well the blue rays,

361
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.530
not truly rewriteable.

362
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:22.460
So why I've tried to highlight rewriteable Essa important aspect,

363
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:27.020
right?
So when we look at it from stories prospective,
right?

364
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.500
People talk about,
Oh,
I take this fire offline,
right?

365
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.970
Or worse as I removed the data,
I deleted the data.
Are you raise a data,

366
00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:38.720
I competing in data,
Lisa have all different meaning,
right?

367
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:43.750
Lots of people using those terms exchange to each other and they don't

368
00:24:44.361 --> 00:24:46.700
differentiate them.
But to,
to me,

369
00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:49.940
to the people who is working on the storage industry,

370
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.460
they have lots of different interpretation,
right?

371
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.470
So if even when we talk about risk data,
there are two different ray,

372
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.970
right?
Lots of times in the cloud space,
right?
You,
you'll,

373
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.380
you'll store your data,
you archive your data when you are actually removed them.

374
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.140
What you'll do is,
oh,
a lot of them have index file,
you know,

375
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.420
compressing a large file.
You remove their index or a secretary to key.

376
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.280
So blueray tape and HDD,
they're all using this master,

377
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.530
right?
And but in rallied here,
right?
That's ps,

378
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.500
all information is still physically residing in that location.

379
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.690
There is,
you know,

380
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:36.250
no way to change it unless you have other approach to make a modification to it,

381
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.840
right?
So on the other hand,

382
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:41.180
when you are actually doing the faith of removal of the data,

383
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.340
I mean you're actually right here another information changing the state of the

384
00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:51.680
data.
Um,
hardware.
So that's a real friends until Sunday.
Something else,

385
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.510
right?
So in that case,

386
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:57.630
the current approach for brewery have lots of limitation because typically they

387
00:25:57.631 --> 00:26:02.030
were right once.
So media and types in rent,
in Siri,

388
00:26:02.031 --> 00:26:05.450
you can do that.
And in Syria can do that many,
many times.

389
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.190
But practical speaking,

390
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.040
you'll have lots of limitation because tape you'll have to physically funny or

391
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.420
library funding or particular tape cutting to your driver honorary,

392
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.730
rewind the following time,

393
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.770
find your old location and take the file out right now after your,
you know,

394
00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:25.580
remove our particular foul,
you know,
compressor so far,
putting them back,
right?

395
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:30.700
So removing one data,
they're taking a long time right now.

396
00:26:30.701 --> 00:26:34.040
How do you strive?
Well,
it's typical,
manageable.

397
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.610
You're talking about a microsecond.
We can make that time,
right?

398
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.710
So when we look at the candidates needs to be done,
is they feasible users,

399
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.310
practical.
While people can say,
Hey,
from hardware perspective,

400
00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.400
we are going to clear see the differentiation,

401
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.810
but why we need to do that,
why we are we buy,

402
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.090
we we shouldn't,
you know,
we can skip this,
right?

403
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.920
So let me pick on one example.
Right?
So typically not,

404
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:05.260
I try to company for example,
I know like a Facebook,
they were very highlight.

405
00:27:05.261 --> 00:27:09.540
How about at the Bruyere base?
A story archive space and a,

406
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:14.370
I think Amazon using a lot on their tape to do their archive for the glacier

407
00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:18.630
storage,
right?
So these are the two primary,
we are low cost solution.

408
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.660
I think of Google using allow time,
the drive based,

409
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.640
but you guys probably also still using quite a bit on the tape side as well.

410
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:31.430
So what's really happening?
So you can pair a lot to information to this season,

411
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.230
but by the time for example,

412
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.930
somebody carotene into are really important to event,

413
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.790
the amount will removes 30th and email they scare to in randomly in the cloud.

414
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:42.750
Right.

415
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:47.750
What you really see is the steps for writing those information into your

416
00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:50.370
archive.
See some up,
we are similar steps.

417
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.390
It doesn't have a lot of overhead for time and effort and cost,

418
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.750
but when you actually try to feed the equally remove something right search,

419
00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.040
you saw the email,
random scattering,
the cloud,

420
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.800
all these three different technology have to go through the completed different

421
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.050
staffs.
And generally speaking,

422
00:28:10.051 --> 00:28:13.530
when you're actually talking about physically removed those information,

423
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.090
assuming only one copy or circus,
how them felt skirting the cloud.

424
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:22.140
It take her about the two months for actually thinking one dry,

425
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.900
one table archive system to remove them.

426
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.720
They take up all 40 years.

427
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.460
If you ask your mom a hundreds drives running in parallel to do it,

428
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.640
to remove the Blueray Ray and it take about eight hours to remove all of this in

429
00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:42.030
the harddrive archive sees.
Okay,
so those were,

430
00:28:42.031 --> 00:28:46.140
the candle comprise him and he says,
so as we can see,
oh,
you know,

431
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.370
if we want,

432
00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:52.370
if we think I some point that we need to remove unwanted data and that become

433
00:28:53.201 --> 00:28:54.034
important,

434
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.920
then the choice of the data storage technology may make a huge impact.

435
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:03.150
Right?
So the next question is can we,

436
00:29:03.151 --> 00:29:07.950
or should we write,
be able to actually complete a,
remove the data,
right?

437
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.990
So there are lots of arguments,
right?
On one side it's dominance argument.
Say,

438
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.950
Oh,
you know,
the data is important,
we should never remove them,
right?

439
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.340
And they also say,
you know,
there are lots of field,

440
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.690
it's a federal law required.
You aren't have data for 10 years,

441
00:29:24.691 --> 00:29:29.670
for 30 years.
Those are the two argument on the other side,
you know,

442
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:34.320
there are a lot of data actually created in way that people privates,
right?

443
00:29:34.321 --> 00:29:38.580
It is something that should be removed,
right?
Or you know,

444
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:43.450
they were data,
you know,
no data probably will last for,
you know,

445
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.950
a hundred million years,
right?
Maybe longer than the,
the,
the,

446
00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:51.310
the human society is uh,
um,
a lifetime,
right?

447
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.050
So the way we were saying at some point in certain type of data may be required

448
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:58.930
to remove,
right?
So all kinds of thing could happen.

449
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:04.060
So what's really happening is,
one thing I want to say is in reality,

450
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.500
even for Rhino,
right?

451
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.280
We actually January to a lot more data and we you and throw away a lot of data

452
00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:13.600
without a human,
actually store them.

453
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.770
Those happen a lot in scientific research.

454
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:23.390
Those happen a lot in even our current like autonomous cars that Google is

455
00:30:23.651 --> 00:30:24.340
doing.

456
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:29.000
Your sensor can capture a lot more data than you actually collect it,

457
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.810
right?
And he our daily life,
right?

458
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.300
And everybody thinking their kids photo,

459
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.770
but are you sure you actually go back to check every single photo right?

460
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.640
After 10 years or after 20 years?
Are you also doing that?
Right?

461
00:30:42.641 --> 00:30:46.390
Because eventually you're limited by your own time to see,
right?

462
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:50.980
So you want to see the most important one,
not I racing go wrong,
right?

463
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.460
The second when we look at the face of who process everybody processor date or

464
00:30:57.011 --> 00:31:01.870
how we recognize things,
right on in physical world,
right?

465
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.660
Our eyes,
we opened the amount of data coming in.

466
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.990
It's a much larger set of information than the Harvard brain actually process,

467
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.130
right?
So in reality,

468
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:17.290
we don't really use to store everything information that's ever exist,

469
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.000
right?
And then the servicing is as we early hockey.
Oh right.

470
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.870
The more data you stored,
the most space you have,

471
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.380
the more files you'll have the data time period or capability to drop.

472
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.230
That means it takes longer time to process them.

473
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.070
You want to make sense of that data is slow you down,
right?

474
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.140
So you order to compensate that,

475
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:43.000
you'll have to add in a lot more processing power,
adding a lot of cost,

476
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.810
a lot of the,
you know,
um,
new hardware and software,

477
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.200
a new efforts to gather,
right?
Justine,

478
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.870
older to eliminate all this redundancy,

479
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.410
making the sense of the same side of the data,
right?

480
00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:01.900
So from the [inaudible] perspective,

481
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.040
now I drawing a national lab,
they care about the costs,

482
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.500
particularly the energy consumption,
right?

483
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.460
If we store a lot more data and doesn't really use them,

484
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.430
that's a big waste from national perspective.
You know,

485
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.620
it's a bigger way.
So I energy,
right?

486
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.800
So with all of this we say,
Oh,

487
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:28.801
I sometime people may need to consider how we can identify and remove those

488
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.830
data,
how we can actually physically remove them.

489
00:32:32.831 --> 00:32:37.831
So the answer they no longer causes us to holding them how much they cost.

490
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.560
Right.
Give you one you,
cause I'm Paul this a call is not to chess,
my last name,

491
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:46.310
right?
This is actually the government accountability office.

492
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.900
They actually check.
So from their report of the assess the Uis,
Carmen,

493
00:32:50.901 --> 00:32:55.901
to actually spend the more than 70% of their it spending maintains those old

494
00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:01.280
legacy system as a readout.
Even like her last year alone,
right?

495
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.040
The we're having some points,

496
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:07.670
$3 billion less investment or to the new

497
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:14.180
technology,
but they have to move this farm to maintain the way are old ones,

498
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.280
right?
Those are the information you'll store.

499
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.280
But some of them still important.

500
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.130
But because you will have no way to transfer to a new system,

501
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.430
but some of them may be obsolete,
right?

502
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.360
So when we look at that Facebook,
right?
It's a very young company,

503
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.460
about 10 years old,
right?

504
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:37.150
Right now they have tried to store all the information people ever uploaded

505
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.520
there,
right?
Some of them may be important,

506
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.130
some of them may be less important,

507
00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:48.920
but what will happen in 10 years later,
right?
What will happen 20 years later,

508
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.120
right?

509
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:55.120
So those data have to be putting somewhere in their data archive season.

510
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.240
Let's say you're putting the Ray,
right?
Five years later,

511
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:01.890
you'll find 5% of data may no longer need it.

512
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.120
You have no way physically remove them.
What you do,

513
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.150
you let them sit there 10 years later,
oh,

514
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:12.230
that'd become 15% right?
So as a time aggregate,
right?

515
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.430
As somewhere realize,
oh,
majority data,

516
00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.010
not now that important anymore,
right?

517
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.410
So at some point there is a trigger point.

518
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.670
So if you don't find a solution where you can actually usually replaced,

519
00:34:25.671 --> 00:34:30.200
those are Montay data with the new data,
it's become,
uh,

520
00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.770
you know,
drive up all your costs,
right?

521
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.640
So let's make another comparison,
right?
When we look at these things,

522
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:45.470
we talking about those unwanted data we say in the digital worlds,
right?

523
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.510
That's also cross burning the garbage,
right?
We talk about,

524
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.900
we have a garbage,
we have recyclable,
we have now recycle,
right?

525
00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.610
For things you cannot remove.

526
00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:00.350
It's like a non recyclable garbage is see to their forever,
take your space,

527
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.280
polluting your environment and take your resources.
But on them,

528
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.190
profanities include four things you can remove.

529
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:11.900
Now become a recyclable,
uh,
staff,
right?

530
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.840
And d come host.
You kind of were right with some new information.

531
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:20.210
So as we migrate to the cloud and now we concentrate a lot more data,

532
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.720
not say it's very similar like a,
remember the human society.

533
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:28.220
Now we have metropolitan,
right?
This is a CT I used to live,
right?

534
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:31.730
And growing up there,
now they have 20 million people there,
right?

535
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.240
So you can actually see as a population density growth,
right?

536
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:40.380
This is the number of s garbage or collecting set surrounding to the CT,

537
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:44.970
Chelsea and older to maintain the function of the city itself,
right?

538
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.800
So if we think,
you know,
if we can actually,
you know,

539
00:35:49.801 --> 00:35:51.990
making all of this to be recyclable,
right?

540
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.830
The number of sites can be reduced significantly,
right?
For the same thing.

541
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.610
If we have our data center right,
we competitor I then he,

542
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:04.611
if I've unrealized have more amount of data that's actually useful.

543
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.900
Remove those.

544
00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.970
You no longer needed data replaced by the use for data,

545
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.010
then the efficiency of the data center as a whole will be improved.
Right?

546
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.830
So there are a few different way to do,
right.

547
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.730
Why will the rare times a to say,
hey,
you know,
data archive,

548
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.880
we replace a hardiest drive the the planter using that to,

549
00:36:28.881 --> 00:36:32.460
to replace the tape or blurry.
At least those are rewriteable,
right?

550
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.640
So of course there are a lot of technical detail.

551
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.440
The people in the hardware side it's working on,

552
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.670
but this is something to get things started,
right?

553
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:46.260
In reality in the data story in industry there are a lot of ways actually

554
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:48.330
continue reduce our costs,

555
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:53.280
but making the rewriteable of this state heart have say some as an option,

556
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.593
right?

557
00:36:55.650 --> 00:37:00.550
So there are some thing that we are currently working on and on those,

558
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.160
the technology we implement,

559
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:06.210
we said we can lower the drive costs to low enough.

560
00:37:06.211 --> 00:37:10.350
So that's a are appealing to the same field and our people are currently using

561
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.360
tape or blu rays and if you look at it right,
what are this means right?

562
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:20.030
The full for the Facebook I think they were directing a benefit because all of

563
00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:24.210
the time they are probably a c or the fanciest growth of you know,

564
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.140
useless data,
right?
As a percentage of the data that is stored.

565
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.040
So they don't have to build the additional data center because a lot of this

566
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:35.130
data sender there,
their information can,

567
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:39.810
can be removed and then can be replenished in a restore on new information.

568
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:42.600
And people,
a company like Sega,

569
00:37:42.601 --> 00:37:46.350
they no longer needs for training sites because now they can build an archive,

570
00:37:46.351 --> 00:37:49.980
say some runs,
an unjust Hardee's drive.
Right?

571
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:55.040
And the same thing for wd is now they have kind of have new product line and for

572
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.600
Amazon,
Google,
for you guys,

573
00:37:57.601 --> 00:38:01.290
you guys are host a larger amount of data if you guys using this.

574
00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:06.060
And you also realize a lot of saving from both of your data center operations,

575
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:11.250
your data archive system as well as for your service.
Right.

576
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.040
Lot of these different hardware technology,

577
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:19.430
they can provide this kind of surveys without having to introduce additional

578
00:38:19.561 --> 00:38:20.820
costs.
Right?

579
00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.410
So the whole society from our personal actually implementing those things,

580
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:30.710
there were actually lower your energy cost and lower your energy consumption and

581
00:38:31.321 --> 00:38:36.220
reduce your carbon dioxide emission.
Right?
So this is,
uh,
you know,

582
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:40.170
from hardware perspective,
we look at how we define the digital universe,

583
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:45.010
how we store the data and know kind of what's a future prospect.

584
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.590
I think I will stop here.
I think that the saw the bank have slide based.

585
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:53.410
I say Lisa's as a summary of my talk.

586
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.760
We try to give a standard definition or detail,

587
00:38:56.010 --> 00:39:00.970
a data time feature and then using that data temperatures to study how the

588
00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:02.170
hardware technology.

589
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.083
<v 3>Okay.</v>

590
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.650
<v 2>Yeah,
I think that's it.
Thank you.
Thanks.</v>

591
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.253
<v 3>Okay.</v>

592
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:20.190
<v 4>Okay.
Here's a right now I,
it's a Q and.
A.
Uh,</v>

593
00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.550
do you have any questions about the talk?
Sure,
sure.

594
00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:26.773
Is this,

595
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.793
<v 3>yeah.</v>

596
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:41.790
<v 4>One question.
I was normally data,
uh,</v>

597
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:46.300
even in active and passive data.
So you have redundancies,
you know,

598
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:47.923
nowadays

599
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.330
not only a single copy of data stores multiple copies.

600
00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.900
So do you take that into account in newer,

601
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.303
richer data?

602
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:03.630
<v 2>Yes.
So,
so here is the,
you can consider every single file you created.</v>

603
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.640
I think independent when you have multiple data you have on chrome of how this

604
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:09.790
piece of information.

605
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.050
So each individual piece of information now being an assassin less frequently,

606
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.730
right?
So you can start a,
your keeping one where a hard piece of data,

607
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.860
now you're creating multiple low temperature data,
right?
That's a huge,

608
00:40:22.861 --> 00:40:26.920
exactly the same thing as we talk about as you're creating more copy,
right?

609
00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.030
The size of the digital universe expansion,
right?

610
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.820
The temperature drops,
right?

611
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:38.970
So the way people in the cloud data store in the industry trying to do is,

612
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.830
for example,
when you have a breaking news,
right?

613
00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.550
Everybody rushing and tried to search or for some piece of information,
right?

614
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.870
But regardless what kind of,
as ISD or Hudd,

615
00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:51.670
they have very limited bandwidth.

616
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:57.030
They cannot keep looking for a couple of pieces of information back and forth as

617
00:40:57.461 --> 00:41:01.750
an unlimited bandwidth.
So they just create more and more copies,
right?

618
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:07.310
But the nice thing for that is typically right after the,

619
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.280
the short pure in time,
we're a hot,

620
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.850
much less than people start searching for yet,
right?

621
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:17.590
So they removed those redundancy,
right?
If you keep all of this information,

622
00:41:17.591 --> 00:41:19.510
you know,
HDD or SSD,
right?

623
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:23.470
Your writer with other information that says like you eliminate,

624
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.640
recycle those data,
right?
Recycle those space.
Right?

625
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:29.260
He eliminated those redundancy.

626
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.640
But what happened is no matter how you to this process,

627
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.390
you always try to keep an archive copy,
right?

628
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:43.310
The archive copy as a beginning,
it's not a problem.
But if our,

629
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:47.840
you know,
these are the universe keeps expanding right?
After 10 20 years,

630
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:49.490
30 years generations,
right?

631
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.140
The aggregate data amount of data become a larger and larger,
right?

632
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:59.000
So by the time you reach there,
now you have to say,
Oh,

633
00:41:59.001 --> 00:42:03.560
I some point I realized I pay a lot more effort.

634
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.360
Try to keep all of this over the data over the past.
Right?

635
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:12.200
And then you'll have to make a choice,
right?

636
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:17.300
There were things that in sync about his two January [inaudible] before,
right?

637
00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:18.860
We don't even have all of this.

638
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:23.720
The teachers are data that nation people still live fine.

639
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.870
Right?
Of course.
Now it's better.
Right?

640
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.480
But you time the means you'll have unlimited data,

641
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.420
whatever and make you better because,
you know,
no,

642
00:42:32.421 --> 00:42:34.530
I didn't probably most people watching their,

643
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.870
their cell phone more than they actually watching the real life person.
Right.

644
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:42.860
People go dating instead of talking to each other,
they do texting.
Right.

645
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:46.230
That's not me know,
be the,
the,
the right thing.
Right.

646
00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.660
Yeah.

647
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.130
<v 4>My kind of second question is,
so normally I sir,</v>

648
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:55.600
<v 5>what do you make a,</v>

649
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:59.210
<v 4>it's very applicable to kind of services we provide.</v>

650
00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:00.760
<v 5>Uh,
but uh,</v>

651
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:06.260
<v 4>like we as a cloud service provider,
uh,
sometimes the data written,
you know,</v>

652
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.040
like,
uh,

653
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:12.040
the data criticality or the data retention that took him and comes from the

654
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.680
customers.
Do you have any,

655
00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:16.530
<v 5>um,
uh,</v>

656
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.740
<v 4>do you have any opportunities that are bad we can provide this data?</v>

657
00:43:20.741 --> 00:43:22.570
Temperature suggestions to them are,

658
00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:27.970
<v 2>yes.
So this is actually the kind of interesting part,</v>

659
00:43:27.971 --> 00:43:31.210
right?
Because for example,
you Fi,
you know,

660
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:36.160
talk to people like you guys or like a Microsoft when there are sales people,

661
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.550
right?
When they sell to their customer about cloud service,
right?

662
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.010
They basically just use,
in our former,
right,

663
00:43:42.011 --> 00:43:45.820
you'll have x amount of terabyte storing in our server,

664
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.750
you'll have this abandoned west,
then you'll pay an amount of money,
right?

665
00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.820
So when those people coming to talking to you,
right?
In reality,

666
00:43:54.821 --> 00:43:58.960
the pre,
the premium to alleyways data,
Tammy recoverability,
right?

667
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:04.210
The character here is,
oh,
we go there,
a log rhythmic.
So you can,
they say,
oh,

668
00:44:04.211 --> 00:44:07.570
we have our few tiers.
Right?
Changing by five degree,

669
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:12.280
you'll changing by double your price.
Right?
This can be really translated there,

670
00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:17.050
right.
It's just every company probably using very similar formula,

671
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.000
but there were no way to talk to each other to try to standardize them.
Right.

672
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:26.350
So that is a kind of an interesting aspect.
That's why I tried to use,

673
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.170
there's a formula because I feel like,
oh,

674
00:44:29.171 --> 00:44:33.750
it's very interesting because people who are naughty working in the technology

675
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:38.460
side now can use that carry correlate to this degree.
It was there,
you know,

676
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:42.690
daily life.
Right.
By the at the same time when you actually look across serious.

677
00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:47.030
That's exactly the kind of form there.
All this,
the you'll okay.

678
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:52.380
<v 6>[inaudible] it's a very interesting perspective to compare this with actually.</v>

679
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:55.650
For Real.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Yeah.

680
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.280
And just have a follow up question to what she talk about.

681
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:06.150
All the companies are already using similar concept,

682
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.590
the no standardized yet.
How is the progress of standardizing and the water,

683
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:13.830
the company's reactions when they,
when you bring up this concept?

684
00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.820
<v 2>So,
um,
good question.</v>

685
00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:21.850
So the standard was a formula now time for them before you're just come saw it

686
00:45:23.541 --> 00:45:27.890
sanctuary in an earlier slide where you can see,
um,
I just,

687
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:31.460
I'm startled publishing this a few months ago,

688
00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.940
started talking to other people.
Um,

689
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:39.440
it's a very interesting ass an ag because,
uh,
uh,

690
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:43.130
even reality,
right?
Every company,
they,
Justin you tool.

691
00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.970
However our formula this,
they show it to their customer,
right?

692
00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.300
So I'm practical aspect.
Um,
you know,

693
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:55.190
if they sing because they can sell to their customer primary,
that's good enough.

694
00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.210
Right?

695
00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:00.890
But for the people working on the storage inside particular last couple of years

696
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.850
I started to looking at,
you know,
I used to be working for cigarette,

697
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:09.560
the harddrive company,
right?
Low Cab and scientific data storage technology.

698
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.650
But I tried to champion outside to look at,
hey,

699
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:16.760
how are you two different technology in fact interact each other.
So for example,

700
00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:21.780
why as ISD taking over some of the market on HDD or the past few years,

701
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.770
right?
So I tried to say,
hey,
you know,

702
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.650
either some universal relation there,
right then that I wrote as a high,

703
00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:34.550
you know,
people in the IT industry,
they have this and this equivalency,
right?

704
00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.050
They're all following the similar trend,

705
00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:38.090
but nobody really tried to put something in there.

706
00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.800
So I hope that people will snap into buying this and the soul.

707
00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:48.070
I'm starting to try to press all different data storage company to start using

708
00:46:49.011 --> 00:46:50.880
something like this.
Uh,

709
00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.980
last year my first son President does a magnitude recording conference.

710
00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:00.140
It was very interesting because normally only hardrive company go to those

711
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:03.020
conference.
But I do see people from,

712
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.980
whereas on Facebook and I'll go there and listen to that talk.

713
00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.790
So hopefully they was feeling like,
oh this is interesting.

714
00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:15.110
And I think that if we got him more,
um,
how to say,

715
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.820
because I myself is from hardware side,
right?
Funds Star aging.
That's right.

716
00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:24.850
If I got more opportunity to talk to the people in the cloud space,

717
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:28.370
right?
Or maybe being open compute nodes,
right?

718
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:31.150
Space lots of this [inaudible] star two,

719
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.610
we'll be able to start to adapt to it.

720
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.170
I definitely think cause that's a very useful because if you look at her in

721
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:40.250
storage industry,
right,
with our,

722
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:45.100
all these different technology from paypal blueray how this drives solid state

723
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.080
the run.
And we have lots of emergent technology.

724
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.950
So being around flash and I'm the RM,
you know,

725
00:47:53.951 --> 00:47:57.910
face change,
um,
you know,
three d cross point,
all of this,
right?

726
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.760
But now with one formula,
right?

727
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.480
All of them just following within the same chart,
right?

728
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.820
We talk about our 160 degree,

729
00:48:06.821 --> 00:48:11.821
you'll cover everything included in the data storage technology right now.

730
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:16.540
Sing,
go outside this boundary right now.
Right?
So this is something make,

731
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.220
make it,
you know,

732
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.270
where we are attractive because people are interesting in the hardware side.

733
00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:26.800
The interest say what kind of new technology or new design or new approach we

734
00:48:26.801 --> 00:48:31.300
can have to take our new market,
right.
Take a market,
current hub,
right.

735
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:36.400
My starting point in say you're never really argued some technology to take over

736
00:48:36.401 --> 00:48:37.840
the other technology market.

737
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:39.510
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

738
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:42.750
<v 2>The your or should be or there is a new market,</v>

739
00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.830
what is the best technology for that?
Right?

740
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.340
So if you have the same solution,
right.

741
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:54.420
To me it's the same market now.
Always the lowest cost one way.

742
00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:55.920
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

743
00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.830
<v 2>But you know,
people have a diversity of needs,
right?</v>

744
00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:04.120
I assume I agree to a cloud actually some of this criteria and become more well

745
00:49:04.261 --> 00:49:07.920
defined.
So that's either for people to look at this evolution.

746
00:49:07.921 --> 00:49:10.720
So that's why you see the,
you know,
uh,

747
00:49:10.721 --> 00:49:14.040
as ISD is booming philosophy years,
right?

748
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.360
But as I,
as I see it taking over,
you know,

749
00:49:18.361 --> 00:49:21.720
high end hardware strive is not because I sic taking them,

750
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:26.750
it's more expensive is because the demand for that particular crowd service

751
00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:32.570
require high data time here's or capability which hard drive actually creating

752
00:49:35.031 --> 00:49:38.970
more gap.
No today as your,
your capacity increase.
Right.

753
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:44.120
So you lose the market by yourself is not an other technology taking over.

754
00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:50.610
So that's his word.
You know my standpoint.
Thank you.
Yeah,

755
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:55.240
thanks.
Yeah,
I think that's it.

756
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.730
Okay.
Thank you for being here and

757
00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:02.330
thanks.
