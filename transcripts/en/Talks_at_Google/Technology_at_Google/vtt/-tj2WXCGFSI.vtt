Mitchel resnick is a professor of learning research at the MIT media lab where

2
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:14.840
he develops new technologies and activities to engage people,

3
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.560
especially children and creative learning experiences.

4
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.750
His research team called the lifelong kindergarten group develops the scratch

5
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:26.210
programming software and online community,

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.060
the world's largest coding platform for kids.

7
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.010
His group also collaborates with the Lego company and the development of new

8
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:38.450
educational ideas and products including Lego Mindstorms,

9
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:41.220
robotics kits,
Mitchell cofounded,

10
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.010
the computer clubhouse project and international network of a hundred after

11
00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:49.580
school centers where youth from low income communities learn to express

12
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:52.310
themselves creatively with new technologies.

13
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.470
Mitchell and the scratch team have partnered with Google and google.org to

14
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:00.860
increase youth coding efforts through projects like cs,
fairest,

15
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.330
Google's CS curriculum for nine to 14 year olds and Blakley,

16
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.920
which makes app development more accessible.
On a personal note,

17
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.030
I worked with Mitchell to develop scratch and traveled around the world doing

18
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:16.970
scratch workshops with children and educators.

19
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.230
I remember how exciting it was for kids to build projects,

20
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.060
bringing their creations to life and how enabling and empowering these tools can

21
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:29.780
be for those who might not otherwise have found themselves coding.

22
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.360
Working with Mitchell and the scratch team helped me internalize that coding did

23
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:39.110
not need to be an exclusive skill restricted to engineers,

24
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.500
but rather a tool to enable anyone to creatively express themselves or to tackle

25
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:48.920
personally meaningful projects.
Mitchell's passion for people,

26
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:53.870
education and empowerment has inspired me and countless others and I'm excited

27
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:56.300
to introduce him to speak with you all today.

28
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.583
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.400
<v 2>great.
Well,
thanks so much,
Tami.</v>

30
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.050
It's great to be talking here at Google without a scratch continues to grow.

31
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:16.950
We're forming stronger and stronger collaboration with Google ads will be

32
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.420
mentioning in the talk,

33
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:21.090
so it's great to be here and to talk with you and to share some of the work

34
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:24.480
we're doing now and looking ahead to some of the things just talking to work on

35
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.180
May,
their projects in collaboration with people here at Google.
Uh,

36
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.460
we've had lots of different ways.

37
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:33.000
We've also been very fortunate to be able to have Phil from Google who then come

38
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.100
and work with us.
I'm here with my colleague Tim Pekin,

39
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:37.470
Fernando who we stole from Google twice.

40
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.540
She came to work with us and visit student,

41
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.450
went back to Google and then recently came back and started working with us.

42
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.350
There's been lots of flow back and forth about people add ideas and it's been

43
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.270
great to have the history with Tommy.
Uh,

44
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.960
so I even went back into the archives and found from scratch was launched in

45
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.090
2007 10 years ago.

46
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:59.091
This was the scratch team and you can see myself there and there's Tommy as an

47
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:03.280
MIT.
She was finishing up at MIT at the time,
I think shortly after this,

48
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:04.540
then started at Google.

49
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.070
So it's great to reconnect and be able to have continued through the years to

50
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.350
continue to share ideas.
Um,

51
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.330
since time he left the scratch team in 2007 scratched,

52
00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:19.090
it continued to grow and grow.
It's like,
you know,
over the last decade,

53
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.020
scratches really groans where there's the number of people joining the scratch

54
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:23.860
online community.

55
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:28.180
To this past year there were 8 million young people who registered in the

56
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:30.590
scratch online community and you can just say,
oh,

57
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:32.560
it's been growing and growing over the years.

58
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.310
But I think for us what's most important is not just the number of people

59
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.150
involved but to creativity expressed by them and the way this is really

60
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:41.950
transforming their lives and the way that,

61
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.010
that they can create things and express themselves.

62
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.140
So I want to start with the story of one of those millions of young people just

63
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:54.340
to give a sense of what the experience is like for young people when they joined

64
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:58.120
the scratch community.
Uh,
citizen,
a story about a young person,

65
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.800
everyone starts with the username.

66
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.780
This is someone whose username was Ypsi and Ypsi described,
you know,

67
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:06.010
an empty was growing up.

68
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.060
One of their favorite things to do was drawing and they love to draw things.

69
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:12.340
And if they got started with scratch,
we,

70
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.390
one of the empties friends explained that scratch was a way to make your

71
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:19.450
drawings come alive.
And that was really intriguing for epsy.

72
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.730
CFC tried out scratch and this was one of the first projects that they worked on

73
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.520
and scratch.
And what I like about this,
as you can see,

74
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:30.250
it's ipsy is drawing and just has a little bit of animation.

75
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.280
You see the ears of wiggling in,
the eyes are moving.
Uh,

76
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.300
and you can almost see here Ypsi starting with something that they're

77
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:41.230
comfortable with and like dipping their toe in the water to try something new.

78
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.480
So this is the scratch programming,
you know,

79
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.010
for those who haven't seen it with scratch,

80
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:48.310
you build up programs by stacking together graphical programming blocks.

81
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.460
This was one of [inaudible] first,
you know,

82
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.470
programs and project as a way to start exploring to testing something new and

83
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:59.110
hips.
He found that they really enjoyed working on these types of projects.

84
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.770
Just started spending more time on scratch a little while later.

85
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.280
This is a project you really got ipsy known in the community.

86
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:09.490
You can see if these projects got more and more sophisticated.

87
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.520
This is a project that ft worked on called lemonade time.

88
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.050
And in this project you can use the Arrow keys to move the odder and is the arm

89
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.950
moves around the otter,
gets tips from different animals.

90
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.470
That daughter comes across the bird,
the frog.

91
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.970
And the goal is to be able to get all the ingredients to make lemonade is yet to

92
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:32.280
get the ideas for,
get instructions and tips on where to get the water,

93
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.690
the lemons,
the sugar to make lemonade.

94
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.740
So Mc put this in the online community and it became really popular.

95
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.470
So if you go to the online community,
you can still see this.

96
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:43.360
This is the page for lemonade time.

97
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.090
And you can see it was viewed 17,000 times.
Uh,

98
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.250
it was loved close to 2000 times.
Uh,

99
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.290
it was remixed 88 times because in scratch anybody can take a project and then

100
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:59.720
make modifications to it.
Changing the images,
changing the code,

101
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.480
it's all sort of an open source culture around scratch.

102
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.120
Everything that is shared is covered by creative Commons.

103
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.270
So as long as you give credit,
you can remix other people's projects.

104
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.630
So 88 people made remix projects,
alumnae time,

105
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.580
nearly 2000 people,

106
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:18.581
1,830 people gave comments giving suggestions or feedback or encouragement.

107
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.550
And you can tell that IPCC was listening to these comments and reading them

108
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.680
carefully because if you're look in the instructions here,

109
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:29.540
it says edit due to popular demand.
The otter walks a little faster now.

110
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.030
So like any good designer,
it's easy,
you know,

111
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:35.900
listening to the audience and making changes based on what comes across.

112
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.290
A lot of the comments were about MCS artwork.

113
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:41.960
People really liked ipsy artwork and several people said,

114
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.470
we'd love to see more of your artwork,
can you share more of your artwork?

115
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.410
So ipsy started putting up some projects like this one

116
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.210
branded as [inaudible] studio and it's a collection of different artwork.

117
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.630
Did Mc sharing with the rest of the community and hits the road?

118
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.310
You can edit them as much as you want,

119
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.440
but you must credit me if you use any of these sprites spread to the objects and

120
00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:09.470
scratch this assigned that if she was learning how to be a good member of the

121
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:12.920
online community and sort of understanding this idea of sharing,

122
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.510
we under creative Commons,

123
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.720
and this was definitely an evolution for epsy as it is for many members of the

124
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:18.980
community.
At first,

125
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.830
IPCC was upset when people were taking their projects and,

126
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.640
and remix in them or using them in different ways or taking characters feeling.

127
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.930
That's my character.
They shouldn't be able to do it.
But over time,

128
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.710
if she came to recognize their,
would everyone shares everyone benefits.

129
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.540
And this time that you're our team,

130
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:38.750
we are constant communication with people in the community.
Try and tell people,

131
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:41.030
understand this,
but just a constant,
uh,

132
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.850
sometimes people would say learning how to share is even more difficult than

133
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:45.350
learning how to code.
Uh,

134
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.860
so that's the real thing that I think a lot of kids are learning.
But you know,

135
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.560
if she was doing this,
but then you know,
is it continued to do,

136
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:54.320
it came with all sorts of different things.
Here was,
you know,

137
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.370
even a tutorial that ipsy did showing how to make scrolling backgrounds.

138
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.140
You saw it in the lemonade time that the background was scrolling behind the

139
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:04.310
Otter Carter's,
he moved the,

140
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.760
or it's not so easy to make scrolling backgrounds and scratch back.

141
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.860
We're trying to figure out how to make it easier,
but it's not.

142
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:13.940
So we'd say the ipsy figured out how to do it and they made this tutorial

143
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.840
showing how to do it and then even commented the code showing people how to do

144
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:19.450
it.
This is again signed.

145
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:24.451
It took us by surprise when we imagined that we would do tutorials and some

146
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:26.000
teachers would do tutorials.

147
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.900
What took us by surprise is that so many kids wanted to do tutorials.

148
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.490
So if you go to the scratch website,

149
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:35.750
there thousands and thousands of tutorials done by kids how to do scrolling,

150
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.990
you know how to use variables,
how to use the vector paint editor,

151
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.720
how to make your projects popular on scratch.
You appeal.

152
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.870
Do tutorials about everything.
Uh,
so just tell him do we just,

153
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:47.150
people are using the community in so many different ways.

154
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.470
So I think just by looking at these projects you can see what ipsy is taken away

155
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:53.390
from participating in the community.

156
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.380
And I think what we see is episodes is really developing as a creative thinker

157
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.840
and we think that's more important today than ever before.

158
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:03.780
For us it's not just about learning the coding skills,

159
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.530
although clearly if you're looking at,
you know,

160
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.730
the scrolling back on MCS clearly learning some coding skills.

161
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.150
But for us what's most important is that if c is really learned to think

162
00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.790
creatively and I think that's more important today than ever before.
You know,

163
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.950
we live in a world that's changing so quickly that we don't know exactly what

164
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:22.260
skills kids will need in the future as they grow up.

165
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.920
But we know they're going to need to be able to come up with creative solutions

166
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:29.400
to the unexpected things that confront cause they will be confronting all sorts

167
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:33.680
of unexpected and new situations.
And we think that's what's happening,
you know,

168
00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:37.260
with with young people like [inaudible] is there to try to support that

169
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:38.670
development of creative thinking.

170
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.030
We developed scratch with four guiding principles of the,

171
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.760
we call them the four p's of creative learning projects,
passion,
peers and play.

172
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.020
So with everything we do,

173
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.770
whether it's developing scratch or running a workshop or giving advice to

174
00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:54.630
parents about what toys to get for their kids,

175
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.980
we're always guided by thinking about these four p's cause it's a good framework

176
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:02.010
for thinking about how you can really help support creative thinking.

177
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.010
So if you look at scratch,
you can see that it really is,

178
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.000
is aligned and guided by these four pieces of creative learning.

179
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.450
The first one project we saw,

180
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.390
ipsy was just constantly making projects in the scratch website is based on

181
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:18.270
projects as the core unit of sharing on scratch.

182
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.440
There's 30 million project that kids have shared now might seem obvious if you

183
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:24.780
look at scratches,
say well of course they're working on projects,

184
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.810
but that's not the way most kids learn to code.

185
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.370
Go to most coding websites and kids are given a puzzle or a problem to solve,

186
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.970
they get the answer and then they're moved on to the next puzzle or problem.

187
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.270
And again,
when I was 10 years old,
I would have enjoyed doing that.

188
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:42.870
Lots of kids enjoy doing it and you can learn some computational concepts that

189
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:44.640
way.
There's nothing wrong with that.

190
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.640
But if you really want to develop as a creative thinker,

191
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.610
it's not just a matter of learning how to solve a certain puzzle,

192
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.310
but being able to do a project and with a project,

193
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:57.660
I mean to start with your own idea,
to develop,
you know,
some prototype with it,

194
00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:01.740
to show it to others,
to experiment with it,
to get feedback,
keep revising it,

195
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.760
to have a way of expressing your ideas to the world.
So with a project kids,

196
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.270
they aren't just developing their thinking but also developing their voice.

197
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.270
You know,
coming up with an idea and expressing their ideas to the world.

198
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.360
So we really tried to see scratches.
It's like a type of writing.

199
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:18.510
The same way when you learn to write is not just to get a task done,

200
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.220
but the way of expressing your ideas.

201
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:25.221
We see scratch the same way as kids work on projects and the second P of

202
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:26.244
passion,

203
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:31.380
I think we all know that we're all willing to work longer and harder and persist

204
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:35.340
in the face of challenges when we're working on something we really care deeply

205
00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:36.520
about.
Uh,

206
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.620
so for us it's so important to give kids the opportunity to work on things they

207
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:43.650
really care about.
So as we were developing scratch,

208
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.100
we want to make sure that you could do many different things with that because

209
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:50.550
we know different kids have different interests and different passions and we

210
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:52.890
want to make sure to align with the interests of all different.

211
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.630
I mean some people suggested,
well,
why don't you do it?

212
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.020
All you do is to make games.
Kids like games.
And it's true.

213
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.320
Lots of kids like games board about kids who don't like games,

214
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.610
then they wouldn't be interested in it.

215
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.680
We want to make sure that kids can make gains,

216
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:10.660
but they can also make animations and simulations and and interactive stories

217
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.250
because different kids have different interests.

218
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:15.760
We want to let all kids build on things they really wanted to want to do.

219
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.220
And you can see that in Ypsi his case,
you know,
we're ipsy with you was drunk.

220
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.290
It was building upon their interest in drawing and use that as a way to get into

221
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.600
coding with peers.

222
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.980
We saw from the beginning that we really wanted to make sure that learning to

223
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:34.090
code was a social experience.
The too often when people think of coding,

224
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.280
they think of the individual sitting,
you know,

225
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.230
by themselves looking at the screen.

226
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.890
And of course he spent some time doing that and you know,

227
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.360
sometimes that's an important part of the process.

228
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.500
We know that a lot of learning happens in collaboration with others.

229
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.450
So when we launched scratch,

230
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.800
we launched the online community at the same time integrated with the

231
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:57.640
programming language.
And to us that was really important.
And a lot of people,

232
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.240
you know,
they weren't quite sure what we were doing because what,

233
00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.700
why do you have to have an online community with a programming language?
For us,

234
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.420
the online committee,
both served as a source of it was,
uh,

235
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:11.380
it was a way to have an audience for what you created because when you create

236
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:14.150
something,
you want to be able to share ideas with others and get feedback.

237
00:13:14.151 --> 00:13:18.580
Cause we saw ipsy getting feedback.
It also serves as a source of inspiration.

238
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.820
You can look at the online community and you see again,

239
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:25.510
millions of projects that gives you ideas of what you want to create.

240
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.290
So we want to have a way that we have kids connect with each other.

241
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:33.250
They would learn with and from one another both to get feedback and inspiration

242
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:37.540
from one another.
And then finally play.
And I saw him was called,

243
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:41.630
played the most misunderstood of the p's because people here playing there just

244
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.030
think,
oh it's about laughing,
having fun.

245
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.360
And there's nothing wrong with laughing and having fun,

246
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.430
but we think of play in a different way.

247
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:52.540
We see it almost as an attitude or an approach to the things you're doing.

248
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.310
When you have a playful approach,

249
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.300
it means you're willing to take risks to try new things,
to test the boundaries,

250
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:02.050
to experiment.
Uh,
and we want to make sure that was possible.

251
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.190
So we've really set up scratch.
So it's easy to put things together,

252
00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:09.190
take them apart.
You can make pro,
you know,
your programs.

253
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.570
Something like building with Lego bricks,

254
00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:13.600
lego bricks or so Tinkerbell and you can play with them,
trying to things,

255
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:16.000
take it apart,
try something else,
continually iterate.

256
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.020
And we want to make scratch really easy to iterate.
He could keep experimenting.

257
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.850
So that's what we did and try to make it.

258
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.830
And we also in moderating the community to make sure the community is,
uh,

259
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.650
a type of place where you feel safe,
experimenting,
trying new things.

260
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.450
So these four p's of guided,
you know,
the things that we're doing.
And from this,

261
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.910
I think this really underlies your house.

262
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.390
Why scratch has been growing over the last 10 years and really has,
you know,

263
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:42.910
grown,
you know,
beyond what we would have imagined.

264
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.860
So last year there were 200 million unique visitors to scratch.

265
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.680
Then.
Not all the,

266
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.670
we're creating projects about 10% about 20 people created projects,

267
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.220
but people just visiting and trying out scratch.

268
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.610
It's things is about 200 million unique visitors,
you know,

269
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.480
every country in the world from the beginning we want to translate to May

270
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:03.231
different languages.

271
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:07.100
So it's easy to make the blocks switch to whatever language you want and even if

272
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:11.750
you see someone else's project to project that was done in New York,

273
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.760
a child and Tokyo could look at it and switch the blocks to two Japanese make a

274
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:20.870
change to it and a child in Buenos Aires could then change the blocks to Spanish

275
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.740
to facilitates collaboration by everyone change it to their own language.

276
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.660
A 45% female,
hundred percent.
Everything is free that the software is free,

277
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:34.310
the community is free.
It's also open source.
So we've really tried to build it.

278
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:36.830
We'll all the development is done an open source way where,

279
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.620
and we have people helping out.
We've been really appreciative.

280
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.690
Bunch of people at Google have helped out.

281
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.570
We did an initiative last year through Google serve and people helped out.

282
00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:48.920
We hope as we continue to develop others helping us out and every day there's

283
00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:53.180
150,000 new projects that kids are creating in the scratch community,

284
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.070
uh,
who's creating them.

285
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.160
This is a histogram of the ages that people join the community,

286
00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:02.660
the peaks at age 12 and this pretty much hits what we'd aim for when we

287
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:07.070
developed scratch.
We aimed at age eight to 16 and that's roughly where,
you know,

288
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.640
the bulk of the people are after scratch came out,

289
00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:12.860
we did another version called scratch junior,

290
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.160
which is her ages five to seven at the lower end.

291
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.700
One thing that took us by surprise as there's more use at the higher end than we

292
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:23.840
imagined because even though we designed for eight to 16 is getting used in a

293
00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:27.670
growing number of introductory computer science courses at universities.
Uh,

294
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.060
sometimes for a whole semester,
sometimes just to get started.
Like at Harvard,

295
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.930
they use it as the first week of the introductory computer science course there,

296
00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:37.960
see us fifth day.

297
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.630
And they found that when they shifted over to doing scratch in the beginning,

298
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.200
the number of people dropping the course,
we went down dramatically,

299
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.790
especially among women.

300
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:50.750
They used to have a huge dropout rates of women and at least they speculated

301
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.560
with scratch.

302
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.950
People were able to have a success very quickly and get a sense of what's

303
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:57.590
possible and what type of things they might do with scratch.

304
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.260
And then after it's in that course,
they do shift other things.

305
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:04.190
Big Scratch serves as a foundation for getting people started,
you know,

306
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.860
within the use of scratch.
When it started 10 years ago,

307
00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:10.280
a lot of it was being used in homes and afterschool centers.

308
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.390
Right now the fastest growth is some schools.
There's a lot of you,

309
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.583
and that's partly is,

310
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.460
it's a cultural phenomena that more schools are getting injured in introducing

311
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:23.120
coding.
So scratch is being used and in many different schools here in New York,

312
00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:26.920
it's,
it's,
it's one of the,
you know,
the language that's really being used,

313
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.820
especially in elementary schools,
uh,

314
00:17:28.821 --> 00:17:32.900
with the different efforts and cs for all efforts is really supporting the use

315
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:34.550
of scratch.
Going out to schools.

316
00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:37.220
I wanted to give you some sense of how it's being used in schools.

317
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.400
So show a few examples of things that we've seen in different schools.

318
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:45.950
The first one is from India.
This one is from Bangalore where this was,

319
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.810
I think it was a 13 year old.

320
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.220
It was in the class where they were studying the layers of the earth as the

321
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:54.450
final project.

322
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.720
They were making scratch projects about what they learned to share,

323
00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:59.370
what they learned about the layers of the earth.

324
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.040
So the teacher explained to us that this dude,

325
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:04.630
he's speaking his native language of Canada,

326
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.810
and he was explaining the different layers that are inhibiting.

327
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.400
He was really excited about was the fact that things are moving aside to earth.

328
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.910
So explain things are moving and you could see it gets down to the water table

329
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:16.860
or things are moving and put some sound effects

330
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.080
for the water table.
So it's again,
a way of sharing.

331
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.200
So this was a case where scratch was actually introduced to school and everyone

332
00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:31.400
was using gut.
Sometimes kids learn scratch at home,
but bring it into school.

333
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.600
That's the nest example.

334
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.890
This is from a a middle school in the United States where they were studying in

335
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.910
a social studies class.
Robin Rapa Nui,
Easter Island,

336
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.890
the island off of South America.
And this dude did something sorta like Sim city,

337
00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:50.570
but Sim Rapa Nui,
he had learned about the economy and the culture.
And you know,

338
00:18:50.571 --> 00:18:52.130
fishing is important to the economy.

339
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:55.640
So to survive there you have to cut down a branch to make a fishing rod and go

340
00:18:55.641 --> 00:18:58.760
fishing.
But if you take down too many branches to God,

341
00:18:58.761 --> 00:19:02.760
happiness goes down because there's a certain way that they respected

342
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.510
environment.
So it's a way for him to show what he had learned,

343
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.910
but also to help other people learn about rapid noway.

344
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.850
I'll share one more example from elementary school.

345
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.600
And this is an elementary school where I really like these examples where it's

346
00:19:14.601 --> 00:19:15.980
used across the curriculum.

347
00:19:15.981 --> 00:19:18.950
So this elementary school teacher introduced to scratch.

348
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.100
And then the same way that if you learn about learn how to write,

349
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.480
use writing and all of your classes,
whether it's history or science,
your use,

350
00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:29.670
your writing everywhere they use scratch everywhere.
In this claim.

351
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.700
This is an example from a book report when they read Charlotte's web that this

352
00:19:34.701 --> 00:19:37.970
was one of the student's book reports and you can see they're using language,

353
00:19:37.971 --> 00:19:40.700
you know,
they'd read the book and they're writing about the book.

354
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.030
One thing that caught my attention with this example is notice how the pig gets

355
00:19:44.031 --> 00:19:46.550
smaller as it goes further away.

356
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.630
So this was also using what they learned in art class about perspective.

357
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.690
That to make sense,
look further way you make it smaller.

358
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.380
Then if you look at the code in order to make it smaller,

359
00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.230
what the student not to do is multiply it by a fraction,

360
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.040
multiply the size by a fraction less than one repeatedly to make it smaller and

361
00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:08.030
smaller and smaller.
So as learning mathematical ideas while doing that.

362
00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.250
But again,
using mathematic ideas with a purpose.
So there's a reason,
you know,

363
00:20:12.251 --> 00:20:15.440
that they knew why they were learning multiplying fractions.
Most kids,

364
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.510
you're talking multiplying fractions and you think,
why am I learning this?
Uh,

365
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.190
but here there were learning,
multiplying fractions for a purpose.
They,

366
00:20:22.191 --> 00:20:25.240
there was a reason for doing it and they can make good use of it here.
Uh,

367
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.890
actually right before this talk it,
before this talk,

368
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:30.110
I was talking to Max and it was really happy he came.
Uh,

369
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.120
he was telling me about it in his third grade.

370
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.650
They're making games where they had to show some things about rocks and minerals

371
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.710
to let other people learn something they didn't know before about rocks and

372
00:20:39.711 --> 00:20:42.350
minerals.
So that's another great example.

373
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.980
I think there was just recently he was doing that and that's a way of sort of

374
00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:49.390
using scratch as a way communicating and sharing with one another.

375
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:52.200
So I think we see more and more of that happening.
Um,

376
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.800
so in our collaboration with Google,
we also are doing a lot aiming at schools.

377
00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.810
You know,
with Google cs first program,

378
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.140
it's an afterschool initiative increasing being focused on school.

379
00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:05.860
So we see that as a great collaboration and we're really pleased to see us first

380
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:10.010
got started.
Uh,
they chose scratches,
the primary programming language.

381
00:21:10.011 --> 00:21:12.820
So we've worked with them and it's been great to see the way that they have

382
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:15.280
built all sorts of resources around scratch.

383
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.490
So those types of collaborations are really important for us because we have a

384
00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:20.440
relatively small team,
we have language out there,

385
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:24.460
but the cs first team is the great job of creating all sorts of resources around

386
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:29.110
it and supporting both the mentors who are facilitators running these sessions

387
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.960
and also developing the materials for kids to use as well.

388
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.880
So we really looked forward to doing that.

389
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.980
Let me give one more extended example of one where,

390
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:40.450
and we see this happening a lot,

391
00:21:40.451 --> 00:21:44.650
where of someone who starts to learn scratch in school but then continues doing

392
00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:47.860
things outside of school and that also makes us really happy.

393
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.970
Actually I was at an event in New York City actually is doing cs ed week in

394
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:54.340
December.
I was down here and it was this,

395
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:58.500
the Cs for all people had an event that I went to and there I met a couple of

396
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.240
high school students and it was talking to them and they,

397
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.300
they weren't using scratch anymore.
They used an elementary and middle school.

398
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:05.590
But what I really liked it,

399
00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:08.800
they said what they liked about scratch was they said it was the one thing they

400
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:13.000
did at school.
They wanted to continue to do on their own afterschool.
And for us,

401
00:22:13.001 --> 00:22:15.520
I think everything should be that way.
So everything we developed,

402
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:17.710
we try to make it the kids would want to do on their own.

403
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.690
And that was the case there.
This is another member of the scratch community.
Uh,

404
00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.050
this bubble one oh three is her username.
Um,

405
00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.710
she's from South Africa and she first learned about scratch in school where this

406
00:22:29.711 --> 00:22:33.160
is one of the projects.
If you go to her website,
to the profile,

407
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:37.370
you can see the water cycle on.
It shows how,
you know,
the,
the,
you know,

408
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.223
the water from the,

409
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.740
from the lake or the ocean goes up and makes a cloud and it goes and it rains.

410
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.390
So it's talking about the water cycle.

411
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.030
But she learned that she then started making games on,
around,

412
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:48.040
this is a fabulous farming games that she made.

413
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.710
She made a presentation about South Africa.

414
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:54.520
She was really proud of South Africa and she went to share her pride with other

415
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:59.320
people in the community and she also made tutorials like ipsy dead and this one

416
00:22:59.321 --> 00:23:03.250
dude that bubbling at three had used variables and she was excited about what

417
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:05.440
you could do with variables and wanting to share that with others.

418
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.520
But the project that really caught our attention and a lot of people's attention

419
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.340
was a project that she worked on called colour divide.

420
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.540
And this was a collaborative project that she did with five or six other

421
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:19.270
scratchers.
They were like in three or four other countries.

422
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:24.271
So they started exchanging ideas in the online community and bubbling a three.

423
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:29.140
It started this role playing game with others and then decided to make a trailer

424
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:32.350
for a movie that they wanted to make about color divide.

425
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.910
So I'll show you now that a one minute clip,
this trailer that they did,

426
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:41.850
and this is an five different scratchers working together to put together the

427
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.690
trailer for color divide,

428
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.640
<v 3>land of color and magic.</v>

429
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:55.220
Every child at the age of 12 faces the test to determine their magical strength

430
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.090
and their color rank,
but all is not as it seems.

431
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.430
This test means everything to me.
I called today,
what if I don't get a color?

432
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.520
I don't want to call it anyways.
I'm going to fail the test

433
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.090
vanish.
Haven't you ever wondered what's out there?
I mean,

434
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:18.440
there's gotta be something I got to close to the gates and I solve something.

435
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.650
Avoid hate living in this place.

436
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.500
The magicians are dictators.
They told my family,
they destroyed,

437
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.790
they destroyed my fruit and bird together.

438
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.990
We'll fail this test again.

439
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.370
Minute mean.

440
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:49.530
<v 2>I think one thing that really struck us with this is the fact,</v>

441
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.280
obviously a big programming after they been a lot of time doing this,

442
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.490
but you can really see that for Bubba one of three,

443
00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.770
there was sort of a deep meaning behind this.
You know,

444
00:24:58.771 --> 00:25:00.570
talking about growing up in South Africa,

445
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.050
turn about this color divide and everyone being given a color and being ranked

446
00:25:04.051 --> 00:25:08.760
by your color.
So we then talked to her and she says,
growing up,

447
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.580
I've definitely seen the scars that apartheid is left in my country and the

448
00:25:11.581 --> 00:25:12.210
people.

449
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.880
I'm really exploring that through the different characters that are part of this

450
00:25:14.881 --> 00:25:17.850
story,
and again we see this over and over.

451
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.300
A lot of the kids are using scratch or oftentimes is they go into their teen

452
00:25:21.301 --> 00:25:23.550
years,
they're spoiling things about throwing identity,

453
00:25:23.551 --> 00:25:25.200
things about the community around them.

454
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:28.230
So you see them tackling issues that are deeply important to them.

455
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.800
Of course there's a lot of things from scratch,
they're funny animations,

456
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.730
but it also is an opportunity for kids to really develop their own ideas,

457
00:25:35.731 --> 00:25:38.360
to share ideas with others as use it as a way to,

458
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.520
to sort through important ideas and also to sort through ways of engaging with

459
00:25:43.561 --> 00:25:48.060
the design process and the creative process.
So bub,
one of the three also said,

460
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.600
she said because of scratch,
I've become more confident to try new things,

461
00:25:51.601 --> 00:25:55.560
to express myself.
I'm more comfortable with taking risks and making mistakes.

462
00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.430
Now when something goes wrong,
I see it as an opportunity to learn something new.

463
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.950
And again,
that's what we were hoping for with scratch.

464
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.760
When I talked about the importance of play and are my,
does a playful approach,

465
00:26:05.761 --> 00:26:09.120
a willingness to take risks,
a willingness to things go wrong,

466
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.830
have been then an ability to try to iterate and to and to debug things when

467
00:26:13.831 --> 00:26:17.670
things go wrong to to try new things and that's exactly what she was getting out

468
00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:22.650
of this.
So really happy.
We hear scratches talk this way and bubbling it.

469
00:26:22.651 --> 00:26:26.100
Three also talked about the importance of the online community for her.
She said,

470
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.400
I've been constantly blown away by the kinds of support and collaboration and

471
00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:31.530
sharing that happens in the community.

472
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.760
That's one of the main things that keeps me coming back to scratch every day and

473
00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:38.340
we see that over and over that for a lot of kids,

474
00:26:38.341 --> 00:26:42.240
they come to scratch to create a project.
They stay for the community,

475
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.510
they connect with other people,
the way they share with each other.
In this case,

476
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.910
collaborating with others,
you'll on,

477
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.390
on projects interacting and getting inspired by others.

478
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.010
And I think it's not an accident that this example happens to come from a young

479
00:26:56.011 --> 00:27:00.570
woman in the community.
Uh,
just last night,
this is,
I've done my freshest data.

480
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.670
Just last night,
one of the graduate students in our group,

481
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.810
a shrew to Darwin was talking about showing some of the latest data should look

482
00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:11.040
at about some gender differences on scratch.
As I mentioned,

483
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.530
it's about 45% female,
the scratch population.
Uh,

484
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.770
one thing we'd already seen was that if you look at the number of projects that

485
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:23.930
people create,
the,
you know,
the boys and girls from scratch,
each crate,

486
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.200
roughly the same number of projects for true to is just looking at the data and

487
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:31.430
saw the following as far as on the social side of scratch.
We,

488
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.510
if you'd like a project,
you can give it a love.

489
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.960
And if you look in the left hand side here,
you see that,
that uh,

490
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.440
the female participants in scratch are much more likely,

491
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.200
they get 50% more loves than others.

492
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:47.670
So on average each be more participant gives 12 loves only eight for male

493
00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:51.780
participants as far as giving comments and other projects,
female participants,

494
00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:54.660
28 male,
16 almost twice.

495
00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.210
And for me I found this really striking because we'd already seen and look into

496
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:01.044
community.

497
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.010
The getting social feedback on the community is the most important determinant

498
00:28:05.011 --> 00:28:07.050
about whether someone stays on scratch.

499
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.050
So when someone puts up a project on scratch,

500
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.080
how quickly they receive some social feedback,

501
00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:17.340
a comment or love has a huge influence on where they make a second project.

502
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.020
So the fact that the young women on scratch are doing much more comforting and

503
00:28:22.021 --> 00:28:26.340
loving really shows the important role they're playing to help continue the

504
00:28:26.341 --> 00:28:28.500
people working on scratch.
So it,

505
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:31.740
and it really shows how the creative side and the community side scratch really

506
00:28:31.741 --> 00:28:35.160
are tightly linked with one another.
So the sign that we continue to look at,

507
00:28:35.161 --> 00:28:38.670
and I think right now we're sitting on top of this huge trove of data cause you

508
00:28:38.671 --> 00:28:42.930
know,
there's 30 million projects on scratch and you know,
we've saved everything.

509
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.870
So we're still sorting through it to try to learn more about the creative

510
00:28:45.871 --> 00:28:49.590
process and the coding process.
As we sort through this on scratch.

511
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.710
I want to end by giving some examples,

512
00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:55.950
looking ahead about the next generation of scratch they're working on.

513
00:28:55.951 --> 00:29:00.030
So we're now working on a third generation of scratch called scratch 3.0 that

514
00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:01.770
will launch this this August.

515
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
The first generation of scratch that came out in 2007 was a downloadable I

516
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:13.430
applications you did low used locally and then you could share on the website

517
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:16.200
where the community was.
If he saw something in the community,

518
00:29:16.201 --> 00:29:19.060
they looked interesting.
Got to download it to see the code and,

519
00:29:19.061 --> 00:29:20.190
and play with the code.

520
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.820
The second generation of scratch in 2013 was all in the browser so you could

521
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:27.900
start offering in the browser.

522
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:31.680
And that really led to a real growth and scratch it really re uh,

523
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.600
it made it removed a lot of the friction between creating and sharing.

524
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.360
So you could sort of see things in the community,
go inside right away,

525
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:43.840
see the right online,
see the,
see the code,
manipulate the code,

526
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:44.860
try different things.

527
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.420
So it really opened up to really lead to some of the recent growth and scratch

528
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.060
the third generation are coming out.
Now.

529
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.350
One of the motivations for it is to make it much better suited for mobile.

530
00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.580
You know,
back in around 2010 or so for Scott,
as we started working on Scotch,

531
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:03.970
Scotch do porno,
we made the decision to implement it in Flash,

532
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.280
which at the time seemed like a good decision.

533
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.560
Right now it's not looking so good.

534
00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:12.240
So we really need to be moving into a new infrastructure.
So scratch the porno,

535
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:16.630
be all html five based,
be much more designed with mobile in mind.

536
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:20.320
So that's one thing that we want to do and we started need to do,

537
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.590
but we also want to make it much more of a,
a basic,

538
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.160
a platform that can be extended to all sorts of different ways.

539
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.000
And this is something,
again,

540
00:30:28.001 --> 00:30:32.410
we've been done a lot collaboration with Google for the programming language

541
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:32.920
itself.

542
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:37.180
We've been working with the blockly team and building on the infrastructure of

543
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:38.920
blockly from here.
Uh,

544
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.470
but then using some of the design ideas we've had from scratch.

545
00:30:41.471 --> 00:30:46.260
We had a great collaboration working together on the new set of blocks that we

546
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:49.540
were using for this.
And these blocks again,

547
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:51.820
or open source as blocked the has been.

548
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.620
So in addition to using his box and our scratch 3.0 we want to have this as a

549
00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:57.520
standard,
you know,

550
00:30:57.521 --> 00:31:02.521
grammar for block based program that anybody can embed in their own apps or toys

551
00:31:02.741 --> 00:31:04.090
or whatever products they have.

552
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.270
So we were trying to make this service standard programming grammar for

553
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.590
everybody,
but then we'll also use it inside our own version of scratch.

554
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.510
The scratch 3.0 another way in which we're extending scratch and make it more

555
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:20.260
modular is make it much easier to extend scratch.

556
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.430
So in addition to the core capabilities of scratch,
we're having a whole,

557
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:28.450
what we call the extension mechanism to make it easy for people to add new

558
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:32.190
scratch blocks.
So of course we want make,

559
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.390
we want to have it so that we can extend scratch.

560
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.360
We also want to let everybody else extends scratch as well.

561
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.840
So now this is not an essay.
Most kids want to do this,

562
00:31:40.841 --> 00:31:44.230
but there's more developers can add their own scratch blocks.

563
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.750
And there's a way down here just in the interface.

564
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.650
If you just want to add an extension,
you can go down to the bottom left corner,

565
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.530
add an extension.
Let me give you some examples of how to do it.

566
00:31:53.531 --> 00:31:56.200
So I'm actually going to run some things live here from uh,

567
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.090
from the prototype of scratch.

568
00:31:58.091 --> 00:32:03.091
Three Point Oh oh

569
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.650
sorry.
There it is.
So this is one,

570
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.500
this is using the extension with the microbead.

571
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.680
A lot of you are probably familiar with the microwave is very low cost to

572
00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:22.620
interface device.
Uh,
and so here's the board is very,

573
00:32:22.621 --> 00:32:23.454
you know,
it's signed it.

574
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.800
If the BBC helped in developing this and they'd give to every school child in

575
00:32:26.801 --> 00:32:29.820
England is now spending the United States only costs like,
you know,

576
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:35.150
less than $20 to get the board.
Uh,
and what we're doing now is so we can put,

577
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.320
do sign like this and notice as I,

578
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.430
so here it's using the,

579
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:45.270
these extra blocks as just saying this as an accelerometer.
So when it's tilted,

580
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:48.520
it's both making the flowers spin and then it has,

581
00:32:48.521 --> 00:32:53.280
it should have a little smiley face shows up on here.
She can see that the code,

582
00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.560
they're shut down.
We just want make it easy for anybody to do it.
Again,

583
00:32:56.561 --> 00:32:57.870
we work with the micro team,

584
00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:01.960
but we want to let anybody who's making new types of hardware be able to extend

585
00:33:01.961 --> 00:33:05.950
it.
So we're working with the Lego company,
so as they add new robotics kits,

586
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:10.560
there'll be using scratch and just having extensions to the both youth,

587
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.370
the scratch blocks and their own apps.

588
00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:16.240
But also we'll have extensions in the scratch 3.0 where you can control your

589
00:33:16.241 --> 00:33:20.590
lego robotics.
We're also working on some of our own hardware extensions.

590
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.270
So this is one the,
right now we're calling this scratch bit.
It's in development.

591
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:29.310
Uh,
one of the graduate students,
the group Craig Hanning is working with uh,

592
00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.460
others including Andrew's Lewinsky was leading the whole scratch 3.0 development

593
00:33:33.461 --> 00:33:38.461
process and a bunch of other people on developing the scratch bed.

594
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.510
Do this.
So here actually my put this little screen,

595
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.770
so hopefully if I,
so this also has an accelerometer

596
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.600
and I'm trying to get the,

597
00:33:52.601 --> 00:33:55.790
the balloons and the tacos and I get different points.

598
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.520
I get two points for every talk on one point for every balloon.

599
00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.380
And if I want things to get out of the way,

600
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:04.940
I think by cover I thought there was a point that sound,

601
00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:06.300
but maybe that's not fair because

602
00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:13.400
he has trying to make it so that it's very easy to take different types of

603
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:17.810
physical devices.
You'll like this.
And with different sensors,
accelerometers,

604
00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:22.340
light sensors would ever,
you know,
buttons,
knobs and be able to wireless.

605
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:25.010
They come here,
there's all Bluetooth,
you know,
communication.

606
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.600
In addition to extend it through hardware,
we're not extend things from the,
uh,

607
00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:35.190
either through a web based or saw or software side.
Here's an example.

608
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.620
This is already in scratch because the spirit of the type of things we're doing,

609
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.270
this is one that uses the camera
and notice,

610
00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.150
oops,
it should be as in the camera.

611
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.840
Oh did I hit the wrong one?
Let me try it one more time and see if,

612
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:06.650
thank you.
So here you see the mini figs are falling.
But

613
00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:17.810
where I can do with my head,
I knew,

614
00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.630
I think a big part of what we end up doing in our group,

615
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:25.820
if we see inside we can take a look

616
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:32.060
and this is the key block.
There are very few new blocks.

617
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.620
This one just says if there's video motion on this sprite as grabbed by the

618
00:35:36.621 --> 00:35:37.980
threshold,
do something.

619
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:42.150
So obviously there's a huge amount of information coming from the camera.

620
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.510
I think a big thing what we do is how can we take all that information,

621
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.000
put it into the right building blocks.

622
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.360
They're like kids use it in a meaningful way.
So we just did it.

623
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:55.260
So you see how much motion there is on your sprite.
So in this case,
if the,

624
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:59.390
if the mini fig is falling,
it sees motion in the background,
it then you know,

625
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.880
jumps upwards.
Uh,
we also have with you can see what direction it is.

626
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:05.580
So you could,
you could also do it by Swat and one direction.

627
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:07.230
It can move one way or the other way.

628
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.840
But just a few simple primitives is what we're doing.

629
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:13.470
We're also in 3.0 we're extending this to do some things with the object

630
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:17.250
detection.
Uh,
let me show one other thing that we're doing.

631
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.690
This is one that actually was just got added to the,
uh,

632
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.030
prototype this week.

633
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.630
This is one of the ones that we're working with people at Google on Todd's a

634
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:31.610
translate feature.
So here's why.
So these are just some of the extensions,

635
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.410
the work on Nelson Division One is what I was just talking about.

636
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.480
Here's a translate one and notice there's a new block.
Let me make it bigger.

637
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:45.000
So basically you can translate a word to any language where you could just have

638
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:47.760
a translator to whatever the web browser is set too.

639
00:36:47.761 --> 00:36:52.290
So I can make this and they would translate things to whatever the person using

640
00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:55.200
the project,
whatever their browser is set to be.

641
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:58.650
If I just set it to a particular language.
So I could just,
you know,

642
00:36:58.651 --> 00:37:03.110
say Oh to French stuff,
I translate French.
Hello,
it says mom,

643
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.920
sure I can then put it inside a say blocked,
have the cat say

644
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.180
so normally lips.

645
00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.870
So there's the cat saying hello.
But now if I just say

646
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.300
translate hello to French for two seconds,
now the cat will say bomb shore.

647
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.440
And if instead of saying to French,

648
00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:27.620
I'd say translate hello to wherever the browsers,

649
00:37:27.621 --> 00:37:31.250
that tool then the cat will talk and whatever language the browser is set to.

650
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.350
So these are things we're doing.
So the,
again,

651
00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:38.060
this is a great thing that came out of the collaboration.
I'll show one more,
uh,

652
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.450
sort of a fake example cause this isn't actually running the prototype.

653
00:37:41.451 --> 00:37:42.470
So it's a little bit of a,

654
00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.043
<v 4>uh,</v>

655
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.810
<v 2>the trick just to show you what we're aiming for.</v>

656
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.100
Again,
we're working with Google on speech recognition blocks.
So it's,

657
00:37:54.101 --> 00:37:57.250
we know that obviously communicating with speech is something that kids are

658
00:37:57.251 --> 00:37:59.590
interacting with all the,
all the time now.

659
00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:03.250
But for us it's really important that kids don't just spend their time feeling,

660
00:38:03.251 --> 00:38:05.650
gets magical of talking to something.
Uh,

661
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.280
and then it talks back to we want kids to feel that they can create things this

662
00:38:09.281 --> 00:38:12.040
way too long.
Kids spill,
create their own speech interfaces.

663
00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.090
So we having some new blocks worth on the speech synthesis side where we'll

664
00:38:16.091 --> 00:38:19.750
actually say the words out loud when this synthesize voice,

665
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.750
but also do some speech recognition.
It's like,

666
00:38:22.751 --> 00:38:26.350
here's one where if you see the key part here,
it says,
when I hear,

667
00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:30.280
what time is it though,
then speak it's party time.
Uh,

668
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.340
and then it will still play a certain sound.
So if I say,
what time is it?
Oh,

669
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.183
see you time.

670
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.333
<v 4>Hey.</v>

671
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:44.460
<v 2>So again,</v>

672
00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.060
our real hope is that again for let kids there to create their own type of

673
00:38:48.061 --> 00:38:52.290
speech interfaces and conversational interfaces with these blocks.
And again,

674
00:38:52.291 --> 00:38:54.840
we're still trying to figure out the exact right building box St.

675
00:38:54.841 --> 00:38:59.841
The key thing is making sure that we preserve what's the core power of it,

676
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.680
but make it simple enough and versatile enough that kids are Gmail to use in a

677
00:39:04.681 --> 00:39:08.860
may different ways.
So just to wrap up,
you know,

678
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.830
we see lots of ways to scratch is going to continue to do that.
We tough scratch,

679
00:39:13.831 --> 00:39:17.310
continue to get out to the world.
And for us we really,

680
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:21.390
we do want to say it as a new type of fluency that something that when we teach

681
00:39:21.391 --> 00:39:25.260
kids to write,
it's not just a that they can use writing in their jobs.

682
00:39:25.261 --> 00:39:28.650
So though people do use writing in their jobs but so that they can express their

683
00:39:28.651 --> 00:39:29.640
ideas to the world.

684
00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.810
And we see scratch the same way when I led all kids grub feeling they can use

685
00:39:33.811 --> 00:39:37.710
the powerful technology of their times in a way that they can express their

686
00:39:37.711 --> 00:39:40.140
voice,
expressed their ideas to the world.

687
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.460
And to do that we want to keep on that focus of projects,
passion,
peers and play.

688
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.460
So there's always more new technologies,
whether it's object recognition,

689
00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:49.560
speech recognition,
speech synthesis.

690
00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.450
We want to keep integrating new technologies.

691
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.930
But always in this framework of providing kids with creative learning

692
00:39:54.931 --> 00:39:57.150
experiences and leaving them in control.

693
00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.740
So it's not that just interacting with things but things where they can do it.

694
00:40:00.741 --> 00:40:04.320
Cause I think that's going to be the key to help kids grow up to become full and

695
00:40:04.321 --> 00:40:09.090
active contributors in tomorrow's Society.
If you want to read more about this,

696
00:40:09.091 --> 00:40:13.290
I did just
finish a book that is called lifelong kindergarten.

697
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.720
We used the metaphor of kindergarten was,

698
00:40:15.721 --> 00:40:18.060
I've been really inspired by the way kids learn in kindergarten.

699
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.620
The idea of the four p's came from opposite observing kids,

700
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:24.440
Kinsey kids in kindergarten.
If you think that the class that kindergarten,
uh,

701
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.450
that uh,
kids are building towers with blocks,

702
00:40:27.451 --> 00:40:30.840
making pictures with finger paints and crayons and the process,

703
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:33.570
they learned important ideas.
They build a tower,
they'll learn about structures,

704
00:40:33.571 --> 00:40:37.260
develop a,
but even more important,
they learn about the creative process.

705
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:41.640
You know,
they learn how to put things together to experiment,
to iterate,

706
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.310
to often,
and they leave kindergarten,

707
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:48.000
they end up sitting in desks listening to lectures,
filling out worksheets,

708
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.570
and that doesn't provide them the opportunity to continue to develop as creative

709
00:40:51.571 --> 00:40:52.404
thinkers.

710
00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.770
So they really aren't getting prepared for what's needed in today's society.

711
00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:00.060
And to make matters worse,
uh,
you know,
a lot of kindergartens today,

712
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.280
you go in there and kids are drilling on math,

713
00:41:02.281 --> 00:41:04.650
flashcards and doing phonics worksheets,

714
00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.230
kindergarten becoming more like the rest of school.

715
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.410
And what we want to do and what I talked about in the book is to make the rest

716
00:41:10.411 --> 00:41:12.780
of school the rest of life more like kindergarten.

717
00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.850
And that really inspired us with scratch.

718
00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.820
So from kindergarten we got the four P's and inspired scratch.

719
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.690
So the book tells you more about the underlying ideas for scratch that do it.

720
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.780
I may just to end with one final thing.
Uh,

721
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.890
every year we do have an annual dinner in New York City.

722
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.450
It's organized by the scratch foundation.
Lisa,

723
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.730
Brian's here is the executive director of the scratch foundation that helps,

724
00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.460
that helps support scratch.
And this year,
uh,
we're,
we,

725
00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.100
we honored two people each year and this year one of the two people are honoring

726
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:45.690
is Maggie Johnson,
you know,
from Google.
And you know,

727
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.850
it's a great way that she serves as a champion for so many of these causes.

728
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:53.420
So it's been great clarity with Maggie and others at Google and we have such

729
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:54.980
admiration and respect for what she's doing.

730
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.100
So we're honoring Maggie along with David Siegel,
who's been a great partner.

731
00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.790
He leads a company here called two sigma is again a great champion for

732
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:06.440
supporting kids and coding and creative thinking.
David.
But thank you very much.

733
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:07.790
I'd be happy to take some questions now.

734
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.530
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

735
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.210
<v 5>hi there.
Thanks so much for the presentation.
Very exciting.
Uh,</v>

736
00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:23.220
I was wondering if you can clarify the associations between scratch blockly and

737
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.400
a code.org or any other associations we may have heard about but are a little

738
00:42:27.401 --> 00:42:28.240
confusing at least to me.

739
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:31.500
<v 2>Yeah.
So here's,
um,</v>

740
00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.690
I'll go a little bit of history.

741
00:42:34.691 --> 00:42:39.691
So scratch got started around 2007 and there's some other people based on

742
00:42:39.761 --> 00:42:43.150
scratch,
started working on other blocks related languages.
And in fact,

743
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:46.780
some of the other things that got done then inspired blocked the another MIT

744
00:42:46.781 --> 00:42:51.150
professor and Hal Ableson spend a sabbatical at Google,

745
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.010
worked with others at Google and started the blockly project,
uh,

746
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.510
rock or at least he started app inventor where,

747
00:42:58.511 --> 00:43:00.100
which was making use of block light.

748
00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.970
So it's sort of using together some of these same block based programming ideas,

749
00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.880
the block who's being developed separately from scratch.

750
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.300
But it was in the same spirit as we started work on scratch.

751
00:43:10.301 --> 00:43:14.050
3.0 we decided to join forces cause he saw the each of us could gain from

752
00:43:14.051 --> 00:43:14.884
working together.

753
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.150
Did we had lots of experience of how to make these blocks really,
uh,

754
00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.160
work well with kids.

755
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.760
So we had a lot more experience working with kids with a block group,

756
00:43:24.761 --> 00:43:29.170
had a great experience and great expertise in making a great infrastructure for

757
00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:30.520
these blocks based languages.

758
00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.340
So we saw each at scientific gain from working with one another.

759
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:37.270
So we've joined forces to basically the,
our new version of,

760
00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.970
of Skratch blocks is building on top of block light.

761
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.550
So our scratch and these are now on top of block.

762
00:43:42.551 --> 00:43:46.420
It's a fork off a block that block the continues to be developed and we're short

763
00:43:46.421 --> 00:43:50.650
of tape building on top of that and making it specialized,
especially for kids.

764
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:55.150
Uh,
code.org which is a separate organization,
has a separate site.

765
00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:59.320
This new focused on getting kids engaged with coding and CS education.

766
00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.990
They have used blockly and a lot of their activities do,

767
00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:06.280
they put a lot of activities online,
uh,
of their own,

768
00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:11.320
some of which use blockly.
So block that gets used by many other sites.

769
00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.700
Uh,
code.org are also features,
many other types of activities by others.

770
00:44:15.701 --> 00:44:19.450
So I've worked with scratch.
Sometimes they'll get featured on the code.org site.

771
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.620
So code.org is sort of this general site that has their own activities.

772
00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:27.280
Some of them based on block they but also they feature especially at Cs ed week,

773
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.320
other coding activities.
Hopefully I gave some sense.
You

774
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:37.540
all right.
Thanks a lot for being here.
Um,
my previous job before I was here,

775
00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:41.220
it was as a k 12 math and coding teacher.
And I use scratch in the classroom.

776
00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:43.620
But this was right around with 2.0 came out before you had a lot of the

777
00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:46.930
classroom management tools that I think you've had in the past few years.
I,

778
00:44:46.931 --> 00:44:47.521
and I'm just curious,

779
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:50.850
a scratch moves into a lot of classrooms as you noted with cs for all other

780
00:44:50.851 --> 00:44:52.320
programs.
I'm curious how you feel about,

781
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:54.870
like you mentioned the projects on the one hand and sort of the flashcards and

782
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:55.800
the drilling on the other hand,

783
00:44:55.801 --> 00:44:58.950
like how do you feel about scratch being sort of molded to fit into like a

784
00:44:58.951 --> 00:45:01.800
mandatory classroom environment where people are interested in,
you know,

785
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:04.890
defined learning metrics,
seeing progress assessments and things like that.

786
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.240
But it's a good question.

787
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:09.510
Then I do think we want to make sure that scratch moves into schools,

788
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:10.531
that what we,

789
00:45:10.531 --> 00:45:13.850
what we love most about scratch doesn't get squeezed out of it and I think there

790
00:45:13.851 --> 00:45:15.120
are ways of doing that,

791
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:19.650
but so I think we're constantly working on and work with educators to feel what

792
00:45:19.651 --> 00:45:23.670
are the best ways of introducing scratch into classrooms and maintaining the

793
00:45:23.671 --> 00:45:24.630
spirit of scratch.

794
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.460
One of my former students who's now a professor at Harvard Graduate School of

795
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.710
Education Power and Brennan has done a great job of this cheese,

796
00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:36.030
made a curriculum called the creative computing curriculum guide that's based on

797
00:45:36.031 --> 00:45:37.860
scratch,
but it's very new.

798
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.740
It's shown how to make use of it in classroom settings.

799
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:45.210
So that's one example of how the of trying to take the scratch programming

800
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:48.630
language but introduced in a way that we say say it's true the values but still

801
00:45:48.631 --> 00:45:51.510
is aligned with the needs of classrooms.

802
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.970
So there are many others work on that as well.

803
00:45:53.971 --> 00:45:57.300
So I think scratch and other languages are getting introduced to many different

804
00:45:57.301 --> 00:45:58.350
ways.
Uh,

805
00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:02.070
our hope is is to try to make sure that it gets out to the world in a way that

806
00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:05.160
stays true to those values.
But there are tensions there.

807
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.880
I think some of the tensions come up outpost to things that we care about most.

808
00:46:08.881 --> 00:46:11.700
I talked earlier about the importance of helping kids learn to think,

809
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:12.534
create a flight.

810
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:16.890
It's not easy to get a quantitative measure of how you've advanced in your

811
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:21.270
creative thinking is much easier to get quantitative measure of.

812
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.620
How often do you use a conditional statements so you can look as long as

813
00:46:25.621 --> 00:46:28.800
projects and see they're using conditionals more and grade them based on that.

814
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:29.820
Uh,

815
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.600
we hope that that's not the way kids ends up being evaluated cause that'll sort

816
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:35.970
of distort we think and what it's going to be most important.

817
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.760
There'll be learning something that way.
It's not stated.

818
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:38.910
There is no value in that,

819
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.990
but I think we want to make sure that kids continue to have this learning,

820
00:46:42.991 --> 00:46:45.180
not just the core computational concepts,

821
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.480
but also design strategies and creative ways of thinking.

822
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:52.950
So we constantly working with educators trying to feel the best way of doing

823
00:46:52.951 --> 00:46:55.500
that.
It's an ongoing process.
I think it would continue.

824
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:56.910
A lot of people are continuing to work on it.

825
00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.990
<v 6>I have a question about the design of the scratch language.
Um,</v>

826
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.000
I think in a lot of other languages,
uh,

827
00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:06.520
some of those complicated things that you were talking about,

828
00:47:06.521 --> 00:47:11.521
like playing audio might be part of like an Sdk or a standard library or

829
00:47:12.071 --> 00:47:14.980
something,
whereas a in scratch,
maybe it's,

830
00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.580
those are more like keywords or blocks that are built into the language.

831
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:21.250
So I was just wondering what you thought about that.
Yeah,

832
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.020
<v 2>well,
we wanted like where as you started scratch,
we want to have a relatively,</v>

833
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:29.040
we're going to take it easy for everyone to have sort of this consistent

834
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:32.010
collection that was going to be used.
Uh,

835
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.190
and we were that there are too many different,
you know,

836
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.360
we too many different things.
You have to go and search for different things.

837
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.490
It was going to make them more challenging,
propelled to get started.

838
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:42.280
So we tried to figure out what were the core things we've thought was most

839
00:47:42.281 --> 00:47:45.430
important and there's a hundred or so core blocks and scratch.

840
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:49.150
And we tried to think what are the things are gonna be most important for the

841
00:47:49.151 --> 00:47:53.000
way kids want to express themselves?
Before we started scratch,
uh,

842
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:54.400
Tommy had mentioned,
we worked,

843
00:47:54.401 --> 00:47:58.270
we had developed this network of afterschool centers called computer club houses

844
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.280
for young people in low income communities.

845
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.560
And we saw the kids at these clubhouses,

846
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.600
they wanted to create their own interactive stories and games and they loved

847
00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:07.720
manipulating media,

848
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:10.750
but there weren't good tools to let them create their interactive stories and

849
00:48:10.751 --> 00:48:12.940
games.
So we definitely had them in mind.

850
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.600
So we want to make sure they were the right primitive building blocks to let you

851
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:20.410
manipulate sound music,
images,
you know,
photos,

852
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.440
make it easy to bring in your own.
Also to personalize that,

853
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.920
to bring in your own voice,
to bring in your own songs,
bring your own images.

854
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.970
So we put a priority on that to making our core set of things.

855
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:33.550
And we found you could go pretty far with that.

856
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.050
As you can see now we are having these extension.

857
00:48:36.051 --> 00:48:39.550
So we're trying to see how we can keep it that core set but still make it

858
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:44.070
possible to extend in different ways.
There's still challenges that were,

859
00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.400
can we ought to think about,
um,
by having an online community.

860
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.620
That's one reason we want to keep it consistent.

861
00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:53.410
So if you saw us on the online community,
it was clear that,

862
00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.940
that you had all the tools to make it.
So now if you see something,

863
00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.510
the online community that's using the micro bit you and have our microbead,

864
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.900
what does that mean as it confusing?

865
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.620
So we're trying to figure how to keep the community,
uh,

866
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.780
done in a way that you could filter out things that aren't relevant for you.

867
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.330
So those are still things that we're trying to work through.

868
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:14.200
<v 4>Uh,</v>

869
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:19.200
<v 7>you mentioned that you've worked a little bit with Lego and scratch and I was</v>

870
00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:22.630
wondering if you'll,

871
00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:28.080
you guys were working on kind of bringing a scratch to Mindstorms and Yo,

872
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:36.360
if you've thought about the differences between Lego's approach to programming

873
00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:42.600
environment where it's all image based and you have blocks that are just,
um,

874
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:47.910
pictures and your approach where you have blocks that have words on them and are

875
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:50.770
like that.
Yeah.

876
00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:53.930
<v 2>And there's also some other differences in the,
the mice,</v>

877
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:57.740
the program lags that comes with mind storms,
uh,
Elsa use it,

878
00:49:57.741 --> 00:49:59.870
some different just programming paradigms as well.

879
00:49:59.871 --> 00:50:02.330
It's not just the visual of the icons versus words.

880
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:05.750
It sort of grew out of a data flow tradition rather than the control flow

881
00:50:05.751 --> 00:50:09.560
tradition.
So there's some differences in some of the ways that the languages are

882
00:50:09.561 --> 00:50:13.240
structured.
We do,
we continue to work closely with Lego.

883
00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:16.580
A lego is work on a next generation of Mindstorms.

884
00:50:16.581 --> 00:50:20.960
We're working closely with them and trying to no influence with some of the ways

885
00:50:20.961 --> 00:50:22.310
that they'll be doing this in the future.

886
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:25.340
Obviously we are deeply committed to the scratch approach.

887
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:30.620
I do see that we're to the scratch approach of the basic grammar,

888
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:36.010
but for scratch junior we do use icons rather than words and we think in some

889
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:41.320
situations partly based on age and party on other factors we think someone is

890
00:50:41.321 --> 00:50:44.960
using the icons can be fine if people haven't seen on scratch junior we use

891
00:50:44.961 --> 00:50:46.640
icons and use it horizontal.

892
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:50.000
You snapped box together horizontally as opposed to vertically,

893
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.790
but when you use the icons of makes more sense doing it that way.

894
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
So we do see a place for both word based text based on the blocks and icons on

895
00:50:58.671 --> 00:51:01.400
the blocks based on different situations.

896
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:06.020
So we're working together in fact on scratch 3.0 we're building on the same

897
00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:06.651
infrastructure.

898
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:09.980
It'll be easier to switch back and forth between them and we think there's a

899
00:51:09.981 --> 00:51:13.220
role for both based on what age you're aiming for,
the type of applications.

900
00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:16.050
<v 7>Can I just follow up?</v>

901
00:51:16.051 --> 00:51:21.051
Do you have an idea of kind of what that age a switchover is between,

902
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.830
<v 2>well,
what we chose for like scratch junior,</v>

903
00:51:24.831 --> 00:51:27.530
we'd say five to seven scratches eight and up.

904
00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.600
But it's not that they're hard boundaries.

905
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:33.260
We're also still exploring I think on different devices as we do more things

906
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:37.670
with coding on a mobile phones,
we think there might be some bands,

907
00:51:37.671 --> 00:51:39.530
if you're doing small programs on phones,

908
00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:43.430
there might be some advantages for all ages.
Starting with icon based blocks.

909
00:51:43.431 --> 00:51:46.670
We just doing small programs,
if you're doing longer programs,

910
00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.530
going to text makes more sense.

911
00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.650
So I think we're still exploring some of the ways to go between them.

912
00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:54.140
It's not just age based.
Thank you very much,

913
00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:01.580
Mitchell,
you're,
yeah,
I'm happy to.

914
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.460
We could just maybe call it then,

915
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:06.110
but I'm happy to stay around people just come up and talk informally and maybe

916
00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:06.944
that makes sense.

917
00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:14.120
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
