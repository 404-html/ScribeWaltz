00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.010
Please help me welcome David.
He won't

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.150
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.090
<v 0>Hello everybody.
I am David.
He Walt.</v>

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.250
I'm a tech journalist and author of a couple of bucks.

5
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.650
It's good to be back here at Google again.

6
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:22.720
I was here a couple of years ago for my first book,

7
00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:26.800
which was about Dungeons and dragons.
And now I'm writing about virtual reality.

8
00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:31.240
So I am a giant nerd.
I'm one of you.
Um,
I'm so,

9
00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.500
I'm excited to be back here,

10
00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:37.180
but frankly I'm a little worried because I've just written a book that's a

11
00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:40.900
history of virtual reality and talking about like where this new generation of

12
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:45.010
products came from and here I am at Google.

13
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.040
So I kind of feel like lecturing Googlers about VR would be like going to like

14
00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:53.350
Le Cordon Bleu and lecturing them about how to make an Omelette.

15
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.390
I'm not super comfortable about that.

16
00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:57.630
So there's a couple of different things I want to talk about.
Um,

17
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.700
when I give talks at other venues,
I usually give very sort of,

18
00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:04.540
I started out very elementary.
It's a sort of like what is virtual reality?

19
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.060
I know you guys know what is virtual reality.

20
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.460
So here I'm going to skip some of the basics.

21
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.670
I want to instead focus on supplying some context about talking about the bigger

22
00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:19.801
picture of where virtual reality came from and that leads into some reasons why

23
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:24.790
virtual reality is important,
not just to businesses but to humanity as a whole.

24
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.660
Um,

25
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.660
so we'll start that with a brief and highly abridged history of virtual worlds.

26
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.000
Um,
I take history pretty seriously.

27
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.030
So when I talk about history,

28
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:40.740
I'm really looking at them going way far back.
Um,

29
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.900
this is about 17,000 years back.
Um,

30
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.940
humans have been trying to create virtual realities for a very long time.
Uh,

31
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.790
basically for as long as we've had technology,

32
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.440
we've been trying to use that technology to escape the real world and enter

33
00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:59.710
fantasy worlds.
This is Lascaux cave.

34
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.480
This is from a subterranean complex in the southwestern part of France.

35
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.430
And in these caves,

36
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:11.431
some of the first modern humans in Europe decorated these caverns with hundreds

37
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:15.490
of pictures of animals and symbols and abstract shapes.

38
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.820
And from here,
and just looking at it as a,
as a photograph,

39
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.700
it looks like just scribblings on the wall.

40
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.520
But when you stand inside these caves,

41
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.700
it becomes clear that these creators were actually creating a virtual world.

42
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.690
Think of it this way,
just like when you put on a virtual reality headset,

43
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.800
part of the reason why you have that headset is because it's blocking out the

44
00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:41.920
world around you.
It's closing off this lecture room.

45
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.860
It's that you're only paying attention to the screen in front of you.

46
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.600
That's what these caves did.

47
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.070
You would go down into these caves from the valley above and you're no longer in

48
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:54.580
the woods.
You're no longer in this,
in this beautiful part of France,

49
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.930
in this specific space where they have painted this stuff.

50
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.910
The walls created this imagery around you and the idea was that the caves

51
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.310
themselves are the immersive environment.

52
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.730
These animals would surround you there in your face and the artists use all

53
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.280
kinds of prospective tricks to actually make them seem alive.

54
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.140
So instead of just being,
this is just kind of a profile of a,

55
00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:22.030
of a bowl or have an aurochs.
Some of the pictures,

56
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.270
the head of the bowl would be turned towards the viewer.

57
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.490
Other ones like you can see him if cave entrance.

58
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:32.260
Some of the paintings actually have the both start on one wall and turn the

59
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:35.470
corner.
So it seems like the animal is actually moving.

60
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.080
And so they used all these tricks to make the scene come a lot.

61
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.540
The author and the technologist Howard Rheingold calls this subterranean

62
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.320
cyberspace and I think that's pretty accurate because what the people who

63
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:55.321
created this we're probably trying to do was to imprint information onto the

64
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:59.650
minds of the people viewing it.
The idea being that like,
okay,

65
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:04.180
we need to teach young people what it's like to go on the hunt to be surrounded

66
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:05.440
by these deadly animals.

67
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.620
So you could take them down in the caves and show them like this is what it

68
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:10.300
looks like.
These are where the animals are.

69
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.420
Or maybe it had some sort of religious function or something like that.

70
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.660
But the idea always being this is the experience.

71
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:19.990
This is what it's like to be surrounded by these animals.

72
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.390
So eventually the caveman left their caves.

73
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.130
So this is sort of the next step of Lascaux cave is when we look at things like

74
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:32.110
this.
Um,
this is,
um,
the great theater of Ephesus in Turkey.

75
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.623
Um,

76
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.640
this was constructed around 2100 years ago and the word theater in ancient Greek

77
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.130
actually kind of translates to viewer.

78
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.320
So this was an ancient VR viewer.
The idea here was not just,
Oh,

79
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.060
this is a platform for a play.

80
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.040
The idea was that they were using the most cutting edge technology available to

81
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:58.480
them at the time to immerse people in whatever play,

82
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:00.670
whatever presentation they were doing on that stage.

83
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.130
They have the semicircular amphitheater.

84
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.490
That was because that shape amplifies sound waves.

85
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.450
So you could have one little guy now on stage and all the thousands of people in

86
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:11.710
the seats could hear what he was saying.

87
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.650
They used mechanical devices that a thing called a Mecca [inaudible],

88
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.480
which looks sort of like a Trevis Shay.

89
00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:23.481
It had like levers and wires and stuff and the McCain would lift actors up into

90
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:25.420
the air and make it look like they were flying.

91
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.110
If you ever heard of the expression,
the dues ex Machina,

92
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.140
that's actually where that comes from.
The machine is the mecking.

93
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.590
They used elaborate props and costumes and settings and and and backdrops in

94
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:42.040
front of the play with the whole idea being,

95
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.600
we're going to create this immersive environment and the people in the audience

96
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.200
aren't just going to think that they're watching some people on a stage.

97
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.620
They're going to think they're here in this fantasy world.

98
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.073
So these audiences,

99
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.600
these performances really audiences into a simulated environment.

100
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.520
Another way to do that is with art.

101
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.900
This was a 10th century painting on 11 foot wide scroll.

102
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.090
It's called the night revels of hand.
She's die and according to legend,

103
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:16.091
this is a record of an actual night in the life of a bureaucrat and he was

104
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.110
legendary legendarily just like Debachi's bus.

105
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.970
He was collecting taxes or whatever,

106
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:26.660
just spending on parties and on women and music and whatever.

107
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.330
And the emperor started to get upset about this.
He was like,

108
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.900
I want to know what that guy's doing.
So he commissioned this painting.

109
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.950
He sent a painter to one of these parties and said,

110
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.260
create this long scroll,
show me exactly what this scumbag is up to.

111
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.490
So it's a 10 sensor equivalent of like setting up Paparazzi to a party or

112
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:47.810
something.
It was really about like,

113
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.480
I want this thing so I can surround myself with it.

114
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:54.140
I can be immersed and really see what's happening at these madcap parties.

115
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.170
Other artists took that idea even further.

116
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.610
So this is,
uh,
a panorama.

117
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.050
This was created by a artists,
Robert Baker,

118
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.990
who was an Irishman.
He created this and around 1801,

119
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.740
and you can see that this is just a massive payment.
He did these things,

120
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.360
three stories tall and what he would do is create these giant landscapes and

121
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:21.950
build a custom building and wrap the landscape around the walls of the building.

122
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.210
So people would enter and stand in the middle and it would feel like they're on

123
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.960
the coast of Scotland or they're in the middle of London or something like that.

124
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.890
Um,
he patented technique as the Panorama.

125
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.900
They built these things all over Scotland and London and even a couple,

126
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.370
uh,
in other countries around the world,
uh,

127
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.980
there were immensely popular tourist attractions,
uh,

128
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.180
because they were so immersive at the time when newspapers wrote about these

129
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:54.170
immersive paintings,
some of them actually said,
this is an alternative.

130
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:59.030
The travel,
we don't ever need to go anywhere again because we can do this.

131
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:01.250
You can see what it's like out there in the,
in the real world.

132
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.450
And it's funny to read those old newspaper stories because they read a lot.

133
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:08.600
Like some of the newspaper stories I've seen in the last couple of years about

134
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:09.350
Vr,

135
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.340
especially if you look at like the press releases released by like hotel chains

136
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:15.860
that have done VR apps and stuff like that.
They're like,
oh,

137
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:18.050
come see what our hotel is like and stuff like that.

138
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.710
You can experience the world just like you,
you could,
if you're actually there,

139
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.230
obviously it's not as good as the real thing,

140
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.890
but for the time this was really immersive.
This was virtual reality for them.

141
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.960
The next way to create a virtual realities was by transporting audiences and to

142
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:37.850
immersing them into their subject matter using optics,

143
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.770
not art.
The first real generation of VR manufacturers were opticians.

144
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:43.670
They were not artists,

145
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.620
and that was because of a particular phenomenon that makes VR possible.
Uh,

146
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.251
take a second,

147
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:54.020
everybody close your left eye and look at me through your right eye and then

148
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:57.600
close your right eye and look at me left and go back and forth like this.
Now,

149
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:00.630
one reason I do that is because it's really funny to me to see a whole bunch of

150
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:01.590
people do that at once.

151
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.270
But what you're seeing there is everything sort of shifts from one eye to the

152
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:08.790
other.
Um,
that's called parallax.

153
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:10.950
It's because your eyes are slightly spaced apart,

154
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.530
so they each have a slightly different view of the world.

155
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.090
Your brain takes that information.
It knows,
okay,
left,
I saw this here,
right?

156
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:19.020
I saw this here.

157
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:24.170
And it uses that data to calculate depth and distance based on just the triangle

158
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:27.690
eye to eye,
to whatever you're there.
Your brain does the math for you.

159
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.700
So these opticians realized that parallax would use them,

160
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.820
would allow them to take images and simulate that.

161
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.410
I'm using a visual cue called stereopsis.
Uh,

162
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:44.490
that's one of the foundations of simulated depth that we use in all virtual

163
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:49.200
reality today is this idea of stereopsis as two separate images.
Um,
uh,

164
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:50.970
very smart English scientist,

165
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:54.930
a guy named Sir Charles Wheatstone was the first person to identify this

166
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:55.501
phenomenon.

167
00:09:55.501 --> 00:10:00.330
1838 and shortly I die after he identified and he created something called a

168
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:04.830
stereoscope,
which this point it was piece of wood,

169
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.200
two mirrors on a 45 degree angle and two pictures on either end.

170
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.920
So basically the idea was you stick your face right in front of these two

171
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:16.830
mirrors.
One reflects the image over here,

172
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:18.420
the other one reflects the image over here.

173
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.520
And if there were slightly different images,

174
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.290
there's eyes would see them both at once and create that false sense of,

175
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.630
of stereovision.
Um,

176
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.670
the idea of this caught on very quickly.

177
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.730
A Wheatstone was an academic,
so he didn't commercialize it.

178
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.240
But soon after other people were like,
hey,
we could make money with this.

179
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:40.560
People would want to do this at home.

180
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.790
It was a guy named Brewster who in 1948 replaced the Awkward Mirror with two

181
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:49.110
prisms and because there were prisoners,

182
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.210
he could just put the pictures in front of your face.

183
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.550
The prisons also amplify the image.

184
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.830
If you could have much more detailed pictures.

185
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.130
So now you've got something that looks like a pair of binoculars.

186
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.870
You can just hold it up to your face,

187
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:05.730
each eyes seeing a slightly different image and you get this view of the entire

188
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:09.030
world is being a big,
beautiful three dimensional image.

189
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.600
A Brewster stereoscope made its debut in 1851 at the world's very first world's

190
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:18.990
fair and Queen Victoria was one of the first people to try it there.

191
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.290
And because she was the queen and she approved of it,

192
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.240
it became incredibly fashionable.
Um,
it was one of the biggest fads of that era.

193
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:27.990
Uh,

194
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.990
over 250,000 of those little cards with the pictures of them were sold in just

195
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.020
three months after that first exhibition.
Like,

196
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:40.620
it's hard for us to imagine now just how much this thing instantly blew up.

197
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.400
People all over Europe,
we're buying these little Brewster stereoscopes,

198
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:45.480
these little binoculars,

199
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.890
and they became so fashionable that it became like a luxury item saying to show

200
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:50.724
off.

201
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.120
Rich Victorians would buy Mahogany Stereo Mahogany stereoscopes are big boxes

202
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:59.770
inlaid with jewels and marble and stuff.

203
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:03.580
And this was like the beautiful thing that you would have in your parlor in

204
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:04.301
Victorian era.

205
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:07.030
And people would come over and they would see these pictures and they would

206
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:11.470
enjoy it.
So that's great for the Victorians.

207
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.810
But meanwhile,
here in the United States,
we were all about the quality,
right,

208
00:12:16.811 --> 00:12:20.950
and about the proletarian populism.
So here in the United States,

209
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.300
a writer and a poet and a physician,

210
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.130
a guy by the name of Oliver Wendell Holmes,
Sr said,
well,

211
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:32.680
this device is great,
but it's for rich people.

212
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.770
I'm going to make the American version.
I'm gonna make one for the people.

213
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.480
So he made it even simpler.
He took away the whole box,
just had a stick.

214
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:44.950
Basically on the end of the stick there would be the two images that would be

215
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:49.900
combined into one stereo graphic image and too little lenses.
It's portable,

216
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:55.150
which cheap,
it was easy to construct.
It was a stereoscope for anybody.

217
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.300
Now Holmes was a visionary a lot of ways on one hand,

218
00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:59.380
because he created this thing,

219
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:02.740
but also because he said this could be a profitable thing.

220
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:06.200
People would want to build this.
I don't want money,
I don't want to see,

221
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.220
I want to share this with the world.
So we open sourced it.

222
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.270
He took this design and just gave it away and said,

223
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.300
I have designed this stereoscope anybody who wants to can take my design and

224
00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:19.990
produce it and sell it.

225
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.320
And thousands of entrepreneurs across the United States did.

226
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:29.010
So the home stereo type or home stereoscope quickly became one of the most

227
00:13:29.681 --> 00:13:33.520
popular entertainment devices across the United States and eventually,

228
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.110
like within 10 or 20 years,

229
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.260
stereoscopes and American homes were like TV's in the 1980s everybody had a

230
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:44.860
stereoscope in the house if not two or three.

231
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.260
So stereoscopes we're a big business,

232
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.650
but the problem with stereoscopes is they were static and they only worked for

233
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:55.120
one person.
Okay?

234
00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:00.010
Because it had to be in front of your eyes and one person had to be getting that

235
00:14:00.011 --> 00:14:01.240
stereoscopic effect.

236
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.260
It wasn't like something you could put up on the wall and have a whole audience

237
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.170
yet because all of you have a different angle on this image,

238
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.870
so the stereopsis would work differently for every person.

239
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.880
The answer to that was a sort of flipped the whole idea on its head.

240
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.720
Instead of using two images and causing and with through the use of prisms are

241
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:27.730
mirrors of thing to merge those two images so you see them on top of each other.

242
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.240
This idea was let's just print the two images on top of each other to start in

243
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:38.701
different colors and then we can use colored filters so that each eye only sees

244
00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:42.100
the one we want.

245
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.130
Now you're all probably familiar with this because you've seen the classic like

246
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:48.550
Three d movie goggles,
one green,
one blue.
That's exactly what this is.

247
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:53.551
And a graph and a glyphic 3-d is simply to images and different colors filtered

248
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.890
so that each,
I sees the right one creating stereopsis.

249
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.850
The benefit of this now is,
as you can see,

250
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:04.190
I can project one of these images on a wall.

251
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.330
Doesn't matter where you're sitting in this room.
If you have these glasses,

252
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.510
you can look at this and you see this image in three days

253
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:21.110
that led to this.
We've got static at Three d images now that we can put up.

254
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.510
We can put that in a stereoscope where we could put it on a wall.

255
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.170
This is perfect for theaters.
This was uh,

256
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.720
uh,
two projectors,
top and bottom,

257
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.030
and each one had a separate filter in it.
One red,
one green,
green,

258
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.050
and they would paint images onto glass slides.

259
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.900
This was called the magic lantern.

260
00:15:45.901 --> 00:15:48.990
And they would go into a theater and set this up and you could turn on and

261
00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:53.190
passed it across the room or projected image and people would wear the glasses

262
00:15:53.191 --> 00:15:56.040
or hold up a little piece of,
of,
of colored paper to their face.

263
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.460
And it would allow them to see these bright,

264
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.920
vivid three dimensional images in our theater.
Of course,

265
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:07.190
they didn't move.
So this is what came next.

266
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.370
This is a cinema cinema octo graph.

267
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.430
This was created by Louis Lumiere,

268
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.410
who you may know as the father,
basically of the motion picture industry.

269
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.110
What he did was develop pictures.

270
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:24.020
Instead of having those images painted on the glass slides,

271
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.730
there were printed on on silos and he would make rolls of,
I'm gonna expose them.

272
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.420
And then the same concept,
you would have a light behind the lens,

273
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:37.810
but then crank through the images and they would display moving images.

274
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.290
Those same Anik glyphic colored images on a wall and went the glasses.

275
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:47.180
Now you've got three d movies.
I mean,
those caught on like crazy.

276
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.890
The first three d images were pretty 30 movies and stuff were pretty boring.

277
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.150
Um,
movies were very simple.
I'm very static.

278
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.500
But movies like this,

279
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.040
this was at the end of a movie called the great train robbery.

280
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.350
The outlaw just turns and shoots at the crowd.

281
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:08.240
People lost their minds when they saw this because they thought they were being

282
00:17:08.241 --> 00:17:12.630
shot at like people screamed,
they ducked under their seats.
Uh,

283
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.970
there's another famous story of another lumiere film called the arrival of the

284
00:17:16.971 --> 00:17:18.350
train of Lasagna toe,

285
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:23.390
which is literally just like a 32nd clip of a train pulling into a station.

286
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.390
But the camera is set so the train is pulling towards you.

287
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.460
And as that train came in,

288
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.120
people got up and bolted out of the theater because it looked like the train was

289
00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:36.950
going to rip its way out of the screen.
Now that seems silly twist now,

290
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:39.920
but that was the level of immersion of the time.
Like people,

291
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:44.690
I've never seen that before and they were immersed into these films.

292
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.100
It was real to them.

293
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.470
The next sort of step course was to do the analytics and the moving pictures.

294
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.060
This is from a uh,
1930s film called Audio Ska picks.

295
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.030
This is created by Metro Goldwyn Meyer and it really,

296
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:04.710
it reminds me a lot of the very first like demos,
if you get like a,

297
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.310
an oculus rift or a vibe or anything else.

298
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:11.190
And like they have like the first experience that you're going to just sort of

299
00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:13.650
show off virtual reality.
That's what this is.

300
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:17.970
But they ran this in movie theaters and it's literally just a series of clips of

301
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:22.380
people like pushing things towards the camera.
Like you're just this dog.
Or like,

302
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:26.010
oh look out.
There's a,
there's a uh,
a ladder coming towards your face.

303
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:31.500
Things exploding,
things popping out.
It's silly.
It's like 10 minutes long.

304
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.160
It's a bunch of dumb clips.
It was a huge hit.

305
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.100
This was nominated for an academy award

306
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.450
because this was the first time in human history.

307
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.170
People had really sat in a theater and felt immerse.

308
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:48.780
Things are actually coming towards them.
It was crazy.

309
00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.490
So three d films kind of turned out to be a little bit of a fat at first because

310
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.170
they were very limited,

311
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:03.290
but they came back big in the 50s when filmmaker started actually using some

312
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.820
art.
And to tell stories,

313
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.030
you've probably seen this picture is the famous life magazine cover.

314
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.410
This is from the premiere of a movie called Bwana Devil Blonde.

315
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:18.460
A devil was based on the true story of guys building a train across Kenya and

316
00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:22.440
these lions kept attacking all the train people and killing them.
So,

317
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:26.850
but these were actual movies with plot and not,
they had plot.

318
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.020
The 3d was so much more compelling because it wasn't just throwing stuff out

319
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.480
your face.
It was like,
oh,
I have a reason to be afraid of this lion,

320
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.430
which then jumps out your face.

321
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:40.830
So 3d for a period in the 50s was really huge.
It was the big thing.

322
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.580
Then it started to Peter out because of television.

323
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.950
Everybody started to have a TV in their home.
People are like,
Eh,

324
00:19:49.951 --> 00:19:52.500
I'd rather stay here.
I don't want to go out.

325
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:57.000
Like this picture is tiny and black and white,
but we don't have to go anywhere.

326
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.210
So the film industry started thinking about,

327
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:02.670
well how do we get people to come back into these theaters?

328
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.050
This was one of the attempts.
This is Cinerama.

329
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.080
This is a giant custom screen.

330
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:15.600
The idea was this screen was so large and it curved around the audience,

331
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.990
it was actually filling your entire field of view.

332
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.330
So it's the same theory with a Vr headset.

333
00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:24.360
The reason why you have that screen right up close to your eyes is because you

334
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:27.570
want the biggest field of view possible.
You don't want gaps.

335
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:29.310
You don't want to an outline because that's the,

336
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.090
when you start realizing that you're not where you thought you were,

337
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.680
this was supposed to fill your entire field of view.
But as you can see,

338
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.580
this is extremely complicated.
It required three projectors,

339
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.640
which also meant that to make these movies,

340
00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:47.860
they had to have three different cameras recording each at each time.

341
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.290
Everything had to be synced up electronically,

342
00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:54.820
both during recording and playback was incredibly complicated and incredibly

343
00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:55.654
expensive.

344
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.960
So they only ended up installing this and a handful of theaters across the

345
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:02.860
United States,
they made less than a dozen Cimarron,
Cimarron,
a movies.

346
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.990
People love them when they saw them,

347
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.650
but it was just not feasible as a commercial technology.

348
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.790
It was however inspirational to certain people.

349
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.290
This is the creation of a guy named Morton Heilig.

350
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.300
Morton Heilig was a cinematographer who wanted to do something bigger and

351
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:26.470
better.
He had seen Cinerama and been impressed and was like,
wow,

352
00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:30.970
I like this idea of immersive film,
but the promise with Cinerama is,
well,

353
00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:34.270
number one,
even though it feels my field of the field of view,

354
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.640
if I turn around and look at the back of the theater,

355
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:41.641
I still realize that my theater and even that it's an a Cinerama is only audio

356
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:46.630
and visual.
It doesn't engage my other senses.

357
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:52.020
I don't think I'm in the Kenyan planes when I'm watching that movie because it

358
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:57.190
doesn't smell like the Kenyan planes.
If I'm running from it from a lion,

359
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.890
I don't feel like the running of adult here.

360
00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:02.080
It's just I don't get all my senses involved.

361
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.740
So the first thing that highlight did was he built a headset he took to cathode

362
00:22:09.011 --> 00:22:14.011
ray tube TVs and basically just prank them onto a headset in front of people's

363
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:15.574
heads.

364
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.590
Each one showing a different image through some lenses and was like,

365
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:25.360
maybe I can show movies to people this way.
It was really unwieldy,

366
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.660
didn't work very well.
I never really got it past the prototype stage,

367
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.730
but it's still to this day,
people cite that.
It's like,

368
00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:33.880
well that's the first VR headset.
In a sense.

369
00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:38.200
He made the first heads up display.
This was a second attempt.

370
00:22:38.201 --> 00:22:40.870
This was something called Sensorama.
And as you can see,

371
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:43.150
it was kind of like a ride.
He would sit down in it.

372
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.800
Inside that hood was a wraparound screen.
So every way you turn your head,

373
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:52.510
you saw the image going.
It also had vibration controls.
So for instance,

374
00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:56.260
one of the experiences you could watch with a guy driving a motorcycle,

375
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.380
and as you drove in the motorcycle like sheep,

376
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:03.250
they would shake and match up the movements it had,
uh,
in front of your face.

377
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.190
A little grill that would blow out smells.

378
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.300
So one of the little experiences,
and here was a belly dancer.

379
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.670
And as she would belly dance towards you,

380
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.650
it blew the smell of cheap perfume in your face.
But this was silly,

381
00:23:17.651 --> 00:23:19.270
but it was getting more and more immersive.

382
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:21.640
Like now you're really felt like you were there.
You could see it,

383
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:26.290
you could feel it,
you could smell it,
you could hear it.
Problem was,
again,

384
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:32.250
vision was more advanced then technology and the market.

385
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.940
Uh,
this thing was expensive to produce.
It broke super easily.

386
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.700
And when it's marketed,
like the idea for this was,

387
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:42.640
let's put it in amusement parks.
Let's put it in theaters.

388
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.910
Let's put it on Coney island.
They literally put one in Times Square.

389
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.940
What happens to something left in Times Square?

390
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.370
That's what happened to this thing.
It was constantly broken,
was vandalized.

391
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:57.680
People cracked it open and get the quarters out.

392
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.400
So like it was just not a viable business and it kind of went nowhere.

393
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.333
Meanwhile,

394
00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.990
it wasn't just entertainers trying to build virtual reality.

395
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.140
This is an academic.
Um,

396
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:17.120
the idea here is this was a heads up display.
It's hard to see in this picture,

397
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:19.670
but this has to very small,
uh,

398
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.800
cathode ray tubes right in front of your face.
Um,

399
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.670
this academic is a guy named Ivan Sutherland.

400
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.900
He would be famous in the story and need to appear in the story of Vr,

401
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.820
even if this device never happened.

402
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.240
Because Ivan Sutherland invented something called sketchpad,

403
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.900
which was the very first computer graphics software.

404
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:43.730
He was the first guy to make a piece of software that allowed you to draw using

405
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:47.360
the help of a computer,
geometric shapes and stuff like that.
So that was,

406
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:51.830
you know,
the Adam and eve of every computer aided design tool.

407
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:55.160
Every graphics program you've ever used,
sketchpads started with it.

408
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.780
So once he had sketchpad,
once he had a way to draw these virtual things,

409
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.740
he's like,
well,
how can I present that in a better display?

410
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.770
He wrote an essay actually called the ultimate display,

411
00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:10.610
where he described where we're moving with this technology is at some point

412
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:11.810
we'll get to a display.

413
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.730
The computers can draw a world so real and so convincing that it will be

414
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:20.030
completely indistinguishable from reality.
Now,

415
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:22.130
it took a long while to get there and we're still not there.

416
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:23.990
But that was what he was trying to attempt here.

417
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.040
So we had these two a CRT displays in front of your eyes.

418
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.080
They were actually transparent.

419
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.100
So his program would draw geometric images,

420
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.770
triangles,
cubes,
stuff like that.
And because the whole thing was suspended,

421
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.990
you could move your head and the triangles and squares and stuff would appear in

422
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:45.890
the real world.

423
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:51.590
Very much like the augmented reality headsets that we'd see in the 21st century

424
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.700
because this thing was so big and unwieldy,
he gave it the nickname,

425
00:25:55.701 --> 00:25:56.900
the sword of Damocles,

426
00:25:56.901 --> 00:25:59.420
cause he always felt like it was just dangling over his head and was going to

427
00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:03.400
fall on just killing one day.
But this was a really important,
uh,

428
00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:06.680
a piece of hardware that got people thinking about,
Oh yeah,
I guess,
you know,

429
00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:11.180
we can use computers now to create these simulated environments.

430
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.273
<v 2>Okay.</v>

431
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.540
<v 0>The other group that was really paying a lot of attention to this was the u s</v>

432
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:17.374
military.

433
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:23.550
They reasoned that virtual reality could be used to help them control the

434
00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:27.810
massive amounts of information that come,
come through into,

435
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.180
in warfare and running a plane.
For instance.
Um,

436
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:36.210
this is something created by an engineer named Tom Sutherland who was working,

437
00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:36.820
uh,

438
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:41.820
with the air force on a program to allow pilots to deal with everything in their

439
00:26:43.321 --> 00:26:47.160
cockpit before he started on this,
a co pilot was saying to him,

440
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.660
there's so much stuff I have to deal with.
They've got all my flight controls,

441
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.230
I've got all the radar data,
but if I'm going into combat,

442
00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:58.170
I also have all the information about my weapons.

443
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.900
I've got maps of where I'm supposed to drop bombs.

444
00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:04.530
Like it was just too much information to deal with.
And he asked this pilot,
okay,

445
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:07.710
draw me a picture of like the ideal cockpit,

446
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.080
the perfect cockpit and how you would control everything.

447
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.910
And the pilot drew him a picture.

448
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.210
And the surprising thing about it was that the pilot and the picture had six

449
00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:19.050
arms.
Like that was the only way to access and control of this information.

450
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.340
So furnace,
his idea was let's just get rid of all that data.

451
00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.950
Let's put one of these digital displays like Sutherland creative in the sword of

452
00:27:27.951 --> 00:27:30.990
Damocles and put that in front of the pilot space.

453
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.490
And then you can just give him the information he needs at any given time.

454
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.240
The same way with a computer generated rendered images.

455
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.770
If you're flying over target,

456
00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:43.980
this thing would like give you a little dot on the ground.
Like,
okay,

457
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:46.920
this is where your target is,
could give you a little electronic Ralph,

458
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:48.450
you're a few on stuff like that.

459
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.740
They called this the Darth Vader helmet for obvious reasons.
Um,

460
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:57.480
this was one iteration in many of different projects,
but throughout the,

461
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.600
uh,
1980s and into the 90s,

462
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.910
this is what the US military was doing,

463
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:07.890
was trying to find a way to make this idea ever smaller and more comfortable and

464
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:10.590
get more computerized information into that display.

465
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.880
Late eighties and early nineties when technology becomes even more refined,

466
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.930
we now have better screens.
We now have faster computers.

467
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.550
So these are products created by a company called VPL,

468
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:31.110
with created by a guy named Jaron Lanier is actually the guy who coined the

469
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:35.790
phrase virtual reality.
Uh,
he was a very gifted,
still is a very gifted engineer.

470
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.660
And his vision was not just the headset,

471
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.950
but to really immerse people.
In the entire world.
So one of the first things,

472
00:28:43.951 --> 00:28:44.251
in fact,

473
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:47.880
the thing that kind of got him into virtual reality was first he was creating

474
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.620
these,
these gloves,

475
00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:53.250
he's data gloves with the idea of being that he was going to create a way to

476
00:28:53.251 --> 00:28:57.960
control instruments using like virtual gloves.

477
00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.700
So you wouldn't actually need a guitar,

478
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.400
you could just do this and it would register where your fingers were.

479
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.240
And then he realized,
wait,
this could also be a computer input device.

480
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.050
And it's sort of evolved into,
okay,
well if it's going to be an input device,

481
00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.150
we need an interface needed to display.

482
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.460
And VPL developed everything from the goggles,
which were called iPhones,

483
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.770
e y e phones,
but still i-phones um,
they develop these data gloves.

484
00:29:22.771 --> 00:29:26.250
They even had full body suits you could put on so that if you were in one of

485
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.280
these computer generated environments,
you could walk around the computer,

486
00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:30.210
knew where you were.

487
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.490
If you saw a virtual reality movie in the 1990s,

488
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.660
I'm thinking like lawnmower man was one of the really bad but famous ones.

489
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:42.730
Johnny Mnemonic,
another one.
A lot of times,

490
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:45.550
the part where that shows up in his movies are these with VPL hardware,

491
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:47.840
those Bob,
these bodysuits.
Um,

492
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.460
VPL had amazing technology.

493
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:56.350
There was a big boom at the time of all my God virtual reality.
Look at this.

494
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.150
It's real.
It's the future.

495
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.410
Vpl kind of crashed and burned though for a couple of reasons.

496
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.280
Part of which just sort of inexperienced around running a business but also

497
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:09.940
because I think the technology just wasn't ready yet.
This was cool.

498
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.580
But look at those graphics in the background.
This is 1991.

499
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.350
Computer graphics still not Super Great.
Certainly not photo realistic.

500
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.500
And the processing power for the computers involved,
number one,

501
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.510
required massive expenditures stirs you basically needed like a supercomputer to

502
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:31.840
run this thing.
So it was not $1,000 set.
This stop,

503
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:35.110
it was more like $150,000.
Um,

504
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.540
and the experience was just not good enough.

505
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:41.500
And so VR started to get the reputation of,
it's a great idea,

506
00:30:41.501 --> 00:30:45.820
but it doesn't really work.
We put this on,
it makes you sick,

507
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.680
it makes you barf.

508
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.600
And cause that's the recurring problem with virtual reality for these decades is

509
00:30:55.350 --> 00:31:00.350
our bodies have a mechanism where if our eyes or ears or one of our senses is

510
00:31:03.271 --> 00:31:07.680
telling us something that's in disagree more with our other sentences.

511
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.110
For instance,
if I start hallucinating,

512
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.760
my body thinks that I have been poisoned because over millions of years of

513
00:31:17.191 --> 00:31:20.310
evolution that would is what would make your hallucinate.

514
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.000
You ate some mushroom that you found in the forest while you're a forging and

515
00:31:24.001 --> 00:31:28.020
now you're tripping out and your body is like,
Oh God,
I'm poisoned.
I'm dying.

516
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.810
I'm going to throw this up so that I don't die.

517
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:35.640
That's why people get simulation sickness because these simulations are just not

518
00:31:35.641 --> 00:31:39.180
real enough.
Your eyes are seeing one thing,
but your body isn't feeling it.

519
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.800
Or your eyes see the image and you turn your head and it takes a second for the

520
00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:47.820
image to catch up.
So your body thinks,
oh,
I'm being poisoned.

521
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.520
And it's an unpleasant experience to say the least.

522
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.000
So that's why this generation of Vr kind of died on the vine.

523
00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.253
<v 2>Okay.</v>

524
00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:58.750
<v 0>Then we get to this.</v>

525
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.980
This is what happened in the 90s this is why we are where we are now with

526
00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:09.070
virtual reality.
Two things actually.
One is the rise of smartphones.

527
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.050
Finally we have high definition,
bright,
beautiful,

528
00:32:14.051 --> 00:32:18.850
fast,
responsive LCD screens,
led screens,

529
00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.090
oh,
led screens,
whatever you want.
Like keep getting better and better.

530
00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.180
So now it looks more and more real.

531
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.860
We've also got faster and smaller processors that go into these devices and

532
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:33.070
they're being made so often millions and millions of these devices being made.

533
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:35.710
The price keeps coming down,
it's getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.

534
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.460
The sort of complimentary thing that happened at the same time with video games,

535
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.060
not just console video games,
but especially like three d video games,

536
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:47.720
things like world of Warcraft,
like all this sort of immersive world video games.

537
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:53.020
How are improving our computer graphics program so we can simulate,

538
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.650
we've gone from now sketchpad where we're just drawing cubes and triangles to

539
00:32:57.651 --> 00:33:01.310
now we're drawing really convincing virtual environments.

540
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:07.750
And so the top that technology sort of set the table for the modern VR stuff

541
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:13.570
we've seen today and everything from cardboard to Oculus rift to the HTC vive.

542
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:22.150
Like all of those headsets really came out of that direct environment.

543
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.730
In fact,
in the book I go into way more detail about this stuff,

544
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:27.710
which is what you guys probably know a lot about,

545
00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:30.850
but the very first uh,

546
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:35.060
prototypes of the oculus rift used phones,

547
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.870
like he was yanking phone headsets and using those screens.

548
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:43.220
So that's when enabled this modern generation of Vr to happen.

549
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.400
So what does this all mean?

550
00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:49.130
I want to take some questions from you guys and I want to discuss this a lot

551
00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:50.640
further.
But I think it,

552
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.630
I think the lesson from history that we get as a couple of things.

553
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:58.100
One is that virtual reality is not a novelty.

554
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.600
It is a new technology.
And I run into a lot of people who say to me,

555
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.990
come on Vr,
like it's really happening this time.

556
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:10.460
I'm sure it's not just the gimmick.
I say no for two reasons.

557
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:15.320
One is because the technology finally works now too is because this history has

558
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:18.170
shown us this isn't just like a new toy.

559
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:23.200
This is something that humans have been trying to do for tens of thousands of

560
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:23.840
years.

561
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.840
We finally have the ability to to convincingly simulate virtual worlds.

562
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.360
That's not going to go away.
The technology needs to get better,

563
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:40.310
the content needs to get better,
but I have no doubt in my mind that yes,

564
00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:45.140
people are really going to want to go into a virtual world for hours for days

565
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.920
does disappear because it's,
it's clearly part of,
of our humanity.

566
00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:53.190
Several things I think need to happen to get there.

567
00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:58.191
One is hardware needs to get better screens and have to get need to get even

568
00:34:58.231 --> 00:35:01.650
brighter and higher resolution processors need to get faster.

569
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.620
Headsets just need to get more comfortable.

570
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.400
Right now that's a thing like just wearing the thing on your head hurts after a

571
00:35:08.401 --> 00:35:10.450
while.
So that's where you guys come in.

572
00:35:10.451 --> 00:35:13.440
You'd have to work out these minor technical problems of like,

573
00:35:13.441 --> 00:35:16.470
well how do we get this technology to work better and better?

574
00:35:16.471 --> 00:35:20.070
But I'm convinced that this human drive,

575
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:25.100
this need to put ourselves into virtual worlds is not going to go away.

576
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.670
One last thing before,
two questions that I wanted to bring up is this guy.

577
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.240
I think you all know who he is and I think,
you know,

578
00:35:33.241 --> 00:35:36.930
with the silly looking thing on his face is,
um,
Google

579
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.900
was a very early example of augmented reality.

580
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.290
The idea of being that instead of hiding your way in a virtual world,

581
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.040
we're putting the,
the digital objects into the real world in front of you.

582
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.613
<v 2>This,</v>

583
00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.580
<v 0>I was about to say in front of an audience of,</v>

584
00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.000
of Googlers that this was a failure.
Um,
I think that's,

585
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:02.290
that there's an argument to make one way or another.

586
00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:07.060
I think the issue here was this was ahead of its time.

587
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:11.680
This was not a bad device.
It did cool stuff.

588
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.360
It was just too early for society.

589
00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.270
People weren't ready for this.
And I think,
you know,

590
00:36:19.271 --> 00:36:22.330
people kind of gotten to this idea of like,
oh,
going out in public like this,

591
00:36:22.331 --> 00:36:25.180
your glass hole.
Just because it was so brand new,

592
00:36:25.181 --> 00:36:29.680
like the ice hadn't been broken.
Well Sergei broke the ice,

593
00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:35.350
so now we're starting to see more of these augmented reality headset start to

594
00:36:35.351 --> 00:36:37.420
come out.
Everybody's got it on their phones,

595
00:36:37.421 --> 00:36:40.240
but also Microsoft is developing the Hollow Lens.

596
00:36:40.241 --> 00:36:41.830
You probably read about magic leap.

597
00:36:41.831 --> 00:36:44.110
It's coming out with an ar headset later this year.

598
00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:49.590
I think those are going to be in terms of business at least even bigger than

599
00:36:49.931 --> 00:36:53.770
virtual reality because the benefit of augmented reality is you can do it

600
00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:57.610
anywhere.
You can take it with you anywhere.
If I want to be in Vr,

601
00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.460
I got to go to a safe space because I'm shutting off the world around me.

602
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:04.810
I'm not going to walk down the street and Vr this I can walk down the street

603
00:37:04.811 --> 00:37:06.850
with and this I will walk down the street with,

604
00:37:06.851 --> 00:37:09.760
especially when it doesn't make me look like a jerk for wearing it.

605
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.480
When it's just like a normal pair of glasses or even just like a pair of

606
00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:14.800
contacts that you're wearing.

607
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.890
There's no reason why people don't want that extra information.

608
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.760
And so that's another sort of a takeaway I want to give you guys.

609
00:37:21.761 --> 00:37:25.670
It's like I know that there's other stuff like this happening here at Google.
Uh,

610
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.480
the project tango stuff that you're doing is very exciting,

611
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.640
but augmented reality is just as important if not going to be bigger than

612
00:37:33.641 --> 00:37:36.340
virtual reality and it's another technology worth chasing.

613
00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.630
So that's where we'll leave it for.
Now.
I want to take your questions.

614
00:37:40.631 --> 00:37:44.340
I want to talk about Ar and Vr and dungeons and dragons.

615
00:37:44.341 --> 00:37:47.260
We want to talk about my first book.
Any questions come on up with chalk.

616
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.250
<v 3>Um,</v>

617
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:53.960
so you say that humans have been working on creating worlds that we can escape

618
00:37:53.961 --> 00:37:56.380
to for the entire history of humanity.
So yeah.

619
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.110
<v 2>Okay.</v>

620
00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:01.490
<v 3>If everything is virtual reality,
then what does that term mean?</v>

621
00:38:01.491 --> 00:38:02.870
Or like how,
how,

622
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.440
what does that term create a bounds around that makes it still useful

623
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:07.483
<v 0>to us?</v>

624
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:12.380
It's a really important question because I think right now we have this very

625
00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:16.280
sort of arbitrary definition of there's virtual reality and this reality if I do

626
00:38:16.281 --> 00:38:19.850
something on a computer isn't real,
but I can tell you something.

627
00:38:19.851 --> 00:38:24.851
I've done some VR demos where I went through them and I experienced very real

628
00:38:24.861 --> 00:38:25.694
emotions.

629
00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.980
It felt very real at the time and now that I've walked away with it from it,

630
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:34.430
I don't look back at that experience and say,
boy,

631
00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.440
remember that time when I was wearing a piece of metal on my head and there were

632
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:41.680
photons being blasted into my eyes.
No,
I say,

633
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:46.681
remember that time when I Splunk through an ancient forgotten temple and had to

634
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:48.790
fight off bats with a torch,

635
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.310
so I remember it like it was a real experience and I think we're getting to a

636
00:38:54.311 --> 00:38:58.690
point where that divide of this is a virtual reality isn't going to matter

637
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.540
because it was routed to me.
I experienced that

638
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.470
it may not have been real in the realest sense,

639
00:39:05.471 --> 00:39:09.190
but it's as real as Marilyn memories just real as walking down the street here.

640
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.080
So,
um,
the,

641
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:14.500
the quick answer is that I think the idea of virtual reality is going to go away

642
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:17.830
and I think it will just simply be we've got different environments.

643
00:39:17.831 --> 00:39:21.040
There's the physical world we live in and there will be the digital world we

644
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:21.520
live in.

645
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.380
It won't be any less real than this one because you experienced it and you

646
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.090
affected it and you changed it and it changed you.

647
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.370
Just this world versus that world.

648
00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:34.573
Anybody else?

649
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:41.610
<v 4>Hey,
great doc.
Thanks for coming.
Sure.
Um,</v>

650
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:47.270
all the historical technology that you showed in the pursuit of creating those

651
00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.840
virtual immersive experiences had the side effect of bringing people together

652
00:39:51.841 --> 00:39:55.410
socially,
whether it was coming to the movies,
coming to the theater.

653
00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:01.220
The difference with this is that that isolation aspect makes it the most

654
00:40:02.971 --> 00:40:05.340
antisocial experience you can have.

655
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:11.450
What is your opinion as we start to see much more aware efforts of digital

656
00:40:12.301 --> 00:40:16.590
wellness and like side effects of smartphone addiction and is ever present

657
00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:22.090
technology in our lives,
how that affects us socially and emotionally.
How modern.

658
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.370
Yeah,

659
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.290
<v 0>our deals with that.
Sure.</v>

660
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.460
I think there are some legitimate concerns about virtual reality being a

661
00:40:28.461 --> 00:40:32.000
isolating technology because you are putting on this thing that cuts you off

662
00:40:32.001 --> 00:40:35.090
from the world.
I have all my VR rigs in my apartment right now.

663
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.560
I put on something,

664
00:40:36.561 --> 00:40:40.490
I go to play beat Saber or some RPG or something and my wife is sitting there

665
00:40:40.491 --> 00:40:43.490
and like she'll try and talk to me.
I don't even hear her.
I've headsets in.

666
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:47.420
I disappeared when another place that happens on a much larger scale may be

667
00:40:47.421 --> 00:40:51.620
worth people who were less than happy with their real lives could sort of

668
00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:53.780
disappear into this technology.
Just sort of be like,

669
00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.850
I'm going to live in these VR things.

670
00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:01.010
I think though virtual reality has much more potential for good in this area

671
00:41:01.011 --> 00:41:02.120
than it does for negative.

672
00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.600
You have to look at things like the social experiences that are being created

673
00:41:05.601 --> 00:41:10.580
for Vr.
Um,
I did a demo for altspace,
which some of you might be familiar with,

674
00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:14.390
which is this one of these very first very basic sort of social VR platforms.

675
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:17.870
You can log in together,
you see each other as avatars,

676
00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.440
very simple sort of polygon will robots basically.

677
00:41:21.441 --> 00:41:23.930
They don't look like real people,
but you can move around in this space.

678
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:27.560
You can talk to people.
Vr Chat is another APP like this that people use.

679
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.340
But like I did that altspace demo and I did it with the CEO of alt space.

680
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.770
I was in New York,
he was in valley.

681
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:34.850
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

682
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.540
<v 0>And we talk to each other.
He showed me around the,
the,</v>

683
00:41:37.541 --> 00:41:42.541
the environment and we talked and at the end of it I felt like I had met the

684
00:41:42.901 --> 00:41:43.734
sky.

685
00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:48.180
Like I knew him even though I'd even been staring at a weird polygon on Avatar.

686
00:41:48.181 --> 00:41:49.250
I hadn't even met him.

687
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.530
But the interaction was more physical and it just,
it,
it,

688
00:41:53.531 --> 00:41:56.900
it was much more than being on a phone call or a video chat.

689
00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.080
And that's like generation 0.01 of these virtual reality spaces,

690
00:42:02.081 --> 00:42:02.990
social spaces.

691
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:06.470
I think these tools are going to become a way for people to connect with each

692
00:42:06.471 --> 00:42:10.460
other too.
You've got friends who live in different parts of the world.

693
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:11.950
You can come together in a virtual chat room.

694
00:42:11.951 --> 00:42:12.950
We haven't seen each other for a while.

695
00:42:12.951 --> 00:42:17.690
You actually see each other and interact with each other and socialize.
Um,

696
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.540
maybe you want to meet people from other cultures so you can go into these rooms

697
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:24.110
and I can hang out with people who live in Zimbabwe who I would never meet

698
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:24.944
otherwise.

699
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.860
It's a lot like what we're seeing on chat rooms and stuff on the internet,

700
00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:29.720
but this way we actually have that physical connection.

701
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.870
When the systems get really good,
I can look in your eyes,
I can,

702
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.050
we can make eye contact.
I can see your facial expressions.

703
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:39.020
It becomes like a real social interaction.

704
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.000
I think that's going to be really good for people.

705
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:50.060
Another,
another common thing with the older technologies,

706
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.470
they all had some sort of drawback that prevented them from what you said,

707
00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:58.940
looking photo realistic.
For instance.
Stereoscope is a static image.
Uh,

708
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:03.800
I would argue that anaglyph three d has loss of Koa,

709
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.430
fidelity.
Some people it just doesn't work right.

710
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.790
Sunglasses don't just work.
Right.
Um,

711
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:16.570
and yet at the same time we are living in a revival of this kind of thing at a

712
00:43:19.611 --> 00:43:23.630
very large scale and yet we are still not as photorealistic technology.

713
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:28.631
So I guess the question is at what point are maybe we are already at this point

714
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.970
does okay,
so we've developed an aesthetic of Vr.

715
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:36.530
Is this good enough?

716
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:41.531
Could we stop and is it worth to keep going or is there value in the aesthetic

717
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.560
of not quite photo realistic Vr?

718
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:48.460
I think there's value in the aesthetic as you say,
of of,

719
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.860
of not quite VR of having a VR look like I said and things like VR chat and alt

720
00:43:52.861 --> 00:43:54.760
space does not look real.

721
00:43:54.761 --> 00:43:58.930
At no point do you actually think I am literally in this other place.

722
00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.710
It's obvious from your eyes,
this is a computer simulation,
but

723
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:07.710
the experiences such and also parts of your brain are not smart enough.

724
00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:09.970
They don't know what a simulation is.
Like I,

725
00:44:09.971 --> 00:44:13.290
I think that the lizard part of your brain lights up in virtual reality

726
00:44:13.291 --> 00:44:16.740
simulations and it says [inaudible],
well,
it looks like I'm here,

727
00:44:16.741 --> 00:44:20.520
so I guess I'm here.
So you get this feeling of presence.
And in that sense,

728
00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.300
bad graphics are good enough because you've convinced your brain enough to lose

729
00:44:24.301 --> 00:44:27.720
yourself in the simulation.
Even if I'm not sort of level of higher reasoning,

730
00:44:27.721 --> 00:44:32.160
you never forget that this is a simulation.
Sure feels real and experiences real.

731
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:36.990
Now.
I think we also will get to a place where photo realism and gets better and

732
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:37.560
better.

733
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.560
I think one of the things we promised to do there is move away from screens.

734
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.770
Even though screens are getting better and more and more higher resolution,

735
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:46.560
we probably are going to need something like holographic technology and are

736
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:50.520
literally beaming the photons into your eyes because then that helps with

737
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:54.900
eyestrain.
But also now you're not focused on something in front of your face.

738
00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:56.970
That's one of the big problems with,
uh,

739
00:44:56.971 --> 00:45:00.810
with eyestrain and with realism problems with VR right now is even though it

740
00:45:00.811 --> 00:45:02.700
looks like you're looking at forest lake far away,

741
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:05.070
you're eyes are literally focused on something an inch from your face.

742
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:07.530
This whole graphic technologies don't have that problem.

743
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:11.340
And then I don't know how high tech you guys want to get here at Google,

744
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:15.390
but I am really looking forward to my direct to brain computer interface.

745
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.860
That's what we need is we need direct stimulation of the optic nerve we need,

746
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:23.050
you know,
that's when you get photo realistic,
that's when you get into,
you know,

747
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:24.690
the oasis,
the metaverse,

748
00:45:24.691 --> 00:45:28.200
you know those worlds where it is just as real as this one.

749
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:32.933
<v 2>Okay.</v>

750
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.560
<v 4>So it seems like for for a while like movie theaters have kind of been at the</v>

751
00:45:37.561 --> 00:45:41.520
forefront of like this kind of making this technology work for the masses.

752
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:43.600
And even now you see theaters that have a,

753
00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:47.490
I think it's four dx real be three d that like you're in like a moving chair

754
00:45:47.491 --> 00:45:49.830
that's there would like spraying sense at you and it's kind of like the device

755
00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:52.560
it was John and talk but for a larger audience.

756
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:56.880
But it also kind of feels like there's some diminishing returns with that.

757
00:45:56.881 --> 00:46:00.360
Do you think that like movie theaters will continue to kind of drive that in

758
00:46:00.361 --> 00:46:03.600
terms of like trying these new crazy ideas first or is that going to come down

759
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:05.880
to like new,
smaller companies?

760
00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:06.920
<v 0>Um,</v>

761
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.240
I can tell you that all of the big theater chains are looking at Vr.

762
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.820
Um,
they're looking at it in a couple of different ways.

763
00:46:13.821 --> 00:46:18.290
One is that they see VR as a way to preview their movies.
Like,
Oh,
you know,

764
00:46:18.291 --> 00:46:22.580
we still want to get people to pay $12 or here in Manhattan,

765
00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.460
$19 to sit down in a seat and watch a movie.

766
00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.800
So maybe if we released via our previews,

767
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.740
people will experience that and then be like,
oh,
we have to see it in person.

768
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:32.690
There are also,
there are companies saying,
hey,

769
00:46:32.691 --> 00:46:34.570
maybe we just have a VR experience where it,

770
00:46:34.571 --> 00:46:36.560
lots of people are in the room or in the headsets together.

771
00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.050
Because part of what's good about the theater experiences,

772
00:46:39.051 --> 00:46:41.840
the shared laugh and cry.

773
00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:45.740
And so maybe if we're all just wearing screens,

774
00:46:45.741 --> 00:46:48.200
as long as you can hear the people around you laughing and sign,

775
00:46:48.201 --> 00:46:49.370
like maybe that'll be good enough.

776
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:53.570
I think this all comes from the fact that movies are really a dying business

777
00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:56.420
because our home entertainment systems are getting so much better so than a

778
00:46:56.421 --> 00:47:01.090
movie theater and movie production companies are trying anything.
Um,

779
00:47:01.091 --> 00:47:04.670
when it comes to the studios and movie studios are investing big in making VR

780
00:47:04.671 --> 00:47:05.504
content,

781
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:09.980
they want to transition from putting stuff on screens in theaters to putting it

782
00:47:09.981 --> 00:47:11.300
on a screen in your house.

783
00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.380
And so everybody from Fox to Sony and like all the big movie studios,

784
00:47:15.381 --> 00:47:18.410
they are already making VR movies.

785
00:47:18.411 --> 00:47:20.570
And they do see that as the future.

786
00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:23.090
Maybe not the only way of consume movies in the future,

787
00:47:23.091 --> 00:47:25.850
but a very big part of it.
Um,

788
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:29.060
and then the other thing when you talk about these social experiences that a lot

789
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.600
companies are investing,
especially the small sort of startup ones,

790
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:36.640
are investing in physical,
social VR experiences.

791
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.580
For instance,
there's this company called the void in Salt Lake City.

792
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.010
They have a few different locations.
There's someone Orlando,

793
00:47:42.011 --> 00:47:45.430
there's one here in times square and that's the one where you wear the headset

794
00:47:45.431 --> 00:47:47.020
that blocks you out from the world,

795
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:52.230
but you actually walk around a set and so there's furniture you can bump into

796
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.820
and there's rickety stairs you can climb.

797
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:59.530
And those things are all echoed in the simulation and that's a group experience.

798
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.320
It's like the one in times square is the Ghostbusters.

799
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.580
You all you and three friends put on headsets and you are the Ghostbusters,

800
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:09.310
you can see each other in simulation,
you can talk to each other,

801
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.400
but you're actually moving around and having a social experience.

802
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:17.670
And that probably is sort of the theater like experience of the 21st century.

803
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:19.360
It's yeah,

804
00:48:19.361 --> 00:48:23.110
we still all want to go to a place and buy tickets and beat together physically.

805
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:26.020
But this is our way to enjoy this virtual environment together.

806
00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.673
<v 1>Thanks.</v>

807
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.320
<v 0>Any other questions?
Awesome.
Well,
thank you guys so much for coming.</v>

808
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.620
There's books in the corner and come and talk to me anytime.

809
00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:43.120
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
