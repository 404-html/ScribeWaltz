00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.970
Please give a warm round of applause and welcome to the stage and Matthew

2
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.803
Claudel.

3
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.730
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.860
<v 2>Thank you.
Thanks everyone for coming today.</v>

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.750
My name is Matthew Claudel and I'm a researcher at Mit in the Department of

6
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:27.680
urban planning and also with Mit lab for innovation,
science and policy.

7
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.330
And I'm here today to talk about the evolution and growth of urban innovation.

8
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.770
So we live in a widely publicized urban era.

9
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.360
It's the reason why sidewalk labs exists.
The reason why I do what I do,

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.270
and um,

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.750
this global shift to cities is bringing in extraordinary set of challenges.

12
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.000
For example,
food production and agriculture,
transportation,
equitable governance,

13
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.890
these are all huge issues.

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.290
But I also think that the metropolitan shift is giving us an extraordinary set

15
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:02.090
of tools to answer those challenges.

16
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.780
So my work deals broadly with the question of how to generate,

17
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.100
test and scale new urban technologies in a way that's equitable,
robust,

18
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.090
and citizen centric.
Now obviously that's a huge topic.

19
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.170
So for today's presentation,
I've broken it down into four main categories.

20
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.720
The first of these is Futurecraft,

21
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.770
which is a new methodology that I developed in a recent book with Carlo Ratti,

22
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.150
which you can find back there.
Um,
the second is design x,

23
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.440
which is a program that we just launched it MIT this semester and it's intended

24
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:38.180
to refocus design education towards entrepreneurship and urban innovation.

25
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.530
Thirdly,
I'll talk a bit about,
um,

26
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.870
dynamic urbanisms these sorts of prototypes that I've seen for what I think of

27
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:48.260
as a new mode of city making.
And finally bringing that all together,

28
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:51.770
synthesizing it into the question of now what,
what do we do with all this?

29
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:55.100
How do we act?
So we're talking about the future of cities.

30
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.460
I want to start with something that we all love Paleo futures.
Um,

31
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.760
I think for as long as people have been building cities,

32
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:04.970
we've also been imagining what the future of the city will look like,
what,

33
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.710
what's going to happen tomorrow?

34
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.400
Everything from Fritz Lang's metropolis to minority report,

35
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:11.990
they're all imagining this future city.

36
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.540
So out of this scrap heap of urban visions,

37
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:17.760
I chose one from my hometown of Boston.
Um,

38
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:22.400
this is an article that ran in the Boston Globe in the year 1906,
I believe,

39
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.070
or sorry,

40
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.620
1900 in which the authors imagined what Boston would look like at the turn of

41
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.180
the millennium.
So you can see,

42
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:34.181
he imagined that everyone will own an auto something or other interesting didn't

43
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:35.624
come to pass,

44
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.660
but I guarantee you he could not have imagined the long chain of ideation of

45
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:44.540
innovation,
of technology development,
including the internet,
including Google.

46
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.840
Actually that led to everyone having a personal driver.

47
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.900
This was a radical vision that could never have existed back then.

48
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.040
So if you imagine that kind of long chain of,

49
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.010
of ideas and technologies and innovations and you look at them developing over

50
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:02.170
time,
you get something a little bit like this.

51
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.740
This is one of the earliest diagrams of that concept.
It's by,
um,

52
00:03:06.741 --> 00:03:10.360
Augustus Pitt rivers from 1906.
It's called the evolution of culture.

53
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.710
And in it he imagines how a simple stick is developed,

54
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.910
iterated into any number of weapons and tools.

55
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.980
And to me,
what,
when I see this,
I see an underlying evolutionary metaphor.

56
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.940
You can think of the development of technology as a sort of synthetic evolution.

57
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.020
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.030
<v 2>Now if we have synthetic evolution,</v>

59
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.770
I think the role of designers is actually to introduce mutations into that

60
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.240
progress to introduce mutations into the development of synthetic evolution.

61
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.230
Now as designers,
um,

62
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.340
it's a little bit different than the biological world and in the biological

63
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:50.020
world,
mutations are entirely random.

64
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.500
They happen with each generation and it's kind of the scattershot approach.

65
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.820
As designers,

66
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.390
we have the obligation and the luxury to think about how things ought to be.

67
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.180
In the words of Herbert Simon,
we're,

68
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.200
we aim at changing existing situations into preferred ones,

69
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.451
which is great,

70
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:12.340
but it's not quite that simple because why should the designer be the one to

71
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.780
choose how things ought to be.

72
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.530
Why should the responsibility to adjudicate between preferred situations and not

73
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:23.590
preferred situations be vested only in designers?
Um,

74
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.310
I think that the process of public debate and public scrutiny,

75
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:31.000
especially when you're talking about urban technologies in public space should

76
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:34.240
be collectively held.
Um,

77
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.930
I think that is analogous almost to the force of natural selection in the

78
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:38.640
biological yeah.

79
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.473
<v 3>World.</v>

80
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.340
<v 2>So this whole framework is what we call Futurecraft.
And that's sort of the,</v>

81
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.950
the framework onto which we built the city of tomorrow book.

82
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.750
And I want a diagram a bit how it works.

83
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.050
So here we are today positioned with respect to the future.

84
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.000
You can take any topic and see where it is today.
For example,
transportation.

85
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.590
And you can look back and see all of the developments in iterations and

86
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:05.890
technologies that led us to where we are today and carrying forward that

87
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:07.630
momentum.
You can see where it's going to,

88
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.350
where it might go in five years in 10 years down the line.

89
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.350
And then you have this sort of like future scenario,

90
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.620
this vision of what the city might look like in 10 years.

91
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.370
And into that scenario you can propose a design project.

92
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.930
So going back to transportation,

93
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:27.070
we know there was the Ford model t we know there was unleaded gasoline.
Today's,

94
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:29.890
there's a Tesla we could imagine in the near future,

95
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.050
what if every car we're autonomous.

96
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.250
And then you can begin to design into that scenario.
So,
for example,

97
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:40.060
in a future of autonomous cars,
you can rethink what a car looks like.

98
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.080
You can design new ride sharing interactions.

99
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.890
You can also rethink what a parking lot needs to be now that we don't need to

100
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:48.910
park our cars anymore.

101
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.040
So of course that design project exists not in the future,
but today.

102
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.420
And because it does,

103
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:59.750
it can actually influence the development of synthetic evolution over the next

104
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:01.790
five,
10 15 years.

105
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.890
And in 2031 15 years down the line,
we're going to look back at 2016 and say,

106
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.150
wow,
that was crazy.

107
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:11.630
I can't believe that we thought the city of tomorrow would look like this.

108
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.910
But at least it gave us momentum.

109
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.850
And it gave us a context into which to develop a design project.

110
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.900
And that again is this notion of Futurecraft a to quote Anthony Dunne and Fiona

111
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.070
Raby.
Our role is to unlock people's imaginations and generate alternatives.

112
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.820
So in this book,
we use that methodology,

113
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.480
this framework to look at a number of what if scenarios.
So,
for example,

114
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:38.660
what if humanity could collectively,
right as we read,

115
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.570
what if drones merged with the environment?

116
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.220
I'll talk a bit more about that one later.

117
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.450
And this little collection of projects is a good snapshot of the kinds of work

118
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.190
that we were doing at the senseable city lab.

119
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.510
The kinds of work that I got to be involved with,

120
00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:55.550
with an incredible team of people,
uh,
researchers,
designers,
computer scientists,

121
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:58.250
technologists.
But what,

122
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.610
what struck me is that many of these projects don't go beyond the prototype

123
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:05.760
phase.
And of course as a research lab,
you're not intending to,

124
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.840
to kind of develop businesses,
but at the same time,

125
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:10.370
our cities need this kind of thinking.

126
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.790
Our cities need these sorts of technologies to be integrated to solve the

127
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:15.050
challenges that we face today.

128
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.220
And that really led us to this idea for design X.

129
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.320
I'm a new program that refocuses education towards urban innovation and all.

130
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:26.690
Explain a bit more about what that means.
Um,

131
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.500
it builds on a lot of momentum that's happening right now at the institute.

132
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:33.950
To quote Ed Roberts,
who's a pioneer of innovation at MIT.

133
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.000
Universities must create a culture and programs that make entrepreneurship

134
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.380
widely accessible.
And at Mit,
obviously that's nothing new.

135
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.950
If you look back during World War II in the 1940s,
um,

136
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.450
conditions were absolutely perfect.
There was high demand with the war effort,

137
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.750
there was low funding,

138
00:07:51.751 --> 00:07:55.050
so people were really thinking creatively about how to do things differently.
Um,

139
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.420
there were a lot of partnerships with government and industry and a unique

140
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:00.410
organizational model.

141
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:04.760
What I mean by that is that MIT put up some really shabby buildings and crammed

142
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:08.000
everyone in there and told them to work really hard.
Um,

143
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.230
building 20 is kind of the famous example,
the Rad lab,
and out of that building,

144
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.490
um,
it seems incredible,
but radar,
microwave technology,
bows,
acoustics,

145
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.300
the first video game,
Chomsky,
linguistics,
I mean it was really across the board.

146
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.620
I'm one of the most vibrant and innovative hotspots in the 20th century.

147
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.660
And if you look at the development of innovation over the course of the 20th

148
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:32.870
century,
actually we've only skyrocketed from there.

149
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:37.610
So right here in uh,
1946 in the middle of the war you can see a little blip.

150
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.230
And here we are in 2014.
So not only are we producing more patents,

151
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.820
those patents are more collaborative and I think that has a lot to do with the

152
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:48.740
space of campus.
As an architect,

153
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.060
I wanted to understand how does the physical architecture of the campus and

154
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:55.560
proximity effect the way in which people collaborate.

155
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.800
So this is what it looks like.
Um,

156
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.510
and the campus is organized obviously according to departments,
labs and centers.

157
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.330
These are things with a discreet buildings,

158
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.530
but there are also some a spacial connections like initiatives and institutes.

159
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:13.410
I mentioned before,
the Innovation Initiative that I'm a part of.

160
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.440
So this little visualization shows over time how people are collaborating with

161
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:24.441
papers and patents and you can see sort of hotspots are moving across the campus

162
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.500
and different amounts of activity for patents and papers.

163
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.930
Um,
and I actually found a consistent curve interestingly,
um,

164
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.490
modeled by negative exponential function where the more the closer you are,

165
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:41.730
the more likely you are to collaborate with someone.
This is similar to,

166
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:44.190
for example,
um,
pollination with seeds.

167
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:46.110
Like the closer you are to a tree or a flower,

168
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.650
the more likely you are to find a seat.
Um,

169
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.950
and the same holds true with a remarkable degree of confidence,
um,

170
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.570
with ideas with collaboration.

171
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.960
And this is true even for cross departmental collaboration.

172
00:09:57.961 --> 00:09:59.940
So people who are in a completely different field.

173
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.120
So how do those departments collaborate?
Um,

174
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.380
this is a set of graphs that shows the connections between departments over
time,

175
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:11.700
with papers and patents.
And if you take this same information,

176
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:14.280
you can actually represent that as a network.

177
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.580
So this is the collaboration network at MIT where each node is a researcher and

178
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:22.740
they're colored according to their department and sized according to their

179
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:23.280
output.

180
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.540
And then the connections between the nodes are the strength of a collaboration.

181
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.900
And this accounts for the number of papers and the total number of authors on

182
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:34.500
those papers.
So these,
um,

183
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.760
these researchers are collaborating and you could think of those clusters as

184
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:41.820
community.
So this is with a,
a community detection algorithm.

185
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:45.600
We saw which groups are more likely to collaborate with each other than with

186
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:47.900
anyone else.
Um,
and you,

187
00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:51.690
you can imagine these as almost like cliques of scientists.
Um,

188
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.480
and zooming into those,
as you could expect,

189
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.660
Sloan School of Management and economics tend to collaborate a lot with each

190
00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:58.380
other.

191
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.370
The earth atmosphere and planetary science guys that are on their own planet.

192
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.990
I'm doing their own thing and not collaborating,

193
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:07.560
but we're really struck me here is that design is missing.

194
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.810
The designers,
the architects,

195
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:12.360
the planners are not collaborating with anyone else,

196
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.220
which seems crazy because so many of the innovations that are coming out of Mit,

197
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.500
our urban facing.
So for example,

198
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:23.550
we have colleagues who are doing smart sewer monitoring and um,

199
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.510
I studied architecture so I can kind of confidently bash it a little bit,

200
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.230
but I think design education is actually pretty archaic.
So this is what,

201
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.890
how it went in the 1920s.
And essentially the same thing is happening today.

202
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:37.290
Um,

203
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.130
when it comes to practice design practice in architecture and planning is also

204
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:44.970
pretty archaic.
It's not innovation driven.
It's not scalable.

205
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.620
It's a service for a fee model.
So it's more of the studio,

206
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:50.454
the Lea.

207
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.180
And that's reflected also in trends across the United States.

208
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.560
Here you can see a map of accelerators and funding across the United States.

209
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.510
And what strikes me about this is that in Boston there are very few
accelerators.

210
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:08.650
There are very few academic accelerators and there's basically nothing for urban

211
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:10.690
science,
for planning,
for architecture.

212
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.490
So all this comes together into an idea for design x.

213
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.910
And this is a new program situated in the school of architecture and planning

214
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.530
the idea behind it being to redirect education towards real challenges and real

215
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:26.620
solutions to bring in partners from industry,
um,

216
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.240
and to focus the students and enable them to launch and grow entrepreneurial

217
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:35.470
ventures for the build environment.
Um,
I can speak more about this later,

218
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:39.760
but the idea is to link the five different departments in the school of

219
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:43.480
architecture and planning.
That includes the media,
lab,
art,
culture,
technology,

220
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.600
urban planning center for real estate,
um,

221
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.670
and offer all of the services and all of the resources that exist,
um,

222
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.230
in the,
in the wider world as an accelerator.
So that includes mentorship,

223
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:59.440
that includes funding,
things like that.
Um,

224
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.870
our broader agenda is to advance design,

225
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.610
to empower students to link academia and practice and to research this kind of

226
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.330
emerging field that we think of as design innovation.

227
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.410
And so to better understand what that really looks like,
we actually,
um,

228
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.910
scouted out all of the entrepreneurship that's come out of MIT.
And,
uh,

229
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.530
despite the lack of resources,

230
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:23.650
we actually found some really exciting companies that came out of the school,

231
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.200
for example,
form labs,
um,
[inaudible],

232
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:30.760
which is this amazing like mushroom suit that you get buried in after you die.

233
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.980
And it sort of takes care of you.
Things like mapped well,

234
00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:37.720
which calculates the solar energy potential of every building in a city.

235
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.500
This is really exciting.
So digging more into this,

236
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:44.860
I wanted to understand what is urban innovation really look like?

237
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:47.230
What cities are doing this,
what companies are doing this?

238
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.810
And that's what I think of as dynamic urbanism.

239
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.280
So I want to show a few prototypes of this new form of city making.

240
00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.010
I think it has four main components.
Um,
there are obviously many more,

241
00:14:00.011 --> 00:14:04.180
but I'll focus on these specifically,
which are concept,
finance,

242
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.130
deployment and regulation.
So starting off with concept,
um,

243
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.300
more and more you see that ideation is happening by and for citizens.

244
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.600
These are people who have a knowledge of what the city looks like,

245
00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:18.450
what they need from a city,
um,

246
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.390
how they envision their neighborhood and begin to introduce these feedback
loops,

247
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.260
almost empowering people to design that sort of design and franchisement.

248
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.290
And this can enter in any segment of the population.

249
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:33.130
People who formerly would never think of themselves as a designer and architect,

250
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:35.200
someone who has agency in their city.

251
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.850
A really good example of that is called is a project called the coil and

252
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:44.640
Amsterdam,
which was formerly this industrial shipyard.
It was actually,
um,

253
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.260
toxic soil because of all the years of,
of industrial activity.
And,
um,

254
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.510
the city allocated this land and put in a greenscape that remediates the soil,

255
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.780
but in this wonderful little winding pathway thing,

256
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.990
and then invited people to drag a disused canal boat into that area and start a

257
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:06.320
little design studio in there.
So now I'm architects,
artists.

258
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.820
Um,
kind of anyone,
any creative industry is,

259
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.770
is running these little studios out of old canal boats.

260
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.610
And what's exciting is that this is also a platform for experimenting with urban

261
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:18.370
technology.
So I'm,

262
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:23.180
I'll show a little video of an aquaponic system that they're developing there

263
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.400
and kind of creating this closed loop system.

264
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.663
<v 4>Okay.</v>

265
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.850
<v 5>The goal is,
is before,
on the number of,
of of this recording,</v>

266
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.890
it's a Kayla Sam's of course go for how to have much experimental basis about

267
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:45.220
wound there,
the greenhouse and the greenhouses,

268
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.250
employee excellence Alotta seen urban farming off the bill.

269
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.280
I need to stop [inaudible].

270
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.180
<v 2>So this is kind of a closed loop aquaponic system.</v>

271
00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:59.290
They're developing this and actually running it in the community.
So it's,

272
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:03.580
it's going to,
um,
the storm water.
It's going to the cafe,

273
00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:06.550
which exists right next door.
Secondly,

274
00:16:06.551 --> 00:16:10.880
I want to talk about finance and there's this incredible,
um,

275
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.510
kind of set of tools that had been unlocked by crowdfunding.

276
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.520
So you guys are all familiar with Kickstarter,

277
00:16:15.521 --> 00:16:18.130
but this is actually beginning to enter an urban space as well.

278
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.270
And I think finance is really important,
not only for the dollars it raises,

279
00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:24.430
but also for the communities that it can create.

280
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.040
And once you have a critical mass of community,

281
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:31.210
you actually have much more capacity to interface with the city.
Um,

282
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.410
so I want to start off with a few crowdfunding real estate companies that have

283
00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:40.120
come out.
Um,
so this is much more kind of dry and economic,
but um,

284
00:16:40.121 --> 00:16:44.950
it's a 2.6 billion industry so far in 2016 and there are plenty of companies now

285
00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:49.570
who are doing this.
Um,
it's mostly tailored to midsize developments rather than,

286
00:16:49.571 --> 00:16:50.590
than the smaller the large,

287
00:16:50.591 --> 00:16:54.670
but it's really kind of taken off so people can invest in real estate and much

288
00:16:54.671 --> 00:16:55.960
smaller denominations.

289
00:16:55.961 --> 00:16:59.770
Then formerly they would have had to as kind of a big ticket and investor.

290
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:06.040
More interesting to me is how this,
this,
uh,
begins to affect public space,

291
00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:09.970
public infrastructure.
This is a project called the loop single in Rotterdam.

292
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.770
And it began because there was a new kind of road that cut off the main

293
00:17:14.771 --> 00:17:15.670
transportation hub,

294
00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:19.630
which is Rotterdam central station with the waterfront historic district.

295
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.750
So the citizens,
that tourists kind of,

296
00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:26.950
everyone was calling for a new way of connecting those two areas.
Um,

297
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:31.690
a pedestrian connection and they solicited a design proposal.
Um,

298
00:17:31.691 --> 00:17:35.140
they crowdfunded the thing and it really became a public area,

299
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.870
a piece of infrastructure,
but also a community space.

300
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.980
Here you can see the tiles that people could buy,
um,

301
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.550
for quite a small amount of money.

302
00:17:42.551 --> 00:17:46.450
They got 8,000 citizens to contribute to this thing.

303
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.830
And at that point,
the city government decided to in the rest.

304
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:55.010
So they came in and sponsored the project beyond what the citizens had raised.

305
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.690
And thinking of that notion of implicating citizens with government,

306
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.370
there's an incredible company now and um,
San Francisco called neighborly.

307
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:08.490
And what they do is actually retail municipal bonds.

308
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.530
So formerly municipal bond market was really for those big ticket investors as

309
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:15.810
people who could put down hundreds of thousands of dollars.

310
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.160
And what neighborly does is allows you to invest in your community.
So,
um,

311
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.390
if you want to invest in a park or a school right next door,

312
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.120
you can choose your level of funding.
You can choose,

313
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:32.121
you're kind of expected return timeframe and do this on the order of hundreds or

314
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.350
thousands of dollars rather than millions.

315
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.220
It's really exciting and it's giving people a sense of agency and community in

316
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:40.440
their city.
Thirdly,

317
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:44.940
I want to talk about deployment and I think deployment is incredibly important

318
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:49.590
and I,
it's almost um,
a criteria for what we call urban innovation.

319
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.470
How do you separate urban innovation from anything else?

320
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:57.870
I really think that these need to be deployed and tested in physical space.

321
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.170
You need to get user feedback,
you need to be able to iterate the technology.

322
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:05.130
You need to be able to see what happens when the snow falls and the thing is

323
00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:06.450
buried and freezing.

324
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.270
So this is a familiar example for you guys called Plus Pool in New York.

325
00:19:12.271 --> 00:19:14.160
You probably heard of it.
Um,

326
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:19.170
and the idea came from a really kind of a people focused bottom up way.

327
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.740
Um,
when you're sitting in your apartment in the summer in New York and you're

328
00:19:22.741 --> 00:19:25.680
roasting,
the only thing you want to do is jump in a pool.

329
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.190
But all the pools are packed.
Um,
at the same time,

330
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:30.480
the city is surrounded by water.

331
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.940
So this group of architects and designers thought,

332
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.990
why don't we make a pool that filters the Hudson and floats out in the middle of

333
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:40.380
the river?
So they went through a similar process.

334
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:44.520
They got 30,000 followers on social media.
They got 2000 funders.

335
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.390
And what's really interesting to me is that they actually,
um,

336
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.410
they built a prototype.
So here you can see the,

337
00:19:51.411 --> 00:19:54.480
the campaign where you can buy a tile and contribute to building the pool.

338
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.420
And this is their float lab,
I think they call it,

339
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.050
which is now floating out in the Hudson.
Um,
they're testing the technology.

340
00:20:01.051 --> 00:20:03.960
It's something completely innovative.
It's never really been done before.

341
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.580
And at the same time,

342
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:09.870
this thing is creating data that's publicly available so you can see kind of the

343
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:13.440
real time conditions of the Hudson and you can see how this thing is functioning

344
00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:14.660
and operating.
Um,

345
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.980
as they progress and as they develop a very similar process went into the,

346
00:20:18.981 --> 00:20:20.730
the low line.
Um,

347
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.740
this was an idea to reuse disused subway stations.
Um,
and again,

348
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.510
they raised a bunch of money on Kickstarter.

349
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.160
They got a bunch of support and they opened a public lab and they do a number of

350
00:20:32.161 --> 00:20:36.290
programs like youth design studios and they're actually beginning to,

351
00:20:36.291 --> 00:20:40.680
to work with the city to make this thing happen.
So here you can see,
uh,

352
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.330
a workshop that's,
that's being done with a bunch of kids.
And in the bottom,
uh,

353
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.150
there's there kind of construction paper vision of what this thing could be.

354
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.120
Of course it's totally new technology.

355
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:55.720
They're actually bringing sunlight down through a little pipe,
um,

356
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.560
and they've prototyped that and it's become an actual open area that you can

357
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:02.710
visit.
Now finally I want to talk about regulation.

358
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:05.980
So this is like the least sexy thing that I could possibly do.

359
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:08.680
And even in research,
people are like,
what are you going to do?

360
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:10.570
That's interesting.
That's not regulation.

361
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.380
But I think policy is extremely important when you're talking about urban

362
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:17.380
innovation because if something's in the street,

363
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.430
it's necessarily confronting with public space.
And unfortunately,

364
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:24.730
if something's innovative,
it's new.
If it's a technological development,

365
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.880
it's often going to be at odds with policy and regulation.

366
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.300
Obviously the two work at very different timescales.

367
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.050
So with technology it's developing weeks,
months,

368
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.650
and with policy and regulation,
it's developing over the course of decades.

369
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.210
And I think this is a huge problem.

370
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:43.420
It's actually stopping or redirecting a lot of technical development.

371
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.770
So I want to show an example of a project that I worked on at senseable city lab

372
00:21:47.771 --> 00:21:51.460
that dealt with a really contentious form of technology right now,

373
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.520
which is drones.
So the idea here was to use drones as um,

374
00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.940
a tool to sample water quality.
And the idea is that with water quality,

375
00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:05.050
you really need high resolution data,
preferably in realtime,

376
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.290
and you need to sample it in a way that doesn't disturb the water itself.

377
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.800
So on the Charles River near Mit,
um,

378
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:16.090
there are these infrequent and somewhat random blooms of cyanobacteria.

379
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.480
And so we want to figure out why these things happen.
To do that,

380
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:20.650
we need better data.

381
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:25.240
And so the idea was to create a swarm of little drones that would share tasks

382
00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.230
and they would fly.
And,
uh,
image the water,
but also sample it.

383
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.220
And then B,
I'm shooting that data up to the cloud and,

384
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:34.990
and processing it in real time.

385
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.330
Also making it publicly available to do that.
We,
um,

386
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.820
are here you can see an idea of kind of what that data would look like as an

387
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:43.654
overlay.

388
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.530
And we also thought it would be great to have a sort of public area where people

389
00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:51.550
can go and see how the river is functioning.
Um,
see the water quality,

390
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:53.980
see the flows and see the information.

391
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.220
So we built a few prototypes.
Um,

392
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:02.250
this is the imaging drone and that sheriff's tasks with the water probing drone,

393
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:04.570
little pool noodles there.
Um,

394
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.050
and I'll show you a video now of how the thing progress.

395
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.373
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.390
<v 2>So there's the existing technique now to collect data is actually rolling around</v>

397
00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:35.380
in a boat and you get samples like once a week if that.

398
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.360
So the,
the idea for drones came from the,

399
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:44.230
the notion of getting realtime,
um,
high resolution data.

400
00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:49.070
So these data points kind of an entire grid across the river.

401
00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.200
And here you can see our first,
a little demo.

402
00:23:59.201 --> 00:24:03.820
It's in a tiny little indoor lake that we held at Mit.

403
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.110
And so this is the drone trying to identify where the pools of water are,

404
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.660
communicates those little pinpoints to the other drones.

405
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:18.100
And you're going to see in a second it comes in,
um,
actually samples the water.

406
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:38.230
Is it here is the kind of image of what this could look like.

407
00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:42.570
It kind of suggestion of this being deployed on an APP,
the actual body of water.

408
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.880
So the next step of course would have been to test this thing,
to try it,

409
00:24:47.881 --> 00:24:50.960
to fly these drones to see how it works.
Um,

410
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.480
we propose to do that as you saw in front of MIT at the Charles River,

411
00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.160
at which point we got a cease and desist letter from the FAA.
Uh,

412
00:24:59.161 --> 00:25:04.161
it turns out we were in violation of like dozens of drone codes and,

413
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.710
uh,
so we thought,
okay,
we need to,
to work with the FAA,

414
00:25:07.711 --> 00:25:11.430
we need to get approval to fly these drones,
which brought us here.

415
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:16.480
This is the FAA website,
which literally looks like 1993.
Um,

416
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.930
and the,
the application process,
um,

417
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.580
for being approved would have been extremely long and laborious,

418
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.510
if not impossible,
um,
as a research institution.
And,
uh,

419
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.201
at which point our,

420
00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:32.400
our funding would have been gone and the project just wouldn't have been viable.

421
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.740
So instead what we did was look abroad.
Um,

422
00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.780
we brought this project to the UAE for this drones for good award.

423
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.800
And we also,
um,
scoped out a deployment in Rio de Janeiro.

424
00:25:43.801 --> 00:25:47.340
You can see here at the bottom,
at the end of the video,
that's the logo.

425
00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.720
And I think this is a huge problem,
right?
As it,
as an innovator,

426
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.060
as an entrepreneur,
as a technologist,

427
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:58.530
if the regulations are causing you either to toss your project entirely to

428
00:25:58.531 --> 00:26:00.330
redirect it or to go abroad,

429
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.650
then we're really setting ourselves up for a lack of urban innovation.

430
00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:09.390
So I'm now working on this idea of a more dynamic policy architecture.

431
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:13.170
And this would have a number of goals.
The first is to,

432
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.190
to recalibrate the pace of policy and technology,

433
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.550
so to accelerate policy and do it in a way that's,

434
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.050
that's recursive and datadriven.
Um,

435
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:26.700
secondly is to democratize access to deployment opportunities.
So right now,

436
00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.060
um,
I believe there's a team at Google actually that are flying drones.

437
00:26:30.061 --> 00:26:34.290
Amazon of course,
is flying drones,
researchers at MIT or not.

438
00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:39.000
And so I think that that access to deployment in that access to,
um,

439
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.920
uh,
approval for,
for these prototypes needs to democratized.

440
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:49.560
Of course,
we want to ensure safety and valuation and forth.
If we're creating,

441
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.870
um,
replicable empirical data,

442
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:56.640
we can actually share that from one district to another from one city to another

443
00:26:56.641 --> 00:27:01.500
and accelerate the development of a abroad technology category.
And finally,
yeah,

444
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.320
to promote urban innovation from new sources.

445
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.040
So now what,
how do we wrap this all together?

446
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.960
And this is really pointing towards,
um,

447
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.040
this book that we did called open source architecture.

448
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.530
And the idea behind it was,
um,
to redesign their,

449
00:27:18.531 --> 00:27:22.050
the design process.
So this notion that the agency,

450
00:27:22.051 --> 00:27:25.800
the power to design is in the wrong hands.
So to explain this a bit better,

451
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:29.750
I'm going to give you a one minute crash course of urban planning history.
Um,

452
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.430
going back to 1920,
this is Le Corbusier who I showed earlier as well.
Um,

453
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.450
in 1924,

454
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.230
he was saying things like the crooked path is the way of the donkey.

455
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:42.150
The straight path is the way of man.

456
00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.780
So he really had this sort of comprehensive rationalist idea of planning along

457
00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:51.510
came Jane Jacobs here in New York and she said,
that's absolutely wrong.

458
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:56.511
The notion of order is irreconcilably opposed to the way in which a downtown

459
00:27:56.581 --> 00:28:00.900
actually works.
And she advocated for this more kind of bottom up citizen driven,

460
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.420
more heterogeneous approach to urban planning.

461
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:09.780
Eventually we got to this charming fellow in which urban development was really

462
00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:14.070
all about the money.
It was kind of a capital land grab free for all.
Um,

463
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.400
I want to point out this quote,
you can never be too greedy.

464
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.340
And that sort of leads us to today.

465
00:28:20.341 --> 00:28:23.940
And I think today we have this alternate notion of city planning,

466
00:28:23.941 --> 00:28:27.930
something that's much more community focused and it's much more bottom up.

467
00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.610
And the reason is that we have access to knowledge practices and technological

468
00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:35.070
practices.
To quote Saskia Sassen,

469
00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.790
we need to fully mobilize neighborhood and city culture.

470
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.310
And I think that's becoming possible now.

471
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.840
So the trick is to merge this kind of neighborhood scale,

472
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.490
the place based community scale with digital platforms that are both local and

473
00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:51.324
global.

474
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.920
And it allows you to sort of reorient those four elements that I was talking

475
00:28:55.921 --> 00:29:00.570
about before and bring in a whole number of stakeholders.
So for example,

476
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.560
concept brings in citizens and designers working together.

477
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.560
This is the idea of Futurecraft finance implicates citizens and government to

478
00:29:09.661 --> 00:29:14.430
really show what needs to happen and raise support deployment,
um,
tests,

479
00:29:14.431 --> 00:29:15.151
prototypes,

480
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:18.630
and it brings together entrepreneurs and designers to really be thinking about

481
00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:22.590
commercializing these technologies.
And regulation,
as I said,

482
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.660
is a government process of course,

483
00:29:24.661 --> 00:29:28.890
but it's also based on data and it happens much more quickly.
And recursively.

484
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.480
And again,
going back to what I said right at the beginning,

485
00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:37.020
I think that a model like this will allow us to generate,

486
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:39.780
test and scale these new urban technologies.

487
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:43.180
And I really think that it could be,
um,
robust.

488
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:46.420
It can be equitable and it will of course be citizen centric.

489
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.350
So the reason I wanted to bring this today is that it's still very schematic.

490
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.100
It's very much a notion of how we could organize cities and how we could

491
00:29:54.101 --> 00:29:56.410
organize digital platforms.

492
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.500
And you guys are doing this in practice.

493
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.080
You guys are working with these connective digital platforms.

494
00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:04.330
You guys are working with the local and the global.

495
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.690
And so I really hope that this can be more of a workshop.

496
00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:09.970
This can be a debate on how this thing could happen,

497
00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:13.480
how it can be tangibly apply it in the streets.
Thanks.

498
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.960
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

499
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.600
<v 2>I have a question.
So you opened up the talk,
uh,
talking about,
uh,</v>

500
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.140
kind of the global urbanization,
which is obviously,
you know,

501
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.490
take some part in in the u s but that's kind of much more global phenomenon that

502
00:30:32.491 --> 00:30:35.440
now more than half the world's population lives in cities.
Um,

503
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.500
but it sounds like a lot of,

504
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.700
of sort of these initiatives work well in the West where maybe having,
um,

505
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.470
I'm thinking in particular about like citizen funding and perhaps some of these

506
00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.390
other regulatory issues.
Um,
just some kind of very like us and European centric.

507
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.200
And one thing that I'm,
I'm a little bit,
um,
one thing that I think,
uh,

508
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.320
as somebody who is like a technology story designer,
uh,

509
00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.440
it's always very easy to be,
um,

510
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.440
to want to work on things that are new instead of kind of wanting to solve

511
00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:07.060
problems so it to solve kind of existing problems in certain locations.
So,

512
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:11.350
uh,
uh,
like the one example that I'm thinking of in particular is that I'm pretty

513
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:14.950
familiar with this Cairo.
Um,
and a lot of,
uh,
you know,

514
00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:18.910
cities in South America as well where a lot of the new development towards like

515
00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:22.570
building these new cities where outside of the,
the w the old urban centers,

516
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:22.791
you know,

517
00:31:22.791 --> 00:31:26.320
we're Brasilia or other examples like this where designers wanted to build

518
00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:30.160
things from scratch instead of kind of wanting to work with the very dirty,

519
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:33.880
messy,
uh,
kind of downtowns in slums.
Um,

520
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:37.070
and so as I guess like as you're thinking about,
um,

521
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.170
ways of shifting funding and policy around to address problems like this,

522
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.540
is that something you've thought about?
Like how do we,

523
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.410
how do we ensure that people are working on solving problems?

524
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:51.850
Like at the actual site instead of trying to create new kind of Utopian cities

525
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.370
revisions that we can shift people into.
Yeah,
no,

526
00:31:55.371 --> 00:31:56.840
you bring up in an amazing point.

527
00:31:56.841 --> 00:31:59.570
I think that's absolutely the right question to ask.

528
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:04.550
I should look Corbusier earlier as this.
Um,
let's say,
uh,

529
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:09.170
the,
the iconic promoter of this a Tabula Rasa,

530
00:32:09.171 --> 00:32:11.860
urbanism,
I dunno if you're familiar with the project,
um,

531
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:16.490
Lipton envoy in Paris where he said we should knock down all of Paris and we

532
00:32:16.491 --> 00:32:19.520
should put up these towers that are efficient.
They're rational,

533
00:32:19.521 --> 00:32:24.230
the work really well.
Um,
and Brasilia you mentioned that as well,
um,

534
00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:29.150
is sort of the iconic example of his ideas as built.
Um,

535
00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:33.650
but I really think that urban innovation is more about figuring out those messy

536
00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:34.280
problems.

537
00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.780
I think in a physical space you have to deal with the existing conditions,

538
00:32:38.781 --> 00:32:41.510
you to,
um,
acknowledge the existing city.

539
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:46.511
And it actually requires much more intelligent use of technology to,

540
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.590
for example,
identify slack in the system,
identify where there's unused capacity.

541
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.710
And that's,
I hate using these examples because they're overused,

542
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:58.100
but airbnb and Uber both identified,
um,

543
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:02.180
a sort of gap in the system that was being unused and they're filling it.

544
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.450
And I think there's huge possibility for doing that.
For example,

545
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:06.770
in energy production,

546
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.810
energy production is all about the peaks and the valleys and mitigating those,

547
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:16.640
um,
those spikes in activity.
And so I think if you,
if you introduce for example,

548
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:17.750
a smart grid model,

549
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:22.070
you're all of a sudden sharing energy between the end users and you've mitigated

550
00:33:22.071 --> 00:33:23.090
the peaks and the valleys.

551
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.560
So I think I'm acknowledging the messy city as it is,

552
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.120
but thinking intelligently about how we can change it is sort of my definition

553
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.440
of urban innovation.

554
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.790
<v 7>Hi,
thanks for your talk.
Um,</v>

555
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:44.070
you spoke quite a bit about the integration of technology into the cities of the

556
00:33:44.171 --> 00:33:47.620
future and also at one point mentioned some of the difficulties you had when you

557
00:33:47.621 --> 00:33:50.020
ran into things like regulation.
Uh,

558
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:53.440
how much thought and planning has gone into those who would just shirk the

559
00:33:53.441 --> 00:33:57.370
responsibility regulation people who might want to hack into this technology

560
00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:01.480
advance city of the future.
And use it for their own,
maybe nefarious.

561
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:07.110
<v 2>Yeah.
Okay.
So I think you're,
you're kind of making two points there.
Um,</v>

562
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:12.240
the first is,
uh,
the idea of,
of scaling outside of regulation.

563
00:34:12.241 --> 00:34:15.930
And I think that unfortunately it sort of the emo have a lot of,
um,

564
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:19.410
a lot of startups.
So for example,
if you've taken on a round of investment,

565
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:22.530
someone's breathing down your neck to show returns,
right?

566
00:34:22.531 --> 00:34:27.531
And so your incentive if you come up against the regulation is not to try and

567
00:34:27.871 --> 00:34:28.800
change the regulation,

568
00:34:28.801 --> 00:34:33.801
is not to try and kind of figure out how to do this in a legal way.

569
00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:38.130
It's to scale as much as possible and then figure out your legal problems later.

570
00:34:38.131 --> 00:34:43.050
And this has been done by a number of technologies and I don't think that's bad

571
00:34:43.051 --> 00:34:47.850
in the cases of,
for example,
airbnb.
But I think that if you start,

572
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.770
if you start to consider challenges like wastewater and sewage,
um,

573
00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:58.330
let's say Flint,
Michigan,
they could have used a water quality censoring,
um,

574
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.840
uh,
water quality sensor in the sewers,
for example,

575
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:06.090
a to B testing to be testing the,
the citizens water.
But as a startup,

576
00:35:06.091 --> 00:35:09.150
you're never going to have the opportunity to kind of shove technology down into

577
00:35:09.151 --> 00:35:10.740
the sewer.
Um,

578
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:15.960
and so this notion of scaling and then figuring out your legal problems is not

579
00:35:15.961 --> 00:35:17.340
really tenable,
especially when you're,

580
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.000
when you're solving those kind of nitty gritty challenges of cities.

581
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.330
And so I think we need to find a way that regulation incentivizes technologies

582
00:35:26.431 --> 00:35:31.050
to,
to acknowledge it rather than trying to scale and then figure out the legal

583
00:35:31.051 --> 00:35:35.160
problems.
Um,
and then when it comes to cybersecurity,

584
00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:39.510
that is a huge,
that I know very little about.
Um,

585
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.050
and there is people who are sort of devoting their entire careers to figuring

586
00:35:43.051 --> 00:35:48.030
out,
um,
how do we secure cities as they become more and more digital.

587
00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.810
So,
uh,
an autonomous city for example,

588
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:53.550
every car is self driving.

589
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.900
That sounds great until someone figures out how to hack the car system and then

590
00:35:57.901 --> 00:36:02.490
you have these giant kind of a dangerous things running haywire.

591
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:05.880
Um,
so again,
that's something I don't know enough about,

592
00:36:05.881 --> 00:36:09.450
but there are certainly people who are devoting a lot of energy to figuring out,

593
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.040
um,
urban cybersecurity.

594
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.220
<v 8>Uh,</v>

595
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:19.220
what changes have you seen slash what changes do you want to see in a municipal

596
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:25.140
governments
starting?
We're starting to see more,

597
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.970
um,
more chief digital officers.
There's,

598
00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:31.200
I mentioned tech,
uh,

599
00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.590
like literally technology literacy is really important to administrations as

600
00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:38.820
well.
Um,
and educating them about these changes.

601
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:42.850
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
absolutely.
I think,
um,
they,
you,</v>

602
00:36:42.851 --> 00:36:45.950
you pointed out a really important trend,
which is that,
um,

603
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
more and more mayors offices are actually incorporating a CTO position or that

604
00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:56.290
the chief digital officer,
um,
that's certainly the case here in New York.

605
00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.620
Um,
I know that there's kind of a whole group,

606
00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:03.220
I'm in the EDC who are thinking about this kind of thing.
I'm in Boston.

607
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:07.420
There's the new urban mechanics and in cities around the world also in
Amsterdam,

608
00:37:07.421 --> 00:37:10.990
there's Amsterdam smart city.
Mexico City now has a similar position.

609
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.830
And I think that's crucial is the first step because you're never going to

610
00:37:14.831 --> 00:37:15.940
introduce this sort of change.

611
00:37:15.941 --> 00:37:20.380
You're never going to introduce a more dynamic policy model.
For example,

612
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.280
if you don't have that person in city government who's really embedded with the

613
00:37:24.281 --> 00:37:27.580
mayor's office,
but also digitally literate.
Um,

614
00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:32.730
and I am excited that that is becoming more of a trend and I hope that there is

615
00:37:32.981 --> 00:37:36.750
linking functions between them.
So now there's,
there's a bit of,
um,

616
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:41.800
kind of collaboration and cross comparison,
but mostly it's happening,
um,
ad hoc.

617
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:46.390
So take for example,
electronic road pricing,
which is something that started,

618
00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:50.020
I believe Singapore was the first one to do it and then it was replicated in

619
00:37:50.021 --> 00:37:53.500
London and Stockholm and a number of other cities.

620
00:37:53.501 --> 00:37:58.480
Now I think almost every city has some form of a major city has some form of

621
00:37:58.481 --> 00:38:02.920
electronic road pricing.
Um,
and I think that's the kind of thing,
um,

622
00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:07.090
that could be shared between the CTO offices.
I also think that,

623
00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.530
um,
at the metropolitan level,
we need to think more about citizen engagement.

624
00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:15.130
So if you look at the voter numbers,
I can't pull off the top of my head,

625
00:38:15.131 --> 00:38:17.930
but people who really look at,
um,

626
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:23.310
their city government and a hold them accountable but be kind of introduced

627
00:38:23.321 --> 00:38:27.160
their aspirations for the city.
At the metropolitan level,
it's really low.

628
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.900
And I think that's,
um,

629
00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:34.170
that's the onus is on us to think about how metropolitan government can become

630
00:38:34.781 --> 00:38:38.020
more and more participant with the city.
Um,

631
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:41.740
in a way that's not like long pieces of paper.

632
00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:45.280
Like I was showing this FAA thing or the government websites.
I mean,

633
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:49.420
that's unfortunately the reality.
So,
um,
so getting prototypes,

634
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:54.220
getting ideas really into people's,
um,
city.
So if for example,
the,

635
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:57.430
the Lincoln Yc,
I dunno if,
if there were demos,

636
00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:00.550
but as people are walking down the street,
you could,
um,

637
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:02.740
you could ask them for their feedback,

638
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:04.480
you could ask them for their interaction and then,

639
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.580
and then develop more along those lines.

640
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:10.120
And I think the same can be true of metropolitan process and policies.

641
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.940
<v 5>Um,
so I guess I've somewhat of a followup question to that.</v>

642
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.850
You showed the network mapping with MIT,

643
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.960
and I'm kind of curious because it seems a lot of these initiatives require

644
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:27.160
champions.
Did you guys do any study on sort of how these connections were made?

645
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:31.930
How to sort of foster them?
The design x is a nice way to bring that in.

646
00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:36.100
But has there been more formal efforts to kind of start these engagements and

647
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:39.910
then can those lessons or do you think those lessons can be transferred to

648
00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:40.744
cities?

649
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.150
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.
Um,
so the,</v>

650
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.370
the study at MIT was of um,

651
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.270
collaborative activity with papers and patents.
So that I think,
um,

652
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:57.080
that happens kind of naturally as a function of academic research.

653
00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:00.560
Um,
when you get to the city level,

654
00:40:00.561 --> 00:40:04.280
I think this sorts of projects like decoy Berlin,
Amsterdam,

655
00:40:04.281 --> 00:40:07.730
like looked single in Rotterdam or it's a low line in New York,

656
00:40:07.731 --> 00:40:10.370
they really do need a champion.
Um,
you're absolutely right.

657
00:40:10.371 --> 00:40:14.930
And I think I showed a towards the end this sort of diagram of an ecosystem

658
00:40:14.931 --> 00:40:19.190
model and I think that can become something replicable.
And,
um,

659
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.390
it could be something that's deployed in different cities and offers a framework

660
00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.780
for the sorts of,
um,
urban innovation that we're talking about.

661
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:30.230
I think you're right that it will still need a champion.

662
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.850
And if you're bringing together stakeholders like academia,
like government,
um,

663
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.310
like existing businesses,

664
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:40.070
they don't naturally work together really well.

665
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.490
So there's some good examples of this happening in pioneering cities.

666
00:40:43.491 --> 00:40:48.170
Like New York,
where as an innovator you can interface with,

667
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.560
um,
with city government and talk about,
you know,

668
00:40:51.561 --> 00:40:55.790
the low line then and how we can get this thing off the ground.
Um,

669
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:59.090
no pun intended,
but um,
but I think in,

670
00:40:59.091 --> 00:41:03.400
in cities where that's perhaps not as much embedded in the culture,
um,

671
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.990
you will need a champion.
And I think,
uh,

672
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:09.530
going back to your question about the technology officer in cities,

673
00:41:09.531 --> 00:41:10.760
maybe that's the point of entry.

674
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:15.200
Maybe that's the person who catalyzes the sorts of projects and demarcates a

675
00:41:15.201 --> 00:41:16.190
district and says,
hey,

676
00:41:16.191 --> 00:41:20.330
this is an area where we can prototype new technologies in a safe way,

677
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:21.410
um,

678
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:25.460
be regulating it and be kind of creating knowledge and best practice so that it

679
00:41:25.461 --> 00:41:27.870
can be scaled up to the urban level.
Okay.

680
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:31.460
<v 5>So there's a follow up to that.
I think the ecosystem that you mentioned,</v>

681
00:41:31.461 --> 00:41:32.720
sort of like the four circles,

682
00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.560
it's really interesting and something we talk a lot about.
Um,

683
00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.700
has there been any blow back when you've shown that to people in terms of like

684
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:44.360
the location of research,
first design at the beginning of the circle?

685
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:49.430
And so like how you see researchers driving concepting phases and these types of

686
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:50.264
projects.

687
00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.930
<v 2>Um,
do you want to give me pushback?
Great.
No,
I don't,</v>

688
00:41:54.931 --> 00:41:56.850
I want you to like,
I want to take your,

689
00:41:56.851 --> 00:42:00.430
approve it and send it back where I came from.
Yeah.
Roast.
Because I think,
I think

690
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.640
<v 5>we spend a lot of time at sidewalk talking about sort of how policy drives</v>

691
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.760
problems that ultimately drive solutions.
Um,

692
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.640
<v 2>and it's,
and it's an open question that we grapple with every day,
honestly,</v>

693
00:42:11.641 --> 00:42:13.800
in terms of like where the idea comes from and,

694
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.220
and sort of how we started driving it forward.
So,
yeah,
I mean,
I,

695
00:42:17.221 --> 00:42:21.240
I really think that the idea could start at any point on that circle and

696
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:26.010
importantly it is a circle because,
um,
for example,

697
00:42:26.011 --> 00:42:30.480
an idea could come from a financial justification.
So,
uh,

698
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:35.070
there's a company called convene now that's like reusing real estate,

699
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:39.120
empty real estate and almost hoteling it.
So it's like a,
we work model,

700
00:42:39.121 --> 00:42:43.530
but for corporate offices and that comes from a financial justification.

701
00:42:43.531 --> 00:42:47.430
Like we have this unused infrastructure,
let's figure out how to put it to work.

702
00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:48.840
Um,
of course,

703
00:42:48.841 --> 00:42:53.040
you can get innovation or the idea coming from a citizens,

704
00:42:53.041 --> 00:42:55.230
people who say like,
I need to get from a to B,

705
00:42:55.231 --> 00:42:58.700
let's figure out a better way to do that.
Um,
so I,

706
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:02.550
I think that you can sort of begin that circle at any point.
Um,

707
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.300
and it's a matter of bringing the different elements together.

708
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:11.330
So where I see failure unfortunately is when any one of those components,

709
00:43:11.821 --> 00:43:15.900
anyone in the stake holders is trying to exist sort of on its own.

710
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.760
Um,
and when you,

711
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.510
when you're talking about cities you can't ignore for a long time anyway,

712
00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:23.730
sustainably,
you can't ignore if something like regulation,

713
00:43:23.731 --> 00:43:27.550
you can't ignore something like finance.
Um,
so bringing those together into the,

714
00:43:27.551 --> 00:43:29.820
the sort of ecosystem is exactly the right approach.

715
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.040
<v 5>Oh,
I just wondering what your like ideal collaboration team,</v>

716
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.820
interdisciplinary team to like put your ideas into the world.

717
00:43:40.821 --> 00:43:43.370
Like what would that sort of look like?
Who would you involve?

718
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:48.240
<v 2>Uh,
do you need me to name names?</v>

719
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:53.910
<v 5>Like you mentioned that design is clearly like integral to a lot of these
things.</v>

720
00:43:53.911 --> 00:43:58.170
Then it's not being integrated.
Yes.
I'm just curious,
like who,
you know,

721
00:43:58.171 --> 00:44:00.960
are you involving and like network scientists are involved?

722
00:44:00.961 --> 00:44:02.470
Like who are you involving?
Yeah,

723
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.230
<v 2>yeah.
No,
that's,
um,
that's a good question.</v>

724
00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:09.710
And I think more and more,
uh,

725
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:14.510
we're seeing this all as collaborative because individual disciplines are

726
00:44:14.511 --> 00:44:16.790
becoming more specialized.
Um,

727
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.720
and so you need to work with people and you need to find ways of effectively

728
00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:24.500
constructing a team like that.
Um,
I think for example,

729
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:28.520
network science you brought up,
um,
network science is extraordinarily cool.

730
00:44:28.521 --> 00:44:33.240
I completely nerded out with that study because it's an incredible tool kit to

731
00:44:33.241 --> 00:44:34.530
answer any number of questions.

732
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:39.060
You can talk about metabolic systems in a very sort of like ecosystem biology

733
00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:42.390
way.
You can also talk about scientists collaborating.

734
00:44:42.391 --> 00:44:47.250
You can talk about road networks.
Um,
super fascinating.
And so I think,
you know,

735
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:51.240
let's say you're working on something that seems completely unrelated,
um,

736
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.540
like a wastewater management system.
But if you talk to a network scientist,

737
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:59.340
there might be kind of insights from that as a very pure and abstract science

738
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:03.450
that could be applied to your tangible demonstration.
So,
um,

739
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.440
this is not a satisfying answer to your question,
but I do think that,
um,

740
00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.520
sort of thinking broadly as to who can contribute to a particular idea is really

741
00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:15.160
important.
And again,
it goes back to the idea of public disclosure.

742
00:45:15.161 --> 00:45:17.880
So the more you can put an idea out there in the world,

743
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:22.020
the more you can kind of get criticism,
get feedback and develop the thing.

744
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:27.340
Um,
and that can happen within academia.
Obviously it can happen within any,

745
00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:31.080
any number of stakeholder categories.
So it could be,
um,

746
00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:35.790
you could imagine a new model for an architecture studio that's actually not an

747
00:45:35.791 --> 00:45:36.630
architecture studio,

748
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:41.040
but just a network of people around the world who can decide to opt in to a

749
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:42.990
project that they find interesting.
I don't know,

750
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:45.570
I'm just speaking off the top of my head,
but that,
um,

751
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.610
that kind of thinking I think is more and more valid.

752
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:52.690
<v 9>Hi,
thanks for the talk.
I have a question about,
uh,
into city.</v>

753
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.330
So a lot of great things are happening within the city,

754
00:45:55.331 --> 00:45:57.790
but what about either connections,
amount of cities?

755
00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:02.780
I know that a lot of Googlers at your daily commute.
All right.
Uh,

756
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:05.930
they spend like I was on the road,
so that's a shoe,

757
00:46:05.931 --> 00:46:08.650
but I can tell you this later,
I wish still spent hours on a revenue.

758
00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.290
Is that the future of our cities?
Thank you.

759
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:17.350
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
so,
so as the Internet was introduced,
um,</v>

760
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:19.290
like in the early nineties,

761
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:24.660
there was this actually very serious and very,
uh,
um,

762
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:28.590
widespread belief that the Internet was going to kill cities because all of a

763
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:31.650
sudden you could like connect from anywhere you are.

764
00:46:31.651 --> 00:46:36.030
You could be on like a lounge chair on an island in The Bahamas and you could be

765
00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:37.680
going to work just the same.

766
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.870
You can talk to anyone at any time and sort of be spatially liberated.

767
00:46:42.871 --> 00:46:45.150
It would be this like neo nomadic condition.

768
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:48.660
But what we've found actually the accelerating trend is that people want to be

769
00:46:48.661 --> 00:46:52.590
downtown,
people want to be in cities.
And um,

770
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.970
and I think a few ways to respond to that trend.

771
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.020
Obviously we can unlock disused capacity.
So,
for example,

772
00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:05.640
city buildings around New York right now are mostly occupied but not all

773
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:10.440
occupied.
Um,
I also know that 12 hours from now in the middle of the night,

774
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:15.120
it'll be almost a complete shift of occupancy in buildings where many will stand

775
00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:18.480
empty that were formerly full.
Um,

776
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.870
so if we can think more intelligently about how to use the infrastructure we

777
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:26.520
already have,
then,
um,
then we're making strides.
I also think that,

778
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.710
um,
that we might have in,

779
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.680
in certain areas and in certain conditions and more polycentric models.
So now,

780
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:34.900
you know,
Google was started in mountain view.

781
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.920
Obviously the number of people that employees can't all live in mountain view

782
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:42.640
and commute there.
Um,
and so there's offices around the world and that's,

783
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:44.770
I mean this is an obvious thing to say,

784
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:48.880
but there's digital connection technology that makes it easier to do that in a

785
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:51.040
way that you couldn't have before.
Um,

786
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.150
I don't know where that's heading and I don't know if the answer is that things

787
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:57.340
will become globally distributed.

788
00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:02.860
I do think that place and proximity are extremely important,

789
00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:06.910
especially for the ideation process.
Um,
and this is really what I was,

790
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:12.110
what I was angling on with that study of MIT was figuring out how,
um,

791
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.761
proximity,

792
00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:16.840
even someone down the hallway is important for that collaborative activity.

793
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:21.910
Um,
so sure it's easy to schedule a meeting with someone and in Taipei,

794
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:27.010
but it's really difficult to come up with a new idea.
And,
and I think that,

795
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.960
um,
having these kinds of spacial centers where people agglomerate where people

796
00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:33.460
bring all those different ideas.

797
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.160
So going back to your question about how a team works,
I mean,

798
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:37.780
I think a lot of it is serendipity.

799
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:41.140
A lot of it is kind of a shared space and shared experience,

800
00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.850
and then you get these new ideas.

801
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:47.650
So that doesn't answer your question about the long commute.
But I do think that,

802
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.410
um,
downtowns and,
and having kind of a,

803
00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.930
a cluster of people is really important.

804
00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:01.240
<v 1>Thanks.
