1
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.610
All right,
everybody,
thank you so much for coming to talks at Google.

2
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.690
We have an amazing guest for you today.
Adam Brown.

3
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.100
Adam started an organization in 2008 called pencils of promise,

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.300
which a lot of you might have heard of.
They've gone all around the world,
uh,

5
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.390
and started schools and impoverished regions.
Uh,

6
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:30.990
they started over 400 schools to date.
Uh,

7
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.550
he's actually the New York Times bestselling author of the promise of a pencil

8
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.600
and he recently just started his newest venture,
which is incredibly exciting.

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.300
It's trying to basically upend the traditional college system,
uh,
and,

10
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:47.700
and end the cycle of debt,
teach students practical skills.

11
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:51.120
It's a one year program.
It's really exciting.
Uh,
and he's here and he's,

12
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.130
that's mainly what we're going to be focused on.
Uh,
can't,

13
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110
can't wait to have Adam speak.
He's a,

14
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.230
a perfect example of somebody who kind of embarked on a non traditional path

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.660
that's purpose driven at a,
at a young age.
Uh,

16
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.520
and he's going to talk about where education is headed and what mission use

17
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.510
place is in that.
And that's,
that's what I just described.
His new,

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.100
his new venture.
Um,
so please join me in welcoming Adam Braun to the stage.

19
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.670
<v 3>Thank you so much.
Um,
so,
uh,
as you heard,
I,</v>

20
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:28.570
I spent a really the last decade of my life focused on education and both

21
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.910
internationally and now more so domestically.

22
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.030
And so I figured I'd walk you a little bit through that journey and,
uh,
you know,

23
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.830
Kinda open up today's talk,
uh,

24
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.150
with a little bit more context in particular on Missionu and then we can dive

25
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:41.590
into some questions,
uh,

26
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.880
and then really opened it up to a Q and a with all of you.
So,
uh,
to begin with,

27
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.300
um,
you know,
this is a,
a community in rural Ghana.
Uh,

28
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.490
pencils of promise began in 2008.

29
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.750
I put $25 into a bank account in hopes of building one school.
Uh,

30
00:01:55.751 --> 00:02:00.100
and that first goal was in a rural Laos.
Uh,
over time.

31
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:04.390
What I saw was that,
uh,
not only did I have a personal passion for,
uh,

32
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.980
attempting and,
and really,
uh,
guiding,
I think,
uh,

33
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.080
communities,
uh,

34
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.170
in particular communities of poverty in rural parts of the developing world,
uh,

35
00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:17.380
to enable their future generations of children to gain access to better

36
00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:21.670
education.
But that idea really resonated with a lot of people in particular,

37
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:24.370
young people across the country.
And so,
uh,

38
00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:28.060
what started in rural Lao screwed in Nicaragua and Guatemala,
eventually Ghana,

39
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.280
uh,
and this was a community,
uh,
that I entered with some of our staff.
Uh,

40
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.500
and what we saw was that about 800 people live in this community,

41
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.120
and this was considered the school for the entire village.
Uh,

42
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.290
so you can imagine a,

43
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.300
obviously these children were not getting access to the quality of education

44
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:47.160
that we would all want for them.
Uh,
and with the support of a,

45
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.160
actually a school in the United States and a Chicago that puts together a peer

46
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:52.450
to peer fundraiser,
uh,

47
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.290
we were able to raise the funds to go and work with this community directly to

48
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:59.600
really transform the lives of those children.
Uh,
and it,
you know,

49
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.690
transformed from this,
uh,
into this,

50
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.060
which is what a completed pencils of promise school looks like.

51
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.800
And I spent a lot of time,
uh,

52
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.130
over this last decade going really not only around the country but around the

53
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.450
world speaking about this work,

54
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:15.180
trying to really galvanize others to get involved in this process.
Unfortunately,

55
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.760
the organization has grown by leaps and bounds.
It's,
you know,

56
00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:20.980
a really found tremendous success.
Uh,
and you know,
the,

57
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:25.030
the next step for me in 2013 is we started to approach what felt like a very big

58
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:27.520
milestone,
which was completing our hundred school,
uh,

59
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.000
which actually was in Ghana as well.
Uh,
I decided to write a book about it,

60
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.370
and that book was called the promise of a pencil.
Uh,

61
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:36.010
what was really important was actually the subtitle of the book,

62
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.280
which is what an ordinary person can create extraordinary change.
And so,

63
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.010
you know,
as much as,
uh,
I felt,
uh,
you know,

64
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:45.160
really inspired by the work that we were taking on,
uh,

65
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.550
my real goal was actually to help other people figure out how they could pursue

66
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:50.530
their sense of purpose and their sense of passion.

67
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.320
And so the book is framed around 30,
very short chapters.

68
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:55.300
Each chapter is title with a mantra.

69
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.700
And those mantras were really the guideposts for me,
uh,

70
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.210
as I navigated the challenging waters of,
of figuring out how do you build a,

71
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.940
a global organization from scratch in particular starting in late 2008 in New

72
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.270
York,
which was incredibly challenging period.
Um,
and so,
you know,

73
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.170
that that subtitle,

74
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.860
how an ordinary person can create extraordinary change is what motivated me.

75
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:19.090
And I found myself,
uh,
on many,
many college campuses around the country.

76
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.870
And you know,
as,
uh,
I would tell this story,

77
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.890
there was certainly a subset of people that would actively get involved.
And,

78
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:30.220
you know,
they tell their friends,
they tell their family.
And as a result,
this,

79
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:34.790
this organization continues to grow.
And in recent years.
And as of today,
uh,

80
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.660
we've now built over 400 schools around the world.

81
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.090
We have about 75,000 students in our programs.

82
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.160
And what started with just $25 is now turned into more than $50 million raised,

83
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.670
uh,
to support these children around the world.
But,
uh,

84
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:52.840
as I went from location to location to location,
uh,

85
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.870
really speaking about the,
the value and virtue of this work,

86
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.700
what I found was a common refrain,

87
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.070
a on every type of college campus that I visited,

88
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:02.890
whether these were elite private schools,
uh,

89
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:06.880
community colleges and Tennessee and Arizona,
large state schools,

90
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:08.260
not elite private schools.

91
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.440
There was always this significant subset of students that would come up to me

92
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:14.530
afterwards or ask a question during Q and a and they'd say,
you know,
Adam,

93
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:16.090
this is really great what you're describing,

94
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:20.770
but I can't even consider the type of work that you're describing because one,

95
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:23.980
I have so much student debt that the number one thing in my life is trying to

96
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.950
get out of that student debt.
And then to a,

97
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.900
I don't actually have any of these skills,

98
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:31.420
they're going to help me get the jobs that I'm seeking.

99
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.480
And I'm now hearing this as I apply for internships and jobs.

100
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.220
And so I started to do a lot of research into some of these challenges and I

101
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:40.810
deeply believe in organizational focus.

102
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:43.690
And so pencils of promise needed stay true to its core mission to support

103
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.250
children in the developing world.

104
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.230
But there was a huge personal transition for me when I met my wife.
And uh,

105
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:53.620
at the time,
you know,
I,
you start to fall in love with somebody,

106
00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:55.930
you start planning a life together.
And one of those,
you know,

107
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:59.420
important conversations is to figure out where you're coming from financially.

108
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.810
And what was very clear to me from really the,

109
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:06.920
the first month that we spent together was that she was,
you know,

110
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.860
from a very loving family but one without a lot of financial means.

111
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.590
And they came to this country and she was nine from South Africa,

112
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.880
moved to the Boston area in hopes of really building a life of,

113
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.800
of success and prosperity.
And you know,
if,

114
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.970
if you're new to this country in particular or your of a working class or lower

115
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:24.390
income family,
you know,

116
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.190
what's the number one thing that every parent tells you you should invest in,

117
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:32.570
that you should focus on to get a better life ahead?
Education.
Right.

118
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.590
And I think that's a dream that we've really kind of sold to generation after

119
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:38.420
generation.
Uh,
on my mother's side,

120
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:42.590
my grandfather actually was part of the first wave of individuals to get access

121
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:44.930
to free college in the United States through the Gi bill,

122
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.460
which was passed in 1944 and it really started this movement towards college for

123
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:51.140
all.
Um,
but you know,

124
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:54.650
my wife bought into that and she went to college initially out of state after

125
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:57.230
two years,
transferred back in state to try and reduce the cost.

126
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.860
And after three years needed to leave school before actually attaining that

127
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:03.580
bachelor's degree that she was pursuing because the,

128
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.820
the challenges were so great financially.
And by the time that I met her,
uh,

129
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.030
her student debt,
uh,

130
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.790
was at over a hundred thousand dollars as a result of these three years.
Um,

131
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.420
and,
uh,
it was absolutely crushing.
And eventually as we moved towards marriage,

132
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:18.650
I said,
you know,
something,
uh,

133
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.550
you should really consider declaring full bankruptcy.
Uh,
you should hopefully,

134
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.160
you know,
I know it's going to destroy your credit,
but I have good credit,

135
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:28.200
will be okay as a couple.
Um,
and at least to be,
you know,

136
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.430
out of this cage that might keep you in poverty throughout the rest of your
life.

137
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.910
And she said to me,
Adam,
uh,
that sounds great,

138
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.150
but student debt is the only debt in the United States that you cannot declare

139
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:40.460
bankruptcy on.
And I remember,
you know,

140
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.740
I have a financial background starting my career at Bain.

141
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.080
I've been working at hedge funds since I was like 16.
And I was like,

142
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:48.290
that's not possible.
Uh,
that's just impossible.

143
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:52.940
Let me talk to some financial people and help you get out of this.
And of course,

144
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:57.590
she was absolutely right and I was absolutely wrong.
And,
uh,

145
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.190
as soon as I really discovered that,
I think that in,
in at least my mind,

146
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.750
that's the moment that mission you was born,

147
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:06.920
that if we had a societal injustice that was this great,
this profound,
uh,

148
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:10.930
and the one thing that was supposed to enable the people who needed to,
uh,

149
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.721
kind of,
you know,

150
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:16.430
experience social mobility most was going to keep them in those places are worse

151
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.300
than we're creating a greater and greater societal divide between the classes,

152
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:23.990
which obviously leads us to this huge political division and all these other

153
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:27.050
challenges that we're now facing as a country.
And so I said,

154
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:31.250
I need to research this more and uh,
I'll,
I'll show you a chart,

155
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.740
uh,
that,
uh,
a friend of mine,
Neil Blumenthal sent me a few months ago.

156
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.320
Neil's the I'm co founder and co CEO of Warby Parker and someone who's also

157
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:41.870
passionate about this cause he's seeing it on his team.
Um,

158
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:45.020
some of the challenges,
right of finding work ready talent,

159
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.160
especially out of Undergrad.
And so,
uh,

160
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.440
this is the price change in consumer goods,
uh,
over the last 20 years or so.

161
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.220
And you know,
what you can see is that the bottom things like toys,
you know,

162
00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:57.480
new cars,
clothing,
et Cetera,

163
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:00.580
essentially luxury consumer goods have actually drastically come down,

164
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.640
much more people can access them than ever before.

165
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.570
What you see at the very top is that education has never been more expensive and

166
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:10.800
even more expensive than traditional education is college tuition.
Uh,

167
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:14.610
it's risen more than essentially any other incurred fee that someone's going to

168
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:18.360
take on in their life.
Um,
as I started to dig further and further into this,

169
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:22.000
what I realized was that,
uh,
not only do you see this huge growth,
uh,

170
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.350
the red line in the cost of getting an undergraduate degree,

171
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.190
but the blue line is the average earnings of a bachelor degree holder between

172
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:33.450
the ages of 24 and 34.
And so that's actually gone down.
And so,
you know,

173
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.890
what we have is one,

174
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.150
the situation where any person who's entering college and his has to take on

175
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.310
debt,
that number is just increasing,
increasing.

176
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:43.700
And now it's becoming oftentimes insurmountable.

177
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:48.710
Today's entering freshmen will have on average $50,000 of debt by the time they

178
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:52.350
graduate,
if they graduate.
Um,
and only,
uh,
you know,

179
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.840
a much lower percentage than we actually anticipate graduate.
Um,
and then to,

180
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.360
they actually don't have the skills that they need,
right?
About three quarters,

181
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:03.840
believe that their colleges failed,
uh,
to prepare them for the real world.

182
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.640
And so there,
there's three macro shifts,
uh,

183
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.810
that I observed and really 2016 into 2017 and now here we are in 2018 that would

184
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:16.050
enable a very new model for us to really kind of recreate,
reinvent,

185
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.080
and reinvigorate this very oftentimes a averse to change space of,

186
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:23.580
of Higher Ed.
And so the first is,
you know,

187
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:27.870
historically credentials were really the metric for success.
Uh,
people just said,

188
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:29.400
okay,
do you have a degree?
Yes.

189
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:32.850
Then you must be skilled because we didn't have all this other information on

190
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.830
individually.
You couldn't search for them on Google.

191
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:38.850
You couldn't look up their linkedin,
you know,
credentials 10 or 15 years ago.
So,

192
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.870
uh,
we're now we're seeing this shift over to competency based hiring,
right?
Uh,

193
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:44.310
in particular for technical skills,

194
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.550
you can just put a test in front of somebody and you can assess their technical

195
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:50.550
abilities.
And that's actually much more important than perhaps,
you know,

196
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:52.140
whether they have a degree or not.
Uh,

197
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.250
this second is that historically tests were the primary method of learning,

198
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:56.701
right?

199
00:10:56.701 --> 00:11:00.720
We did rote memorization and then after that rote memorization and then we just

200
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:03.750
jumped into like an an exam and we regurgitated that.

201
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:05.070
And that was a demonstration of learning.

202
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.000
And I think that what we are seeing a radical shift to is project based
learning,

203
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:09.840
uh,

204
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.830
where it's much more replicable to put together a group of projects,
uh,

205
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.100
that a person actually navigates through in a group.

206
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.310
And that in itself is a lot more demonstrate of,

207
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:23.400
of what we actually experience in the real world,
uh,
in our work contest.

208
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:25.080
And then the third is that in 2012,

209
00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:27.510
we saw the rise of moocs like Coursera and you'd ask city,

210
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.150
there was this huge belief that you're gonna have the best professor in the

211
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:31.950
world is going to educate 15,000 people.

212
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.530
And that's going to solve the challenges of education.

213
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.560
And what we're seeing is that the vast majority of people,
uh,

214
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.380
don't actually complete those courses.
It's less than 5%.

215
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.220
Most of us are not considered a autodidacts.

216
00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:46.980
So we can teach ourselves and have that motivation and accountability to

217
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:48.300
complete one of those courses.

218
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:53.600
And so what we are able to do though is work very effectively in online cohorts

219
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:59.290
when it's live synchronous instruction.
Uh,
when there's,
you know,
an instructor,

220
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.190
a world class expert in something with a small group and we're held accountable

221
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.640
to those around us on the screen and it's done lie.
That's actually very,

222
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:10.360
very powerful.
We've seen a few models involved in that space that,
uh,

223
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.350
are able to demonstrate that.
And so,
uh,
and you know,

224
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:18.460
really it started 2016 I moved from New York after a place in myself as CEO at,

225
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.300
at pencils of promise,
uh,

226
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.070
out to the bay area to focus on building a college alternative for the 21st

227
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:24.904
century.
Uh,

228
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.210
really reinventing the model of what higher education can and should look like

229
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:31.850
if you started from today.
Um,
and so I'll show you a quick video a,

230
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.840
it features some really extraordinary people that have gotten behind what we're

231
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:38.830
doing and it walks you through a little bit through why this works and how it

232
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:39.664
works.

233
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.410
<v 2>Did the first time in history the skills you need for work learning and</v>

234
00:12:45.411 --> 00:12:47.090
citizenship have converged.

235
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.120
The current process of academia is failing us in our ability to find great

236
00:12:52.131 --> 00:12:52.730
talent.

237
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.730
There is a gap now in what students are learning and what employees are

238
00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.520
expecting in the market.

239
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.300
<v 4>There's a lack of sort of specific practical experience.</v>

240
00:13:03.301 --> 00:13:06.060
Traditional four year curriculum is missing.

241
00:13:06.061 --> 00:13:07.740
We'll have the technical skills that people need.

242
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.790
They might not have collaboration skills,
project management skills.

243
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:15.090
They're not prepared to work and you just want to make sure that the experience

244
00:13:15.091 --> 00:13:18.240
that someone has is irrelevant to the job that they have to do.

245
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.380
I'm excited about mission u because the team has been reaching out to folks like

246
00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:25.980
me to figure out what are we looking for in candidates and helping to design the

247
00:13:25.981 --> 00:13:27.630
curriculum around that.

248
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.530
<v 2>People that take not just ideas and theory,</v>

249
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:33.960
but they show real concrete examples.

250
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:39.020
You want people who can work with other people who have great soft skills,

251
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.170
you want hard skills,
right?
The ability to analyze problems.

252
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.580
That's what mission use.
Teaching

253
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.450
<v 4>the student who's aggressive about taking on things is exactly the type of</v>

254
00:13:48.451 --> 00:13:50.910
candidate we would want to bring in to our company.

255
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.020
Analytical Problem solvers and not afraid of something tough and that's why I

256
00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:58.410
think mission use focus on skills is so important.

257
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.570
It's one thing to learn something in a classroom,

258
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.380
but it's a whole nother thing to have real world experience in a specific field.

259
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.340
<v 2>One truly lens by doing,</v>

260
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:12.160
<v 4>having somebody that's been specifically trained in an area where we need talent</v>

261
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:13.840
is of real value.
Holding a company,

262
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.710
we set out to challenge norms and so of course we should be empowering people to

263
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:20.560
do the same thing with their own educations.
We would definitely hire mission.

264
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:22.780
You graduate,
of course,
I would hire someone from Missionu.

265
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.090
We would a hundred percent higher mission.
You graduate.

266
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.250
<v 2>Be Very confident about hiring someone from Missionu.</v>

267
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:33.370
We would and we will hire Missionu grads 1000% I would hire a mission new Grad.

268
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.050
I would totally hire someone from mission unit.

269
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.600
We would like to be the first people to hire a Missionu Grad.

270
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.270
I would absolutely hire Missionu Gretsch.

271
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.450
<v 3>So,
um,
you know,
mission,
you in essence,
uh,</v>

272
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.460
is this one year program that focused on his aunt real world skills.

273
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:55.400
And one of the things that we've certainly seen is that it's not enough just to

274
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:56.630
teach hard technical skills,

275
00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:00.410
but people that really thrive actually possess this whole wealth of soft skills,

276
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.080
effective collaboration,
critical thinking abilities,
um,

277
00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:06.450
effective communication both in written,
you know,

278
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:11.030
whether it's email or building presentations or in person.
Um,
and so,
you know,

279
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:15.860
we also thought about what is a,
a actual viable revenue model for,

280
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.131
you know,

281
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:21.020
a modern institution that aligns itself with the outcomes and the aspirations of

282
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:25.700
their students from day one.
And so what we decided was that,
um,

283
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.910
before any student ever paid us a dollar of tuition,

284
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.760
we would have to demonstrate to them that they had achieved success,

285
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:34.900
which is really the exact opposite of what happens on a traditional college
date,

286
00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:37.770
right?
You take out these big loans,
you pay this school,
and then,
uh,

287
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.670
you kind of hope for the best that you end up with a job afterwards.

288
00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:43.250
But their commitment essentially ends when you walk out their door.

289
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:46.730
And that's when they usually reach out in order to ask for a donation.

290
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.880
And how many people have in that solicitation from their Alma Mater?

291
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.410
Probably all of us.
Um,

292
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.940
and so what we decided was that when someone got into mission,
you,
uh,

293
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.430
we would charge them absolutely no tuition upfront and instead we would invest

294
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:01.970
in them throughout the course of their entire year at mission.
You.
And,
uh,

295
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:03.080
at the end of that year,

296
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:06.470
only if and when they were making at least $50,000 or more,

297
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.770
they would contribute back 15% of their income for three years.

298
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.720
And then that would be the end of their obligation.

299
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.040
And so it's an entirely outcomes based model.
Um,
and we said,

300
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:18.440
you know something when it comes to designing curriculum,
you know,

301
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:23.390
most colleges kind of oftentimes are very separated from the business world,

302
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.540
right?
We said,
we should absolutely partner with the business world.

303
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:27.590
This is what students want.

304
00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:30.740
91% of today's freshmen say they're going to college to get a better job.

305
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.020
And so before we ever started recruiting students,

306
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:35.510
we were speaking to world costs companies.
Uh,

307
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:37.490
and they've deeply advised us on curriculum.

308
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.360
Everything that we teach our students goes through the lens of a employer,

309
00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:43.930
partners evaluating,
assessing,
and advising.
Uh,

310
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.440
the second is we would create content.

311
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:47.950
So we have guest speakers nonstop for our students.
Uh,

312
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.320
they oftentimes go onsite to actual companies to get that real world experience.

313
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.790
So all of our employer partners get first cut at this incredible pipeline of

314
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:58.750
talent.
And,
uh,
as of now,
these in partners,
uh,

315
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.310
include companies like Spotify,
Lyft,
Uber,
Warby Parker,
Casper,
Harry's,

316
00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:04.300
et Cetera,
uh,

317
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.760
with a bunch more to be announced shortly and hopefully Google at some point as

318
00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:08.780
well.
Um,

319
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.960
and so what I figured would actually be helpful is to walk you through a little

320
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:16.670
bit,
uh,
of how we've integrated Google's technology being here,
uh,
on campus.
Uh,

321
00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:20.170
you guys have been an incredible,
incredible provider,
uh,

322
00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:23.540
of the technology that actually powers a lot of our student experience.
Uh,

323
00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:26.090
we use blended learning.
We think that's really the future of education,

324
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:28.160
which is a hybrid of both online,

325
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.850
which is live primarily for our students as well as in person.
We think that,

326
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.560
you know,
uh,

327
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.780
a lot of students can learn very well online in particular technical skills,

328
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.470
but those soft skills and those relationships that you create with your cohort

329
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:42.260
mates really have to be a facilitated in person.

330
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.420
So our students come together at minimum every other week.

331
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:47.990
A lot of them actually live together because you have to live within 50 miles of

332
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:52.170
your cohort city.
Um,
and then,
you know,
finally I figured,
um,
uh,

333
00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.540
just share a little bit of what are your,

334
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.220
it looks like the first trimester is a deep dive into what we consider

335
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.490
foundational skills.
A mix of both hard skills and soft skills.

336
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.520
A lot of things that come out of Stanford on the soft skill and holistic

337
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:05.400
development side.
A lot of things that come out of places like Bain,

338
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:09.570
where I started my career as well as some of the instruction from top data

339
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:12.490
scientists and our instructors as well as,
you know,

340
00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:15.910
advisors come from places like Harvard and Stanford and Mit.
Uh,

341
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.020
second trimester is a deep dive into your major.
Right now we offer one,

342
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:21.270
which is data analytics and business intelligence.

343
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.100
Over time we'll learn many more.

344
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.160
And then the final trimester is actually real world work experience,

345
00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:28.170
either internships,
fellowships,
uh,

346
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:31.290
or consulting projects so that they can complete the year with the actual

347
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:36.000
competency that they want to enter the workforce with.
So,
um,
you know,
with that,

348
00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:39.450
uh,
I guess we'll kind of dive into a little bit of a conversation,
but,
uh,

349
00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.140
if anybody wants to follow up or get involved in any capacity,

350
00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:46.560
this is just my email and I'll,
I'll leave it up there as we chat.
Cool.

351
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.000
Thanks Adam.
Yeah,
thank you.

352
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:57.260
<v 1>Awesome.
Really appreciate you being here and for the Google plug.
Um,</v>

353
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.610
so I,
I want to kind of just bring it back for a second and,
uh,
just,

354
00:19:01.611 --> 00:19:05.090
just provide a little bit of context for the audience.
Uh,
talk about,

355
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.500
talk about your child that you talked about,

356
00:19:06.501 --> 00:19:10.820
the inflection point between pencils of promise and mission.
You,
uh,
I,

357
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.770
I'd love to hear you focused on the inflection point between the kind of,
uh,

358
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.650
overachieving,
kind of typical path of like,
you know,
Hedge Fund being,
uh,

359
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.990
to pencils of promise.

360
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.140
<v 3>Sure.
Um,
you know,
I had a good childhood.
I mean,
a great one.
My,</v>

361
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.340
my parents are amazing.
So now I have 14 month old twins at home.

362
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.270
And so,
uh,
my parents have suddenly never become smarter,
uh,

363
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:36.240
in my life and I've never gone to them for more advice than since becoming a

364
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:40.530
parent myself.
But,
you know,
they're both very loving.
Um,
my,
uh,

365
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.630
my dad's an immigrant,
came here when he was three,

366
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.940
a child of two Holocaust survivors.
And,
um,

367
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.230
my mother's father passed away when she was quite young when she was about 11.

368
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.400
And so I think that even though we had this great upbringing,
my dad's a dentist,

369
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:55.950
my mom is an orthodontist and,
and so,
you know,

370
00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.540
I don't think that we felt any sense of,
you know,
hey were,

371
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.850
were impoverished.
Uh,
but you know,

372
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:05.700
I'd look around in the town that we grew up in,
which was Greenwich,
Connecticut,

373
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.600
and there were certainly people with way more than what we had.
And,
um,

374
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:13.320
so I was always aware of that juxtaposition that,
you know,
we were fine,

375
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.790
but there was a lot more to be achieved.
But I think,
um,
you know,

376
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:21.630
having the recognition that your,
your grandparents lost everything,

377
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.830
including family members,
um,
and every possession in the Holocaust,

378
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:30.480
there was this kind of mentality,
I guess just ingrained in us.

379
00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:33.460
This is kind of like immigrant mentality of,
um,

380
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.840
you got to work for everything that you're going to go out and achieve.
And so,

381
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.170
you know,
in the teenage mind it was gotten,
make a lot of money and,

382
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:43.410
and hedge funds and kind of the world of finance was the best way to accomplish

383
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:46.620
that.
And so that was the path I was on it.
But when I was 21,

384
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.740
I went on semester at sea and just had this series of life changing experiences

385
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.160
through exposure to the developing world.
And I realized,
you know,

386
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:59.161
the actual purpose for my life is to try and bring as much positivity and

387
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:03.670
wellbeing into the world as I can.
Um,
and uh,
you know,

388
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.340
enabling others to reach their full potential,

389
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:10.030
which education I believe does most,
um,
is the path that I pursued since then.

390
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.270
And how would you advise somebody who's maybe in that situation where they're,

391
00:21:14.271 --> 00:21:18.280
they're kind of on the linear path to success to,
to break out of it?

392
00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:19.240
Is it kind of,
you know,

393
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:22.040
getting out there and seeing the undeveloped world or you don't?

394
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.430
My advice has always been,
um,

395
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.410
that true self discovery begins where your comfort zone is.
And so,
you know,
the,

396
00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:33.850
the surest way to get to that place where you feel most alive,

397
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:37.150
where you have this deep ingrained sense of purpose,
uh,

398
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.470
is by leaving your current comfort zone.
And for some it's physical,
a relocation,

399
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:44.320
you know,
go travel.
And you go on a trip to kind of remote part of the world.

400
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.730
But I don't think that's necessary.

401
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:49.240
I mean in other capacities it's changing the relationships around you.
Uh,

402
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:53.140
it's changing what your day to day actual kind of routine looks like,
you know,

403
00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:56.080
exposure to new hobbies that you never thought that you'd actually be interested

404
00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:56.950
in.
Um,

405
00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.270
all of those things I think help us get unstuck from kind of what we are and

406
00:22:01.271 --> 00:22:05.530
what people in society and norms dictate we're supposed to be into who we truly

407
00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:08.490
are.
Um,
and then the,
the final thing is,
uh,

408
00:22:08.491 --> 00:22:11.560
I think you can just learn from the template of others before you.

409
00:22:11.561 --> 00:22:12.940
And so that means reading books.

410
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:17.050
I listened to a ton of podcasts and a lot of those podcasts are just interviews.

411
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.610
Uh,
on my way here today.

412
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:23.110
I was listening to an interview with the founder of Patagonia and it was just so

413
00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:25.180
inspiring for me over the last hour or so,

414
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.860
hearing how different this person's path was and the decisions that he's made

415
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:30.431
historically.

416
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:34.300
And it helped me reframe the way that I might want to dictate some of the

417
00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:37.500
decisions in my life as well.
And,
uh,

418
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.790
I want to touch on pencils of promise briefly.

419
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:44.110
I want to focus on mission you today,
but where it's pencils of promise at,

420
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:48.340
how involved are you in,
what's,
what's the plan for it going forward?
Sure.
Uh,

421
00:22:48.341 --> 00:22:52.540
so pencils of promise is,
uh,
about 130 fulltime staff globally,
uh,

422
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:56.350
operating in four different countries,
New York being the headquarter,

423
00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:59.230
but the vast majority of our staff is from the countries in which they work.

424
00:22:59.231 --> 00:23:01.990
They're gay and they're loud.
They're,
they're Guatemalan.
Um,

425
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.690
we do have 20 schools in Nicaragua that we built originally.

426
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.430
We decided not to continue expanding their,

427
00:23:06.431 --> 00:23:09.460
so we support that through a partnership on the ground.
Uh,

428
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:13.960
we had our single biggest growth year ever in 2017,
uh,
which is hugely exciting.

429
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:17.950
And my role is,
is founder and board Ameritas,
which means that,
uh,

430
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:20.950
I'm still involved but not on a day to day active basis.

431
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:25.330
Decisions don't need to go through me,
uh,
in order to be made an executed.

432
00:23:25.331 --> 00:23:28.650
But I tend to be kind of the lightning rod for inbound interest.

433
00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.150
People read the book and they'll reach out and then I can funnel those

434
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:34.390
relationships to the organization.
I still host our annual gala,

435
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.960
which this past year raised a to pour over $2 million in a night.
Um,

436
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.970
so I'm still very involved but not on a day to day fulltime role.

437
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.040
Whereas most of my,
my,
uh,
kind of to day thinking is on

438
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.870
<v 1>mission.
Yeah.
We have over $1 trillion in student debt in this country.</v>

439
00:23:50.871 --> 00:23:55.130
It might even be fortunately one point 4 trillion,
which is,
which is crazy.
Um,

440
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.480
I remember reading a blog post maybe in 2008 or nine by Mark Cuban actually

441
00:23:59.481 --> 00:23:59.900
talking,

442
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.070
kind of comparing a student debt issued to the housing bubble saying we have an

443
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:07.550
education bubble because students literally are taking out all this money and

444
00:24:07.551 --> 00:24:12.460
they can't flip it for a profit.
Just like you would flip a home for a profit.
Um,

445
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.420
how exactly is mission you solving this?

446
00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:19.800
<v 3>Um,
you know,
from spending all the time focused on international education?</v>

447
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.431
Uh,

448
00:24:20.431 --> 00:24:24.900
one thing that I've really seen and absorbed is that in order to create systemic

449
00:24:24.901 --> 00:24:29.670
change,
need two things to happen.
Um,
the first is you need innovation,

450
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:30.870
right?
And that innovation,

451
00:24:30.871 --> 00:24:33.960
if you've read Clayton Christianson's innovator's dilemma,
uh,

452
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.090
it occurs on the fringes,
right?
It's not mainstream.

453
00:24:36.091 --> 00:24:39.720
It's kind of these outside smaller players that start out really small and

454
00:24:39.721 --> 00:24:42.960
they're so small and they're working on something kind of so unique that you're

455
00:24:42.961 --> 00:24:45.630
large incumbents literally don't even pay attention even though if they had

456
00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.290
replicated,
they could've squashed them.
And,
um,
you know,

457
00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:52.620
what oftentimes occurs in systemic change is that as that innovator on the

458
00:24:52.621 --> 00:24:55.290
fringe gets a demonstration of success,

459
00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.440
what you actually need is widespread policy adoption and advocacy that leads to

460
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.910
a scaled impact.
And so,
uh,
my goal in particular when it comes to mission,

461
00:25:05.911 --> 00:25:06.721
you a,

462
00:25:06.721 --> 00:25:10.800
is for us to be that innovator on the fringe that demonstrate success and then

463
00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:13.920
eventually has policy adoption at the national level.

464
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.880
And then essentially what the US does,
a lot of countries obviously follow.

465
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:22.170
So a small example would be the fact that we're using a 100% income share

466
00:25:22.171 --> 00:25:24.400
agreement rather than traditional tuition.
Uh,

467
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.990
the fact that we're doing that is putting a lot of pressure on traditional

468
00:25:27.991 --> 00:25:29.040
colleges to respond.

469
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:34.020
And my hope is I don't expect to see every college be 100% Isa income share

470
00:25:34.021 --> 00:25:34.381
agreement.

471
00:25:34.381 --> 00:25:38.550
But what I do so expect to see is for colleges to be expected to start to have

472
00:25:38.551 --> 00:25:42.930
some skin in the game and eventually for policy to actually mandate that,
um,

473
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.140
you know,
for students not to be required to pay back until they reach a certain

474
00:25:46.141 --> 00:25:49.860
threshold,
which is actually the national policy and uh,
countries like Australia,

475
00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:50.790
um,

476
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.090
as well as this blended learning model to be demonstrated as a proof of one by

477
00:25:54.091 --> 00:25:57.540
us.
There's other companies that are doing it and doing it with great success and

478
00:25:57.541 --> 00:26:01.170
for then that to get adopted by a lot of the mainstream incumbents as well as

479
00:26:01.171 --> 00:26:02.004
policy.

480
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.310
<v 1>Now you started out with pencils of promise,</v>

481
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.320
kind of focusing on accessibility and getting as many students around the world

482
00:26:09.721 --> 00:26:12.400
kind of educated as possible.
Uh,

483
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:17.100
Peter Teal talks about the current college education system and he says it's

484
00:26:17.101 --> 00:26:18.460
almost like a nightclub.
Like if you,

485
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.210
if you expand it and allow more people in yeah,

486
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:27.420
there'll be very angry because basically it's their bread and butter.
Exactly.

487
00:26:27.421 --> 00:26:31.290
Exclusivity.
So how do you reconcile those two things?

488
00:26:31.291 --> 00:26:36.030
Kind of it's this social credential where prestigious,
maybe semi important,

489
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.410
uh,
along with accessibility in reaching as many people as possible.
Yeah,
so,
so

490
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.840
<v 3>this is a big thing for us and it's currently a,</v>

491
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.530
that we're addressing through scale.
So,
um,
you know,
we launched,
uh,

492
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.210
March,
2017 we said,
we're open,
this is mission,
you know,
and,
and you know,

493
00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:53.340
really had any public exposure to it.

494
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.920
We asked everyone that knew about it to not talk about it until we were ready to

495
00:26:55.921 --> 00:26:59.620
launch.
And we launched March 21st,
2017 and we said,
this is mission you,

496
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.920
you can apply as of today.
And,
uh,

497
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:04.380
we spend no money on any form of paid marketing.
And we said,

498
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:06.000
we just want to see organically what happens.

499
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.660
And I did interviews and podcasts and stuff and press picked it up.
But you know,

500
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.190
we didn't know targeted marketing.

501
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.520
So we allow the message to spread to the places where it might spread naturally.

502
00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:17.450
And we said,
you know,
we have 25 spots per cohort.
Uh,

503
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.900
we'll just see how many people apply.

504
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.760
And we had 4,700 applicants for the first 25 spots in about two and a half month

505
00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:27.780
period.
And we said,
oh my gosh,
there's,

506
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:32.310
there's some lightening in a bottle here.
And our goal is that to be,
uh,

507
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.210
the most exclusive selective higher education program in the country,

508
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.560
which statistically we are right now,

509
00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:41.080
we have a essentially a 0.5% acceptance rate.
Um,

510
00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.720
we don't want it to be that.
Um,
but we are in at the moment.
So we said,
you know,

511
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:48.990
one,
we need to go out and raise more capital so that we can offer,
um,
you know,

512
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:50.910
additional cohorts.
We don't want to change the cohort size.

513
00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:54.450
We think about 25 is the best number for people to build those tight

514
00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:57.720
relationships,
to have the right ratio to instructors.
Um,

515
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.530
but we needed to have additional times in the year when people could apply

516
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.920
concurrently launched cohorts,
uh,
at the same time in the same cities,

517
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:08.580
expand to new cities as well as offer new majors.
So we went out,

518
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.860
we raised another round of capital from some incredible people.
And uh,

519
00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.150
then we opened up admissions for January and we said,
okay,

520
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:18.810
you can apply for January and we had 5,500 people apply for those spots and now

521
00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:23.610
we're running admissions for May and,
and so,
um,
again,
uh,

522
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.990
we acknowledge that this is a real challenge in higher ed and our goal is to try

523
00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:30.480
and scale quickly to serve that need.
But at the same time,

524
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.110
we want to create a truly world class,
high quality experience for every student.

525
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.470
And we know that we need to start slowly and test out this model.

526
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.960
And once it's really tightly refined on the curricular side,

527
00:28:39.961 --> 00:28:43.290
on the student experience side,
then scale really,
really rapidly.
I mean,

528
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:45.270
our goal is to serve tens of thousands of students,

529
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.800
ideally be larger than any current college in the country.
Awesome.
Uh,

530
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.340
what does the real world approach me and you guys talk about kind of teaching

531
00:28:53.341 --> 00:28:57.420
practical skills as opposed to maybe more theoretical ones.
Yeah.
Um,

532
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:58.531
so first of all,

533
00:28:58.531 --> 00:29:03.060
I mean it means having a really tight pulse on what's happening in industry.
Um,

534
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:05.580
so designing and building curriculum in a vacuum,

535
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.790
having to go through a three to four year accreditation process and then saying

536
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:12.030
you should go learn this as all of you I'm sure experience on a day to day basis

537
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:14.790
here at a place like Google is going to leave you well behind what's actually

538
00:29:14.791 --> 00:29:17.990
needed to solve the needs of industry.
So part of it is,

539
00:29:17.991 --> 00:29:20.450
is having these deep relationships with folks,
uh,

540
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.850
ed companies to understand what's needed to actually hit the ground running.

541
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:29.210
The second is I think a profound acknowledgement that you need to bring that

542
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:35.100
real world into the curricular design.
And so as I mentioned,
we have our,
I mean,

543
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.980
I went to a great college and I loved my experience,

544
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:43.460
but I don't think more than once did I ever get exposure to a public speaker who

545
00:29:43.961 --> 00:29:46.330
came in and addressed the class that I was in a,

546
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:49.750
that actually was working at a company.
Um,
it was so rare.

547
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.130
And so for our students,
I mean,
you know,
last week the global head of,
uh,

548
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.410
artist marketing and Spotify spent an hour just with a group of 30 students and

549
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:59.920
then that's like on a weekly basis a top tier person comes in and addresses
them.

550
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.040
Um,
but then the second is actually teaching them things that,

551
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.580
that are going to be applicable to getting a great job to navigating their

552
00:30:06.581 --> 00:30:09.430
personal life as well.
So we teach personal finance.
I mean,

553
00:30:09.431 --> 00:30:12.820
how many people here got like a deep introduction to personal finance,

554
00:30:12.821 --> 00:30:17.230
how you actually navigate your financial scenario once you leave the bounds of

555
00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:20.320
your educational experience.
I mean,
everyone's nodding their head no.

556
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.380
So things like that we have,
we have,
um,
you know,

557
00:30:23.381 --> 00:30:25.090
the class will be called success by design,

558
00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:27.550
which is really about finding your internal happiness.

559
00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:30.000
Where do you want to punch your compass in life and why,
you know,

560
00:30:30.001 --> 00:30:33.460
all of those things are I think are applicable to a real world context.

561
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:34.630
And then finally,
uh,

562
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:37.480
our students work on projects that are based on real world scenario.

563
00:30:37.481 --> 00:30:38.620
So we'll get,
you know,

564
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:42.070
dummy data from real companies that are facing a real challenge.

565
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:44.350
Our students will work through that,
produce a final project,

566
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.270
and then after they ship it,
they can,

567
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.580
one publicly presented as part of their portfolio.

568
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.760
But oftentimes they actually get to present it to somebody who has worked on

569
00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:55.570
that real project at that real company and they get that cycle of feedback.
Um,

570
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.450
and then the final part is just the,

571
00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:01.630
the back third of the years is actually working full time at a great company a

572
00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:04.850
or organization and then getting additional curricular support,
uh,

573
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.150
from us throughout that process.
Yeah.

574
00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.530
One of the perks we have here at Google is we get to kind of like speak to

575
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:16.531
financial advisors and I think this was my first job out of school and like I

576
00:31:16.661 --> 00:31:19.300
didn't know anything.
Yeah.
And I think most people don't know,
right.

577
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.310
They don't know how to flow oneK is,
yeah.

578
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:24.580
I mean one of the things that we teach our students is a salary negotiation.

579
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.890
And uh,

580
00:31:25.891 --> 00:31:30.520
I remember sitting with a reporter from a major media company explaining that

581
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.700
and she was in her mid thirties and she said,
Geez,
I wish I got that.

582
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.590
And so we think it's important to,
our students range from 18 to 39,
you know,
um,

583
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.780
some of them have transferred in from top tier colleges,

584
00:31:40.781 --> 00:31:44.440
some of them have bachelor's degrees.
Uh,
most of them have some type of college,

585
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:46.330
but not a ba yet.
And are looking out and saying,

586
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.840
why would I take on this much more debt to get this piece of paper that isn't

587
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:52.210
actually going to be of greatest value?
Where as mission you will be,

588
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.920
there seems to be a special interest rate now on learning how to learn.

589
00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.800
That's actually the most popular course on Coursera right now.
Barbara,

590
00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:04.420
Barbara Oakley,
uh,
teaches it.
Do you guys incorporate,
uh,
kind of,
uh,

591
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:05.960
the most recent,
uh,

592
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.500
kind of neuroscientific findings and findings about just how to learn and how,

593
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:14.220
how cognition and kind of,
uh,
happens in mission yet?
Yeah.
Um,

594
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.630
this is the obsession of my cofounder Mike.
So,

595
00:32:16.631 --> 00:32:20.830
so is our chief product officer and he oversees both curriculum and technologies

596
00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:22.420
are work cost software engineer as well.

597
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.970
So all the stuff that you were seeing on Google,
he's,

598
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:29.590
he's overseen and design with Jen who you heard.
Um,
and uh,
yeah,

599
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:32.740
I mean if you saw the slack channels of our team,

600
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:35.800
like you would just think these people are the biggest education nerds in the

601
00:32:35.801 --> 00:32:39.980
world.
Um,
so,
so yeah,
we obsessed and kind of geek out that stuff.
And then,

602
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:40.521
you know,

603
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:44.160
we have incredible advisors like doctor Tony Wagner from Harvard or from,
Oh,

604
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.690
mom froze lecture at Stanford.
And,
um,
so we're,

605
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:51.290
we're constantly kind of digging into the latest learning science,
you know,

606
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.300
part of that,
uh,
applies into how the actual structure of the program looks.

607
00:32:55.301 --> 00:32:58.520
So for example,
we tell every student,
um,
that,

608
00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.970
and so one thing that I'll share is I actually call every student when they get

609
00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:02.300
in.

610
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.500
So the actual admissions acceptance as me calling them a kind of as a surprise

611
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.710
and you know,
they always answer and how he was calling and I say,

612
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:13.170
it's Adam Braun,
I'm from Michigan.
And then they're like,
oh,
hi,
how's it gone?

613
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:16.880
What's up?
And then I'll say,
how's your day?
And they say it's good.

614
00:33:16.881 --> 00:33:17.570
And they'll say,
okay,

615
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.400
well hopefully it's a lot better because I wanted to share with you that you got

616
00:33:20.401 --> 00:33:22.860
to and they're all excited.
And then I kind of walk them through,
Hey,

617
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.680
here's the next steps.
Here is your orientation date.

618
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:27.620
We'll send you a email and rep,
you know,
a repeat,
a lot of this stuff,

619
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:28.700
so you have it in writing.

620
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.250
But I want to get them comfortable with a couple of the high level details.

621
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:34.370
And one thing I share is that you can work a part time job while you're going

622
00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:36.680
through our program,
but you can't exceed 20 hours a week.

623
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.300
And that's grounded in learning science.

624
00:33:38.301 --> 00:33:43.280
That shows that if you exceed 20 hours a week of a job while you're trying to

625
00:33:43.281 --> 00:33:45.470
focus on a primary academic commitment,
uh,

626
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.690
your success in that program really falls off the map.

627
00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:49.340
So things like that are applicable for us

628
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:55.290
<v 1>and kind of reconciling teaching practical skills and emphasizing that with just</v>

629
00:33:56.171 --> 00:33:58.510
a liberal arts education to begin with.

630
00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.570
I can imagine where you kind of fall on that,
but you know,

631
00:34:01.571 --> 00:34:05.140
there are people like Fareed Zakaria who talk about the loss of like liberal

632
00:34:05.141 --> 00:34:06.340
arts education in the country.

633
00:34:06.341 --> 00:34:10.030
I went to Columbia and I'm still trying to figure out whether,
you know,

634
00:34:10.031 --> 00:34:13.780
reading Plato like helps me every day.
But um,
uh,
yeah.

635
00:34:13.781 --> 00:34:16.660
Where do you kind of stand on that?
Yeah,
I mean,
um,

636
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:18.710
<v 3>my belief on this is very firm.</v>

637
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:23.390
I think there's tremendous value in the ideals behind a liberal arts education.

638
00:34:23.391 --> 00:34:27.700
So self discovery,
uh,
critical thinking,
reasoning,
uh,

639
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.350
morality.
All of these things are really,

640
00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:33.010
really essential as part of a formative education.
Uh,

641
00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:37.280
the problem is those things are actually not taught in a meaningful capacity and

642
00:34:37.281 --> 00:34:40.040
the vast majority of liberal arts programs in this country,

643
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:43.190
what liberal arts has kind of become his general education,

644
00:34:43.191 --> 00:34:46.550
where you're just asked to read a series of texts and suddenly you're supposed

645
00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:50.300
to be expected to achieve these things.
So some schools do it well,
but very few.

646
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:54.770
Um,
the two places that I think that it's best to achieve our through two courses

647
00:34:54.771 --> 00:34:56.930
that are taught at Stanford,
one is called designing your life.

648
00:34:56.931 --> 00:35:01.280
It's the most popular class in Undergrad,
uh,
at,
at Stanford.
And then the second,

649
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.420
uh,
is called interpersonal dynamics taught at Stanford GSB,

650
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:09.290
but no one is touchy feely.
And if anyone here has gone to GSB,
uh,

651
00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:10.670
or know someone that's gone to GSB,

652
00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:13.550
this is the course that they will say is the most transformative in their life.

653
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.450
And so we actually have former lectures from those two courses were full time on

654
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:21.830
staff a admission.
You,
uh,
and our students go through something that is very,

655
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:26.180
very similar.
Uh,
we call it a I labs are similar to the tea groups there.

656
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.510
And when you mix that with the hard technical skills,

657
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.810
that's actually when you create a really profound transformation in an

658
00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:33.530
individual.

659
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.500
So I think it's important that we incorporate the ideals of the liberal arts,

660
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.440
but that you mix it with the actual a hard and soft skills that will help

661
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:42.650
somebody get a job right to,

662
00:35:42.651 --> 00:35:45.630
to pay back the debt that they've taken on if they'd gone a traditional liberal

663
00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:48.780
arts school.
Um,
and,
and we really seek to blend that emission.
Yeah.

664
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:54.140
So is that really how you kind of stay away from being like considered like a

665
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:58.110
trade school?
Because there are a lot of circles out there.
They're like,
uh,

666
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.860
I don't like my career right now and so I'll switch and I'll go to this school.

667
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:03.810
And then,
you know,
it's just kind of a pivot.
Right.

668
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.960
Is that how you kind of stray away from that by having these kinds of stuff?

669
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:07.620
I mean,

670
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.890
I think what we've seen is there's a lot of schools that are out there that are

671
00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:14.820
very effective at helping you get into a new industry and lock in a first job.

672
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.190
That's not our goal,
right?
Our,

673
00:36:16.191 --> 00:36:20.430
our students only send us a dollar if they're successful.
Uh,
you know,

674
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:23.100
not only in getting the job but they need to be successful for three plus years.

675
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.020
Right.
And,
and so,
you know,

676
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:27.900
we want to prepare them for an extraordinary life and career ahead.

677
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.480
And part of that is learning this hard technical skill,

678
00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:34.260
but actually a much bigger part is the soft skills and that holistic self

679
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:37.530
development.
If you spoke to any student that's at Michigan,
you,
uh,
they'll,

680
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.580
they'll say that they needed one to be able to succeed in the other,

681
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:42.930
that when they really hit that,

682
00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:46.380
that kind of sticking point and learning python or sequel or excel modeling,

683
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.200
it's actually the group discussion that will happen in I lab.

684
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.300
It gives them the confidence and the,
you know,

685
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:53.790
self awareness to be able to progress through those challenges.

686
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.180
Do you have kind of like a,
a 10 year game plan for a mission?
You,

687
00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:58.960
it seems like right now,
uh,

688
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:03.030
you might be going kind of the Uber Tesla model where you start kind of premium

689
00:37:03.031 --> 00:37:07.590
and then you'd kind of widened out.
Uh,
what's the,
what's the plan?
Yeah,
so,

690
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.350
um,
one,
I mean,
pencils of promise is in its 10th year.

691
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.290
And if you would've told me at the beginning when I was trying to build one

692
00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:18.291
school and riding my motorbike with a backpack and rollouts by myself that this

693
00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:22.410
year we'd likely break ground in our 500 school,
I would have said that's insane.

694
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.700
And so,
um,
you know,
I think it's challenging to project 10 years out that said,

695
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.361
you know,
the,

696
00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:31.380
the ambition is certainly within 10 years for us to be in dozens of cities.

697
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:35.070
Again,
everyone lives within 50 miles,
so they can come together frequently.
But,

698
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:35.700
uh,

699
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.560
the 50 mile radius allows for more affordability than just having to be close to

700
00:37:39.561 --> 00:37:43.800
a downtown campus.
Um,
so it will be in dozens of cities will be offering,

701
00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:48.690
I would imagine,
10 plus majors.
Um,
and you know,
I think 10 years from now,

702
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.380
uh,
parents and children,
uh,

703
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.950
will essentially look at mission you and I assume others will follow our lead

704
00:37:55.951 --> 00:38:00.300
and create similar types of programs and it will be a real consideration for

705
00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:02.910
every student that you know,
is considering college,

706
00:38:02.911 --> 00:38:06.830
whether they're scratching out of highschool and mid career.
A working adult,
um,

707
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.290
is,
do I go to the one of these traditional four to six years that's a little bit

708
00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:13.240
outdated or do I go through something like a mission,
you know,

709
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.840
and it'll just be part of the landscape of higher education.

710
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.070
And Are you convinced that going forward a classroom is the best kind of medium

711
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:24.720
or setting to learn?
Um,
I,
I think it depends on how you define a classroom.

712
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:29.790
So,
you know,
a classroom does not need to have four physical walls around it.
Uh,

713
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.320
if I showed you,
you know,
the engagement of our students,
um,

714
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.460
it looks like a Brady bunch style,
you know,
set of screens.
Um,

715
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.460
our admissions process actually replicates that through a group challenge where

716
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:42.340
we have total strangers design,
uh,
actually on,

717
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.430
on a Google drive.
Uh,

718
00:38:45.431 --> 00:38:48.370
we give them an ambiguous challenge and then they actually build a presentation

719
00:38:48.371 --> 00:38:51.710
in Google sheets together in 45 minutes and presented to our staffing or call

720
00:38:51.711 --> 00:38:56.130
the whole thing on zoom and go and watch it back.
And so,
um,
you know,

721
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.420
I think that to me is a version of a classroom.

722
00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:02.320
What I would say is a medium through which individuals are able to communicate

723
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:05.140
in a live synchronous manner,
uh,
with intimacy.

724
00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:07.480
And honesty is the best way to learn.
It's,

725
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:11.500
it's certainly better than doing it by yourself unless you have a direct tutor.

726
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:11.861
Um,

727
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:15.640
so some type of human engagement and that can be a classroom and sorts you and

728
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:18.100
another person.
Um,
and you know,

729
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:21.000
I don't think that large lecture halls are the way to do it.
Uh,

730
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.890
but I do think that there's tremendous power in these small group,

731
00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:27.610
cohort based formats in particular behind a screen where everything is being

732
00:39:27.611 --> 00:39:29.860
recorded and where you truly feel accountable.

733
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.210
I want to move on to you briefly before we open it up to Q.
And.
A.
Um,

734
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.750
are there kind of habits or philosophies that kind of helped you just perform at

735
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:41.760
a high level every day?
I'm sure.
I mean,
this has evolved,
you know,
in,

736
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:42.820
in my twenties,

737
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:45.970
it was like just putting in as much work as I can and try and respond to

738
00:39:45.971 --> 00:39:48.070
everything as fast as I can and,
you know,

739
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:51.880
make the most of every opportunity and like,
I'll sleep when I'm dead.
You know,

740
00:39:51.881 --> 00:39:55.960
that was kind of my approach.
Um,
I think now in my thirties and with,
you know,

741
00:39:55.961 --> 00:40:00.280
a wife and two kids,
uh,
I've really learned the value of self care.

742
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.780
And so,
uh,
for example,
if I work out consistently in a given week,

743
00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:06.550
I out in bike and I play basketball,

744
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.960
then I actually performed much better in the office.
Uh,

745
00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:14.080
if I'm able to meditate for 10 or 15 minutes before the babies are up,

746
00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:16.840
and then my house like goes into,
you know,
all hell breaking loose,

747
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.450
then I feel much more grounded throughout the day.
Uh,
I use an APP called Kaptio,

748
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.110
which allows me to just send a quick notes to myself and my inbox tends to be my

749
00:40:26.111 --> 00:40:30.620
to do list.
And so I try and practice inbox zero or some form of it.
Um,

750
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.820
and then the other I think is just treating people the way that you would want

751
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:38.200
to be treated,
right?
Building a culture that really values people as people,

752
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:41.600
not just as numbers on your,
uh,
you know,
excel sheet of headcount,

753
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.520
roadmaps are your org chart.
Um,

754
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.170
and really focus on growing those people into the best performing individuals

755
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:50.410
that they can and the best people that they can lead to.

756
00:40:50.411 --> 00:40:53.650
A really rewarding work environment and something that you're excited to go into

757
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:58.160
everyday.
What's your why?
What's the thing that your eyes yeah.

758
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:03.370
Um,
you know,
my,
my why is quite simply that,

759
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:07.330
um,
by every statistical measure,
I shouldn't be here,
right?
I mean,

760
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.470
my grandparents were meant to pass away in those concentration camps.

761
00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.340
If anyone's read my book on semester at sea,
my,

762
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.040
my cruise ship was hit by a 60 foot rogue wave 800 miles from land.

763
00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:21.550
And we had this titanic esque experience where I was supposed to die that day

764
00:41:21.551 --> 00:41:23.680
and somehow I didn't.
And uh,

765
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.710
so I genuinely feel like this life for me is one in a trillion.

766
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.110
Um,
and so I need to do everything that I can to that,
uh,

767
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.870
and you know,
both leave,
uh,

768
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.980
the most positive mark that I can on as many people as possible.

769
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.150
And now as a new father,
uh,
I realized that at the same time,

770
00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:48.050
I have to balance that with the fact that the greatest mark that I can leave on

771
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:52.340
the world is producing great children and being a great husband and great father

772
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:55.300
and siblings.
Um,
so,
so those are the two things for me.
You know,

773
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.470
this kind of big scale of ambition,
uh,

774
00:41:57.471 --> 00:42:01.010
with this very small one that I'm most happy when I'm just hanging out with my

775
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:02.210
kids and their little bro.

776
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.110
Do you have mentors or role models who have really helped you and affected you

777
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:06.990
throughout?
Yeah,
I mean,

778
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:11.480
I've had a bunch of mentors that I've kind of gathered over the years.

779
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.480
Um,
you know,
one of them is a guy named Ray Chambers who,
uh,

780
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.280
is probably most responsible in the world for eradication of malaria.
Uh,

781
00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:23.130
became a billionaire,
really started the leverage buyout space.
And,
um,

782
00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.480
I was at lunch and one point with a guy named Randall Lane who was the editor in

783
00:42:26.481 --> 00:42:29.810
chief of Forbes.
And he told me that maybe 15 or 20 years,

784
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:32.720
and I can remember how long,
but he was,
you know,
not the editor in chief,

785
00:42:32.721 --> 00:42:36.980
but he was running the Forbes 400 kind of lists that as his function at the

786
00:42:36.981 --> 00:42:39.140
company and Ray Chambers is on the list.

787
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.260
And he got to call the next day after I came out and this guy said,

788
00:42:42.261 --> 00:42:44.930
how do I get off the list?
I don't want to be on it.
And he said,
well,

789
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:46.940
you either have to lose the money or give it away,

790
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:49.550
but we're going to report it if you're that wealthy.
He said,
all right,

791
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:53.900
I'll be off by next year.
Um,
any committed his life to humanitarian work.

792
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.410
And so,
uh,
he's,
he's been an incredible mentor.
And then,
you know,

793
00:42:57.411 --> 00:43:00.160
certainly my family members,
I mean,
you know,
my dad,
my mom,

794
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.340
my sister and my brother are there.

795
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.740
They're the people as well as my wife that I talked to most about these

796
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:04.574
decisions.

797
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.120
<v 1>Speaking of your family,
have a very high achieving family.
Your,
your,
uh,</v>

798
00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:12.730
Adam's brother actually manages a Justin Bieber among many other artists.
Yeah.

799
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.260
A lot of people.
A lot of people.
That's right.
Uh,

800
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:19.310
do you ever get competitive with scooter about anything you guys took?

801
00:43:19.311 --> 00:43:22.340
Couldn't have taken more different paths.
You're both very impressive people,

802
00:43:22.341 --> 00:43:23.500
but do you ever get competitive with

803
00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.620
<v 3>yeah.
Um,
you know,
as kids we were super competitive.</v>

804
00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.560
I think by the time we both had our kind of mid to late twenties,

805
00:43:29.561 --> 00:43:32.230
we realized that we were just operating in such different spaces and the,

806
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.430
the best thing that we can do is just be unbelievably proud of one another and

807
00:43:36.431 --> 00:43:37.510
try and support each other.

808
00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.140
I think if you went to a Saturday morning basketball game or where you're

809
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:44.020
playing on opposite teams,
you would see us pretty competitive.
Um,

810
00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:47.650
but in most things we just try and support one another as much as we can.

811
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.160
<v 1>Awesome.
Uh,
do you guys have any questions?
Let's open it up for Q and.</v>

812
00:43:52.161 --> 00:43:55.250
A and if you do,
please go to that mic right over there.

813
00:43:55.790 --> 00:44:00.490
<v 6>Hi.
I resonated with a lot of what you said.
Ah,
thanks for speaking.
Um,</v>

814
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:04.610
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind sharing with us some things that you tried

815
00:44:04.611 --> 00:44:07.820
or thought that might work but ended up not working out.

816
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:13.360
<v 3>Sure.
Um,
I mean at,
at pencils of promise,
you know,</v>

817
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:16.820
Nicaragua was the second country that we tried to expand into.
Um,

818
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.410
and I'm built a partnership with an organization there.

819
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:23.120
They kind of showed me the lay of the land.
We sent a small team down,
um,

820
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:27.060
and it ultimately wasn't successful for two reasons.
The first was,
uh,

821
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.180
the government was incredibly challenging.
You know,

822
00:44:29.181 --> 00:44:32.280
we need to work with supportive governments because we built public schools.
Uh,

823
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:35.700
the second though was we did this deep analysis and the population density was

824
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:38.220
very low and the cost of materials is very high.

825
00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:41.880
So we saw it was it was two to three x more expensive to impact the same number

826
00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:45.330
of lives and that country.
Then it wasn't the other,
eventually,
you know,

827
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.630
three to four other countries where we were working.
Um,

828
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.330
and that was really tough,
right?
I mean,
you know,
you starting to country,

829
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.450
you actually make a commitment,
you build 20 schools and then you have to say,
ah,

830
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:57.590
we're not going to continue to expand and build our own teams there.
That,

831
00:44:57.591 --> 00:44:58.411
that was really hard.

832
00:44:58.411 --> 00:45:02.550
But I think it forced an organizational discipline at pencils of promise.
Uh,

833
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.580
for sure.
You know,
with,
um,
mission you,
I mean,

834
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:09.210
anyone who likes our pitch deck before there was even a company when it was just

835
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:13.290
like a seed of an idea would tell you that the way it looks today is remarkably

836
00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:15.660
similar.
There's only been one meaningful change.

837
00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:18.800
And that's that originally we said we're going to have four quarters,
uh,

838
00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.690
and those quarters we're going to be hard skills in the first quarter of SEC,

839
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.660
a soft skills and the second technical and the third and then real world in the

840
00:45:24.661 --> 00:45:25.350
fourth.

841
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:29.130
And we realized right away that you actually can't divorce hard skills and soft

842
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:30.990
skills that they need to be taught in conjunction.

843
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.710
And so we moved over to a trimester model where that,

844
00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.580
that first trimester is a deep dive on the foundation.
Um,
and so a lot of it is,

845
00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.100
is like that lean kind of mentality that test and iterate and get feedback from

846
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:42.690
your consumers.

847
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.570
<v 7>Yeah,
thanks so much for coming.</v>

848
00:45:47.571 --> 00:45:50.850
It's very inspiring talk and I think this mission you,
um,

849
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.970
concept is a really strong one.

850
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:56.160
So I guess my general question is this,

851
00:45:56.161 --> 00:46:00.680
this problem of crushing student debt seems to be a uniquely American problem.

852
00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.050
And I was wondering if,
if you,

853
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:06.890
during your research you would look at other countries and maybe could take away

854
00:46:06.891 --> 00:46:10.190
something like either boring stuff that you could incorporate into Michigan you

855
00:46:10.191 --> 00:46:11.540
or are there any,

856
00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.920
this is sort of a private sector solution to the education problem and is there

857
00:46:15.921 --> 00:46:20.921
any role for the u s government that's could lead to better informing the

858
00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:23.870
education system or solving a problem?
That one sentence.

859
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.050
<v 3>Absolutely.
Um,
so,
so right now,</v>

860
00:46:26.051 --> 00:46:29.680
and there's a new bill that's being formed that's probably the most significant,

861
00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.750
uh,
restructuring of a higher education funding in the last 40 years.

862
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.120
So they're overhauling essentially the higher education act.

863
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.740
And there's some stuff in there that I agree with.

864
00:46:38.741 --> 00:46:42.040
There's some stuff that I don't,
um,
but I think it directly,

865
00:46:42.041 --> 00:46:45.830
it's actually a move in the right direction.
So one of the things is,
um,

866
00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:49.660
the reason that we're in the position that we're in is a series of factors.

867
00:46:49.661 --> 00:46:53.380
But one of the important ones that the government has enabled is that an

868
00:46:53.381 --> 00:46:57.220
individual can essentially take out an unlimited line of credit at a very young

869
00:46:57.221 --> 00:47:00.310
age without any demonstrated capacity to be able to pay that back.

870
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.620
And we have this society that's kind of,
you know,

871
00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:06.160
encouraged through just societal norms and expectations that you should do that.

872
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:11.490
And so one thing that's happened as a result is that there's no market force

873
00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.360
that's creating downward pressure on how much colleges can charge or any

874
00:47:16.361 --> 00:47:20.530
accountability to the value of that college relative to the cost.
So,

875
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.690
for example,
I can think of many,

876
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.350
not very good colleges that have terrible outcomes that charged the same amount,

877
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.720
uh,
as a school like Harvard.
Right?

878
00:47:28.721 --> 00:47:32.300
And so like me being a car salesman and saying to you,
here's this,
you know,

879
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.700
Lamborghini for $200,000 or you can get this really crappy old beat up car

880
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.460
that's actually not going to drive very well,
but that's $200,000 as well,

881
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:43.660
and you should buy this one too.
So,
uh,

882
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:47.290
I think that the government needs to one hold schools accountable to outcomes.

883
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:49.210
And the best way to do that is through skin in the game,

884
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.170
some type of income share based on student success.
Uh,

885
00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.900
the second is to actually realistically put a limit on how much a student can

886
00:47:55.901 --> 00:47:59.150
borrow and when.
I think that will lead to his colleges,
uh,

887
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.430
bringing their prices down.

888
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.130
And the result of that is that a lot of colleges are going to go out of business

889
00:48:03.131 --> 00:48:05.950
because they have on sustainable business models.
And that's actually,
I think,

890
00:48:05.951 --> 00:48:07.350
a very good thing.
Um,

891
00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:12.420
we need to have market forces in place that remove bad actors that are putting

892
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.710
students in positions of peril.
And you know,

893
00:48:14.711 --> 00:48:16.960
just because you're a nonprofit college doesn't mean that you're actually

894
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:19.660
helping people.
Uh,
and there's a lot that are actually hurting people.

895
00:48:19.661 --> 00:48:24.580
So a skin in the game,
uh,
camping a total amounts that students can,
can,

896
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:26.170
uh,
can take out.

897
00:48:26.171 --> 00:48:29.620
And then the third is transparency as to how much it's actually going to cost.

898
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.540
It's very hard if you're an 18,

899
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:35.290
1940 year olds and you're applying to college to actually get the clear

900
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:38.110
information on how much it's eventually going to cost to you as well as the

901
00:48:38.111 --> 00:48:40.630
outcomes data of those colleges.
It's,
it's very convoluted.

902
00:48:40.631 --> 00:48:44.980
They hide it and Congress needs to really move forward with an effort to ensure

903
00:48:44.981 --> 00:48:46.390
greater transparency in this space.

904
00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.130
<v 8>It seems like there'd be a lot of lot of forces that would kind of be off</v>

905
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:52.880
operating against those kinds of reforms.

906
00:48:52.881 --> 00:48:55.630
Like colleges are at risk of going out of business.

907
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.680
<v 3>Definitely.
I mean,</v>

908
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:59.710
it's challenging because you have one of the most entrenched systems in our

909
00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:03.740
culture,
uh,
as well as our capital allocation in the country.
Um,

910
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.060
but what it's led to is a,
a position that's completely unsustainable.
I mean,

911
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:12.070
I read a report from the Brookings Institute,
which is as you know,
nonpartisan,

912
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.770
objective and well researched as possible.

913
00:49:14.771 --> 00:49:19.771
That came out last week that projected that 40% of today's college students will

914
00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:24.160
default on their loans by 2030.
I mean,
it's insane.
Um,

915
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:27.640
so we need to have some type of really meaningful change.

916
00:49:27.641 --> 00:49:31.570
And as an entrepreneur I look at problems like this and I say,
um,
you know,

917
00:49:31.571 --> 00:49:32.500
if not me,
then who,

918
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:37.740
<v 8>thanks.
Hey,
thanks for the presentation.</v>

919
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.860
I think the,
uh,
problem that mission use saws,
which is about,

920
00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:47.550
uh,
how to actually deliver education in a system,

921
00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:52.551
which is not exactly a built up for the huge population is slowly going to apply

922
00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:59.990
for the kind of countries in which pencils for promise operates in.

923
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:05.060
So do you see how technology as as a medium for the instruction can be actually

924
00:50:06.451 --> 00:50:08.550
scaled to developing countries?
And

925
00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.160
<v 3>Oh yeah,
100%.
I mean,</v>

926
00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.380
<v 8>just finished my question.
And,
uh,
uh,</v>

927
00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:19.000
what exactly are the challenges that are preventing it from happening as of it?

928
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:23.370
<v 3>Okay.
Um,
so great question.
Uh,
one,</v>

929
00:50:23.371 --> 00:50:25.230
when I talk about that 10 year vision,
I mean,

930
00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.920
when I say worldly in dozens of cities,
the world,

931
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:32.300
many of them should be international.
So 18% of our applicants are international.

932
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:35.030
Uh,
you have to have a visa to work in the u s cause we need to recruit,

933
00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:39.800
raid our investment in new through,
uh,
you know,
livable wages.
And so,
um,

934
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.380
we can't take those students on currently,
but,
uh,

935
00:50:42.381 --> 00:50:45.230
we've had applicants from dozens of other countries.

936
00:50:45.231 --> 00:50:48.940
I recently gave a talk in Singapore about this and the main question from all of

937
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:52.880
these representatives of different countries was how soon can this come here?
Um,

938
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:57.050
and so we certainly have ambitions to scale globally.
I think you are right now,

939
00:50:57.051 --> 00:51:01.640
part of the challenge is the ability to deliver live synchronous education over

940
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:05.810
low bandwidth,
uh,
internet,
but that's increasing exponentially every single day.

941
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.300
Right.
Um,
and,
uh,

942
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:13.540
so I actually spent the full year in 2015 I was leading the largest,

943
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:14.540
um,

944
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.890
digital initiative called the global education platform for the UN special envoy

945
00:51:18.891 --> 00:51:21.440
for Education,
which was Gordon Brown,
the former prime minister of the UK.

946
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.230
And in that year,
what I spent,
you know,

947
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:27.490
observing and seeing was this huge proliferation of mobile,
uh,

948
00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.640
across the developing world.

949
00:51:28.641 --> 00:51:32.480
And so what I would see at scale is people being able to actually have these

950
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:36.340
experiences on mobile in the types of environments where,
you know,

951
00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:37.970
pencils of promise has historically worked.

952
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.180
<v 9>Hi,
my name is Terry.
I'm from China.</v>

953
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:45.500
We are facing the same issue in China is not worse.

954
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:49.220
So I'm shooting spider by your talk today and thank you for sharing your great

955
00:51:49.221 --> 00:51:53.690
work.
My question is simple.
If that model works for mission you,

956
00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:58.550
do you think it might work for high school as well?
Because I see,
I see no point.

957
00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:00.410
Now if we go to college,

958
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.130
peak expensive tuition and they're nothing but high school is preparing for that

959
00:52:04.131 --> 00:52:08.900
entry examination info,
nothing that's that four years,
uh,
uh,

960
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.640
greatly wasted.

961
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:14.540
So maybe we can start younger and without wasting any time and make,

962
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.450
put in Jack Hope in these children's eyes in yeah.
Heights.

963
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.450
<v 3>Yeah.
I,
I think our curricular approach,
um,</v>

964
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.520
certainly can be adopted about the high school level.

965
00:52:23.521 --> 00:52:26.040
I don't know about the income share agreement because you know,

966
00:52:26.041 --> 00:52:29.500
some people do want to work directly at the end of high school.
Um,
but you know,

967
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.580
I think the curricular approach certainly can be adopted by public and private

968
00:52:32.581 --> 00:52:33.520
schools.
Um,

969
00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.780
the kind of product base and certainly the blended learning and the technology

970
00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.240
can and should be used in that capacity as well.

971
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.150
<v 9>Uh,
I mean if the compensation,
I mean,
oh,</v>

972
00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.160
the payback part is not only measured by the income,

973
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.390
what else it could be for your success in the school.

974
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.010
<v 3>Um,
you know,</v>

975
00:52:55.011 --> 00:52:58.490
for us there's also what we would consider nps or net promoter score.

976
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:00.680
That's actually just as critical in,
in our minds.

977
00:53:00.681 --> 00:53:04.610
We need to create an environment in which our students are the single greatest

978
00:53:04.611 --> 00:53:05.900
evangelists of our program.

979
00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.970
And eventually they become really the stewards for additional innovation within

980
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.400
education.
It's what you've seen with teach for America for example,
is,
you know,

981
00:53:13.401 --> 00:53:15.230
they've certainly seen a success.

982
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:19.670
They've also had controversy but directionally incredible success.
Um,
and,
uh,

983
00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.520
not only the success within the schools in which they've taught,
but you know,

984
00:53:22.521 --> 00:53:25.500
there are alarms have gone out and become stewards for an incredible amount of

985
00:53:25.501 --> 00:53:27.570
new initiatives that have had a truly global impact.

986
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:31.110
And that that for us is absolutely critical to long term success.

987
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:37.590
Thank you guys.
I mean,
it's really an honor to be here and as I alluded to,

988
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.030
a Google really powers a lot of what we do without even a formalized partnership

989
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.720
in place just by the tools and technology that you all built.
But,
uh,

990
