<v 2>Okay.</v>

14
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.910
<v 0>Okay.
Hi everybody.
My name is a Sullivan.</v>

15
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.820
I'm a software engineer here at Google and um,

16
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.890
I am really excited to moderate this panel of people who have been able to

17
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:20.891
bridge the gap between tech and their passion because I'm a software engineer.

18
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm very passionate about coding.
Um,
but I'm also like a designer.

19
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.850
I'm a very artistic person and I like to think of coding and um,

20
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.370
all of tech in general as being a canvas because you can kind of with

21
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:37.940
programming create anything that you,
you want.

22
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.530
Everything that was PR that,
um,

23
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.290
is on youtube and everything that they've been able to accomplish is because of,

24
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.800
um,
innovators and programmers.

25
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:53.030
And people who are passionate about that.
So let's get started.

26
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.770
<v 2>Woo.</v>

27
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.180
<v 0>So can we first start off with everybody introducing themselves and um,</v>

28
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.450
saying a little bit about their background?
You can start.

29
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.220
<v 3>Yeah.
So my name is Ishmael.
May You?
Um,
I'm a digital media strategist.
Um,</v>

30
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:13.510
I also do a lot of coding.
Um,
and I've always loved fashion.

31
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.330
Fashion is actually a very new industry for me,

32
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.130
but I've always secretly been involved,
um,
for a lot of reasons,

33
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.080
um,
since I was a young kid.
And so this is really full circle for me as well.

34
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.750
<v 4>I'm Nina and I'm the founder of daily dress me where we tell you what to era</v>

35
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:36.580
based on the weather.
And this all works by using our proprietary algorithm.

36
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.300
And I started daily dressed me when I was in high school actually.

37
00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:45.130
And now I'm 23 and working on it full time.
Um,
and yeah,
that's pretty much it.

38
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.090
Hi,
my name is deleon

39
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.900
<v 0>and I'm the designer of Sierra Ramirez is a dress,</v>

40
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.500
I'm not sure if you saw it.
You see it a little bit in the,
uh,

41
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.080
in the dark to see it light up.
I a clothing line,
uh,

42
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 1>mainly dresses and gowns.
I started that 18 years ago,</v>

43
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.780
so I'm not going to tell you how old I was when I was a little younger and I

44
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:11.390
started with 10 dresses actually for Prom and within one year,
uh,

45
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.890
the line was in 1500 stores in most major department stores.

46
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.910
But I always had a dream to merge technology with fashion.

47
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.300
14 years ago actually launched the first light up jeans in the world,

48
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.270
took him to Macy's and Macy's said,
this is either you're going to be,

49
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.910
it's our biggest hit or our biggest flop.

50
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.710
And in one month they were Macy's biggest flop,
but I didn't give up.

51
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.280
Every good idea has its time and obviously today was the time.

52
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.470
<v 5>Hi,
I'm Nina Wallia and I'm experienced design lead for Jakarta by Google.</v>

53
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:50.410
I'll tell you a little bit about what that means more later,
but um,

54
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.600
Dzhokhar by Google,
what we're doing is we're making your clothes interactive.
Uh,

55
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.090
hopefully you guys got to see the demo.
If not,
come find me later.
Uh,

56
00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:04.091
I've also done interaction design or experience design for Nike.

57
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:08.240
I did the Nike plus fuelband.
I did it for public broadcasting.

58
00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:10.990
I used to work with shows like sesame street and you know,

59
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:14.050
probably all the shows you guys grew up watching.
Um,

60
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.920
and on the side,
I love music.

61
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.070
I used to be a Dj and I'm a community organizer,

62
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.550
<v 6>so my name is [inaudible].
Um,</v>

63
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.210
I have a very real long background in three d printing especially.
So I'm,
I'm,

64
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:34.570
you know,

65
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.310
besides designing in three d sculpting and doing art,

66
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.200
my art work on,
we also have a venture capital fund and we,

67
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.270
uh,
design technology organizations from scratch ourselves,

68
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.070
<v 2>sorry for that.</v>

69
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.720
<v 6>Um,
and especially within with a real,
um,
of,
uh,
of,
uh,
uh,</v>

70
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.730
across pollinize in technology like Three d technologies,
augmented reality,

71
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:03.940
virtual reality,
uh,
sometimes fashion as well.

72
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.860
And trying to find some new kinds of ventures within these crossroads and a big

73
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:13.390
suite.
If everybody had some ice pops outside,
they already,
yes,

74
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.160
they already like it.
So that is a very good example of,

75
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.670
of the types of ventures that we're,
that we're busy with.
You know,
again,

76
00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:23.504
you would not,

77
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.820
might not imagine grading a search engine meeting three d printing,
meeting food,

78
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.430
uh,
every day.
Um,

79
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.790
so if anybody has some ideas for new content ventures,

80
00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:37.370
which are completely crazy,
then,
uh,
let me know.

81
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.320
<v 0>Well,
all of you have like a really incredible careers.
Um,</v>

82
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:48.130
I was reading all of your bio's when they sent them to me and every single one

83
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:50.350
was just like mind blowing,

84
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.230
but I'm sure you didn't start there.

85
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.400
So how has your profession changed since you first started your career?

86
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.240
<v 3>Oh my gosh.
I mean,
for me it's changed a lot.
Uh,
well the technology,</v>

87
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:09.170
the technology industry in general changes probably every day.

88
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.320
There's always new discoveries.
It's like science,
you know,

89
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.990
it changes and what people need changes and how people live their lives change.

90
00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:20.030
So that naturally happens and there's always something different that's thrown

91
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:22.810
at you and there's a new problem to solve.
Um,

92
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.400
but I also think the overall makeup of how any industry,
um,

93
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.340
is cha has changed a lot since I've started.
Um,
you know,

94
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.570
we hear this buzzword of millennials a lot and millennials have really changed

95
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:40.340
the face of what corporate America looks like and how it operates.

96
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:44.840
And you know,
how,
you know,
young professionals are serving,
you know,

97
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:46.610
their audiences or the world.

98
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.110
So I love millennials so much too.

99
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.000
I will defend millennials to the death.
I love them.

100
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.310
<v 4>Um,</v>

101
00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.260
well for me and my actual profession has changed a ton because when I started my

102
00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:03.840
career,
I was in high school and this wasn't really a career.

103
00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:06.060
It was something I was doing for fun.
Um,

104
00:07:06.061 --> 00:07:09.870
it was literally something I made for myself.
Cause every morning I'd wake up,

105
00:07:09.871 --> 00:07:13.530
I check the weather and then I decide what to wear.
Um,

106
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.550
and so over the years it grew really organically and now it is my career.

107
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.960
And I think it's a really interesting time to be in between retail,

108
00:07:21.961 --> 00:07:24.750
commerce and tech.
I mean,
if you look around,

109
00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:28.200
so many stories that I grew up with are now going bankrupt.

110
00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:31.890
And you're seeing this new crop of brands that are really catering to

111
00:07:31.891 --> 00:07:36.210
millennials and our preferences.
Um,
customers have more choices,

112
00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:37.770
more options than ever,

113
00:07:37.771 --> 00:07:41.880
right at their fingertips and the way that they're being advertised who is very

114
00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:44.970
different now.
It's very native,
very organic.

115
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.440
And so all of this is happening and it's just really exciting to see how it

116
00:07:49.441 --> 00:07:50.274
evolves.

117
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.100
<v 1>Well,</v>

118
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.100
I always say a fashion is the last frontier because I feel like every other

119
00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.570
industry has progressed so much.

120
00:08:00.571 --> 00:08:04.410
You think of cars and phones and yet like where's our fashion that should be

121
00:08:04.411 --> 00:08:07.950
doing so much more,
which thank goodness we're finally getting there.

122
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.360
But 18 years ago in the fashion industry are fashion shoots.

123
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.330
I mean we were printing catalogs on paper.

124
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.110
The photography was being done by hassle.

125
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:22.110
Blood camera's on real old school film.
We were using,

126
00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:25.290
some of our photographers know that we were using drum scans.

127
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:30.030
It was very expensive.
Now obviously everyone can do it.
Not everyone,

128
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.840
but I mean professional fashion shoots.
It's like,
you know,

129
00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:37.380
you take the shoot and tomorrow you've got the digital images out there.

130
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.080
So that's a big thing.
18 years ago,

131
00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:44.460
there wasn't really the volume of online shopping that there is now.

132
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.260
And then information,

133
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:51.120
you really had to be a fashion insider to know what was going to be big the next

134
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.770
season.
Now we have to keep up because you guys know before us what's,

135
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.750
<v 5>you know,
what the next trend is.</v>

136
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.410
And then I think the last thing is really being able to touch people,

137
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.240
touch the whole world pretty much at the,
you know,
with the,

138
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.960
with the touch of a button,

139
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.650
you come out with something and everyone's able to see it instantly.

140
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:14.640
And that's huge.
So
yeah,

141
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.010
to that point,
um,
my profession didn't exist when I started in my career.

142
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.250
Um,
so after college I went to graduate school,
um,

143
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.010
really super cool program,

144
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:30.090
which was basically computers as an expressive medium through doing really cool

145
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:34.260
creative stuff with the computers.
And um,
we,

146
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.270
this was many years ago and we,

147
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.390
a bunch of us got together and made this cost,

148
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:44.391
these costumes that we programmed so that the way you move could modulate sound

149
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:45.990
and music.

150
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.980
So you could call like Dj with your body and do a performance and were,
it was,

151
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.130
you know,
early days.
And so we're doing all this stuff,

152
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.920
but like my friends and my program,
like,
yeah,

153
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.400
<v 2>cool,</v>

154
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.080
<v 5>but how are you going to get a job?
But are you going to do with that?</v>

155
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.140
And I was like,
oh,
I guess you're right.
And I,
um,
at first I was like,
oh,

156
00:10:05.141 --> 00:10:07.140
let me do something practical if you're right.

157
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.030
But then like two or three years later,
the Nintendo we came out,

158
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.670
the iPhone came out using the same technologies we were using to,

159
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.030
to do all that modulation.

160
00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:20.790
I don't do you guys don't want to get an accelerometer is,

161
00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:24.000
have you heard that word?
See,
everyone knows what it is now.

162
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:29.350
Nothing like it when it started,
you know,
it wasn't a thing.
Um,
so yeah,
I'm,

163
00:10:29.351 --> 00:10:32.090
I'm sure like there'll be even new,

164
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.560
more new stuff coming up as you guys are coming up too.

165
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.483
Yeah,

166
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.420
<v 6>I would,
I would answer that a little bit in a different way.
Um,
I mean,</v>

167
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:47.260
of course I'm in my last 20 year last carry.

168
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.880
A lot of things have changed and know new technologies and you know,

169
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:54.660
people to express themselves in different ways and all that.
But,
um,
I would have,

170
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:57.860
uh,
you know,
advice for everybody here,
all the younger or younger crowd,
you know,

171
00:10:57.861 --> 00:10:59.570
to,
to uh,

172
00:10:59.571 --> 00:11:02.870
don't be entertained but be the entertainer.

173
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.860
So when I was at school 20 years ago,
I was the only kid at school,
you know,

174
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:08.420
how to computer on.

175
00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:11.720
Of course I was fighting against the system and we had this old tools and you

176
00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:11.871
know,

177
00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:16.871
everybody was drawing by hand and I was told by my peers that quote,

178
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.620
that thing computer will kill your creativity.
And I said,
yeah,

179
00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:25.820
and you're going to be so unemployed.
Uh,
so again,

180
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.020
to that note,
be the entertainer and to all the youtube stars here,

181
00:11:30.021 --> 00:11:33.380
I'm in today's world,
it's a lot easier than when I was scoring up 20 years ago.

182
00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:34.550
We didn't have youtube.
And you know,

183
00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:37.250
I wish a lot more difficult to get out there.
And to your point,

184
00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:39.830
we didn't have online shopping any of these things,
you know,
so,

185
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.870
so all of these stores are available,
so really,
really go out there and kick ass.

186
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.110
<v 5>I agree.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

187
00:11:50.111 --> 00:11:54.240
so did he,
did you have plan for success

188
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.500
<v 0>when you first started your career?
I'll start with you.</v>

189
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.170
We've been starting on this sentence so we can start on that in this time.

190
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.010
<v 6>If,
if I had a plan.
Yeah.
Only had one plan,</v>

191
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:06.420
which is to find happiness.
And also everybody said all in,

192
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.930
in the previous panel about is a lot of talk about passion and I try to find

193
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:15.100
that inner core trying to find your passion and really stay true to that.

194
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.430
And if you find that it's going to be a lot easier,

195
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:19.750
you don't actually have to work,

196
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:22.240
you don't have to worry about anything because you're happy every single day

197
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.350
working on what do you love?

198
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.320
<v 0>What I will say that people,
um,
it's like,
especially when I was in high school,</v>

199
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.260
like I was passionate about some weird thing is or whatever,

200
00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:35.280
but I still didn't know exactly where I was going.

201
00:12:35.281 --> 00:12:38.970
And I think that it's a,
I want to reiterate that that's okay.

202
00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:43.310
If you don't have a passion,
you don't have to force a passion on yourself.
Um,

203
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.670
like there are people well into their forties and fifties that don't discover

204
00:12:47.671 --> 00:12:51.450
like what they wanted to do or what their passion was.

205
00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:55.480
It's not something that you can just look up.
It's kind of something that,
um,

206
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.760
the universe presents right

207
00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.090
<v 5>self to you.
Yeah.
Sorry,
go on.</v>

208
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:06.620
I think I'll say two things about my,
my plan.
Um,
one is,
uh,

209
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:10.940
I'm a child of immigrants.
My parents came over from another country and yeah,

210
00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:11.990
they had their education,

211
00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:15.500
but that doesn't always mean a whole lot when you show up and you look really

212
00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:16.560
different.
Um,

213
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:21.570
and so I came up watching my parents hustle so hard and to get us to where we

214
00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:28.730
are and watching that like to me there was no other choice.

215
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.630
It's like there is success or what else?
Cause they,
they work so hard.

216
00:13:32.631 --> 00:13:37.370
I watch that,
you know.
Um,
and I was just going to carry that on.

217
00:13:37.371 --> 00:13:40.970
So that's one part in the second part is,
um,

218
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.030
part of watching that kind of put that,
that like practicality in me,

219
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.580
it's like dreams,
but also I need a paycheck.
So,
uh,

220
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.690
what I realized is I could be in any industry through technology.

221
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.550
So as I was mentioning to you guys before,

222
00:13:58.551 --> 00:14:02.780
like I've worked in media and TV shows,
I worked at Nike,

223
00:14:02.781 --> 00:14:05.720
which is awesome because that's a sneaker head.
Like,
um,

224
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.220
I work in fashion now,
everything you can imagine,

225
00:14:10.221 --> 00:14:14.350
every industry they need technological things.
Um,

226
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.920
so you can be anywhere using that knowledge.

227
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.770
So I think that was a major part of my plan is like,

228
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.870
I'm going to take this practical skill set in and be wherever.

229
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:30.813
<v 2>Good.</v>

230
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.190
<v 0>Well,
I think because I started so young,
you know,</v>

231
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.590
everyone says is saying passion,
which obviously is huge,
following a dream.

232
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.750
That's huge as well.
I,

233
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:44.540
I grew up riding and jumping horses and anytime I was afraid,

234
00:14:44.541 --> 00:14:47.510
my trainer would always say,
throw your heart over the jump and follow it.

235
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:52.010
But I really think,
you know,
the year

236
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.010
<v 1>my collection blew up and people always said,
well,
how'd you do it?</v>

237
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.870
I had no fear because I hadn't been tainted by the world yet.
I mean,

238
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:03.560
that's the honest truth.
So I hope you guys hear this because it's your,

239
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:05.270
it's so powerful right now.

240
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.670
Don't let anyone tell you who you are or what you can or cannot do.
I had,

241
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.950
I had no fear.
I believed I could do anything.

242
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.570
And so nothing held me back.
I had dream and I had a passion and,

243
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.090
and um,
I guess that was the plan

244
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.093
<v 2>sound,</v>

245
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.790
<v 4>uh,
for me.
Sorry.
That was great.</v>

246
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:30.470
And I totally agree with it because I started young as well and a lot of people

247
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:34.220
are so surprised when they hear that.
But for me,
I don't know any different.

248
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:38.300
And I think I was almost naive in a sense.
And I didn't,

249
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.200
I wasn't daunted by the world either cause I hadn't really seen it.

250
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.110
And I'm still young now too.
Um,

251
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.890
so I still can be a lot more bold than people,
you know,

252
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:52.460
who have to support a family or,
you know,
have all these responsibilities.

253
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.600
But as far as when I was in high school and starting my career,

254
00:15:56.601 --> 00:16:00.740
I guess I didn't have a specific plan for success.

255
00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:04.820
I didn't think of it like that.
But what I did think about was,
you know,

256
00:16:04.821 --> 00:16:06.110
what did I enjoy doing?

257
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:10.610
What was I good at and how can I combine those two things into a career?

258
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.180
And if I was able to,
I knew I would consider that a success.

259
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.810
And so I was always very creative.

260
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.090
I knew I wanted to do something on my own.

261
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.670
I was very intrigued by entrepreneurship.

262
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.140
And so I guess marrying all those three things is what I would have considered

263
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:28.700
to be a success at the time.

264
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.583
<v 2>MMM.</v>

265
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.040
<v 3>Um,
I,
um,
have never had a plan.
Um,</v>

266
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.080
I still don't have a plan.
I've always clawed my way.

267
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.550
I've always had a goal.

268
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.620
And so I've always spent my life setting milestones and,
and having a vision.

269
00:16:52.621 --> 00:16:56.490
I remember Darren and John Saying,
you know,
seeing yourself

270
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.633
<v 2>there,</v>

271
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.760
<v 3>you know,
no matter what circumstances you are in and you know,</v>

272
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.240
some of you are already tainted by the world,
you know what I mean?

273
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.530
You guys are facing unimaginable,
you know,

274
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.060
trials and circumstances.
You know,

275
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.920
I did when I was this age and I was raised by my grandmother and there was never

276
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:18.500
really a plan for my life,
um,

277
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.740
because the plan wasn't to be raised by my grandmother.
So,
um,

278
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.540
I've always set milestones and I've always clawed my way to where I want it to

279
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:31.340
be and always set a vision for where I wanted,
how I wanted to see my life.

280
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.290
And that always changed to two because you know,
you,

281
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:39.590
you get inspired by new things and I don't want anyone in this room to feel

282
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:44.330
married to,
um,
any industry or even any vision to yourself.

283
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.980
Just know what you want.
I love what you said.
You just want it to be happy.
Um,

284
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.040
I think that's one of the most important goals anybody could ever ask for is

285
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:56.150
just to choose to be happy.
Um,
and,
and,

286
00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.000
and be good to people and be good to yourself and,
you know,

287
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.320
think of ways that you can give,

288
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:04.290
use your gifts and your talents to give back to the world.
So,

289
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.320
<v 2>yeah.
Yes.
That was beautiful.
Yeah.</v>

290
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.370
<v 0>One thing that,
that one word that you used,
milestone.</v>

291
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.480
That's one of my favorite words.
Um,

292
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.710
because like goals and dreams and stuff can sometimes be arbitrary,

293
00:18:20.711 --> 00:18:24.280
but I feel like when you have milestones,
it doesn't feel like it's the end.

294
00:18:24.281 --> 00:18:27.640
It's almost like a stepping stone.
Sometimes people view goals as like,

295
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.510
that's the end now.
I got here,
now what?
But I do.
Yeah.
So I like that,

296
00:18:31.511 --> 00:18:35.980
but I think you did have a plan to get to each milestone,
right?
Kind of.
Yeah.

297
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.350
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
I,
I mean I,
I just figured things out.
Yeah.</v>

298
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.820
<v 0>Yeah.
You've got there though.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I did.</v>

299
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:46.910
I heard I was listening to a podcast and I heard something that said a goal

300
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:51.660
without a plan is just a wish.
And I was like,
oh,
read me.

301
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.240
Yeah.
So,
um,
the next thing,
we only have like,
what,

302
00:18:57.241 --> 00:19:02.040
15 minutes left?
Um,
I'm going to go over because the last person went over,

303
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:06.690
so I'm sorry.
Um,
so if you had to pick,

304
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.780
<v 5>okay.</v>

305
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.560
<v 0>Okay.
If you had to pick one thing,</v>

306
00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.620
what has been a major highlight of your career thus far?

307
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:15.730
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

308
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.740
<v 3>Um,
the measure,
the major highlight of my career.
Um,</v>

309
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.160
I guess isn't anything career.

310
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.810
Just anytime I hear someone telling me that whatever I've done in my career and

311
00:19:25.811 --> 00:19:30.400
my business has positively impacted them and motivated them to get up in their

312
00:19:30.401 --> 00:19:33.550
darkest moments,
you know,
I think that is a highlight for me.

313
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.323
<v 5>Cool.</v>

314
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.880
<v 0>Um,</v>

315
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.350
whenever I get emails from my users who tell me about how a daily dressed me has

316
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:43.920
made their lives better and streamline their morning routines,

317
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:46.340
it's always really touching.
And I love receiving those.

318
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:47.810
<v 5>Okay.</v>

319
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.171
<v 0>Well,</v>

320
00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:52.460
I'm Canadian and I was honored by the Consul General of Canada a few years ago

321
00:19:52.461 --> 00:19:55.550
and that was a big deal for me.
It felt very proud,

322
00:19:55.551 --> 00:19:57.350
felt like I was representing my country.

323
00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.843
<v 5>That's awesome.</v>

324
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.500
Always have two part answers.
One,
my,

325
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.790
my highlight is always the latest thing that I did.
So right now it's,
um,

326
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.800
our jacket with Levi's.
So you can go get this right now in any Levi's store.

327
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.540
Well,
mostly by stores and it's interactive,
so it's pretty cool.
And then,

328
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.030
um,

329
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.940
kind of similar to what you were saying of I got to work with Michelle Obama's

330
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:31.410
office on a digital campaign to help kids be more active.

331
00:20:31.411 --> 00:20:34.660
And I mean that always feels super good.
Yeah.

332
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:46.180
<v 3>I would say the proudest thing for me would be the next thing that I haven't</v>

333
00:20:46.181 --> 00:20:50.350
done yet.
You know,
so I don't really,
unlike reminiscing of the past,
I haven't,

334
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.740
I didn't write a book.
I probably should have all this kind of things.

335
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:55.450
I didn't write a memoir.
No,

336
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:57.850
I just want to make the next thing that he's the craziest,

337
00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:02.470
weirdest shit that I could ever imagine.
So,
um,

338
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.830
I don't yet know what it is,
but that's the next thing.

339
00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.373
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

340
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.550
<v 0>So I'm gonna to piggy backing off of that,
I'm going to ask,
well,</v>

341
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:17.540
a one last question,
we'll go to the audience,

342
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.810
but if we don't have time to have everyone answer,

343
00:21:20.811 --> 00:21:23.270
if just maybe two people want to interject.
Um,

344
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:28.300
what is a tech related path that you have not gone down yet but are interested

345
00:21:28.581 --> 00:21:33.290
in exploring?
We kind of want to know what do you guys want to go?

346
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.880
Like what's a cool thing to kind of go into next that any of you might be

347
00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:40.760
excited about?
Cause I know he's been talking about,
what is it?

348
00:21:40.761 --> 00:21:44.030
Tell me where he's trying to discover it.

349
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.120
<v 5>Oh,
sorry.
I did,
um,
public service.
I um,</v>

350
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.140
yeah,
I mean my generation,
we need to step up.

351
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.910
It doesn't have to be all the same people we've been seeing like as an,
uh,

352
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.030
members of Congress as the people representing you and your city.
So,

353
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.900
um,
yeah,
something I'm not tech related.

354
00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:06.880
I want to do one more.

355
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.113
<v 2>Woo.</v>

356
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.120
<v 3>I'm still thinking there's somebody else.</v>

357
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.340
<v 0>Anyone else?
And then we'll go into the audience.</v>

358
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.100
<v 3>I think just,
um,
just to pick up piggyback off of what she just said.</v>

359
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.220
Also social issues.

360
00:22:22.221 --> 00:22:27.221
I'd love to see some technological and innovations and mobilizing communities

361
00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:30.860
and,
you know,
really,
um,
not just mobilizing communities politically,

362
00:22:30.861 --> 00:22:33.100
but also inspiring,
um,

363
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:38.170
people of several different backgrounds and multicultural backgrounds and

364
00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.820
origins to really be active and powerful in their communities and use that

365
00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:48.320
technology to grow that and make the world a better place.
Awesome.

366
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.660
<v 2>Yeah.
So we'll go,
let's give our panel a round of applause.</v>

367
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:53.933
Yay.

368
00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.020
<v 0>Okay.
How many questions do we have time for?
We have time for one question.</v>

369
00:23:01.021 --> 00:23:03.360
Who's going to ask our panel?
One question.

370
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:08.670
<v 2>Okay.</v>

371
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.320
<v 0>How did you find your passion?</v>

372
00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.620
<v 2>Okay.</v>

373
00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.200
<v 0>How did you find it?
I think everyone should answer that.</v>

374
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.180
<v 3>Uh,
my fashion,
my passion found me.
Um,</v>

375
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.880
I think like,
you know,

376
00:23:21.881 --> 00:23:25.480
there comes a point in life if we're all being realistic where you hit rock

377
00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:28.510
bottom,
you know,
um,
like Darren said earlier,

378
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:31.300
like what you put on Instagram as your best moment,
right?

379
00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.060
But there's a lot of other moments that are very discouraging where you want to

380
00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:35.320
give up on yourself.

381
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:40.390
And so the magic happens when you apply grit.
Um,

382
00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.490
and you can't have magic without grades.

383
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.340
So don't get discouraged by the grit and the mundane moments

384
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.500
<v 6>and the unglamorous moments.
You know,</v>

385
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:51.500
where your throat is sore and you don't want to keep working and you don't,

386
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:55.400
you're tired.
Um,
use those moments to motivate you to make magic.

387
00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:02.670
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

388
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.460
<v 4>one thing I would say is to not be so quick to define your passion because it's</v>

389
00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:13.540
often not something like fashion or you know,
tech.
It might be some,
uh,

390
00:24:13.541 --> 00:24:17.740
feeling like accomplishing goals or solving problems,

391
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.380
things like that.
And so don't look to,
you know,

392
00:24:20.381 --> 00:24:24.220
put a box around it and just really look out for things that you intrinsically

393
00:24:24.221 --> 00:24:26.650
enjoy and things that you're also very good at.

394
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.103
<v 2>That's good.</v>

395
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:30.331
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

396
00:24:30.331 --> 00:24:34.860
I think I always say that if you can't stop thinking about it and your desire to

397
00:24:34.861 --> 00:24:38.640
do it is greater than your fear of failure,
then you know,
you've hit something.

398
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.420
So,
and that's changed for me over the years,
but technically speaking,

399
00:24:42.421 --> 00:24:44.070
it's always been about creating something.

400
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:46.863
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

401
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.570
<v 4>I think for me it was like someone mentioned before,
like a little bit of like,</v>

402
00:24:53.571 --> 00:24:55.670
what I don't like to do.
So,
uh,

403
00:24:55.671 --> 00:24:58.820
I started college as a computer science major and I was like sitting there

404
00:24:58.821 --> 00:25:00.800
coding and I was like,
one day I was like,

405
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.340
I don't want to do this for all my life.
I want to be a music journalist.

406
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.310
And so was like,
that's after two years of coding.

407
00:25:07.311 --> 00:25:12.311
So I went like to journalism school but I couldn't like I already knew how to,

408
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.310
how to code.
I already knew how to make things interactive.

409
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.930
So then I was like running around like let's make this multimedia video.

410
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.351
And they're like,

411
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:25.250
go bother the drama kids and like let's make an interactive play for theater.

412
00:25:25.251 --> 00:25:27.530
And it's all because I already knew how to code stuff.

413
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.150
But it was just finding that like,
oh,
I can do more than just stare at a screen.

414
00:25:32.151 --> 00:25:34.820
I can make this coat,
do cool stuff.
And I think that's where it came from.

415
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.290
<v 6>What's the kind of kind of to your point of sale?</v>

416
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.730
I mean I didn't have to work for it.
It found me,

417
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.090
but also I had pretty much finds me every one.
Not Anymore.
Every single night,

418
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.250
I would wake up in the middle of the night with an idea,
you know,

419
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.970
so kind of you have a higher power controlling you,

420
00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:58.140
so you kind of makes you kind of let go and just joy,

421
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.470
enjoy the ride.
I mean there's nothing that we have to find for you in a way,
but,

422
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.030
but I can also imagine that a lot of people,
it might not come naturally.

423
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.450
So I have one word for that,
which is curiosity,

424
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:14.480
stay curious and try to find the weirdest,
you know,

425
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.900
meet the weird people,
you know,

426
00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:18.600
go to the park and look at the grass and you know,

427
00:26:18.601 --> 00:26:20.640
go to the library and read the weird book,
