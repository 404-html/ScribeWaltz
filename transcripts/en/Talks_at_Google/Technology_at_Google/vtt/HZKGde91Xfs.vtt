1
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.560
Please welcome Jeremy Blm sin.

2
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:12.300
He is a professor of communication at Stanford University and founding director,

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.390
director of the virtual human interaction lab and he has a new book out called

4
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.710
experience on demand,
what virtuality is,

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.710
how it works and what it can do and it is available for sale in the back.

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.020
And now please welcome Jeremy Bailenson.
Yeah.

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.930
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.890
<v 0>Hi.
So my name is Jeremy Bailenson and since the late 1990s I have been building</v>

9
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.310
immersive virtual reality and testing its effect on the brain.

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.790
My Phd is in cognitive psychology,
um,

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.590
but in the year 2003 I switched to Stanford University where I'm in the

12
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.920
Department of Communication.

13
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.910
Basically what I do is I build virtual reality and I test to see what works,

14
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
what doesn't work and we study virtuality as a medium.

15
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.480
The same way you would study the newspaper or the way you studied television,

16
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.850
the key to virtual reality is something called presence.

17
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.320
Presence is defined by Matthew Lombard as the illusion of non mediation.

18
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.530
When VR works well,
there's no gadgets,
there's no pixels,

19
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.310
there's no field of view,
you're just having an experience.
So this is,
uh,

20
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.280
a lab demo we call the virtual pit.

21
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.880
What happens in the virtual pit is you're wearing the equipment and you see a

22
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:27.350
three d model of the room.
The floor opens up in the three d model of the room.

23
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.350
It looks just like the physical room.
We drop a chasm,

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.410
it's about 10 meters deep and we lay a plank across the chasm.

25
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.360
Now let me go back to the year 2001 we presented at the Federal Judicial Center

26
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:39.760
in Washington DC.
Uh,

27
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.850
a demonstration about how one would use virtual reality in the court system,

28
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:47.810
for example,
to recreate crime scenes.
And we're giving a demo to a federal judge.

29
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.960
He was a large man probably in his late sixties.

30
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.750
And when he was walking across that plank that you see,

31
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.380
he just took a little baby step to his left.
Of course,

32
00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:00.680
he modeled gravity and we stepped off the physical plank.
Visually,

33
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:04.760
he plummeted towards the bottom of that pit.
Now if you wanted to save your life,

34
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.860
the way you would save your life would be to dive across to catch the other end

35
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:10.694
of that lip.

36
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.150
And so here we are in Washington DC this near 2001 and this federal judge in the

37
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:21.020
physical world just decides to dive at a 45 degree angle.
It gets worse.

38
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:25.310
This is my first public demo and we put the computer on a table that had a sharp

39
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.760
corner.
Okay,
so here is this judge in a roomful of lawyers.
Uh,

40
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:31.910
and he dives towards this corner.
He was okay.
He didn't,

41
00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:34.040
he didn't actually hurt himself,
he didn't cut himself.

42
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.920
But this exemplifies something called presence.

43
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.920
And for most of the people in this room and a lot of the people watching this

44
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:42.620
video,
you have done Vr,
you know,

45
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:47.120
there's something special about what makes VR field different than other media.

46
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.480
At my lab at Stanford,
since 2003,

47
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:54.800
we've published hundreds of studies that show what works in Vr from a

48
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.640
psychological standpoint,
how it's different than other media.
In my lab,

49
00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:00.040
we've got a,
that shakes.

50
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.910
We've got a very accurate tracking system that can move sounds around the room.

51
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.520
We've got haptic devices that can move your arms.

52
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.240
We started working with virtual sent.
That being said,

53
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.680
the lab is a physical destination is becoming obsolete because some of the smart

54
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:19.480
people in this room here at Google and other companies are transforming the way

55
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.810
they've transforming the availability of virtual reality.

56
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:26.620
So if you look in this image here on the right side of your screen,

57
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.210
if you go to my lab's website,

58
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.080
80% of our publications are using these head mounted displays.

59
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.220
They way up to five pounds.
They cost more than my car.

60
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.670
They're really heavy,
kind of bulky to use.

61
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.840
The ones that we're using now cost the price of an expensive dinner,

62
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:46.990
a couple of hundred dollars and so what we've done is we've gone from when I

63
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:47.830
started this work,

64
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.090
there was only a couple hundred head mounted displays to now we've got tens of

65
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.140
millions and that drastically changes the questions that we try to ask in the

66
00:03:56.141 --> 00:04:00.490
lab.
When I first started virtual reality,
we thought of it like an MRI machine,

67
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.410
expensive.
You needed a dedicated space,
you needed a technician to run it.

68
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.640
And this transition to now to tens of millions of people in the United States

69
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.530
are doing VR in their homes.

70
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.890
It's an important transition in the history of the field.

71
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.500
So the point of this talk is to answer the question that my 91 year old

72
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:24.280
grandfather had when I first put him in virtual reality,
which is,
you know,

73
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.430
really what's the point.
So a lot of people have had this experience.

74
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:32.140
You put on Vr,
it feels really cool,
but then you take it off and you're like,

75
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:34.330
okay,
that I did that and now what do I do?

76
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:39.130
And what we specialize as a lab is focusing on the things that make VR

77
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:43.270
spectacular and avoiding the things that maybe aren't so good.
And um,

78
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.280
what I'm going to do today in this talk,

79
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:48.250
which is something I haven't done before,
but,
but it's,

80
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:49.540
I'm going to start doing it,

81
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.190
is talking about both the downsides of Vr and the upsides.

82
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.700
I think it's important to talk about both.

83
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:58.600
So this is an image from the cover of my book and we spend a lot of back and

84
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:00.370
forth going,
going back and forth.

85
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.800
We spent a lot of time going back and forth with the artist.

86
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.790
And the cover is a shape that's impossible.

87
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.350
This shape can exist in the world,
however,
people are doing normal things on it,

88
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:14.560
everyday things and virtual reality.
There's a paradox.

89
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.850
The brain treats it is real.
Remember that Judge Dove into nothing,

90
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.590
but there's no rules.
You can go back in time,
you can turn physics on and off,

91
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.120
you can become a different person.

92
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.250
And so what I spend 12 hours a day thinking about and studying is in a world in

93
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:31.840
which there are no rules,

94
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.020
very new to human history of from an evolutionary standpoint,

95
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.580
but the brain treats that is real.
What should you do and what should you avoid?

96
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.460
So I'm gonna start by talking about the downsides.

97
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.480
I just took this photo of 45 seconds ago and I luckily did not get run over on a

98
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.740
New York City streets here,

99
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.260
but in a non funny version of this,
uh,

100
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.600
there's reports out of Moscow four weeks ago that we have the first VR death.

101
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.590
A person fell through a plate glass table while using Vr to play games.

102
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.580
Smartphones now are so distracting.
It's causing people to cause accidents.

103
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.900
VR will be no difference.
Kennedy Shriram just turned in her dissertation,

104
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.680
which is now available in public databases and her dissertation.

105
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:20.600
She put people in Vr and she tested to see how quick they were to notice events

106
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:23.270
outside of Vr.
For example,
something touches your hands.

107
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.390
What she proved was that when you're in immersive Vr,

108
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.530
you're slower to notice and less likely to notice things in the outside world.

109
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.670
It's an important one.

110
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.180
We need to think about how not to be too distracted so we can function in the

111
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:36.014
world.

112
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.340
Addiction when social networking fields like the best party you've ever been to,

113
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.790
when online gambling feels like going to Las Vegas,
when pornography,

114
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.200
it feels like sex.
How does society function?
Reality blurring.

115
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:51.350
I'm going to read you this quote several times during the experiment,

116
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.950
the participant was confused about being in the virtual environment or in the

117
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:59.870
real world and mixed certain our artifacts and events between both worlds.

118
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.590
This is a quote from two German psychologist from the University of Hamburg who

119
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.650
studied a paper in 2014 where one of them watched the other one while he stayed

120
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:12.950
in virtual reality for 24 hours straight.
Uh,
so to prepare for this talk,

121
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:16.910
I called up Garrett Brooder who is the second author on this paper.

122
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.010
A lot of strange things happened.

123
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.390
One of the things that happened is that they actually modeled light to work in

124
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:26.210
the virtual world to correspond with the actual time of day.

125
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.840
And when the virtual room got dark,

126
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.580
this subject got colder,

127
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.870
the temperature changes to the body self reported were mediated by what they saw

128
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:36.560
in Vr.

129
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.560
It's going to be a strange world if people spend too much time in VR simulator

130
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:42.771
sickness.

131
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:46.370
We all work hard to make sure that our technology has got high frame rates,

132
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.430
low update rates.
We try not to move the camera,

133
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:52.130
but it's still something to think about.
Over time.
You can feel fatigued.

134
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.410
Media modeling.
Let's avoid the desensitization of violence debate for now.

135
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.080
But VR has been used to train soldiers for decades.

136
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.950
Most VR labs had been funded by research to help our soldiers get better at

137
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:07.970
their jobs when the average citizen can download software that teaches her or

138
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:10.940
him how to do combat.
Uh,
we need to think about that.
There's some,

139
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.820
some issues there.
Kids are unique.

140
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.030
So we are about to publish a few things I can want to talk about today with

141
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:19.730
common sense media.
We have a report coming out in late March.

142
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.990
That's going to be a helpful report for parents to think about when is it okay

143
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:26.870
for kids to go into Vr?
What types of things should they do,

144
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.140
how long can they stay in there?
Uh,
but my phd student,

145
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:33.800
my former PhDs and Jackie Bailey's now a professor at University of Texas and

146
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:37.070
her dissertation research looked worked with sesame street,

147
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.030
sesame street funded a project for us to take four year olds,

148
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.320
five year olds and six year olds put them in Vr and study the way they would

149
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:47.660
interact with Grover.
And so I'll show you this movie

150
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.130
and you'll just get a sense of the reaction that kids have in Vr

151
00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.090
of things for us.
Okay?

152
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.020
<v 1>Ready?
Oh,</v>

153
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.730
it's a sign you're lovable for [inaudible].

154
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.620
You have cheer and dance with us.
All of my crazy moves.

155
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.880
All right,

156
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.280
<v 0>so we've now run north of a hundred kids who are six years or under in the lab.</v>

157
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:23.170
And what Jackie Bailey looks at is she looks at psychological processing such as

158
00:09:23.171 --> 00:09:27.160
being able to inhibit responses,
mimicry,
and social interaction.

159
00:09:27.161 --> 00:09:31.480
And she's found fairly drastic differences where VR is more influential on young

160
00:09:31.481 --> 00:09:33.910
children than a TV version of Grover.

161
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:35.580
So it's something we need to think about it.

162
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.250
Now we've talked about five downsides of Vr.

163
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.320
Given those downsides.

164
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.610
What I'm seeing here today in this talk is that in five years from now,

165
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.490
if the people in this room are putting on helmets to read their email,

166
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.330
then I've failed.
As an evangelist.
Vr is an amazing technology.

167
00:09:52.331 --> 00:09:54.700
The brain treats it in a similar way to being real.

168
00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:58.180
It's something that can take us to different places.
It's powerful.

169
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:59.530
We should save it,

170
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.910
save it for things that in the physical world meet one of four standards.

171
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.430
Impossible,
counterproductive,

172
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.310
rare or expensive or dangerous,

173
00:10:09.311 --> 00:10:10.960
and I'm going to go over each of these individually,

174
00:10:10.961 --> 00:10:15.110
but to sum up the take home argument from today,
Vr is super intense.

175
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.800
The brain treats that as if it were a real experience.

176
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.900
Therefore we shouldn't use it for everything.

177
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.590
Let's save it for something that meets at least one of these standards.

178
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.930
Let's start with impossible.
In 2003 my lab,

179
00:10:28.931 --> 00:10:32.860
the first corporate grant we got were from Cisco and a woman there named Marcia

180
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:34.330
is Petoskey.
Marcia said,
Jeremy,

181
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.990
it would be really neat if you could think about how to use VR to teach

182
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.940
diversity and inclusion and what we did is we built the virtual mirror and I'm

183
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:46.990
going to show you this video and be kind to it because I like to show history

184
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.160
this,
these graphics.

185
00:10:48.161 --> 00:10:52.300
Now we're 15 years old and the idea was to use VR to induce what neuroscientists

186
00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:53.440
called body transfer.

187
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:58.770
Body transfer states that if you move physically and your virtual avatar moves

188
00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:01.600
synchronously with you,
you see that in a mirror,

189
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.870
you see it in the first person over time,
the brain,

190
00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:09.640
the part of the brain that includes the Schema for the self expands to include

191
00:11:09.641 --> 00:11:13.030
that virtual representation.
So here in this movie,

192
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.860
subject walks around,

193
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.593
<v 1>okay,</v>

194
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.810
<v 0>he goes up to the mirror.
Most subjects do this for four minutes.</v>

195
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:25.050
I've kept it to about 10 seconds.
He moves in the mirror,

196
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.760
turns his head.
After about four minutes,

197
00:11:30.761 --> 00:11:33.880
it's really feels like it's you.
We've got a set of instructions that we do.

198
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.430
He then bends down,

199
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.610
Ben's down at the knee and he comes up and he's now a woman of color.

200
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:45.490
And what we do is the next step we repeat the body transfers.

201
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:47.680
So you really feel like that's you in the mirror.

202
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.330
And then what we do is we network a second person into virtual reality.

203
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.790
So you're wearing the body of someone else,

204
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.110
a second person comes in and then that person proceeds to treat you horribly

205
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.340
based on your race,
based on your gender,
based on your age.

206
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.680
And what we've discovered and about 15 years of studying this fairly rigorously,

207
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.660
this is described in chapter three of my book,

208
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.410
it's called walking a mile in the shoes of another is that in general across

209
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:17.320
these studies,
virtual reality reduces prejudice,

210
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:20.170
changes behaviors more than controls,

211
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:24.850
like watching a video or doing role playing or reading case studies.
Now,

212
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:27.250
I don't want to over claim the results.
Nothing is magic.

213
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.620
Nothing solves all of our problems.
And,

214
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.610
and not every single study does VR work better than controls on every single

215
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:37.030
measure.
But as a pattern across over a decade of research,

216
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.010
VR works better than controls.

217
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.430
We published work in 2013 my former student sons you on is now professor at

218
00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:47.080
University of Georgia.
She had subjects come in,

219
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.780
half of them imagined the role played,

220
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.560
what would be like to be colorblind while they were doing a sorting tasks,

221
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:55.930
they had to grab objects and sort them around.

222
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.970
The other half we use the head mounted display to take away their ability to see

223
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:03.370
green from red.
It was a brutally difficult,

224
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:07.000
in fact impossible task to actually do because you had to sort items of

225
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:10.630
different colors and you couldn't see that.
Well after the study was over,

226
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.720
she gave subjects and opportunity to help people with disabilities.

227
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.020
She didn't uh,
ask her to ask subject to self report.

228
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.410
She paid them for the study and then said,
if you want a volunteer extra,

229
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.180
what you can do is you can surf the web,

230
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.600
you can find websites that would be hard to read if you are visually impaired

231
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.180
and then you can email the webmasters and ask them to change it.

232
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.760
When you become impaired in Vr,

233
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.450
you spent twice as much time helping others compared to when you imagined it.

234
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.650
And most of our studies look at behavioral measures like that we never trust

235
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.380
when it comes to issues of implicit bias and prejudice,

236
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.990
we don't trust self report.
We actually watch what people do.

237
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.940
Another example of how Hershfield who's now a professor at the business school

238
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.050
at Ucla,

239
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.610
he cared about empathy to yourself and in particular yourself in the future,

240
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.560
a philosopher called par feet as long argued that it's really easy to imagine

241
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:04.420
pleasure soon.
It's very hard to mount in to imagine pain in the future.

242
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.710
Therefore,
people rarely defer gratification.
They tend to opt for pleasure.
Now,

243
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:13.160
how do you get people to push that back and how ran a series of experiments was

244
00:14:13.161 --> 00:14:14.200
his dissertation work.

245
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.980
Where in the Virtual Mirror we actually scanned your face before you came in so

246
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:21.190
you saw yourself in the mirror and your face look just like your actual you.

247
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:26.380
We then use algorithms to age yourself so that you in the mirror you went from

248
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:30.730
20 something to you know in your sixties or seventies very intense experience.

249
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:32.470
You see yourself age in front of your eyes.

250
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.480
Where we would then do is give you the opportunity to take some money now or

251
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:40.570
give you more money later on if you were to put it into a savings account.

252
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.450
In other words,
he asked people to defer gratification.

253
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.560
What how discovered over a series of experiments was that compared to just about

254
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:51.620
every control condition you can think of meeting your future self in virtual

255
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:55.430
reality causes you to plan for the future better than controls.
Now,

256
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.590
we published this in the Journal of market research,

257
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.120
which is a good academic journal,

258
00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.840
but one of the themes of today is watching this academic work we've been doing

259
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:05.930
for a decade actually scale out to the world.
And,
uh,

260
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:09.410
the funnest thing that we've done with this work is bank of America,

261
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.430
Bank of America,

262
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.780
Merrill Lynch has built what's called face retirement and they figured out a way

263
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:16.550
to use the laptops in the camera,

264
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.740
just do a scan of your face and then they age yourself so that you are uh,

265
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.230
about 67 years old in this picture.

266
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.470
And then part of your online banking interface,

267
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.330
your future self is staring at you.

268
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.530
Every decision that you make and your future self gets happier,

269
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:37.470
the more money you put into savings.
Okay.
And,
and you know,
at Stanford,
uh,

270
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.870
we like win wins.
It's okay,

271
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:41.810
the Bama is going to perhaps make more money because there's more money in their

272
00:15:41.811 --> 00:15:46.760
accounts.
20 somethings are saving money more.
And this is important,

273
00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:50.990
not just because they are going to be impoverished a given the current trends of

274
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.140
how people were savings.
They're also going to live till they're 90 or a hundred.

275
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.870
So getting people to save money as a really important goal and we're working

276
00:15:56.871 --> 00:16:00.740
with a number of companies to help them encourage young people to put money in

277
00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:01.574
the bank.

278
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.110
Another fun application of this to solve a problem that's,

279
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.940
that's not fun and fun is the wrong word to use in this context.
Uh,

280
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.660
the national football league has been very active in working with us as an

281
00:16:13.661 --> 00:16:17.700
organization to use this technology to help to,
uh,

282
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.400
to help the members of their company or their organization because they're a

283
00:16:21.401 --> 00:16:25.390
nonprofit to become better.
And Troy Vincent,

284
00:16:25.391 --> 00:16:27.490
the vice president of operations on the NFL,

285
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.160
he really wants the NFL to be known as the best place to work.

286
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.730
And what you're seeing here is a screenshot from an interview simulator that

287
00:16:33.731 --> 00:16:38.650
we've built in tandem with the NFL for not players,
for coaches,

288
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.700
executives,
for owners to basically practice having an interview.

289
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.060
Why did you ask this question to this person but a different question to someone

290
00:16:46.061 --> 00:16:47.830
else.
Why did you look in this place?

291
00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:51.190
And just like VR comes from the flight simulator in interviews.

292
00:16:51.191 --> 00:16:52.330
We also make mistakes.

293
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.270
We have a flight simulator because mistakes are very expensive and a plane,

294
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.100
but they're not expensive.
When you're simulating,

295
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:00.670
we should learn by doing and we've been working with the NFL to help their

296
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:04.270
personnel become better giving interviews and become less biased.
It's a,

297
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.290
it's a neat process to watch people do an interview and then do it again and to

298
00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:09.940
point out things that they can do better.

299
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.320
Another example of scaling this up,
uh,
at the to 20,

300
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.080
at the 2016 Tribeca film festival,

301
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.410
we premiered becoming homeless and Tobin Asher is sitting right here.

302
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:23.800
He's one of the directors of becoming homeless.
Um,

303
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.550
it's a seven minute journey where you learn in a visceral manner something

304
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:31.280
called the fundamental attribution error.
So psychologists,

305
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.480
Lee Ross from Stanford has coined the term which basically states when something

306
00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:37.580
bad happens to someone else,
we blame their character.

307
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.230
When something bad happens to us,

308
00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:42.380
we blame the situation and most people do this all the time.

309
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.620
How can you reverse this in the context of becoming homeless?
Meaning,

310
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.190
how can we get people to understand that people are homeless because of

311
00:17:50.191 --> 00:17:52.410
situations and get them to have more empathy.

312
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:57.000
And so what we've built is this seven minute experience where you lose your job,

313
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.700
you then lose your apartment and you can't stay there.

314
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.280
You have to sell things in your apartment,
you try living in your car,

315
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:05.250
but that doesn't work.
You then,
uh,

316
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.560
try to sleep on a bus and you have harassment under the bus.

317
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:09.810
It's a very intense journey.
Uh,
but more importantly,

318
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:14.811
we have run thousands of subjects through this now thousands of subjects where

319
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:17.340
we have people do VR or control condition.

320
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.130
And what we give them as a is a petition.
They take the helmet off,

321
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.730
sign this petition.
It's an actual proposition in many cases.

322
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.170
Are you willing to have your own personal taxes increased if it can go to

323
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:32.010
supporting affordable housing?
And in a paper we're gonna publish quite soon,
uh,

324
00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.590
in a paper that's already been accepted for presentation at a conference.

325
00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:37.440
So it's been peer reviewed compared to control conditions.

326
00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:39.510
VR causes more people to sign this petition.

327
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.410
But what I'm really excited about scaling up is,
uh,
when we leave here,

328
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:47.760
Tobin is going to be hard at work because tomorrow this is going to be released

329
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:49.380
for the world on steam.
Uh,

330
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:52.140
and so we're really excited just to take what the lab is built in to give it to

331
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:56.370
people for free.
Let's go to the next example,
which is counterproductive.

332
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.480
This bucket of,
remember we're talking about physical experience,

333
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:03.300
things that in the real world would be counterproductive hands.

334
00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:06.030
Let's do them in Vr.
And I'm going to focus on conservation.

335
00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:09.090
And one of my academic heroes is as doctor Jane Lubchenco.

336
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.470
She was the head of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration for four

337
00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:16.050
years under President Obama.
In that four year window,

338
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:20.340
she saw more natural disaster than in any four year window in u US history.
Uh,

339
00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:24.090
scientists are in consensus that the frequency and intensity of these weather

340
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:25.900
events are due to climate change.
Uh,

341
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.440
but of course there's many people both in our government,
uh,

342
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:30.870
and among our citizens who don't believe this.

343
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:33.300
And so this quote from Dr Lubchenco,

344
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.770
when people directly experienced something,
they see it in a different light.
Uh,

345
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.790
and I interviewed her for the book.
Uh,

346
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.590
and she told all these amazing stories at the,
at Noaa,

347
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.330
her job was when there was a natural disaster to go down and to help the people

348
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.500
who had been hurt by the national disaster.
And,
uh,

349
00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.260
she's got some amazing stories of a lawmakers who were climate change deniers,

350
00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.210
but when natural disaster hit their city,
they become believers.

351
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:01.044
In other words,
the,

352
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.910
the horrors and the experience of droughts and floods that have ravaged their

353
00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:08.700
country,
their cities have caused them to become believers.

354
00:20:08.701 --> 00:20:12.690
But remember in virtual reality,
disaster is free.
Okay,

355
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.240
we can feel a disaster but not get hurt.

356
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.220
And so the first study that we published here examined a phenomenon called

357
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.930
toilet paper consumption.

358
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.580
And it turns out there is a article written in 2009 by Leslie Kauffman for the

359
00:20:26.581 --> 00:20:30.090
New York Times if use that soft,
fluffy toilet paper that we all love.

360
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.820
That paper is made from non recycled pulp.

361
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.190
About half of that comes from second growth forest.

362
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.120
10% of that comes from virgin trees.
So the article is written brilliantly,

363
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.840
but nothing changes in San Francisco where I live in the bay area,

364
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.210
it's the hippiest crunchies place in the country.

365
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.120
And many stores don't sell recycled papers.
The one that does that do sell it,

366
00:20:49.121 --> 00:20:52.300
you have to hunt and peck.
So how do we change behavior?
So we ran a study,

367
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.180
three groups of subjects,
one group ready,

368
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:57.640
beautifully written narrative of what it be like to cut down a tree.

369
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.000
The second group saw a video shot from the shoulder of a lumberjack,

370
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.130
the third put on the goggles and had a haptic device that gave them touch

371
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:09.610
feedback and they actually had to cut down two trees.

372
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.230
And then after the trees fell,

373
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.810
my lab was a floor that shakes the tree falls and it booms.

374
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.510
That feed up a really intense experience.
And in fact,

375
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:19.840
I get phone calls quite often.
Someone will call me up when they said,
Jeremy,

376
00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.140
I went to that toilet paper Iowa yesterday and I thought about you and I.

377
00:21:24.141 --> 00:21:26.240
Then I say,
I say that's just fine.
Uh,

378
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.480
we tend not to trust self report though.
So in our experiments we did two things.

379
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.260
We ask people before and after,
are you going to conserve paper more?

380
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.000
Everybody says yes,
whether you read the narrative,
saw the video or did the Vr,

381
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.080
but we also looked at their actual paper use and the only change occurred with

382
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:46.690
the Vr Group,
they use 20% less paper.

383
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.240
So the big idea here is VR gives you an experience.

384
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.200
The brain treats it as real and experienced changes our behavior.

385
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.880
But if I were to teach the people in this room about deforestation by forcing

386
00:21:57.881 --> 00:22:01.130
you to cut down big trees,
that would be a silly way to do it.
Vr,

387
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.770
VR gives you the best of both worlds.

388
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.820
The next project I want to talk about because a,

389
00:22:06.821 --> 00:22:10.870
I'm hugely impressed what Google's done throughout its history about education.

390
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.680
I've worked closely with the expeditions team,
uh,
for quite some time,
uh,

391
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.480
is education and I want to talk about a very special place that has been worked

392
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:21.850
on by my,
my marine science colleague feel Mckelly.

393
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:26.620
This is a riff off of the island of Ischia,
which is off of Naples,
Italy,

394
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.480
and this island.

395
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:33.580
This reef has volcanic vents that seep pure carbon dioxide.

396
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:37.570
This is special because most of the time that there's underwater volcano and

397
00:22:37.571 --> 00:22:39.220
underwater volcanic vents,

398
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.690
it seeps methane or sulfur or other bad chemicals that you can blame the

399
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:45.460
destruction on the reef on the bad chemicals.

400
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:50.680
This is a pure area where you have CO2 coming out of the bottom of the ocean and

401
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:54.670
what you're looking here is a picture of what's called ocean acidification.

402
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.450
So most smart adults have not heard of ocean acidification.
Um,

403
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.990
Jane Lubchenco calls it global warming's evil twin.
Uh,

404
00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:05.290
there's been papers published,
hundreds of them in the best journals,

405
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.650
science and nature.
Yet most adults don't know what it is.

406
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.560
When oceans absorbs CO2,

407
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.520
about a third of the co two produced by humans get absorbed by the ocean,

408
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.140
the water becomes more Siddiq.

409
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:20.080
The Ph level goes down the same way that when you drink seltzer,

410
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:24.610
which has CO2 and it's a little more tangy,
the water becomes more acidic.

411
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.290
When the water becomes more acidic.

412
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.320
What you see on your right side of the screen happens,

413
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.130
coral dies and algae thrives and what you,

414
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:38.160
the entire food web under the ocean gets destroyed because the corals and other

415
00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:43.030
types of animals that support the ecosystem get replaced by a small number of

416
00:23:43.031 --> 00:23:43.864
species.

417
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.270
So what you're looking at is a screenshot of how all of our oceans are going to

418
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:51.710
look if our oceans continue to absorb human produce co two,

419
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.690
but most people haven't heard of this and it would be counterproductive for me

420
00:23:56.691 --> 00:24:00.990
to fly school kids and lawmakers to the small refund Iscsi.

421
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.490
It's not much bigger than a,
than a soccer field in order to learn this lesson.

422
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.920
So we work tirelessly with Fema,
Kelly,

423
00:24:06.921 --> 00:24:11.330
the marine scientists and Roy p who's an educational technologist to build an

424
00:24:11.331 --> 00:24:15.950
eight minute journey where you leverage all of the educational techniques that

425
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:20.480
Roy p has championed.
Experiential learning,
uh,
all sorts of perspective taking.

426
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.810
You become a scientist,
you do species counts.
Uh,
we,

427
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.430
you get to travel through time.

428
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:30.431
You really experience what ocean acidification is and what we can demonstrate.

429
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.310
We've published a number of papers here.
Uh,
the first thing is learning efficacy.

430
00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:38.390
We've put it in high schools,
we've put it in a college classes.
Simply put,

431
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:40.010
people learn well from virtual reality.

432
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.140
It's a good starting point to get a lot of data on that.

433
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.980
There's also motivation to learn,
uh,
which is,
uh,

434
00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:50.981
this is a screenshot from the 2016 Tribeca film festival where we premiered the

435
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:55.460
Stanford Ocean acidification experience.
It's an arcade that's open from a,

436
00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:57.830
you know,
about 10 hours a day.
Uh,
Jane Rosenthal,

437
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:01.130
the genius that put this together.
It's an amazing,
amazing,

438
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.870
a set of experiences that people pay to come to.
We had a line of,

439
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.560
you know,

440
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:11.270
sometimes up to 100 adults waiting for up to an hour for about 10 hours a day

441
00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:14.810
for seven days straight to learn about chemistry.
And you don't,

442
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:16.010
you don't see that for textbooks.

443
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:18.380
And maybe it's a novelty thing and it'll wear off.

444
00:25:18.381 --> 00:25:20.750
But I've been doing VR for 20 years and,
and the,
the,

445
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:23.160
the shock and awe for me is not worn off.
So,
uh,

446
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.440
I do think the motivation piece will stay.
Um,

447
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.490
we've done a lot of work to do this to inform policy.
Um,

448
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.320
so we did a briefing at the u s Senate where we had senators and Congress woman

449
00:25:33.321 --> 00:25:35.480
and Congressmen,
uh,
in addition to their staffers.

450
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.190
What you're seeing here in the picture,
uh,
experience ocean acidification.
Uh,

451
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.330
and there was really two functions of this.

452
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:45.680
One was teaching the lawmakers about ocean acidification.
Uh,

453
00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:48.920
but for those who knew about acidification,
we were teaching them about Vr.

454
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:52.130
And it was a really neat process.
We just came back from Pulau,

455
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.340
which I'm not going to go into too much detail cause I have limited time in this

456
00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:59.420
talk where we did a similar briefing for Palau and lawmakers.
Um,

457
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.400
but we actually created a demo,

458
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:06.200
a targeted demo to show the lawmakers how climate change is affecting the reefs

459
00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:07.670
in Palau.
Uh,

460
00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:11.900
and it was a really neat experience to watch the VR demos that we gave as a

461
00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:15.290
briefing to the lawmakers be come part of the policy decisions and the policy

462
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:16.124
conversations.

463
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.060
But most importantly really happy that it's free and that we're giving it away.

464
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.160
There's,
you know,
at Stanford we've got a history with Moocs,

465
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.440
which is can we democratize learning materials?

466
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.800
And I believe even more than a Moog,

467
00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.440
a seven minute journey where you learn something new and exciting,
uh,

468
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.540
is going to really transform a lot of education because the

469
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.740
very few people get to have labs.
Really good labs are really good field trips.

470
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:43.190
And I'm not saying we should replace actual field trips with VR.

471
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.060
I'm saying we should have fieldtrips much more often.

472
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.960
Let's move to expensive and rare and a,

473
00:26:48.961 --> 00:26:51.870
this is going to be the story of learning and training.

474
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.970
And it starts with Derek Belch.

475
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.860
Derek Belch took my virtual people class in the year 2005 he was a field goal

476
00:26:58.861 --> 00:27:01.470
kicker for the Stanford team after class.
He said,
Jeremy,

477
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:05.190
can we use VR to train athletes?
I said,
Derek,
it's a brilliant idea,

478
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.610
but the techs not ready yet.
Come back in 10 years,
10 years later,

479
00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:09.930
Derek came back to the lab.

480
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:15.050
He got his master's thesis with me while he was an assistant coach on the

481
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.910
Stanford Football Team and he convinced coach David Shaw and other brilliant

482
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:19.800
forward thinking person to give us a way,

483
00:27:19.801 --> 00:27:23.190
five minutes of practice time on a Monday where we would film and spherical

484
00:27:23.191 --> 00:27:26.970
video back in 2013.
It was really hard to do spherical video.
Well,
uh,

485
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.260
and our defense would pretend to be the team we're going to play that Saturday

486
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.670
and they would throw at us really complicated blitz packages and a different

487
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:36.510
defensive looks.

488
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.630
The quarterback would go to the line of scrimmage a and he'd have to do one of

489
00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:43.110
three things.
He'd let it roll.
We just keep the original play.
He'd kill kill,

490
00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:45.330
kill,
which is go to the next play down the queue.

491
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.910
Or he would ask a running back to move to pick up a block.

492
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.290
So recognize a pattern,
make a decision,
communicate that decision.

493
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.590
After three weeks it was working so well that David Shaw decided to make a

494
00:27:55.591 --> 00:28:00.180
mandatory for practice.
Uh,
the Stanford team outperformed that season.

495
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.330
Uh,
I would never claim that,
but coach Shaw as well as Kevin Hogan,

496
00:28:03.331 --> 00:28:04.390
our quarterback,
uh,

497
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.500
highlighted this as one of the many tools that help them do well that season.
Um,

498
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.790
so it was a really neat thing to watch Derek graduates January 2nd,

499
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:18.390
2015 and like many Stanford students,
he forms a startup.
It's called strivr.

500
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.860
And what Derek has succeeded in doing is transforming the way athletes train.
Uh,

501
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.020
the first few months after starting this company,

502
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.660
he thought he would have maybe a team or two.

503
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.340
He signs five NFL teams to multiyear contracts about a dozen college teams.

504
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.790
And now this is just a sampling of some of the teams,
uh,

505
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:37.230
and companies that are using this.

506
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.350
It is transforming the way that people are training.

507
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.260
And the point here is not that we want to replace actual training,

508
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.370
it's just an extra tool that you can use to get more mental repetitions.

509
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.000
It helps you learn faster.
It helps you learn in ways that are less dangerous.

510
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:55.080
Now in terms of scaling out because it's really exciting to watch,
you know,

511
00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:59.610
companies like Google build things that can allow everyone to do VR.

512
00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.500
Um,
I want to talk about Walmart.
I'm going to read you this quote from our test.

513
00:29:04.501 --> 00:29:07.830
We've seen that associates who go through VR training retain what they've

514
00:29:07.831 --> 00:29:11.130
learned in those situations better than those who haven't because of the

515
00:29:11.131 --> 00:29:11.911
promising results.

516
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:16.110
We'll be rolling out this training to all 200 of our academy facilities by the

517
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:20.850
end of 2017 that means the over 140,000 associates who will graduate from

518
00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:24.030
academics each year.
We'll have yards integral.
Part of that experience.

519
00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:25.380
That's from a vice president,
Walmart.

520
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:31.010
The story of Walmart is we were demoing Arkansas football trainer to someone

521
00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:34.560
from Walmart.
He said,
Huh,
recognize a pattern.

522
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.290
Making a decision and communicating that decision sounds like part of

523
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:38.130
everybody's job.

524
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.820
And what we did is we built a Vr trimino dem or VR training demo for Walmart and

525
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:45.970
we put it in one single trading academy,
Walmart,
it's 200 of them.

526
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.940
Any Walmart employee you can get in their car and drive in a day to get there.

527
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:52.240
They do a bootcamp where they spend a week learning.
We put Vr in one.

528
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.630
You're probably all thinking,
well what do you learn in Vr and for,
for Walmart?

529
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.360
Uh,
one example is holiday rush.
All these people running at you asking you to,

530
00:29:59.361 --> 00:30:01.540
to answer questions and screaming at you.

531
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.240
Or another example is finding safety hazards in the room.

532
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:08.050
There's actually a lot of use cases.
So we started one of these academies,

533
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.490
very good qualitative data.

534
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:14.790
We then went to 30 of them and paired the 30th is using it to 30 who were not

535
00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:17.260
yet using it.
So we could run a controlled study,

536
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.250
very good quantitative data at scale.
We are now an all of them.

537
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.400
And I can say I'm allowed to say in the year 2017 over 150,000 people got better

538
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:29.570
at their jobs using virtual reality,
uh,

539
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:33.630
in similar techniques just to look around and get extra mental repetitions and

540
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.580
what goes into it as a motivation.
It's fun to do the efficacy.

541
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:39.190
It's a better way to train cause you've,
you've,
you feel like you're there.

542
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.290
The final one I'm gonna talk about,
and uh,
we're short on time,

543
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:45.400
so I'll be brief on this,

544
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:49.690
is we should use VR for things that are dangerous and the physical world.

545
00:30:49.691 --> 00:30:50.524
And you know,

546
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.320
one of the most dangerous things that all of us do far too often as drive cars

547
00:30:56.321 --> 00:31:00.850
killed 40,000 people last year,
1.3 million people worldwide.

548
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.050
You know,

549
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.290
we're going to look back someday and can you believe that we all gotten these

550
00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:06.160
metal boxes,

551
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.540
followed other people in metal boxes and spend an hour each day going back and

552
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:14.710
forth and uh,
you know,
we're not quite there where face to face meeting,

553
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.390
video conference doesn't work.

554
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:20.200
I've been tirelessly working on my colleagues on trying to come up with a set of

555
00:31:20.201 --> 00:31:23.410
nonverbal features that are sufficient enough to do what I call the virtual

556
00:31:23.411 --> 00:31:25.390
handshake.
Feeling like you're really with someone.

557
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.000
We've got a lot of work to do there.
But you know,
my,

558
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.640
my plea to the brilliant people in this room and the brilliant people watching

559
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:32.980
this video is what's make VR work.

560
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:34.870
I don't want to get rid of face to face conversation,

561
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.790
go to that party city or loved ones,

562
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.850
but we don't need to drive to work every day to clock on a computer and then

563
00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:42.370
drive home.
To sum up,

564
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:48.270
Justice Alito had a concurring opinion in a famous court case in 2011 in the

565
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.320
Supreme Court case,
the u s supreme court ruled that free speech,

566
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.590
Trump video game violence,
meaning that any video game,
no matter how violent,
uh,

567
00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.550
is free speech.
And I am a full believer in free speech.

568
00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:03.250
I'm very supportive of the Supreme Court and that,
you know,

569
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:05.500
people get to do art and we have free speech.

570
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:09.760
That's what makes America so special.
Alito wanted to flag something though.

571
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.230
He wrote what's called a concurring opinion,

572
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:13.060
which is he agreed with the majority,

573
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:16.300
but he wanted to flag an issue and it was about immersive virtual reality.

574
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.240
And in fact,
Alito quotes my last book,
infinite reality.

575
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.280
And what he says is that I believe in free speech and it trumps other concerns.

576
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.430
But there's something different about VR.
There's something about it,

577
00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:29.290
which it feels really real.

578
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.550
And the same standards that we've been applying to normal two d media might be a

579
00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:37.360
little different.
So,
um,
I don't come on stage today,
give you an answer.

580
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.300
I do agree with Justice Alito that there's something different about VR.

581
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.450
Free speech trumps all and we've got to figure out how to meld those two.
Uh,

582
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.670
the kind of take home standard that I've come up with for me personally and my

583
00:32:49.671 --> 00:32:52.610
friends and family that called me up and they say,
well,
what should I do in Vr?

584
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.180
Vr is meant for things that you cannot do in the real world.

585
00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:57.140
That's why it's there.

586
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.740
But if it's something that you wouldn't do in the real world that you feel bad

587
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:03.020
about yourself,
that you wouldn't want your friends know you did,

588
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.650
maybe that's not something you should be doing in Vr.
So,
uh,
on that note,

589
00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.690
I look forward to your questions and thank you for your attention.

590
00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:14.250
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

591
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.230
<v 3>thanks for coming in.
Thank you.
This caught my eye because as a consumer,</v>

592
00:33:19.231 --> 00:33:22.200
I read about Vr.
I hear about it a lot,

593
00:33:22.201 --> 00:33:27.201
but it still seems very kind of at arm's distance as a consumer.

594
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.270
Your arguments make perfect sense to me,

595
00:33:30.271 --> 00:33:35.220
but what's the tipping point for Vr to become kind of more,
I guess,

596
00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:39.750
accessible for the consumer?
Like what's the iPhone of Vr?

597
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.290
<v 0>So there's two things I'll say here.</v>

598
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.620
The first is when most people think about VR consumption,

599
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:50.020
if you imagine a graph where the x axis is years in the y axis is numbers

600
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:54.110
purchased,
some people are a little bit sad at,
at the,
at the slope of that curve.

601
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.170
But for Vr,
people that have been doing this for 20 years,

602
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.860
if you pull out and you extend that x axis,

603
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:05.390
what you see is this whoop,
really intense curve.
And personally,

604
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.640
I'm very comfortable at the rate that VR has been expanding.
Uh,
and,
uh,
you know,

605
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.390
what's perhaps what's,
we had a death in Russia according to Moscow News.
Um,

606
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.030
I'm thrilled we haven't had one in the United States.

607
00:34:17.031 --> 00:34:20.220
I'm just absolutely delighted by it.
And you know,

608
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.710
I liked the pace that we're going on.

609
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:25.850
We need to learn a lot about this technology before all of us are walking around

610
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:26.870
in these goggles all day long.

611
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:31.310
So my first answer is I know that you work at Google and you know,
we want to,

612
00:34:31.311 --> 00:34:33.290
you want to reach people.
That's what you guys do.

613
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.330
I'm really comfortable with where we're at.

614
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:40.160
The second answer to your question more functionally,
um,
in my opinion,

615
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.840
the roadblock and Vr content,
uh,

616
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:46.670
and if you think about how long it took to get to citizen Kane from the first

617
00:34:46.671 --> 00:34:51.380
moving picture,
it took some time and we just haven't nailed content.
Yeah.

618
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:54.680
There's no reason to be in Vr for that long.
And so,
you know,

619
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:59.420
w w if we give somebody demos,
it's an hour long demo session.

620
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.120
Our longest one is five or six minutes.
They do a lot of them.

621
00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:03.260
They were about a minute long.

622
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.060
The content is not quite there yet to justify you clearing out a room and you're

623
00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:11.360
in your garage.
And putting in this hardware.
So you have to make a,
you know,

624
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:13.640
great content,
then people will buy the widgets.

625
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:17.800
<v 4>So I'm thinking back to that original anecdote that you opened up with,
um,</v>

626
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.290
about the judge who was stepped off the plank and was diving at the like,

627
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.010
I would be that guy.
Um,
I haven't been in that many VR simulations.

628
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.030
You've been in countless,
I'm sure does it,
does it wear off it,

629
00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:30.260
but the reality we're off a bit.

630
00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:32.870
Do you kind of get used to it so you don't react that intensely?

631
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.320
<v 0>Um,
I'll tell you a story.
So with,
with the plank demos,
you know,</v>

632
00:35:37.321 --> 00:35:40.440
way back when I was actually doing code and now I'm just a figurehead that talks

633
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:41.720
all the time.
Um,

634
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.250
when I was programming my own pits and building the actual carving out the floor

635
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:51.960
and laying that plank down,
um,
I got a little bit desensitized to that one.

636
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:55.380
Um,
and I was able to kind of jump off and play because I'd spent so much time

637
00:35:55.381 --> 00:35:59.070
building it.
Uh,
when I visited one of my academic heroes,
his name is Fred Brooks.

638
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.250
He's a computer science professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel

639
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:05.220
Hill.
He had a pit that just had,
it wasn't the graphics,
it was,

640
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:09.630
the tracking was a higher update rate,
a more accurate,
uh,
lower latency.

641
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.870
And,
you know,
it was my plan to show off in front of him,
uh,

642
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.200
and just kind of jump off the pit.
But I was terrified and I couldn't do it.

643
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.420
He put a Napkin in my hand and my napkin could with sweat.
Uh,

644
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.640
to close the loop on that,

645
00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:24.570
I went to go visit a company called nomadic in San Rafael.

646
00:36:24.571 --> 00:36:26.700
They run these arcade systems,
uh,

647
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.120
and I have to say they've got a better pit than I have in my lab.
It's a,

648
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:34.860
it's the pit.
There's an actual wooden plank there.
Uh,
and it's really the,
they,

649
00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.810
they warp it so that it's wobbles and they track the wobbles.

650
00:36:37.811 --> 00:36:40.110
So you see it in Vr and they've got wind going.

651
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.150
But because of my lesson with Fred Brooks,

652
00:36:42.151 --> 00:36:47.020
I promised myself that I would never not step off a plank again.
Uh,
and,
um,

653
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.760
um,
so I was able to overcome that.
Um,
but,
uh,
it's still got me,

654
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:51.870
it hurt for me to do.

655
00:36:51.871 --> 00:36:54.610
I wanted to show off to these guys and I was the first person in the history of

656
00:36:54.611 --> 00:36:57.570
that ever stepped off their plank,
but I had to really tell myself to do it.

657
00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:58.310
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

658
00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:02.110
So it sounds like it may be very specific to the environment that you've gotten

659
00:37:02.111 --> 00:37:02.944
pretty accustomed to.

660
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.270
<v 0>So one of the questions I get in Vr is what's the effect of multiple doses?</v>

661
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:09.180
We're just starting to get a little handle on how long affects last with

662
00:37:09.181 --> 00:37:13.590
longitudinal studies and about five or six really rigorous studies will tell you

663
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:18.090
that the effects of Vr,
of these,
these treatments for empathy,
et Cetera,

664
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.420
if you look say two months later,
it's still outperforming the others.

665
00:37:21.421 --> 00:37:22.890
So we were starting to get a handle on that.

666
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:26.700
But in terms of the number of doses doing VR 10 times,
50 times,

667
00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.990
the one data point we have historically is for the folks that use Vr to treat

668
00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:33.870
phobias.
So before there was this consumer revolution,

669
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.410
there was a lot of brilliant people who are using Vr to teach fear of public

670
00:37:37.411 --> 00:37:41.720
speaking.
Fear of heights,
fear of spiders,
uh,
and it typically with,

671
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.520
with dcis,
with systematic desensitization,

672
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.490
what you have there is people come back for multiple sessions.
And so,
uh,

673
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.770
at least with those data points,

674
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.890
it's still intense for them over time in the fear context.
But your,
your,

675
00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:53.910
your larger point,

676
00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:56.940
which is all of these things are going to matter on what you're doing.

677
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.380
I totally agree with it's,
you know,

678
00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:01.920
I try not to overgeneralize sometimes I do it.
Thanks.

679
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.320
<v 5>Hey.
Hey,
come on.
I'm curious about you.</v>

680
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.510
So you just mentioned about your optimism in Vr generally.

681
00:38:09.511 --> 00:38:14.250
Can you talk about that?
A visa vi optimism for ar and you know,
the spectrum,
uh,

682
00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:17.640
of,
you know,
from mixed real and virtual.

683
00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.040
<v 0>So augmented reality for those that don't know is you're wearing normal glasses</v>

684
00:38:21.041 --> 00:38:24.400
that let light in from the physical room and you can overlay digital stuff on

685
00:38:24.401 --> 00:38:25.960
top so that everyone in this room,

686
00:38:25.961 --> 00:38:28.180
I could see a name tag floating over your head.
Um,

687
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:33.280
my lab is tunnel visioned on air right now.
We have two brilliant Grad students.

688
00:38:33.281 --> 00:38:36.160
That's all they're doing.
When I doing VR research,

689
00:38:36.161 --> 00:38:39.970
it was in 1999 it was new,
but there was still 300,

690
00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:44.110
maybe 500 published studies on psychology of Vr.
When you get to Ar,

691
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.040
there are some studies about usability,

692
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:50.890
about kind of perceptual features,
but the kind of work that I do,

693
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:54.400
which is what is the effect of me being in this room,
real people.

694
00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.500
And then there's a virtual person right here.

695
00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.040
How does that change the way that I exist in the world?
There's almost nothing.

696
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.150
So,
uh,
my collaborator Greg Welch at University of Central Florida,
he's done.

697
00:39:04.151 --> 00:39:07.360
He and I have collaborated a on,
we just published our first study,

698
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:12.130
which asks what happens when an Ar,
a virtual human outbreaks physics.

699
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.010
She walks through chairs and stuff.
Uh,

700
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.870
how that affects how you deal with that person later on.
Uh,

701
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:21.450
the work we're doing in my lab right now,
um,
there's just so much there.

702
00:39:21.451 --> 00:39:23.490
There's so many questions were to address.
We've,
we're,
we're,

703
00:39:23.491 --> 00:39:25.690
we're kind of sprinting on this cause there's no academic research.

704
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.730
We're asking the question,
if you think about what people are going to do an ar,

705
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:32.260
it's not going to be mundane stuff.
In other words,

706
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.020
I'm not going to bother to go into ar to,
uh,
to,

707
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:38.470
to just to do things that are boring.
You're going to really intense things.

708
00:39:38.471 --> 00:39:40.240
That's what you do in Vr,
good or bad.

709
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.060
If you go to your own life and think about the best thing that's ever happened

710
00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:44.710
to you or the worst thing that's ever happened to,

711
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.680
you can really imagine that place.
And if you go to the place,

712
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.460
you're going to have some emotion.

713
00:39:49.461 --> 00:39:52.720
And so the questions we're answering now are when you have an event occur to you

714
00:39:52.721 --> 00:39:56.440
in ar later on,
how do you feel about the space itself?

715
00:39:56.441 --> 00:40:01.000
Because you're going to see people doing stuff in physical spaces that are

716
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:03.730
compelling and how does that affect the way we live in the world?

717
00:40:03.731 --> 00:40:08.180
And so I'm tunnel vision on this as a lab.
We just don't know that much.
Yeah.

718
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.273
Thanks.
Hi.

719
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.580
<v 6>I don't think it's fine.
I have a question.</v>

720
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.700
So how do you see the future of VR playing in people doing work?

721
00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.340
How does the VR effect people?
Every work?

722
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:24.460
<v 0>So the where I can answer with great confidence is in the training,
right?</v>

723
00:40:24.461 --> 00:40:28.930
So,
uh,
we talked about the Walmart example.
Fidelity is using Vr to help its,

724
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:33.130
people in call centers have better empathy with the people that they're talking

725
00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:35.410
to on the phone so that they can basically beam into their,

726
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.670
into their living rooms.

727
00:40:36.671 --> 00:40:40.000
I think that's one aspect of training people do better at their jobs.

728
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.710
I truly believe the commuting,

729
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.970
the commuting one is it's going to be transformational.
Now,

730
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.220
it's only going to work at Vr as good enough that we can feel this magic where

731
00:40:49.221 --> 00:40:50.260
we call social presence.

732
00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:55.261
But the money companies will save because you don't have to fly someone halfway

733
00:40:55.361 --> 00:40:57.220
across the planet for a one hour long meeting.

734
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.500
You don't lose that hour on each end of the commute.

735
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:03.340
I think it's going to be spectacular.
But I will say I always try to be careful.

736
00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.120
Uh,
there's just a lot of things that don't need to be in Vr,
right?

737
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:11.050
So most of your daily work is going to be just fine on the computer.

738
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:13.360
You don't have to gratuitously stick it in Vr.
And,

739
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:17.320
and a nice data point here is when,
uh,
when we went through the Walmart handbook,

740
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:20.710
they've got this amazing handbook on how to train at Walmart and how to do your

741
00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:23.770
job better.
You know,
we had choices of hundreds and hundreds of anecdotes.

742
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:24.760
We didn't build a hundreds.

743
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.150
We built a dozen because we wanted to focus on the things that are going to be

744
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:31.270
great in Vr,
for example.
Things that require you to look around,

745
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.190
things that might be dangerous to do in real.
There's,
there's,

746
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:37.230
there's things that work in Vr and it's really not for everything.
Uh,
you know,
I,

747
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.770
I hope if there's any lesson that comes out of this talk,

748
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:41.840
I do not believe we should use VR for everything.

749
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.340
Let's save it for the things that work.

750
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:47.750
So the two answers your question training and productivity because you can take

751
00:41:47.751 --> 00:41:49.460
more meetings and you don't lose a commute.

752
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:55.100
<v 7>I agree with a lot of what you're saying about,
um,
what,
uh,</v>

753
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.160
what's possible in Vr.
And,
um,

754
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.980
as well as what you said in relation to film,

755
00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:03.230
how it took certain amount of time before you have a,

756
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.110
a masterpiece type of the film.
Um,

757
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:10.810
I was wondering if your lab offers grants to,
um,

758
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.010
content creators in that realm,

759
00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:18.011
like specifically in relation to like film or art or if you know of any,

760
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.290
um,
in this way,
cause I agree with you that it does,

761
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.820
the level of it rising depends on consecration is what you said.
Um,

762
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:29.570
so wondering if there are any possibilities in that that you would give to

763
00:42:29.571 --> 00:42:31.520
independent artists or filmmakers.

764
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:36.260
<v 0>So,
so what my lab does first of all is we give pro bono advice to just about any</v>

765
00:42:36.261 --> 00:42:37.940
artists who asks.

766
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:41.630
We get free tours to people who are in the bay area that wanted to get the,

767
00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.220
the deep dive on what works and what doesn't.
Um,

768
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.040
I'm happy to share with you the syllabus.

769
00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:50.930
We pioneered a course at Stanford called immersive journalism and this was,
um,

770
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.110
it wasn't just about journalism,
it was about storytelling.
And it was a,

771
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.360
what we did in the classes.
We didn't do technology.

772
00:42:56.361 --> 00:42:59.570
We had a bunch of really smart storytellers.
Uh,
uh,

773
00:42:59.571 --> 00:43:02.270
there was actually a woman named Jerry piglets and Janine Zacharia,

774
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.310
that coat taught the class,
really amazing storytellers.
Uh,

775
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.720
we just critiqued everything that had ever been done and we pulled things that

776
00:43:08.721 --> 00:43:12.320
worked and that didn't and I'm happy to share that syllabus with you.
Um,

777
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.330
<v 7>I think these are,
this is a great case study.</v>

778
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:18.260
What you're saying and what I was asking was say for example,

779
00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:22.400
I'm an artist now I'm a content creator and I know how to create a story with

780
00:43:22.401 --> 00:43:26.270
empathy or something.
How do I get a grant to do that?

781
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:27.650
That was sort of the question.

782
00:43:27.651 --> 00:43:31.700
Or if I know somebody who's can do something with virtual reality that hasn't

783
00:43:31.701 --> 00:43:32.534
been done,

784
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:37.130
like you've talked about a small form of like this about homelessness,

785
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.660
some other situations,
uh,
how does an artist,
uh,

786
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:45.620
get a grant to do something but not from like a company perspective too?

787
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.140
Like something like Google and I'm thinking outside of,

788
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.700
<v 0>yeah.
So I'll answer what I know cause I,
I'm,</v>

789
00:43:50.701 --> 00:43:53.350
I'm a very bad artist and a decent social scientists.

790
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.690
The foundations have been really supportive to me.

791
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.960
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
Gordon,
Betty Moore Foundation,

792
00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:04.230
Mayfield Foundation,
or sorry,
the May Day Foundation.
Um,

793
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:09.990
if your content aligns with their topics,
uh,
there's,

794
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:14.040
there's good money for that and you can make small money go a long way these

795
00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.630
days.
Um,
the other thing I will think about it as the other,

796
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:21.410
the large organization.
So my lab,
I have hosted visits from just this year,

797
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:26.430
probably a dozen nonprofits ranging from planned parenthood to the World

798
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.860
Wildlife Foundation to the Red Cross.

799
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:34.460
They're all looking for virtual reality simulations that can help them get their

800
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:39.930
message out.
Um,
that being said,
they all tend to have their own storytellers,

801
00:44:39.931 --> 00:44:43.470
so they tend to be looking for support on the,
on the code side.
However,

802
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:47.940
I truly believe that that creating good narrative is the roadblock and a lot of

803
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:48.774
ways.
So it just,
I,

804
00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:51.780
I would just ask early and often and have a thick skin on the nose.

805
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.520
<v 8>Thank you.
Yeah.
Apologies in advance.</v>

806
00:44:55.521 --> 00:44:57.710
A few actually do answer this in your book,

807
00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.740
but so when you talk about using your technology to show people what the effects

808
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:11.660
of climate change or deforestation are by having them cut down a tree or

809
00:45:11.661 --> 00:45:14.480
experience a single,
not sure disaster,

810
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.750
how does that scale up from,
okay,

811
00:45:17.751 --> 00:45:20.360
I cut down a tree to Oh my God,

812
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:24.680
we are actually getting rid of rain forest or cause one person cutting down one

813
00:45:24.681 --> 00:45:29.240
tree on its own doesn't seem like it would have that effect.

814
00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.360
<v 0>So one of my appointments at Stanford,
I'm a,</v>

815
00:45:32.361 --> 00:45:35.470
I'm a senior fellow at the Woods Institute for the environment and we think a

816
00:45:35.471 --> 00:45:39.370
lot about how to communicate climate change in the sense that it is frustrating

817
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:44.510
that one person,
you know,
we can do better but we can't solve the problem.
And uh,

818
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.260
the two answers I have to that are,
one is it's still good to do better.
Uh,

819
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:52.240
and you know,
changing the car you drive and what you eat everyday can,

820
00:45:52.241 --> 00:45:55.740
can make some type of difference.
The second answer is that,
you know,

821
00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.010
I can talk about under the previous administration,

822
00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.550
I spent a lot of time working with USA ID.
Uh,

823
00:46:00.551 --> 00:46:05.470
and these were building virtual simulations to target leaders in the developing

824
00:46:05.471 --> 00:46:10.390
nations because the truth is climate change is here now and we have to focus on

825
00:46:10.391 --> 00:46:14.500
adaptation,
right?
And so we do a lot of work on,
you know,
what,
you know,
Polo,

826
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.500
they can't reduce our carbon footprint and expect that to change anything.

827
00:46:17.501 --> 00:46:20.640
They only have 20,000 people.
They can stop the commercial farming,

828
00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.420
prevent runoff that kills the reef.

829
00:46:22.421 --> 00:46:24.430
They can regulate commercial fishing a little bit more.

830
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:29.220
<v 8>Well,
I guess my question is more from a psychological standpoint,</v>

831
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:31.290
like for you are a pile example.

832
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.680
You can actually show them through an eight minute scuba dive with the timelapse

833
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.670
the effects of their current environment over time.

834
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:46.740
But one person cutting down one tree in that one restricted simulation that's

835
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:51.270
not going to show the full effect in the immersive environment.
So,

836
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.620
Yup.
So that's my question.
How does that scale up psychologically?

837
00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.290
<v 0>Yes.
Um,
so the two answers to that or that's why we,</v>

838
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.610
so the early work had to give me the confidence as a scientist know that this

839
00:47:03.611 --> 00:47:05.980
stuff actually as a medium is effective.

840
00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:10.000
And so a lot of that early work that the tree study again is over a decade old

841
00:47:10.001 --> 00:47:15.001
now is just to prove to myself that it's okay to actually go to larger upscale

842
00:47:15.371 --> 00:47:16.300
type simulations.

843
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.440
The second answer is I don't think VR is great for the macro stuff.
And so,

844
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.780
you know what,
on the climate change side,

845
00:47:22.781 --> 00:47:25.960
when you've got to learn about all these complex systems where you're seeing how

846
00:47:25.961 --> 00:47:29.320
weather patterns use a computer for that,
VR is not for everything.

847
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:33.130
And the computers work really well.
The best online learning materials,

848
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:36.910
in my humble opinion is Chris DDS,
uh,
for,
he's a Harvard psychologist,

849
00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:41.110
he's got something called eco move and river city and he's hundreds of thousands

850
00:47:41.111 --> 00:47:44.920
of students and he's shown real differences in learning from that.

851
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:48.490
And it's a complicated thing where you're running experiments and talking to

852
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:50.830
other people and that they're in there for hours.

853
00:47:50.831 --> 00:47:53.080
You don't want to be in Vr for hours.
So for the macro stuff,

854
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:57.400
I don't want to cheapen the science and to,
to kind of this Aha moment.

855
00:47:57.401 --> 00:47:59.560
That's a five minute thing.
The way that I think about it,

856
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:00.970
let's do the macro stuff.

857
00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.750
You learn these complex relationships then go in Vr and experience the intensity

858
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:05.490
of it.

859
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:06.630
<v 8>Oh,
okay.
I see.</v>

860
00:48:06.631 --> 00:48:11.100
So it's more about making people feel like they are responsive.

861
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.280
They are part of the problem directly.

862
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.730
<v 0>Well I think we should continue to talk about everything.
It's good for.
So with,</v>

863
00:48:17.731 --> 00:48:19.650
with,
with the leaders,
that's why I brought up allow,

864
00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.540
this was not for the citizens,

865
00:48:21.541 --> 00:48:24.660
this was for the 26 people who are making the laws in plow.
Right.

866
00:48:24.661 --> 00:48:29.310
And that scales,
right.
So when it comes to citizen,
uh,
so when I work with USA id,

867
00:48:29.311 --> 00:48:33.630
we were trying to brainstorm where we can be helpful to give leaders of

868
00:48:33.631 --> 00:48:37.140
countries more information to make better informed decisions about their climate

869
00:48:37.141 --> 00:48:38.760
policies or their adaptation policies.

870
00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:41.980
<v 8>Oh,
what about the opposite issue that for instance,</v>

871
00:48:41.981 --> 00:48:43.360
in the empathy at the beginning,

872
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:49.000
the opposite issue would be if somebody sees that the reflection has changed,

873
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:54.610
what happens if the shock of seeing that change cancels out?

874
00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:57.010
So the rest of the experience.

875
00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:03.910
<v 0>So we pilot test a lot with this stuff and we make mistakes early on with small</v>

876
00:49:04.131 --> 00:49:06.620
samples.
When we ever were present a study,

877
00:49:06.621 --> 00:49:10.580
it's usually because we failed a dozen times and what we ended up presenting is

878
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:14.390
not from a statistical sense for those who pay attention to p hacking a in a,

879
00:49:14.391 --> 00:49:19.070
in a formal pilot studies were qualitatively we do designing and we find out

880
00:49:19.071 --> 00:49:22.370
what is going to not cause that shock to take you out of the experience.

881
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:23.740
<v 8>Okay.
So,</v>

882
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:29.040
so I would just have to get a little bit more nuanced insight into exactly what

883
00:49:29.201 --> 00:49:31.390
you did and I assumed that book provides that.

884
00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:37.070
<v 0>Well,
yes.
However,
no I,
this is in its infancy.</v>

885
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:37.461
You don't,

886
00:49:37.461 --> 00:49:41.330
I'm presenting my work and I'm trying not to present it as if we've discovered

887
00:49:41.331 --> 00:49:41.721
everything.

888
00:49:41.721 --> 00:49:46.220
Most academic fields have got hundreds if not thousands of people converging.

889
00:49:46.221 --> 00:49:49.450
On a topic in the history of Vr,
social science,
there's about four,

890
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.870
<v 8>right?</v>

891
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:53.990
I'm actually appreciate this talk for that attitude that you present it with.

892
00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:57.830
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate your questions.
Okay.
All right.

893
00:49:57.831 --> 00:50:00.010
Thank you all for coming and let's please thank our speaker.

894
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:00.640
<v 1>Good as well.</v>
