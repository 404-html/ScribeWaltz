00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.410
Hi.
Thank you.
Welcome.

2
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.920
My name is Magali [inaudible] Martinez and my co Creator in all things.

3
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:23.200
Genesis Watson.
Hartsough.
Um,
so a little bit,
we'll talk a about,
uh,

4
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.120
genesis.
What is,
what is genesis,
what we aim to do?
Um,

5
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.150
so genesis is a nonprofit here in Los Angeles that aims to foster and strengthen

6
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.710
and expand access to dynamic and interactive and comprehensive,

7
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.830
um,

8
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.830
stem experiences primarily in underserved communities throughout Los Angeles.

9
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.333
Um,

10
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.050
so we do this by dropping a mobile stem lab,

11
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.130
state of the art mobile stem lab.
It's about like 36 feet.

12
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.640
And we interchange it with anything from computers and laptops to three d

13
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:06.040
printers to laser cutters.
We can,

14
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.670
for whatever stem experience we want to create,
we,
we,

15
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.060
we re we shifted around so that it fits the theme and the experiences that we

16
00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:19.900
want the young people to,
to have.
Um,
again,

17
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.220
we're primarily dropping this genesis mobile innovation lab in underserved

18
00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:28.510
communities,
high poverty areas with underperforming schools.

19
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.913
Um,

20
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.820
we are popup experiences have included robotics and assisted devices or our

21
00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:40.090
young people have actually built,
um,

22
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.240
and three d printed hands for about accounts that they sent to children in third

23
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:52.750
world countries that had lost their lens.
Um,
we also have a game design lab,

24
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.560
so we will shift our pod,

25
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.440
that's what we call our mobile innovation lab.
Our pod,

26
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.210
we shifted and turn it into a k a game studio.
Um,

27
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.240
this summer we introduced smart machines and smart cities are two latest stem

28
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:12.190
popup experiences.

29
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.470
And you'll see here where we're actually going to demo our smart machines,

30
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:22.471
which was designed and built and iterated over three popups with about 60 group,

31
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.270
60 young people from harbor city to southeast Los Angeles to South La.

32
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.020
Um,
okay.
And so,
uh,

33
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.440
at the center or we sent her all of our experiences in design principles that

34
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.470
meant most of the design principles come out of the MIT media lab.

35
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.580
I'm Mitchell Resnick's work,
which was inspired by pairs work,

36
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.410
which is centered on constructivism and hands on learning.

37
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.950
So are our design principles augment a child's experience with stem learning no

38
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.610
matter what their interest level.
So there's many paths,
many styles.

39
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.350
It's hands on,
self directed,
a constructivist transparent.

40
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:12.790
What we mean by transparent is we bring the,
the inside of the machine outside,

41
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.240
we want the kids to be able to see what,
um,
what creates,

42
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:20.290
what's the inside pieces that make these machines and tech go.

43
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.520
Um,

44
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.200
we emphasize process over product and of course we're experimenting,

45
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:30.520
exploring.
And as a result,
the young people are constantly discovering.

46
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.900
Our goal is 100% engagement.

47
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.310
Every single time we pop up.
Um,

48
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.680
the goal is 100%.
And so far so good.
So far,
so good.
If you,

49
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:46.600
if you come to our popups,
uh,

50
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:50.170
you'll see a 100% engagement and,
and

51
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.510
100%.
So all the students that come in,
let's say we have 40 students,

52
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.700
it usually we have about 2018 to 20 students.

53
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.270
All 20 students are engaged in some aspect or some element of the experience.

54
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.770
So it's designed with multiple points of entry.

55
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.300
We'll have arts and crafts at one table.
We call it our operating system.

56
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.660
So it's like this little hub where there's tinkering,
there's designing,

57
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:22.900
there's arts and crafts,
there's world building,
their storytelling,

58
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.490
computer programming.

59
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.730
Everyone has an opportunity to touch every aspect of the hub,

60
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.790
but then they also choose where they're going to spend the rest of their time.

61
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.920
Um,
so that's what I mean.
Does that answer the question?
Sweet.

62
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.320
Um,
um,

63
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.980
we're going to actually play a video while I share the story of,

64
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:49.960
of young hot when I'm so hot.

65
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:50.910
When,
uh,

66
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.010
we met at a 49th street elementary school in southeast Los Angeles.

67
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.450
And just to paint a little picture,
southeast La,
um,

68
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.610
is a neighborhood with high levels of poverty underperforming schools.

69
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.580
Um,
uh,
one of the days that we were there,
we,

70
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.610
we had to lock down the campus because the helicopters,

71
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.640
you know,
we're hovering really low.
And the kid said,
okay,
we have to go.

72
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:20.350
We have to go on lockdown.
Um,

73
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.390
so just to give you a sense of the communities that we're dropping into,

74
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.220
this is a unique opportunity for,
for the young folks.
Um,

75
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:34.990
it's Kinda like the carnival is coming into town,
the circus is coming into town.

76
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.120
Um,
but it's a stem circus.
So when this young child,

77
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.320
the staff,
um,
afterwards when I went to meet with the staff,

78
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.650
they said to me,
um,
we weren't sure if hot when,

79
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.180
if we were going to let him participate because he has a severe learning

80
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.060
disability and um,

81
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.840
they let him come to our,
our,
our pop up.
I'm glad they did.

82
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.600
As soon as I noticed how it,
when I noticed he was fidgeting,

83
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:05.270
he was trying to stay in place,
but he was moving around,
moving around.

84
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.220
So I walked over to him and I shared,
I gave him some pipe cleaners and a job.

85
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.930
I said,
hey,
can you help me create,
um,
some,
I can't remember what it was,

86
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:19.520
some element of our smart machine.
At first he looked at me,
you know,

87
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:23.810
before I add,
before I gave him the job,
like he was nervous,

88
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:27.020
like he was going to get kicked out.
And when I gave him the job,

89
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.770
he just smiled beaming wide.
Together,

90
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:32.510
we're working on the pipe cleaners.

91
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.010
And it wasn't until later that I realized that he had a severe learning
disorder,

92
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.720
learning disability.
We worked with him.
Uh,
he worked with all of us.

93
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:44.170
That was,
this is the day that our Googlers,
um,

94
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.250
came to join us and he actually built some of the most intricate,

95
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.770
most detailed,
um,
what were those bumpers?
Those are bumpers,

96
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:57.650
right?
Yeah.
He,
he built some of the most intricate,

97
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:02.510
most detailed bumpers that we had seen in the entire trajectory.

98
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.670
All three popups.
His bumpers were the most detailed and creative.
Um,

99
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.080
when I went back to talk to,
to the,
to his,
to the staff at les best,

100
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:17.081
they said that his parents thank them for allowing him to be a part of the

101
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:22.700
genesis popup.
Um,
because prior to that,

102
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.470
the only subjects he talked about are the only topics he talked about.

103
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.540
Um,
where Jim in lunch,

104
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.680
and this was the first time that he talked about computers.

105
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.910
So the parents are very,
um,
they wanted to know more,

106
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.380
how can we get our kid involved in more,
um,
computer classes.

107
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.330
Now I have to tell you about my little friend Andre.
He was over at challengers,

108
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.740
um,
boys and girls club.
And the reason I share these stories,

109
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.370
these inspired beginning stories is just to give you a face.

110
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.640
Um,
and,
and you know,

111
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:06.140
real young people that are experiencing these popups.

112
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:07.670
We save these numbers.

113
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:12.200
We've reached over 150 to 200 kids this summer.
Um,

114
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.940
but just to give you a sense of that,

115
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:18.770
the young people that we are touching and reaching and connecting with Andre,

116
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:20.950
he's about six years old.
Um,

117
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.970
he was considered one of the most challenged members at the club.

118
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.410
I didn't know that.
We invite everyone multiple paths of entry.

119
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.390
As long as he was interested.

120
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.380
He kept wandering over to our pod.

121
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.740
I'm wandering over to our tents and didn't want to join his group,

122
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.410
his age group.
And we said,
that's okay.
He can stay.

123
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.480
And so staff members kept coming up to me,
is it okay if he stays?
I said,
yeah,

124
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:51.021
he could stay.

125
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:55.570
So he was there every single day and other younger kids started to join the pop

126
00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:56.880
up.
So we ended up,

127
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:02.090
we had originally had 30 scheduled and we ended up with about 60 in that one.

128
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.750
Uh,
challengers.

129
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.610
And so Andre was the cutest.
Uh,
he,

130
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.100
he was always getting in trouble at the club,

131
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.200
but they knew that if he was over at the pop up at Genesis,
he was fine.

132
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.820
He was not going to be,
he was not going to get in trouble.
Um,
they would ask him,

133
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:25.380
the staff members would ask him,
Hey,
what are you doing over there?
It's like,
oh,

134
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.120
I'm being creative.
And so when,
when he'd asked staff members,

135
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:34.820
could he leave to go to genesis?
They said,
well,
what,
where do you,
what,
what,

136
00:09:34.821 --> 00:09:38.280
what are you going to go do?
He says,
well,
I'm going to go do science.
So for us,

137
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:43.281
it was this beautiful moment of him realizing that science and creativity,

138
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.210
um,
they work together,
they can be fun.
Um,

139
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.600
so I met his foster mom afterwards and she said,
oh,

140
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:56.340
my son keeps coming home talking about computers and creativity and science.

141
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.160
Um,
is this,
you know,
what's genesis?

142
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:03.480
And so I introduced them to some more steam programs in the community.

143
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.823
Um,

144
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.280
but she said we've been trying to figure out a way to get him engaged in stem.

145
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:15.570
Uh,
but he never showed any interest.
So that's,

146
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.860
that's Andre and then,
uh,
yeah.

147
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.793
All right.

148
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.830
So where we met Andre and hot when we met them at our genesis stems summer pop

149
00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:32.070
up,
uh,
you see here next to me,
uh,
uh,

150
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:36.330
smart pinball machine made 100%,

151
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.550
well not 100% cause we got some tech,

152
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.970
but it's made from sustainable from recycled materials.

153
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.470
We go to a place called trash for teaching and Gardena and pick up,

154
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.270
well was it a hundred pounds of stuff?
Yeah,

155
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.300
like a hundred plus pounds of recycled trash materials.

156
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.420
And we dropped them off with all these kids.

157
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.730
And we have a few,
you know,

158
00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:05.490
we have some guidelines and some structures in place,

159
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:07.080
but we're basically saying to them,
hey,

160
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:11.250
your design challenge is to create a smart pinball machine that not only you

161
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:12.180
want to play,

162
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.530
but also that other young people throughout Los Angeles will want to play.

163
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:22.670
And so this is our smart machine powered by the imagination of young people.

164
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.740
Um,
I am going to hand off to my Buddy Watson,

165
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:29.940
uh,

166
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.570
he's going to talk a bit about how the machine was transformed in ways that we

167
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:34.800
could not have imagined.

168
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:38.970
He'll just take us through the trajectory of the smart machine and because

169
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:40.650
there's so few of us here,

170
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.300
is it okay if people kind of come up for this part of the talk?
Is that okay?

171
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.340
Come on up.
If you want to stay seated.
That's,
that's cool too.

172
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:53.650
But come take a look at the machine that was and

173
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.490
<v 2>built and created by,
I dunno,
60 plus kids</v>

174
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:04.150
and Watson.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So,
um,

175
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.320
luckily for us,
um,

176
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.350
most kids don't know what pinball machines are anymore.
So,
um,
our,

177
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.550
our job of reimagining the pinball machine was made much easier because we

178
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:19.690
didn't have them saying,
well,
this doesn't look like a pinball machine.
Um,

179
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.140
and really we sort of like boiled it down to a few different skills that we

180
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:28.040
wanted to scaffold on top of this.
Um,

181
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.140
and they were all around rapid prototyping,
experimentation,

182
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:36.580
testing and tinkering because we're asking them to build something that nobody

183
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:39.460
really knew how to build.
We had no idea what this was going to look at.

184
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.750
It was completely a codesign process with them.
Um,

185
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.910
clearly whenever they're using,
um,
like there'd be like,
oh,

186
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:50.130
I want to cut a whole year so we're not going to just hand out exacto knives.
Um,

187
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:56.020
one of us will help them make their designs into reality.
Um,

188
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.450
but as we were moving through this design process,

189
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.403
um,

190
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:07.470
what we ended up seeing was that the more open space we gave for them,

191
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:11.150
the more we were impressed with what they came up with.

192
00:13:11.151 --> 00:13:13.450
That was beyond what we could imagine.
Um,

193
00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:16.880
so for those of you who are classic pin ballers,
um,

194
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.010
you should know there are elements that are incorporated into this that do

195
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:23.920
resemble and original pinball machine.
So,
um,

196
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:29.050
we sort of broke it down into three simple game mechanics to explain to them.
Um,

197
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.370
you have targets which are buttons that you hit that give you points.

198
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.910
This is connected using a Makey Makey to uh,

199
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.950
a simple graphic programming language called scratch,
which is out at Mit.

200
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.400
I'm an obstacle is anything that gets in the way of you hitting a target and

201
00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:48.934
getting points.

202
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.620
And then a bumper is something that's really not maliciously trying to stop you

203
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:54.490
from getting points,

204
00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:59.491
but you can bump into it and it'll spin or light up or something like this.

205
00:13:59.551 --> 00:14:03.230
Something kind of like what hot created.
Um,

206
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.680
sorta just adding,
adding to the experience of the machine tells me how to slope.

207
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.740
Um,
yeah,
so,
so the,

208
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.420
the other important piece of,
of the game,
um,
is,

209
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.750
is are these robotic balls,
um,
for the name of Sphero.
Um,

210
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.720
so the kids,
you can learn basic programming with these,

211
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:26.420
but it's a lot more fun to just drive them and control them.
Um,

212
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.130
at the center of the design challenge for making the game as smug Elise was

213
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:33.470
saying is it has to be fun.
It can't be,
um,

214
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.740
something that just sits here and looks like a pile of trash.

215
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:38.200
This is like carefully engineered fun.

216
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.790
This was like everything here is here with a purpose.
Um,

217
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.850
and the fun that we had was structured on this idea that in pinball it needs to

218
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.450
be a game of skill.

219
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.610
So not anybody can just walk up to it and come and beat the game.

220
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.050
You have to really,
um,

221
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.050
have practiced and you have to know how to control this fall.
So out of that,
um,

222
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.060
immediately whenever you have a hoard of kids around when these machines,

223
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:06.950
it became apparent that we needed a way to say your turn is over.
And,

224
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.280
um,
the kids came up with that in an elegant way.
Um,
let's see,

225
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.350
like giving me the controller.

226
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.490
So thus was born the idea of the trap.
And as you can see it there,

227
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.560
there's a trap over here.
There's a trap.
Um,

228
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.970
this is sort of like the pit of despair.
Once you go inside this box,

229
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:27.670
it's very hard to get out.
Um,

230
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.330
but all of these were sort of mechanisms that the kids came up with to make it

231
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.220
to the game,
kept moving and it had a,

232
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.990
had a rhythm and allowed everybody to play it.
Um,

233
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.440
one of the most beautiful parts of this,

234
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.470
the testing of this machine is that we do try to get in,

235
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.130
um,
expand access to the machine and the test,

236
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.410
the play testing period.
So,
um,

237
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.390
our young designers who'd been working throughout the week on this at the end of

238
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:56.780
the week,
um,

239
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.660
get to present it to the rest of the boys and girls club and have younger kids

240
00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:03.950
come and play and get their feedback.
What's fun,
what wasn't fun,

241
00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:06.890
what would be cool?
This would be neat if I had plexi glass this,

242
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:08.990
it'd be cool if it blew up right here.

243
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:13.070
Like this would be cool if it made a cat noise.
Um,

244
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.490
but it,
it was just another way to get the input of,

245
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.460
of this other generation of kids,
multiple things going on.

246
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.710
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
So we actually,
we are,
this is a,</v>

247
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.190
I guess the fourth iteration.
Yeah,
there were many iterations within,

248
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.090
in between them.
But for the example,

249
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.870
this trap was created by the first group of kids in South Bay and then I believe

250
00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:40.540
these were created and with those charges,
yeah.
Can,

251
00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:44.640
we had a total of three popups.
Um,
yeah.

252
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.370
And then this was challengers as well.

253
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.610
It was actually really interesting to see how they were building on top of each

254
00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:51.690
other's ideas.

255
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.710
And then how our final papa you can talk a little bit more about challenges and

256
00:16:55.711 --> 00:16:57.060
how they activated the,

257
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.650
they really opened up the imagination for more arts and story and world building

258
00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.210
at challengers.

259
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.010
<v 2>Yeah.
So this thing has been through a lot.
It has a,</v>

260
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:11.240
it has more tape than anything else at this point it seems like and that is

261
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:13.280
because this thing has been played.
Um,

262
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.180
ms thing has been used by kids and it was in a really,

263
00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:19.940
really sorry state at our last pop up.
Um,

264
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.360
and we gave these to sort of more experienced designers where we said,

265
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.300
all right your guys job and make this just as sturdy as possible.

266
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.830
And there are all these like inbuilt little obstacles that we had made where

267
00:17:29.831 --> 00:17:33.080
they're like,
oh,
this'll be great for them to put electronics on and stuff.

268
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.280
And these kids in this redesign,
they just got rid of everything I just said.

269
00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:42.260
It's a box now,
but it's a strong box
in what the,

270
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:47.300
what this did though is it opened up the game board completely and now there was

271
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:51.390
no real constraint.
There weren't walls anymore.

272
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:55.920
There were just these boxes that can be taken on and off.

273
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.540
And when that happened,
each of these boxes became a different world.

274
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.580
The kids were able to start designing them.

275
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.830
So there was some star wars kids that were like,

276
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:06.720
this is the dark side because it's really,

277
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:10.340
really challenging and like nobody wants to go up this,
um,

278
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.530
this was considered to be like this like Celestial Palace,
um,

279
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.800
up here where that's like worth the most points,

280
00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:21.420
but it's also very challenging to get to the pit of despair clearly is some

281
00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:26.340
place you want to avoid.
Um,
but as this was happening,
um,

282
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.200
it opened up this whole other world of,

283
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.790
of kids being able to come and start getting engaged with it.

284
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.490
If you see that little character right there,
um,

285
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:42.780
these started getting reproduced at a amazing rate.

286
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.110
One Kidney,
I had to do it.
And he taught all the other kids and quickly,

287
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:50.370
all the levels got filled up with these characters.
Um,
and they're,

288
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:53.190
they're so cute.
They all got taken afterwards because the kids love them.

289
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:56.940
But we're able to save one.
Um,
but,

290
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
but it was sort of this realization at the end of the day as I just sat staring

291
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:07.410
at this,
um,
sort of like open box was that in a way,
what this is,

292
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:12.130
is a,
a new sandbox,
right?
Um,

293
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:18.170
and what it's doing is mixing digital and physical computing in a single space.

294
00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:23.490
So you're able to,
to use trash,
you're able to use tape,

295
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:27.240
you're able to use things that are engaging for somebody who likes to use their

296
00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:31.440
hands,
but you're also learning the basics of computational thinking,

297
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.070
um,
in a way that you really sort of like,

298
00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:37.230
it's like you get tricked into taking your medicine,

299
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.850
<v 0>right?
Uh,
and then with,
you know,
the Sphero and we also activated ozobots.</v>

300
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:46.260
You can program them so you can teach young people and in very incremental
steps,

301
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.880
programming and computer programming.

302
00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:51.600
And by them being able to place it inside of the game right away,

303
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:54.030
they have that instant gratification that they can see,

304
00:19:54.031 --> 00:19:57.450
feel and touch and also challenged their friends.
Hey,

305
00:19:57.451 --> 00:20:00.870
I programmed it to do this and I did that better than you.

306
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:05.300
Or maybe we can work together to challenge the next group of kids.
So it's,

307
00:20:05.301 --> 00:20:08.670
it's just a fun way.
Um,
I I find to,

308
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.030
to begin to teach coding and computational thinking.

309
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.330
<v 2>I was gonna I was wondering if you guys want it.</v>

310
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:22.110
I was hoping you want it to play.
Yeah.
Um,
okay,
cool.

311
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.830
So let's see here.

312
00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.460
<v 0>Oh,
I have to take photographs to see this,</v>

313
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.310
but that's how the kids here machine was played at Google.
Okay.

314
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.240
So don't,
they're going to love it.
Is it okay if I take photos of cool.

315
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.100
Cool.
Awesome.

316
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.300
<v 2>So you're the one who volunteered to do the Guinea pig.</v>

317
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.890
<v 0>Yes.
On let's do it.</v>

318
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.650
<v 2>No,
this first experience is really fun.</v>

319
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.250
If you want to just do what you think you should do,
it's pretty intuitive.

320
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.310
<v 1>That sounds great.</v>

321
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.490
<v 2>All right,
so let's try to,
to get that button up and running.</v>

322
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.680
I have to hit it with a little bit more force.

323
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.583
<v 1>No.</v>

324
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:22.030
<v 2>See if we can get two of them going at the same time.</v>

325
00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.940
So the,
the other thing that happens,
uh,

326
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.430
whenever all these obstacles started getting placed around,
it was the,

327
00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:35.020
it became a team affair.

328
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.300
So it might be challenging for you to see you this right now,
but I tempted or,

329
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.810
yeah.
Okay.
Awesome.
You made it through.

330
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.110
You have to go through,
through the pit of despair or the there.

331
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.020
There may or may not be a secret court order.
I can't,
I can't give that away.

332
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

333
00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.560
<v 2>What do all the other things on there do those are,
those are all um,</v>

334
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:06.520
part of the APP.
This is so no,
no effective.
Yeah,
yeah,

335
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:10.580
yeah.
That's not,
let's just say stay focused on trying to hit these buttons.

336
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.310
That's the way you get points.
All right.
So

337
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:19.800
it's good though.
That all is like attached to the ball.
Yes.

338
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.550
And so one of the,

339
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:26.570
one of the things that we do in teaching science with this is there's a lot of

340
00:22:26.571 --> 00:22:31.250
things that didn't make it onto this board.
These represent the best components.

341
00:22:31.251 --> 00:22:34.940
We probably made about 50 buttons.
Um,

342
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:39.560
and we would sort of like test them to see how many times hitting it does it get

343
00:22:39.561 --> 00:22:43.040
triggered?
And we would teach the buttons in a really simple way.

344
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.990
A button is just that right there.
Um,
but that's a bad button.
So that's the hit.

345
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.250
Unless you wanna do you wanna try it?
Try it.
Try from up here,
sort of like this,

346
00:22:55.251 --> 00:22:59.980
this upper spine point and see if you can navigate the,
the upper zone.

347
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:05.290
<v 1>Winter break.
Okay.
What's the age?</v>

348
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.700
<v 0>So for this one,
we had anywhere from six years old to 16.</v>

349
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:11.630
Uh,

350
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:16.630
the program was designed for fourth graders through ninth graders.

351
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.650
And what's the gender breakdown at Ellis best?
It was 50,
50.

352
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:26.300
About,
um,
let's see.
Let me go here.

353
00:23:26.301 --> 00:23:29.590
We had a group at challengers where it was,
this is a hard one.

354
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:34.820
See 5% groups and they followed the entire process.

355
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.990
They were able to drop in and out that this group of girls,

356
00:23:38.991 --> 00:23:43.180
you'll see them there.
They were there the entire time.
They would stay hours.

357
00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:44.893
It's amazing.

358
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.370
<v 3>That's amazing correction.
Yeah.</v>

359
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.630
<v 2>Yeah.
So now it,
now it'd be the time there'd be like,
this is too easy.</v>

360
00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:59.573
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

361
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.860
<v 3>So this is,
this is all dynamic.
Is that right?
So like this stuff is not,</v>

362
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.600
<v 2>oh yeah.
Nothing here is this is all men.
This is like a block set essentially.</v>

363
00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:13.210
Like this is meant to be moved around.
Um,
yeah,

364
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.710
<v 3>20 pops today.
You know,</v>

365
00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:18.480
if that's something that you guys built for them and then just kind of show them

366
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.990
how you can make contact.
Yeah.

367
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.610
Yeah.
Is it possible to program the bolt to do the course themselves?
Yes,

368
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.990
<v 0>and we didn't have enough time to do that with them.
The pop up.</v>

369
00:24:32.991 --> 00:24:34.130
But that is the idea.

370
00:24:34.131 --> 00:24:37.550
Once we've been ignited that curiosity and that passion and that interest,

371
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.520
then we go back and start teaching them how to program.
It's like,

372
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:47.330
oh,
you want to make that thing go?
That's code this press back.
Yeah.
There you go.

373
00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:58.030
<v 2>Yeah.
One of the biggest challenges was figuring this the surface texture out,
um,</v>

374
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.470
in trying to get the ball programs,
how it responded to different textures.
Um,

375
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.000
it was really one of the central challenges that kids have.
My variable as well.

376
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.340
Did it like the sermon flexible?
Yeah.

377
00:25:08.341 --> 00:25:11.580
The surfaces we worked on were not always like perfectly flat.

378
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.030
So there were a lot of things that made programming it to navigate the course by

379
00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:17.560
itself.
Challenging.

380
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.950
<v 0>And then you'll see Hannah's as idea.
Uh,
she,</v>

381
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.490
she came up with this not make a bowl.
You can,

382
00:25:24.491 --> 00:25:28.600
not that no one can make this.
Yeah.
Get the points.

383
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.693
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

384
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.980
<v 2>SORTA exactly.
Came into the dark side over here if it worth 10,000 points,</v>

385
00:25:35.981 --> 00:25:40.150
but sort of like this vague like,
oh,
if I hit this,

386
00:25:40.151 --> 00:25:45.130
like how do I hit that?
You know?
Um,
yeah,
so

387
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.620
part of it though,

388
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.730
oftentimes it's like getting kids to the point where they make something beyond

389
00:25:51.731 --> 00:25:54.740
what they thought was possible initially.
Um,

390
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:59.320
which happens a lot whenever you make something that's programmable out of
trash.

391
00:25:59.321 --> 00:26:02.320
Most people don't associate those two things together.

392
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.900
<v 0>Yeah.
There were two,
two,
two takeaways or highlights for us.</v>

393
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.900
One young person said,
um,

394
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.610
it's like being inside of a video game.
And then the other one,

395
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.600
so funny,

396
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.310
<v 2>no offense,
but it's a video games made out of trash.
So,</v>

397
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.280
um,

398
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.110
<v 0>this video game is made out of trash.</v>

399
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.103
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

400
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.330
<v 0>But no one,
none of them turned away from it.
They just,
they have,</v>

401
00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.480
and they all had ideas on how to make it better and more competitive and harder.

402
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.393
So.
Great.

403
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.230
<v 4>Sorry.
Are you going to move?</v>

404
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.500
Are you going to keep using this or if you do an a pop up,
will you do it?

405
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.650
<v 0>It'll be,
it'll be so take,</v>

406
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.510
we also go through our own r and D and prototyping process and testing.

407
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:53.230
We their co designing with us how this should be presented in,

408
00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.330
in the next phase.

409
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:58.080
I think we're deciding that we'll have all these different pieces,

410
00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:03.081
but we'll keep the board empty for them to just unleash their imagination.

411
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.190
But we'll always have pieces around to support those students who might need a

412
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:12.920
little bit more,
um,
uh,
you know,
a little bit more push.
Um,

413
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:17.940
but this board will actually go back to 49th street elementary school in

414
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:22.170
Southeast La.
Uh,
the principal there and Ellie's best,

415
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:26.600
they were so inspired by this,
um,
that they started talking about,
well,
why,

416
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.620
why don't we have more of this?

417
00:27:28.621 --> 00:27:32.280
And I talked to him about creating a maker space and they s there,

418
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.720
they said we have room.
So they're creating a maker space at 49th street,

419
00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:39.780
elementary and this will live there.
Um,

420
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.300
so the students are,
uh,

421
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:47.100
Oh and hot when I didn't mention he graduated from the elementary school,

422
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.510
but he will be coming back,
um,

423
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.910
when they're running programs in the makerspace and he's going to be a
volunteer.

424
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.310
It's going to help work with the other kids.

425
00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:03.360
So yeah,
and of course,
um,

426
00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.050
what we're really focusing a lot on is,
uh,

427
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.310
mixed reality and k through 12 learning.
Um,
so this,
this,

428
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.960
we are smart cities.
Um,
we're in prototype mode.

429
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:20.120
It activated virtual reality,
augmented reality,
physical computing,
coding,

430
00:28:20.121 --> 00:28:22.130
storytelling,
world building.
And this is a young,

431
00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:27.320
a child experiencing virtual reality for the first time ever.

432
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.970
And the genesis innovation.
We have a lab,
a physical lab,

433
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.820
uh,
and Pico,
the Pico Robertson area.

434
00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.360
And this was her first time I'm experiencing this.

435
00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:43.361
And what she's seeing inside here is the smart city that was created by the

436
00:28:43.881 --> 00:28:45.140
young people.
Um,

437
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.430
they're helping us codesign that next pop up experience.

438
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:50.893
Um,

439
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:51.990
<v 4>whatever he gets.</v>

440
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.320
<v 0>We use as our asthma.
We used our asthma.</v>

441
00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.580
We're going to activate the Samsung three 60 camera.

442
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.410
Right.
So we're going to activate the Samsung three 60 camera.
Um,

443
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.690
what else did we use?
We use ozobots.

444
00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:08.853
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

445
00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.250
<v 2>Yes.
This was,
this was,
uh,</v>

446
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.670
this was just like a virtual reality camera that was popped down in the middle

447
00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:18.760
of the city.
Um,
and then this,
this girl,

448
00:29:18.761 --> 00:29:22.070
she was falling around these little robots that they'd program.

449
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.200
So she was sort of like spinning around in a circle watching the,
the city.

450
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.300
The city turned around to,
um,

451
00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.300
sort of like from the perspective of like a very small person in the middle of

452
00:29:31.301 --> 00:29:32.770
the city.
Um,

453
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.290
<v 0>yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
And so then because we,</v>

454
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:40.090
well we ask you to join us.
Um,

455
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.810
we are in the process of activating programming in 25 boys and Girls Club clubs.

456
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.980
And,
uh,
we are in,
we're also in talks of opening,
uh,

457
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:57.430
an innovation lab in one of the boys and girls clubs in south La.

458
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.350
So however you can come and support or send friends,

459
