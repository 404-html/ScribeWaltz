1
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.090
My name is Mark Bartlett.

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.770
I'm going to do a presentation called a frank conversation about the f word.

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.210
My name is Mark Brierley.

4
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.930
I'm the founder and the executive director of the Abl gamers charity.
Um,

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.050
I chose this picture because when I had the press shots done,
um,

6
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.500
I've actually lost a hundred pounds.

7
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.790
So I thought this one was the best press shot I could find because you probably

8
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:32.790
wouldn't even recognize me.
I want it.

9
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:34.980
This is the only slide I'm really going to read to you guys,

10
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.410
but it's really important for me from time to time,

11
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:42.150
I'm known for not being the most politically correct as somewhat expect me to be

12
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:44.040
with the sensitive issues that we're going to talk about.

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.270
But I live with my disability and the people that I work with,

14
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:51.750
the volunteers that able gamers and the people we help also have disabilities.

15
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.700
And I will tell you that we're not always politically correct about them.

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.350
And in fact sometimes we're not at all and it's because they're real to us.

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.060
So if I use a term that you don't like,
I apologize now,

18
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.490
but it's the terms we use among ourselves.

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.900
I want to tell you guys some stories because game accessibility has come such a

20
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:20.091
long way in such a short time and I thought storytelling would be the best way

21
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.420
to,
to kind of show you how far we've come.

22
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.910
You need to know that this is my friend Steve.

23
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:30.330
There was a picture of me much heavier.
Um,
as you guys can see,

24
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.290
Steve is profoundly disabled,
um,

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.040
uses a ventilator to breathe and he's my best friend.

26
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.140
I built a ramp onto my house so that he could get to my home and um,

27
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.040
I then subsequently slipped and fell on said ramp and broke my tailbone.

28
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.780
That's how much of a friend he is for me.

29
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.130
I have been called from a game accessibility specialists.

30
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:57.870
I have to confess that I am a bully.

31
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.420
I'm a bully and I want to tell you why because game accessibility is important

32
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.440
and it's not an option for me.

33
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.040
<v 0>The first story I really want to tell you is about a story with a company.</v>

35
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:16.240
And Steve and I,
we were traveling through Pax East.

36
00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:19.420
Does anyone know who packs is?
Pax is the Penny Arcade Expo.

37
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.570
We were in Boston and there was this great game that was being demoed and we

38
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:28.660
were kind of cruising through the aisles and we didn't really want to wait in

39
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:31.870
line for it.
And this gentleman by the name of Mario,

40
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:34.810
we found out later kind of wanted us to sneak the line.

41
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.020
Having a friend who's profoundly disabled as great,

42
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.310
just like bringing grandma to Disneyworld,
oftentimes you can cut the line.

43
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.740
Unfortunately they had doubled,
carpeted there,
um,
booth.

44
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.170
So Steve's wheelchair couldn't actually go into it.

45
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.780
So they asked us what we were there for and we were there to

46
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.180
show the talk to them about this game was going to be accessible.

47
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.220
And the woman that was there,
she wasn't,
she was kind of a paid marketing person.

48
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:08.560
So she's like,
I'm not the person to answer that.
Let me go get it.

49
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.180
And she took our little flyer and she went into the booth.
Um,

50
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.350
and she was gone for a few minutes and a gentleman came out and he had our flyer

51
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:19.990
and he had it rolled up and he goes,
what?

52
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.820
And I said,
hi,

53
00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:27.900
my name is such and such and we wanted to talk to you about how your company,

54
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.050
which is actually just three blocks down the road,
um,

55
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.980
is worrying about how people with disabilities are playing this game.

56
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.950
And he took our flyer and he watered it up and he said,

57
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.720
I don't really have time for this shit.
And he walked back into his booth.

58
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.730
Now this is where platforms like Twitter become pretty amazing.

59
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.510
We only had 3,600 followers at the time and I posted was just at Rockstar

60
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.340
booth told me,
don't have time for this shit,
Hashtag accessibility.

61
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.030
So we go about our day because we're just a tiny charity.
We don't,
you know,

62
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.370
it was just a thing that happened.
We'll let,

63
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.230
we'll let the internet take care of it for us.

64
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.640
We go to bed and I get up early and about five 45 in the morning,

65
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:28.641
I check my email and I have an email from a game company called Rockstar and

66
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:34.530
they're like,
hey,
something happened at our booth.

67
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.780
We kind of want some information on it.

68
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.430
Apparently the wall is coming down behind me.
Um,

69
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.390
oh,
okay.
Um,

70
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.090
and so I kind of typed out what happened and you know,

71
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.100
we went to the booth and Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

72
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.340
And I got a response back that said,
well,

73
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.370
we talked to the person you talk to and they said you were alone.

74
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.720
He didn't even notice Steve.
In fact,

75
00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:10.380
the woman we were talking to said you were standing next to a plant,

76
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.570
which is why I say meet my friend the fight,

77
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:16.530
because he wouldn't even look down at Steve.

78
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.330
She did say,
Hey,
um,
that's not what I heard exactly happened.

79
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:25.020
But your story and the story have converge enough.

80
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.590
What do you want to do now?

81
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.250
We usually don't ask a lot of people.

82
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:34.380
We just wanted to get a couple of developers on the phone.

83
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:38.730
We saw this as an opportunity to share how game accessibility is important.

84
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.910
And the woman said,
no,
we're not going to do that.

85
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.600
This is actually the quote

86
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.540
I did not notice he was than when was he behind a plant.

87
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.850
<v 1>Okay,</v>

88
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.340
<v 0>it's kid you not.
She said No.</v>

89
00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.360
And she said that do the disservice we did to you requires us to do more.

90
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.530
So why don't you come to us here in New York City.

91
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.190
We said,
well we can't afford that.
And they're like,
we're,
we got,

92
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.600
we got piles of cash,
we'll do it for you.
Um,
so they,

93
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.550
this company Rockstar,
I've already given it away.
Um,

94
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.200
bought plane train tickets.
We train from Pittsburgh to New York.

95
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.280
They had a van waiting for us at Madison Square Gardens and the Mario Guy that

96
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:32.510
had told you about waiting for us gave us a wonderful time in New York state at

97
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:34.280
the Tribeca.
Um,

98
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.220
the aside of that is Steve was trying to get into his van cause it's a

99
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:40.760
wheelchair accessible and there was no place on the curb,

100
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.260
but there was this beautiful Bentley at the end of the block because the Tribeca

101
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.640
is owned by Robert Deniro.

102
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.330
So Steve like rolled up to the Bentley and asked him to move his car.

103
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:52.970
So his van that he was a guest.
And so as [inaudible] get in,

104
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.980
so Steve has the pride of saying,

105
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.530
I asked Robert De Niro's driver to move his damn car.

106
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.440
And um,
the company was so gracious.
They,

107
00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:06.530
they talked to what they actually made several changes to the game in the first

108
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.510
patch based on the feedback we had given them.

109
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.080
And we've created a great relationship ever since.

110
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.140
They helped us get to pax the next year and the whole nine yards.

111
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:19.220
And this was really a win for us that started really tragically,

112
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.550
but turned out to be a really great relationship with a very aloof company who's

113
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.540
making much more accessible games.

114
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.640
The next story I wanna tell you is why I'm being called a bully.

115
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.950
And it has to do with the game that used to be incredibly popular,

116
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:39.920
called world of Warcraft who plays world of Warcraft.
I knew it.

117
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.053
<v 1>Ugh,</v>

118
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.040
<v 0>I was going to speak at,</v>

119
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.120
at the gaming development con game GDC,

120
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.850
I can't remember what it stands for anymore.
It's just GDC to me.

121
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.740
And we kept getting people with disabilities reaching out to us saying,
hey,

122
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:03.940
I just got banned from world of Warcraft because I'm using macros to help

123
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.720
overcome some of the challenges that they've created in their game.

124
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.050
And they've banned me for,
for,
for cheating,
you know,

125
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:13.450
and we would ask questions and you know,
sure enough,

126
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.050
these people really did have disabilities and I knew the software that they were

127
00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:18.040
using and everything like that.

128
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.460
And we kept reaching out to blizzard so that we could create a relationship to

129
00:08:23.861 --> 00:08:25.760
get people on band.

130
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.590
Now game companies that have really big followings create spheres around them

131
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.250
between the fan and leadership,
because fans can be creepy.

132
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.563
Um,

133
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.600
this is a real hard nut to crack even for us.

134
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.120
So I hatched a plan and the plan was I was going to GDC to talk about game

135
00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:54.931
accessibility and I needed a way to break through all of the nuts at once.

136
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.290
So I created this shirt.
Blizzard hates disabled Gamers,

137
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.410
asked me for details and I put out there and the shirts still exists.

138
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:07.950
It's actually in my closet.

139
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.990
I put out there through my game developer friends that this shirts existed and

140
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:14.400
we were going to wear it at GDC.

141
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.330
The first day of this GDC there was a panel that had the CEO of of Blizzard on

142
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:25.170
it,
Pardot Rod Pardot.
That's him right there.

143
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.430
I S I sat was not wearing the shirt.

144
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.580
I sat and then at the end of his panel about microtransactions people kind of

145
00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:38.220
rushed the Deus like you guys are all going to rush when I'm done with this talk

146
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.773
and

147
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.030
he's just sitting on the end of the stage and you know he's holding court is

148
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:49.050
what I like to call and he looks at me and he goes,
what do you want?
And I said,

149
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.810
hey,
have you,
why do you,
why do you hate people with disabilities?
And he goes,

150
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:55.470
you and I need to talk.
I mean,
he just literally locked arms.

151
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:56.340
And as he's doing that,

152
00:09:56.341 --> 00:10:00.150
I'm handing my cards to all the press people that have literally turned to face

153
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:02.730
me now.
And he goes,
you and I need to talk.

154
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.500
Can you please wait over there talking about cracking through all of the shells

155
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:11.730
at once.
So I weighed over there and he said,
look,
I heard there's this shirt.

156
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:13.530
And I said,
there is,
he goes,
what's your beef with me?

157
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:17.550
And I told him the beef and he goes,
oh,
that's actually really important.

158
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:21.270
And I'm like,
yeah,
I know.
And he goes,
okay,
here's my deal.

159
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.940
I am going to send some people to this panel that you're doing.

160
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.510
This is their names,
that they are your contacts,

161
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.490
but that shirt,
I don't want that shirt.
And I said,
what shirt?

162
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.220
I have no idea what you're talking about.
And he goes,
good.

163
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.780
So that's why I was called a bully because I used the pulpits that I was given

164
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:46.410
to crack to the nuts.
So a little bit about the Abl gamers charity.

165
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.680
So the able gamers charity was founded because my best friend from middle school

166
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.270
who married my,
my,

167
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.420
my best friend in the military was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and we

168
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.400
played everquest,

169
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.760
her and her husband and me and my husband,
um,

170
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.000
used to log on to everquest every Friday night.
Um,

171
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.190
mainly because she was always playing and she was our sugar mama.

172
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.870
If we needed anything,
she always had the Plat to give to us.
And um,

173
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.220
one once,

174
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.230
one Friday evening I put on my van Trillo headset and I wait for that really

175
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:31.260
familiar,
you know,
Chameleo has entered the channel.

176
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.190
Anyone who uses like teamspeak knows this and it didn't happen.

177
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.020
So at around seven,
10,

178
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.550
I picked up the phone and Albert answered it and I could hear Stephanie crying

179
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:46.020
in the background and as a best friend,
practically my sister,
I said,

180
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:50.940
what's wrong,
what's wrong?
And Albert said,
let me hand you the phone.

181
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.880
And I handed the phone to Stephanie and Multiple Sclerosis that night had

182
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:59.830
decided that her mousing hand wasn't gonna work so she couldn't feel it and she

183
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:04.090
wasn't going to game.
And
I kind of,

184
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.170
I kind of like really said,
wow,

185
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:11.950
like I'm a person of disability but my a disability doesn't really affect my

186
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:15.940
gaming.
There's probably,
if this is doing this to my family,

187
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:19.840
there's probably other people who are,
who are doing something similar.

188
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.130
So I spent all of that night yahooing for information.

189
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.520
The reason why was yahooing is because Google hadn't been invented yet,
relax.

190
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.330
And I wasn't really finding anything around how people with disabilities are

191
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:34.631
playing video games.

192
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:39.631
So I'm a technologist and I just decided that this was what we were going to do

193
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.110
and we founded able gamers.
Um,

194
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.720
we were just a little website for the longest time.

195
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.290
The idea was we were just going to create like a forum for other people with

196
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:54.490
disabilities to attach to.
And the idea was like gamers helping gamers,

197
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:56.860
but that never really took off.
Um,

198
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.430
and so the maker of the most inaccessible game in the world,

199
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.150
anyone want to guess what it is?
Rock band,

200
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.950
um,
said,
hey mark,
what you're doing is really important.

201
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:16.630
Here's a check for $5,000.
Can you turn this into a real charity?
So,

202
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.171
you know,

203
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:21.760
I think it's funny that the most inaccessible game in the world started gave us

204
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:24.680
the seed funding for able gamers.
Um,

205
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.160
these are some of the things that we do every day.
Now.
Um,
accessibility,

206
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:33.010
I put this slide up here because there's a really interesting picture in this

207
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.770
slide.
Accessibility.
It doesn't always have to be technical.

208
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.710
The gentleman to the far right,
his name was Gideon.

209
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.680
We were at an event and we had fruit and engine,

210
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.770
which was the only game you could play with the connect in a wheelchair.

211
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.180
And he had a disability and I don't remember the name of it because it's about

212
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:54.130
this long,
but he basically had no arms but he had hands and he kept,

213
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:58.270
he was working another booth with his mom and he kept coming up to the,

214
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.280
to the,
um,
fruit and Jenny would try to move,
but it wasn't detecting him.

215
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.740
And we just kind of said,
well,
what could we do?

216
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.490
And all of our equipment was packed in these little green foam things.

217
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.480
So we handed him some green phone things.
All of a sudden the connects saw him

218
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:23.190
and he just spent hours playing in the last picture at the bottom is actually

219
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:28.321
his mom crying behind him because she never thought he would be able to do this.

220
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.180
These are the wins that I get to see all the time.

221
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.990
We have a fun first philosophy.

222
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.500
I talked to a lot of game developers all the time who say,
well,

223
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.970
I don't want to create,

224
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.060
I don't want to add certain features because I think that will make the game

225
00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:46.894
less fun.

226
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.680
And that's why we had to create this talk

227
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.500
as a person who runs able gamers.

228
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:02.530
I get people all the time coming to me going like I want to create a game for

229
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:09.340
people with multiple sclerosis or people with muscular dystrophy or people with

230
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:15.230
stage three kidney disease.
Those are someone really came to me and said,

231
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.830
I want to create a game for people with stage three kidney disease.

232
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.530
I couldn't imagine what that game would have been,

233
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.180
but if anyone comes to me and says something like that,
you've already failed.

234
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.190
<v 0>People with disabilities don't want to play targeted games.
They just,</v>

236
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:35.024
they don't.

237
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.340
They want to play the games that include people with muscular dystrophy.

238
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.620
They don't want an eye when button.

239
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.880
They just want to be able to enjoy the content even if it's not how it was

240
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:51.260
intended to be played.

241
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.770
Games that are created specifically for a purse person with disabilities are

242
00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:03.790
isolating and often patronizing.
I mean,

243
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.610
I don't want to play a game that reminds me that I'm disabled every day.

244
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.010
The further alienate them from their peer groups and this is really why games

245
00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:16.450
are so important.
Look at rock band who hears played rock band,

246
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.980
who here doesn't own rock band but played rock band.
Why?

247
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.920
Cause it's fun.
You're at a party,
you're with some friends,

248
00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:26.320
you get coerced into it.
Um,

249
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.090
very few people really played that game by themselves,

250
00:16:31.091 --> 00:16:35.740
which is kind of why they're on the rocks right now.
Being disabled,

251
00:16:35.741 --> 00:16:40.120
especially profoundly disabled,
can be really isolating,

252
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.430
really isolating.
Like think about,
you know,
we're in New York City right now,

253
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:50.620
but I actually live in West Virginia at the top of a mountain.
I work in DC,

254
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.540
but it live in the top of the mountain,
West Virginia.

255
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.050
Do you know how far access and access of Van comes?

256
00:16:56.051 --> 00:17:00.280
If you're a disabled person who is profound and needs an access fan?
Zero,

257
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.350
you're in your house and you're not leaving.
And if you want to buy a van,

258
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.540
an accessible van is you have to take a really crappy van that cost like

259
00:17:10.541 --> 00:17:13.870
$24,000.
And when it's all said and done,

260
00:17:13.871 --> 00:17:18.730
it's 87 grant to have a crappy van that has wheelchair stuff on it.

261
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.770
So people with disabilities,

262
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:23.410
especially people with disabilities that don't live in urban areas,

263
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.800
are socially isolated and the Internet has changed their lives in a way that you

264
00:17:29.261 --> 00:17:34.261
cannot imagine because now they can reach out and see people talk to people and

265
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.830
really connect.

266
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:44.050
This is a quote from a good friend of mine who said,
you know,
I saw,
you know,

267
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.690
I suck at call of duty,
but I still play it.

268
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.820
I used to be a professional first person shooter,

269
00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:50.580
but that's no more because I can't strife,

270
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:53.100
walked backwards or do any trick shots.

271
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.320
My idea of fun more from destroy the competition and laugh with their pain too.

272
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:00.960
As long as a mother effer goes down with me,

273
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.100
I'm happy he's not playing the game as the game was intended,

274
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.590
but it's still fun for him.
Why,
why,
why,
why do you care?

275
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.800
Harvard actually said,
and this,
um,

276
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.210
this actual study has been used to show that solitary confinement within our

277
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:23.211
prison systems is psychosis incredibly psychologically damage damaging because

278
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:28.530
they say that social stimulation is important to the brain is food and that if

279
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:31.230
you don't have social stimulation,
um,

280
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.080
you kind of just die.

281
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.650
Not sure what this blank slide was really wasn't.

282
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.770
So I as an organization,
we as an organization,

283
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.160
we do not believe in universal design.

284
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.820
Now I know that I work with people at Google.

285
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.380
I know you guys really don't like that thought process,

286
00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.610
but I'm going to explain why

287
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.310
able Abel gamers alternative to universal design is that we'd be,

288
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.540
feel like disabilities are on a spectrum and we don't know where on the spectrum

289
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:10.920
it really doesn't matter.
The whole concept that we preach is,

290
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.100
this is my fictitious game kittens,

291
00:19:13.101 --> 00:19:17.520
slayer 2005 it's you just stab kittens as many as you can.

292
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.320
If you follow include effication you follow the guidelines that game

293
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:26.470
accessibility teaches you.
What we're trying to do is broaden where kittens,

294
00:19:26.471 --> 00:19:30.390
slayer 2015 fits on the spectrum of disabilities.

295
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.310
Then we look at where games are across the entire spectrum

296
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.750
and depending on someone's disability,
and I don't actually know,

297
00:19:40.751 --> 00:19:41.890
like I haven't said this,

298
00:19:41.891 --> 00:19:45.680
is this disability we just look at are there things that you can play it,

299
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:50.690
cause I've talked to so many gamers with disabilities who will tell you I would

300
00:19:51.071 --> 00:19:56.071
rather see a game that forwards gaming that I can't play,

301
00:19:56.321 --> 00:20:01.321
be created then that game never be created at all because I'm a Gamer and I love

302
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.520
what games do.
And while I can't play this one,

303
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:12.190
I might be able to play the next one or this game created an AI that is going to

304
00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:17.191
be used now in this game that I can play in love cause we're gamers first.

305
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.430
So this is our alternative design,
our,
our,

306
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.530
our alternative to universal design.

307
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.340
Now during the day I do work for the federal government.

308
00:20:27.341 --> 00:20:30.160
And what's great about that is with enough time and enough money you can do

309
00:20:30.161 --> 00:20:32.410
anything.
Um,

310
00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.820
but that's not the case for a lot of,
for profit organizations.

311
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:38.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

312
00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.620
<v 0>So what can we do?
What are some top level things?</v>

313
00:20:41.621 --> 00:20:44.800
I'm kind of going to go through this fairly quickly for everybody because

314
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.840
there's a lot of wins here that are already being,

315
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.000
I built this little word salad here,
um,

316
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.420
because what do all these people have in common?
They're gamers.

317
00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:01.240
The interesting thing about this word salad is this little piece right here.

318
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.100
This is my personal word salad.

319
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.150
I have paresis of the left leg because of my military service.

320
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.040
My husband who's sitting right here has shark tooth,
Sharp Litton Marie,

321
00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:16.570
Tucson CMT is what it's called.
Stephanie has,

322
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.210
who I talked to you about earlier,
has multiple sclerosis.

323
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:24.040
My mother recently died of a stroke and Steve has spinal muscular atrophy.

324
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.790
These are all disabilities just within my life.

325
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:29.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

326
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:34.290
<v 0>What can we do to help them?
Well include a vacation is broken down into levels.</v>

327
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.670
The idea being that everything in level one and most of level two is technically

328
00:21:38.671 --> 00:21:42.960
feasible right now.
Um,
re mappable keys,
these are common now.

329
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.550
Camera controls less common third party access.

330
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:51.270
This is where we get to that blizzard banning people because they didn't like

331
00:21:51.271 --> 00:21:55.770
third party access.
Movable Uis.
Let me,

332
00:21:55.771 --> 00:21:56.970
if I have limited motion,

333
00:21:56.971 --> 00:22:01.080
let me put all the important stuff in area of the screen that I can get to.

334
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.320
When you get into level three,

335
00:22:04.321 --> 00:22:07.530
some of the challenges with level three is they actually cannibalize some of the

336
00:22:07.531 --> 00:22:08.700
other disabilities.

337
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.480
So you have to be really careful when you get into level three and that's where

338
00:22:12.481 --> 00:22:13.380
options come in.

339
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.850
Why not have a several ways to do something in my kitten killer game,

340
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.590
you didn't just stab them,
you could club them.

341
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.670
The guy is not liking my game.
I have three cats,
I love my cat.

342
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.750
So you have to ask yourself questions.
Can I play this with a keyboard?

343
00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:34.340
Can I play this with just a mouse?

344
00:22:34.341 --> 00:22:37.550
Can I move the triggers from the side to the top?

345
00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:39.560
Now interestingly enough,

346
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:44.710
game companies have done such a terrible job at this that Microsoft playstation

347
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.000
has actually solved the problem because they've put remap ability in the console

348
00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:54.080
level.
So you know,
game x,
you didn't do it.
Don't worry.

349
00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:57.650
We're going to actually put it the OSTP level that the trigger button is now the

350
00:22:57.651 --> 00:23:00.490
x button.
So,
you know,

351
00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.790
that's where a company stepped up and saved everybody and they did it purely for

352
00:23:04.791 --> 00:23:05.930
the point of accessibility.

353
00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:11.570
Here's some of the devices that we've created as able gamers to help people with

354
00:23:11.571 --> 00:23:15.320
disabilities be able to play with mobility disabilities.

355
00:23:15.321 --> 00:23:17.480
And here's some of people using these devices.

356
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.680
These are real devices people are using every day.

357
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.400
Visual impairments.

358
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.270
These are some of the things.
Color changing texts.

359
00:23:30.271 --> 00:23:33.180
This is something most people don't actually think about.

360
00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:35.610
But if I have a visual impairment,

361
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:40.200
maybe I want to make a really high contrast of the text that's important to me.

362
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.610
Let me get rid of some of the texts.
Colorblind is a big deal.
Um,

363
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.570
text to speech output,
which is in level three now,

364
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:51.740
but he's actually really should be more in level one now because technology has

365
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:53.960
made text to speech really easy.

366
00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:56.970
<v 1>Okay?</v>

367
00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.380
<v 0>Colorblindness is the big one.
Um,
8% of men are colorblind,</v>

368
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.660
but only 0.5% of women are colorblind.
So,
you know,

369
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.670
there's one women finally when in this case,
the red green is the most common.

370
00:24:11.671 --> 00:24:13.590
Does anyone know what the least common is?

371
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.810
It's the 12 orange and blue is super rare.
And interestingly enough,

372
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.400
I think mainly women,
um,
dogs aren't colorblind.
They can see color,

373
00:24:23.401 --> 00:24:27.630
just not all the colors.
I will tell you a funny story about this slide.

374
00:24:27.631 --> 00:24:29.690
I actually use a slide at a,
um,

375
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.760
event that had all the chief technology officers for all the big companies that

376
00:24:34.951 --> 00:24:37.170
were out there.
It was,
I met Oprah,

377
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.850
like I was super nervous giving this talk because there was just every who's who

378
00:24:41.851 --> 00:24:45.480
in the audience.
And when I got back to my desk,

379
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.050
when I got back to my little seat,
the CEO,

380
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:52.020
the chief technology officer for a major grocery store chains said,
hey,

381
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.710
about you're colorblind side.
There wasn't a number in one of those circles.

382
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.940
And I'm like,
yeah,
there was,
it was like,
no,
there wasn't.
And I'm like,
yeah,

383
00:24:59.941 --> 00:25:04.140
you should probably go see your doctor.
And it was the one in the bottom,

384
00:25:04.141 --> 00:25:08.040
the small one 42.
He couldn't see that.
Um,
which is a pretty rare one.

385
00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:11.880
So yay.
Slides work.
If everyone can see numbers,
if you don't see numbers,

386
00:25:11.881 --> 00:25:15.330
go see your doctor.
So what a game companies do.

387
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.590
So game companies use color,
but they also use symbols.
Symbols are a big deal.

388
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.280
If you look at like be jeweled or you look at,
you know,
candy crush,

389
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.151
there's color,

390
00:25:24.151 --> 00:25:28.380
but every little piece of candy is also shaped differently because you can match

391
00:25:28.381 --> 00:25:32.580
shapes or you can match match colors.
Um,
this is,
um,
Star Wars,

392
00:25:32.581 --> 00:25:33.600
the old republic,

393
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:38.100
and that is the same the screen that's large on the right,

394
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.670
you can see it on the left and the different types of colorblindness that there

395
00:25:41.671 --> 00:25:44.760
is hearing impairments.

396
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.670
If you're a Gamer with a hearing impairment,

397
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.830
the world is in a pretty good shape for you.
Um,
this is closed captioning.

398
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.070
We'd like to see more than closed caption and we would like to also see event

399
00:25:58.071 --> 00:26:02.610
captioning.
You hear a sound to your left,
things like that.
Um,

400
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.550
more and more games are doing that.
I'm changing colored fonts,
things like that.

401
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.760
But why this is really become almost moot and almost every game has it.

402
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:18.770
Does anyone know why,
why?
Almost every game now has closed captioning?

403
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.490
Here's some examples of closed captioning,
by the way.

404
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.113
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

405
00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.970
<v 0>exactly.
Here's one.
The reason why is because of localization.</v>

406
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:35.070
So if you put in the closed captioning and you,
and you lay that all in,

407
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:39.630
you can send your close captioning file off to a company and you can then use it

408
00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:43.170
as subtitles in various languages.

409
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.840
So that's,
you know,

410
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:50.841
this ability to want to sell your game in non English speaking places has become

411
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:55.320
great for the need of close captioning.

412
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:58.170
So it's closed captioning and an and an English speaking country and it's

413
00:26:58.171 --> 00:27:02.010
subtitles everywhere else.
Learning impairments.

414
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:06.930
So learning impairments is one of the hardest ones to really take on,

415
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.940
but it's actually not tutorials in sandboxes.

416
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.780
When you're working with people who have learning impairments,

417
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.140
what you really want you to do is giving them a safe place to practice.

418
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.950
When we work with,
with people with autism,

419
00:27:22.951 --> 00:27:27.150
what we find oftentimes is they easily get frustrated and I'm being very general

420
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:31.890
now because the spectrum of people,
everyone manifests differently.

421
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.070
What's what,
what,
how they operate in the world.

422
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.000
But you want to just make sure that they're not frustrated.

423
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:43.200
So if you create sandboxes,
you create tutorials,
time-based games,
you know,

424
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:43.860
one of the,

425
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.860
one of the greatest games as an example of it is civilizations because it's turn

426
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:54.030
based,
you can take forever to make your turn forever.

427
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.690
Game doesn't care cause there was no clock,
there's no speed.

428
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:02.370
There's also a sandbox mode,
um,
tutorials,
um,

429
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.330
intuitive menus,
um,
videos.
In fact,

430
00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:09.870
I'm youtube has done great for um,

431
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.380
for people with learning impairments because they go watch twitch,

432
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:16.530
they go watch other people play,
play,

433
00:28:16.531 --> 00:28:21.030
play the game and that way they get comfortable with the content.
Um,

434
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.760
so this game right here,
I can never say the name of it.
Um,

435
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.800
the lead story teller said that they spent so much time working on the story

436
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.120
that they created this menu right up at the front that said,
you know,

437
00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.020
that you could say,
tell me a story.
You know,
give me a challenge.

438
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.520
And what it was was,

439
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:46.820
it was actually an accessibility feature that was hidden for the casual Gamer,

440
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:50.970
but as well as other people were,
depending on what you chose,

441
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.710
what he said was we spent countless hours telling a great story.

442
00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:02.150
It would be tragic if in the first jump puzzle someone couldn't get through it

443
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.290
and never gets to the end.

444
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:09.090
So they use this so that the game will actually say,

445
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:12.420
if you're in a quick time event,
hey,
I noticed you're having problems,

446
00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:16.020
you want to skip it.
Now I won't do that in some of the other modes.

447
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.280
But in the tell me a story,
it will,
it brings the enemy's down.

448
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:25.460
It puts auto targeting on so that someone who just wants to enjoy this game from

449
00:29:26.071 --> 00:29:28.290
a story perspective can,

450
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.430
but those that really want to hardcore it also have that option.

451
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.910
No one complained.
No one said anything.

452
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:43.300
Regulatory Environment.
So,
um,
I'm hoping,
I haven't gotten the answer yet,

453
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:47.980
but we're doing a talk at GDC this year on the CVA.
It had a two year extension.

454
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.810
It is in full effect for anyone who is working on games in the Google space.

455
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:57.730
You were,
you were aware of this and it's about,
um,
communications.

456
00:29:57.731 --> 00:30:01.360
Anything that's a communications device must be able to be used by people with

457
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:04.840
disabilities.
Um,
so captioning,
things like that.
Um,

458
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.760
it's mainly affecting consoles and platforms.
Um,

459
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.520
we're still trying to figure out what it does in the actual game space.
Um,

460
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.820
if you do any content,

461
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:19.600
and I know that Google actually does do content for government and state and

462
00:30:19.601 --> 00:30:22.240
local,
oftentimes five Oh eight,

463
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.610
section five Oh eight of the rehabilitation act of 1976 comes into play,

464
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:32.000
which is an accessibility requirements because um,

465
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.290
when the government pays for it,
everyone has to be able to enjoy it.
Um,

466
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.040
I know California actually adopt,

467
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.430
adopted a local California level five oh eight.

468
00:30:42.431 --> 00:30:46.600
They just literally cloned five Oh eight out of the rehabilitation act.

469
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.430
It was just,
um,

470
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.660
all of the stuff was just redone to better align with why Cag,

471
00:30:52.661 --> 00:30:54.280
if anyone's familiar with why Cag,

472
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:59.170
which is the European standards or just like,
just like the metric system.

473
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.200
Why CAG is what everyone else uses.

474
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.070
And Five Oh eight is what the United States uses.
Um,

475
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:10.330
there was a lot of pushback from the rest of the world,

476
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:14.080
rightfully be.
And so,
um,

477
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:19.000
in the last refresh which just finished in January,
they now better aligned.

478
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:22.810
So five oh eight actually went into line with wildcat cause a lot more thought

479
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:24.820
had been put into it.
So,
um,

480
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:30.310
that's where the rectory in Europe,
Europe is a different story.
Um,

481
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.860
the EU was really,
hasn't,

482
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.690
hasn't really figured out exactly what they're going to do from a games

483
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:42.550
perspective yet.
So this is where I opened it up to questions.

484
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.590
Um,
so one of my favorite slides,
by the way,

485
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:48.910
any questions

486
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.140
<v 1>yes.
Of</v>

487
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.520
like Doris does.

488
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.400
<v 0>So his question was,</v>

489
00:32:05.401 --> 00:32:09.780
was there a disability ratings scheme system,
um,

490
00:32:09.781 --> 00:32:11.910
for when games come out in the answer that is no.

491
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.490
And we will fight you tooth and nail not to have it.

492
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.120
The reason being is if you show me some with multiple screens,

493
00:32:18.121 --> 00:32:19.950
show me 10 people with multiple sclerosis,

494
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.660
I'll show you 10 people that need something different.
So it's almost impossible.

495
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.660
What we advocate for is for them to,

496
00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:32.610
for game companies to put out a checklist of things that they do.

497
00:32:32.611 --> 00:32:36.840
So,
you know,
we have remap ability,
we have,
so all of the things we talked about,

498
00:32:36.841 --> 00:32:40.430
we asked them to do a checklist and what we do it from review perspective as we

499
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:41.330
go through the checklist,

500
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.760
personal with disabilities knows what they're looking for.

501
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:48.560
So the rating system just doesn't work.
Yes sir.

502
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.650
<v 2>Um,</v>

503
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:54.330
regarding this as maybe trailing off the styling politically incorrect topic,

504
00:32:54.331 --> 00:32:59.070
but when you speak with these companies or these CEOs of these game companies,

505
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.100
how is your message received by both the leadership and then the developers in

506
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.943
most company?

507
00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.290
<v 0>I'm really glad you asked that because I want to tell you the,
the,
the,
the,</v>

508
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.070
you know,
it wasn't a planned question,
but I'm glad he asked it.

509
00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:16.590
So the stories I told you,
we're from four years ago and seven years ago,

510
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.730
I actually just got back from playstation

511
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.080
because they have internal accessibility policies now.

512
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

513
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.630
<v 0>Aye.
I,</v>

514
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:33.810
I've actually had like a real crisis of where able gamers goes in the last six

515
00:33:34.711 --> 00:33:39.711
months because it dawned on us and the weight of what we did is a couple of

516
00:33:41.611 --> 00:33:45.060
really passionate gamers and I mean really a couple we could fill.

517
00:33:45.061 --> 00:33:50.061
The first row of this auditorium was banging on the door of a $16 billion

518
00:33:51.691 --> 00:33:54.870
industry for 15 years.

519
00:33:55.290 --> 00:34:00.290
It's now a $64 billion industry and we affected change.

520
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.280
A handful of people.

521
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:06.690
I kid you not 15 passionate gamers

522
00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:13.460
and now the major game companies have all reached out and said help us create

523
00:34:16.561 --> 00:34:21.561
guidelines that we will enforce and our internal studios and we will suggest in

524
00:34:24.421 --> 00:34:29.310
our third parties.
Think about that.
Like,
you know,

525
00:34:29.311 --> 00:34:33.210
my mission was to get people with disabilities in the first part of doing that

526
00:34:33.211 --> 00:34:37.650
mission was getting game companies to understand that people with disabilities,

527
00:34:37.651 --> 00:34:39.990
we're a market,
not a sad story,

528
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:45.230
that we had $1 trillion in income and we wanted to spend it on games as part of

529
00:34:47.751 --> 00:34:51.360
our entertainment.
Like make the game,
I will give you the money.

530
00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.780
So we created this dialogue that talked about gamers with disabilities as a

531
00:34:58.291 --> 00:35:03.060
market,
not a sad story.
And we banged on the door,

532
00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:07.620
we banged on the door and now we have game companies,

533
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.520
the big boys who are going,
yeah,
don't worry about that.
We've done that.
Yeah,

534
00:35:11.521 --> 00:35:16.050
that's done.
What's next?
Let's go to the next thing.
Let's,
let's figure this out.

535
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.120
Vr,
here's what we've already done for Vr.
What do we miss?
Well,

536
00:35:21.121 --> 00:35:25.890
what about this?
Oh yeah,
let's talk about that.
So to your point,

537
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.940
we won.

538
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.940
That battle is won now and it was because a handful of really passionate bullies

539
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:39.540
banged on the door and finally got,
so thank you for asking that question.

540
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.390
So what do we do now by the way?
We give grants out.

541
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.800
We give tons of grants because a lot of the equipment you see is handmade,

542
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:52.050
custom built and people with disabilities told you about the story about being

543
00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:54.540
in rural and not holding out for affording a van.
Trust me,

544
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:59.100
a $500 controller might as well be $5 million.

545
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.290
So we just give them out.

546
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.950
Like my Thursday is literally just printing labels.

547
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.490
So any other questions?

548
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.770
Thank you very much.
Thank you for having me.
Thank you for,
you know,

549
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.770
having a great time.
Thank you for Tracy and I appreciate it.
Take care.
