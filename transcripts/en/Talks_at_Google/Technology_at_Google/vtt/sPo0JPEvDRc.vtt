1
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.320
All right.
Excellent,
so thank you so much for joining us today.

2
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:15.321
Welcome to grand rounds at verily and today is a very important day for us.

3
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:18.450
Today is a day to think about our mission,

4
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.540
which I know drives everything that we do.

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.560
We know our mission is to make the world's health information useful so that

6
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:30.450
people can enjoy healthier lives and I know that all of us work incredibly hard.

7
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.140
We keep our heads down,
but if we keep our eyes on this mission,

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.740
then I think we're ultimately going to end up really affecting people's lives

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.760
and try to make a difference that we are trying to make every day.

10
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.930
The question is how do we actually achieve our mission and as I look around the

11
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:49.710
room and I see all of the different teams that come together,

12
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.880
this is a very special place that's got groups of people figuring out how do you

13
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:56.310
collect the next generation of information.

14
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.640
This information may be digital information and we were talking about that

15
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:01.140
earlier with Michael.

16
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:06.060
It may be molecular information and we have the latest and greatest technologies

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.560
that we can deploy.
It then becomes very important to organize this information.

18
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:14.370
Information that just lives in silos doesn't actually change care.

19
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:15.600
It doesn't help people.

20
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.350
And so the most important thing is how do we activate this information?

21
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.640
Getting into the hands of people,
patients,
providers,
and health systems.

22
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.690
And if we do that,
then we will achieve our mission.
Now,

23
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:31.740
the reason that we're starting in grand rounds at verily is as part of a big

24
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:36.741
effort to make sure that we understand our users and it's exciting today that

25
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:40.470
we're going to be kicking off this particular event and I'll hand it over to

26
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:41.850
bill to give you some background.

27
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.920
<v 0>Thanks Jess.
Well,
welcome to the inaugural grand rounds and fairly</v>

28
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.750
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.400
<v 0>As just said,</v>

30
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.840
the intent of these sessions is really to connect us all with the patients,

31
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:05.040
researchers and clinicians that are a part of our lives.

32
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.180
And I know that many of you don't always have the opportunity to hear from the

33
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:10.200
patients voice.

34
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.670
So on a quarterly basis we'll bring in patients so we can hear their real life

35
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:15.241
stories,

36
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:19.830
understand their unmet needs and hopefully that'll really help us stay connected

37
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.100
to our mission.
Each session,

38
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.130
each quarter we'll have a different topic today the topic is Parkinson's disease

39
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.290
and 2017 marks,

40
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.320
the 200th anniversary of James Parkinson's.

41
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.280
First description of the disorder.

42
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.220
I think it's fair to say that maybe in the next 20 years we may make as much

43
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:49.221
progress in Parkinson's as had been made in the first 200 and I think we can

44
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.780
contribute to that.

45
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.920
Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder.

46
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:59.500
It's second only to Alzheimer's disease and prevalence affects about a million

47
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:01.930
Americans,
10 million people worldwide.

48
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.670
Most people think of Parkinson's disease as a movement disorder,

49
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.990
problems with slowness of movement,
stiffness of muscles,

50
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.200
shaking,
difficulty with gait and balance,

51
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.150
but it's really a multisystem disorder that affects so much more and causes many

52
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.870
symptoms for patients,
difficulty regulating blood pressure,

53
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.860
difficulty with sleep,
depression,
anxiety,

54
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.040
gastrointestinal issues,
and many other issues.

55
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:33.340
So it really is a multisystem disease.

56
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.110
And I think one that we're up to,
the challenge of tackling here at verily.

57
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.000
Many of you are aware of our emerging efforts in Parkinson's,

58
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:48.001
but I wanted to highlight why Parkinson's disease make sense for us to care

59
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.110
about and work on.

60
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.820
Certainly there are still knowledge gaps as I think you'll hear from our guests

61
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.110
that we can really help fill characterizing the disease better,

62
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.310
understanding how we measure the progression of the disease or the response to

63
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:08.311
treatments and we can all contribute to that and as we study this disease it

64
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:13.711
will simultaneously help us build out our capabilities in systems biology and

65
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:18.220
wearable sensors and algorithm development and so forth.

66
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.760
So it's really quite a nice match for our mission.

67
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:26.110
I think some of the specific programs that we have,

68
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:27.130
just so you're aware,

69
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.550
the new study watch is being used in our Parkinson's study in the Netherlands

70
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:36.040
and perhaps in other studies to come.

71
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.520
We think this will be very useful for tracking movement and function during the

72
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:44.530
patient's normal daily activities.

73
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.620
We also have liftware of course and lift where can be useful to cancel out

74
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:55.621
tremor that may interfere with feeding from Parkinsonian tremor and now with the

75
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.440
lift wear steady device can help Dyskinesia,

76
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.730
the involuntary movements that medication can cause in Parkinson's disease.

77
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.790
And then the Parkinson Mot,

78
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.940
that's the Dutch version of the personalized Parkinson project,

79
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:16.210
which is our longitudinal cohort study that we're kicking off in the Netherlands

80
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:21.211
with the goal of really understanding in a deep way what Parkinson's is to

81
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:24.310
advance treatments.

82
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.210
So I think a very interesting and important disorder that we care about and we

83
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:37.111
are extremely excited to have members of the Michael J.

84
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.690
Fox Foundation to help us better understand Parkinson's disease and learn what

85
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.260
it's like in terms of the impact on daily life.

86
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.790
For those who are not familiar with the Michael J.

87
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.890
Fox Foundation for Parkinson's research,

88
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.430
you know in its short history they say the only constant of the organization has

89
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:04.751
been its unflagging commitment to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease and put

90
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:06.530
itself out of business.

91
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.540
Michael was saying earlier that he wanted to go into business to go out of

92
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.374
business.

93
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.500
They launched the foundation in 2000 it quickly grew from a startup to the

94
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:21.920
world's largest nonprofit funder of Parkinson's drug development.

95
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.190
They've allocated more than $700 million since the inception of the

96
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:31.640
organization.
The New York Times has called the foundation,

97
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:36.641
the most credible voice on Parkinson's research in the world and it's widely be

98
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.130
being considered at the forefront of innovation.

99
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.780
They've established a pure level group of neuroscientists who prioritize,

100
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:49.781
manage and troubleshoot their research portfolio and they are sponsoring a

101
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:54.941
landmark biomarker study called Ppmi most recently to foundation has also

102
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.440
formally integrated policy and advocacy and to their work as well.

103
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.740
So a very impressive organization.

104
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.910
I've had the privilege of working with them pretty much since their inception.

105
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.090
Well,
let's bring out our guests.
Uh,

106
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.260
actually our first guest is already in the audience.
Debi Brooks,
uh,

107
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.380
is the co founder of the foundation.
Michael's employee number one,

108
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:20.500
I think they call you.
And uh,

109
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.750
presently the executive vice chairman of the organization

110
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.920
<v 2>have a round of applause for Debbie [inaudible].</v>

111
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.400
<v 0>And then we're going to bring to the stage Todd sharer.
Uh,</v>

112
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.980
Todd is the chief executive officer of the foundation.

113
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.910
Todd is formally trained as a neuroscientist and he now directs the

114
00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:48.560
organization's research strategy as well.

115
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:52.540
He's responsible of course for the overall scientific and fundraising efforts.

116
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.240
<v 2>Todd,
great to see you.</v>

117
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.250
[inaudible]

118
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.420
<v 0>how did I go back a ways.</v>

119
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:07.010
But the cool thing is that I didn't realize until I read your bio is that you

120
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:10.310
received a grant from the foundation in 2003.

121
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.670
And so he was a grant recipient and then came in house to gradually assume

122
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:19.280
increasing responsibilities and now is the CEO of the organization.

123
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.990
So great to have you here.
Thanks Phil.

124
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.790
And then our very special guest,
Michael J.
Fox

125
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.380
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

126
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.170
<v 0>seem a little superfluous for me to provide a formal introduction,</v>

127
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:55.100
but I will provide a very brief one.
As you know,
he is an actor,

128
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.210
producer,
and author and of course an advocate.
Uh,

129
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.590
they say you burst onto the scenes with iconic roles.
Uh,

130
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.660
Alex p Keaton from NBC is family ties.

131
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.380
Marty McFly in the back to the future trilogy and,

132
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.530
and he's continued to thrill audiences as recently as uh,

133
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.800
the good wife and with his portrayal of Louis Canning.

134
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.210
But he's also a best selling author and he's written three books,
is that right?

135
00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:27.700
Three,
three and a half.
Three and a half.

136
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.230
A lucky man,
a memoir,

137
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.670
always looking up the adventures of an incurable optimist and a funny thing

138
00:09:39.281 --> 00:09:42.460
happened on the way to the future twists and turns and lessons learned.

139
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.540
I think you can tell a lot just about the,
the focus there.

140
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.900
He was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1991 at the age of 29 and disclosed his

141
00:09:53.921 --> 00:09:58.921
condition to the public in 1998 ultimately went on to fund the foundation in

142
00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:02.410
2000 so warm welcome again for

143
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.610
<v 2>Todd and Michael [inaudible].</v>

144
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.690
<v 0>Thanks to you both for being here.
It's really,</v>

145
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.780
really kind of you to come and help our employees understand Parkinson's

146
00:10:20.211 --> 00:10:21.044
disease.
You know,

147
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.780
<v 3>Monterey to be here.
I just want to say I've said to a couple people,
but,</v>

148
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.940
but I always think when I'm,
when I'm with a group like this,

149
00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:27.530
I think your parents must be so disappointed.

150
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.820
<v 0>Nothing.
Well,
you know,
it's been interesting,</v>

151
00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:38.330
Michael is when word leaked out that you might be visiting us.

152
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.160
I had a number of people come up to me and tell me that you are their hero,

153
00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:43.994
their idol.

154
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.650
And I had to sort of smile because as a neurologist taking care of Parkinson's

155
00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:53.030
patients for the last 20 years,
um,
they feel the same way about you,

156
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.070
that you've been their hero and idol.
And I just wonder,

157
00:10:57.071 --> 00:10:59.990
did you ever think you'd be in that kind of a role?

158
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.070
<v 3>No,
I didn't.
I didn't think,
I didn't see it through eight.</v>

159
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:06.110
It's kind of like the,
when I get to work,

160
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.850
when I got into acting just as a thing that felt good to me.

161
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:13.330
And so I did it and it,
and it,
and it turned out.
But when I found,

162
00:11:13.331 --> 00:11:15.040
when I was diagnosed with Parkinson's,
I didn't,

163
00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.920
my first thought was other people.
My first of what the hell happened to me,

164
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.540
what am I going to do?
And,
and,

165
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.200
and it took about seven years for me to work that all out.
And then,

166
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.480
and then what happened was when,
once I accepted that,
and I've said people,

167
00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.870
but acceptance is,
is,
is,
is,
uh,

168
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.620
my happiness grows in direct proportion to my acceptance,
an inverse proportion,

169
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:39.010
the expectation,
it what,
what,
what if I could just accept what my situation is,

170
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.670
then I can move in,
I can nuance it and I can,
I can be honest about it and I can,

171
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.470
I can move forward.
And also I B,
I felt 10,
oh,

172
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.930
became part of a community and an undue or other people and that they were in

173
00:11:49.931 --> 00:11:50.880
the same situation I was.

174
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:55.620
And they had thoughts and feelings are similar mine and,
and goals and,
and,
and,

175
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.450
and hopes that was similar to mine.
And I stopped.

176
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.860
The only difference is I'm in this unique position in this position where people

177
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:07.240
know me and have a predisposition towards me,
whether it's good or bad,

178
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.910
mostly good,
which was nice.
And,
and,
um,
and so I said,

179
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.180
I have an opportunity here and I can't have a responsibility here to do

180
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:20.170
something.
And so the foundation was born,
but I,

181
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.870
the gratitude that you say that people expressed toward me and,
and,

182
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.790
and most feelings are completely mutual.
I mean,
it's,

183
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:32.140
so I'm so inspired by people that have this and they're in a tougher position

184
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:35.070
than I am and they deal with the daily and,
and,

185
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.950
and I feel honored that they've been trusted me with their,

186
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.720
their hopes and their dreams of,
of,
of being rescued.

187
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.460
Well,
you've already gotten pretty personal and I wanted to go back in time to,

188
00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:52.960
uh,
no.
Uh,
um,
back to the first symptoms.

189
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.990
Um,
what were you experiencing?

190
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.220
I was doing a movie in Florida called Doc Hollywood and I was not,
I was,

191
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.750
I woke up in the morning,
I had twitching pinky and I,

192
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.060
I,
I,
I've got that night before with Woody Harrelson was on the movie and that's

193
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:13.990
always bad news.
And so we kind of ripped up jeans go.

194
00:13:13.991 --> 00:13:15.250
We were in a college town would be like,

195
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:20.080
what are you here after going to college?
This is all bad.
Um,
but,
but uh,

196
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:22.120
so I put up the next morning I had this twitching pinky and I couldn't,

197
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.760
I couldn't stop it.
It just kept twitching.
And so I went to,
I went to,

198
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:32.010
um,
they're all just on the campus right away.
Yeah.
I went and I went and I said,

199
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.590
did you see what right?
Cause I thought I hit my owner or it,

200
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.660
and he said,
the guy said it was drastic,
drastic.

201
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.590
It was some poll and,
and uh,
he completely missed the boat.

202
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:48.310
But I mean there's so symptoms with,
with early onset,

203
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.450
they really tell you I need a 29 year old guy.
He's not to get Parkinson's.

204
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.490
So then about a year later,
a year later,
you're lighter.

205
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.500
I found myself,

206
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:03.430
I'm in the wrong office because I had gone to a physical therapist who said this

207
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:06.910
is neurological,
the neurologist's office.
And He,

208
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.010
I did the battery of tests.
I mean to sell today.
It's,

209
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.260
so we haven't got biomarker.
We ended up waiting to identify it.

210
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.560
So you do this drunk driving tests and which I failed.
And,

211
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.050
and,
um,
and,
and then he sat me down and said,
you have Parkinson's,

212
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.170
Parkinson's disease and you have 10 years left to work in.

213
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.060
And it was just wham.
And,
and I,

214
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.690
it took me a long time that I remember going outside and leaving the doctor's

215
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:36.440
office and,
and,
uh,

216
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.910
it was just this rainy day in New York and they just thought how this happened.

217
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.120
I mean,
and I even had,
I have to confess,
I had feelings.
I don't,

218
00:14:44.121 --> 00:14:48.190
you know who I am.
You get parents that I have,

219
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:52.100
Parkinson's is not the script.
And,
um,
uh,
so,

220
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:57.040
so that was being my journey.
It must've been a stunning thing to here.

221
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:02.300
It was pretty shocking.
And then I told my wife,
I came home,
told my wife and,

222
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.190
and he just was like,
uh,
we have young son is two,

223
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:10.130
he's 27 now.
But he was,
he was,

224
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:14.340
he was really young and he just said,
we didn't know what the future.
But I,

225
00:15:14.341 --> 00:15:16.730
I've always been,
uh,

226
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.160
if not optimistic,
I tend to look at things positively.

227
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.090
And,
and,

228
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.170
and I knew that there was something in there all the way along the first few

229
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:29.870
years,
I knew that there was something to fit this was,

230
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.910
there's possibility in here and there,
those was,
there was opportunity to,

231
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.960
to change the way I look at things at very least in adapting to it.

232
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.630
And something good might come about.
Were you treated with medication right away?

233
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:48.680
Once the diagnosis was given medication,
but I treat it like smarties.

234
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.690
I just throw my pocket.
If I was feeling twitchy,
I'd pop a pill in it.

235
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.080
And I really did it haphazardly in and had dyskinesia as a result.

236
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:01.220
I had been swaying movements even early on.
Yeah,
yeah.
From the,

237
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:04.820
from the drugs that I take too much.
Yeah.
And I,
and it,
cause I wasn't,

238
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.750
I didn't educate myself,
but the disease and then about four or five years in,

239
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:12.580
I started just really talk to my doctor and I kind of,

240
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.290
I had,
this isn't going away,

241
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.420
this and I haven't like changed toothpaste and have something better and got

242
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.820
toothpaste all along

243
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.720
was he knew that it was then it was in it.
And I had to educate myself about it.

244
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:29.330
And so I did.
And so that brought me to a place where,

245
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.120
where before it started the foundation,
I was,
um,

246
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.660
I was in Washington testifying about the need for funding and,

247
00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:39.410
and I talked to doctors who said the science is of the money.

248
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.070
They've kept saying to me,
if the science is ahead of the money,
I thought,
well,

249
00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:45.230
that's what I chased the science.
I mean,

250
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:48.670
it's like kind of flip on the Watergate thing.
It's my father's side.
It's fault,

251
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.260
the money and the money will follow the science and,
and,
um,
and,

252
00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:58.220
and so that kind of getting into my head and I just knew that it needed to treat

253
00:16:58.221 --> 00:17:02.780
this like a business and treat it well,
treat it like,
like,
uh,
uh,
our,

254
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.900
our goals throughout the business.
And we need to,

255
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.330
we need to look at it from a scientific point of view,

256
00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:10.520
from a business point of view,
from an academic point of view,

257
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:14.810
from a patient point of view.
And,
and,
and we managed to do that.

258
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.330
Before you went public,
you had a felon autonomy,
right?
Yeah,

259
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.621
yeah.
Before,

260
00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:26.621
I'm a republican and a foul anatomy is a very precise therapeutic lesioning

261
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.810
procedure of area of the brain that's generating the tremor.

262
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.280
It's 20th century Triponin.
How did you decide to do that?

263
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.920
I had huge symptoms on my left side and I was doing a show called spin city and

264
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:42.340
I was finding myself doing scenes.
US standing on my hands,

265
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.160
you're going to just wouldn't stop.
And it just was,
I mean,

266
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.140
everything I did was I was acting and I was doing my job,

267
00:17:49.141 --> 00:17:51.520
but I was also involved in Ms Direction and,

268
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.560
and started hand in and just finding ways to lean on deaths and,

269
00:17:56.561 --> 00:18:01.050
and if have to tip my tremor,
if I,
if I,

270
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.310
if I did something it would,
it would rest.
So if I,
if I move this,

271
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.780
so I would like be doing a scene and I just do that for a reason.

272
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.130
And um,
and so I thought,
I talked to some neurologists and I said,

273
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.630
we can diminish the tremor on that side by doing the small incision and your

274
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:22.800
thumb on me and your thalamus.
It's called the tell mommy.
And,
um,

275
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.650
so I did it and,
and it,
and it worked.
It helped.

276
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:30.060
But then it started on my right side so I wasn't going to go back in again.

277
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.490
And,
um,
it was,
it was a stop gap measure that,

278
00:18:34.491 --> 00:18:37.140
that I don't know that I would do it again,
but I don't,

279
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.800
I don't resent the fact that I did it.
I don't always have the doctors that did.

280
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.440
I don't regret it,
but,
but I,
I wouldn't,

281
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.140
I wouldn't do it again because they're going to,
I mean,
the next time we went,

282
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:47.940
my brain being a habit figured out.

283
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.690
<v 4>Todd,
you're a neuroscientist.</v>

284
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.180
How did you become interested in working on Parkinson's disease?
Um,

285
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:59.350
I was fooled into working in Parkinson's disease because at the,
uh,

286
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.700
at the time when I was in graduate school,

287
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.340
and still one of the common theories in Parkinson's is that there's really a

288
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:11.410
selective loss of a very specific population of cells in the brain that produce

289
00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:16.190
dopamine in the substantia Nigra.
And at the time of diagnosis,

290
00:19:16.191 --> 00:19:21.191
it's believed that already 80% or so of those cells have degenerated before the

291
00:19:21.471 --> 00:19:25.280
symptoms start.
So as a naive graduate student,
I thought,
well,

292
00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:29.180
wouldn't be so hard to just save 10% of these cells and then we'd have cured

293
00:19:29.181 --> 00:19:33.470
Parkinson's.
And of course we know it's much more complicated than that.

294
00:19:33.471 --> 00:19:38.360
But just sorta like the academic challenge of that drew me into this to really,

295
00:19:38.361 --> 00:19:42.170
it's a seems to be a very solvable disease if we can push the science and fund

296
00:19:42.171 --> 00:19:43.004
the right science.

297
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.120
And so you were a grant recipient of the foundation just a few years into its

298
00:19:47.121 --> 00:19:50.420
creation and then how did you end up becoming staff?

299
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.930
It's really hard being a grant recipient of the foundation.

300
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:55.670
It's much easier being the grant giver.

301
00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.070
But actually one of the things that really impressed me when I had my grant was

302
00:20:01.071 --> 00:20:03.800
that the foundation is very focused on accountability.

303
00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.490
And as having a fellowship from the,
from the foundation,

304
00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:11.420
I still had to come in and report on what I actually use the money for,

305
00:20:11.421 --> 00:20:14.420
which is not actually that common in the granting industry.

306
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.740
And what was really exciting about that is I actually got to meet the other

307
00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:23.060
grant recipients and it really improved my research.

308
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.210
And,
um,

309
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:29.150
develop this network and I got access to new tools and it got me really excited

310
00:20:29.151 --> 00:20:32.870
about this new way of funding and pushing research forward.

311
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.610
And at that time when Michael and Debbie were expanding the activities to look

312
00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:41.960
to bring on internal scientists and to have that opportunity to have this broad

313
00:20:41.961 --> 00:20:45.500
impact across the whole disease rather than just be focusing on one,

314
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.770
you're one molecule to your one project

315
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.370
<v 3>was really exciting to me.
Michael,</v>

316
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:56.290
can you describe a typical day with Parkinson's disease if there is such a
thing?

317
00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.580
Well,
I don't have any typical days,
but in general,

318
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:05.410
I mean I don't,
I don't go to work at the same place every day now,
so,

319
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:09.010
so,
so I never knew what to expect on any given day.
And I have my,

320
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.130
I have commitments or responsibilities in,
Oh,

321
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.520
titrate my medication according to what I want to have to do.

322
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:20.521
I don't take pills at nine o'clock and 1130 and I have kind of areas that I,

323
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.910
and some days I feel better if I come to California if feel a lot better than

324
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:25.744
I've seen in New York.

325
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:33.820
High pressure's better for me than a low pressure.
Um,
humanities for me,

326
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.560
if I eat protein,
it's,
it's tough for me.
So I'm always doing different things.

327
00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:42.970
But,
but,
um,
I typical days I get up and,
and,
and I literally,

328
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.380
someone once said to me that it used to be the hero's journey was to slay the

329
00:21:47.381 --> 00:21:50.200
dragon and saved the princess.
But for me,
he was,

330
00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:53.520
journey is pretty much put in front of the other and getting out of bed.

331
00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.850
And literally since I've,
I've had this problem with gait and with falling,

332
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.870
I literally get up and okay,
and okay,

333
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.550
and it's,
it's again,

334
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.600
you look at things differently and I look at that as this is an incredible gift.

335
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.890
I think that is that to,
to live that metaphor is,
is,

336
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.950
is so rewarding and enlightening and just opens you up to,

337
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.960
to,
to,
to everything.
Because it really is about that step.

338
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:24.430
And I don't know what to expect after that.

339
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.140
Like we were header into the toilet and crack my handover.
So,

340
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.060
so,
and let the possibility and the next moment,

341
00:22:31.061 --> 00:22:35.590
so I get to read and I don't do that,
then that's a success.
I can build on that.

342
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:41.210
And um,
my,
my,
my day is a typical day is just building and building on,

343
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.700
uh,
relationships and being open to it,

344
00:22:44.701 --> 00:22:49.690
to my family and how they react to it and realizing if it affects them too.
And,

345
00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:52.660
um,
and again,
this,
this,
this,
this,

346
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.020
the only thing that in this understanding that no one dies from Parkinson's,

347
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.990
you die with Parkinson's.
And so I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

348
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.940
I'm living with Parkinson's and,
and my family's living room,
the two.

349
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.050
And so I respond to,
to how they,
how they react and,
and,

350
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.700
and I respond to how I'm feeling and just,
uh,

351
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.800
it's why this,
this,
this work is,

352
00:23:15.801 --> 00:23:19.270
is so rewarding because it's,
it gives me,

353
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.600
it gives me a,
a feeling of,

354
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.670
of usefulness and then I'm,
then I'm doing something productive.

355
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.680
It's really common for people with Parkinson's to talk about how difficult it is

356
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:35.710
in the morning since they've gone all night without medication.

357
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.700
Do you find you can count on your beds once you have taken them?
Yeah,

358
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:42.300
but I liked his butt played this game.
I put Skim,
keep away with them.

359
00:23:42.301 --> 00:23:46.820
I I could care less forestall as where they can.
Um,

360
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:52.040
but why,
why is that?
It just because it'll go,
cause I can,
I can,

361
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.240
if I can pump up.
That's right.
You don't have to take it at eight and I take,

362
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:58.610
take it at nine 30,
then I don't have to take you up to,

363
00:23:58.611 --> 00:24:02.730
and I'm good in the evening.
Um,
it's,
it's,

364
00:24:02.731 --> 00:24:07.630
it's funny to be,
I try not to be a prisoner to it.
I tried to,
I tried to,
to,

365
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.640
to be,
uh,

366
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:14.550
to have it be a living relationship between me and my treatment that we give and

367
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:20.140
take.
Right.
And,
um,
uh,
you know,
any,
he played games that we got,

368
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.690
I was saying to someone earlier and when I go to my doctors and my movement

369
00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:28.460
disorder specialist and she,
she's doing this kind of comes in with this,
uh,

370
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.950
information,
uh,
devices that you guys are working on.
Um,
I go in and,

371
00:24:33.951 --> 00:24:38.951
and she has a list of questions about how I'm doing and she has a graph from one

372
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:43.610
to five or zero to five.
So,
so I,
I instinctually want to get those Zeros,

373
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.200
which means I'm not,
I'm not,

374
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.340
I don't have the symptoms that she's talking about typical over achiever,
right?

375
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.500
Yeah.
But I didn't have the symptoms,
but I say,
you know,

376
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.750
I say I met up so I'm really good shape and I,

377
00:24:53.751 --> 00:24:55.820
and I do my walking really well and I do my,

378
00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.980
all my stuff really well and she's like,
you're great.
And I'm like,
not really,

379
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.760
but,
but,
but,
but,
and this is a key point where you're pointing out is,

380
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.720
is the snapshot that the doctor gets in the office doesn't necessarily what's

381
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:10.880
going on at Mcdonnell and,
and,
and,

382
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:15.881
and where we are in many ways the best reporters of our situation or condition.

383
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:18.860
But in other ways we're not because we just pure humanity,

384
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:22.760
human instinct to want to be the best you can be at any given moment.

385
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.240
So the idea that there's a device that you can just hand you a doctor and he or

386
00:25:30.351 --> 00:25:33.860
she gets a run rundown of what your day,
your week,
your month has been.

387
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.290
How are you,
Hey,
you movement is responding to medication.
How,
how,
how,

388
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.250
how much rest you need.
And I mean,

389
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:48.060
it's an amazing,
amazing thought that you can,
you can,

390
00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.700
you can,
you can turn your experience into,

391
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.100
into information that,
that helps people that are there,

392
00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.110
uh,
in a position to do something about it.
Question for you.

393
00:26:00.111 --> 00:26:02.750
People may notice a little bit of the writhing movement that you have,

394
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.340
the Dyskinesia.
Can you comment on what,
what that's like and what,
it's

395
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:13.900
almost when you're,
the focus of attention,
uh,
get you,
get you Twitty.

396
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.920
So it's just a,
it's a,
it's,
it's a reaction to the medication.

397
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.040
There's something that this drug that I take for called Amantadine,

398
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.720
which is a found drug,

399
00:26:23.721 --> 00:26:28.721
like many drugs that treat diseases that don't have cures or,

400
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.990
or therapies that pretty much resemble a cure.

401
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.580
Um,
and so it made it in,

402
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:40.590
this was a drug that was used for old people had flu and it happens to diminish

403
00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:45.410
Dyskinesia,
but it's going to harsh and even,
I mean,

404
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.420
after a while you see spiders in the corner and stuff moving that isn't there.

405
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.700
Um,
so,
so it's,
is trade off with everything.

406
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:56.410
You try to do a little of that as possible.
I mean,
I could,

407
00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.820
I could get myself still,
but it would be the expensive,
my articulate,

408
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.190
my articulation in my Todd.
I think Michael's bringing up one of the clinical

409
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.890
<v 4>issues is the motor fluctuation,</v>

410
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.270
the trying to balance the good function without being too slow or too
diskinetic.

411
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.590
Um,
are,

412
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.550
are there efforts that the foundation has supported to try to help with some of

413
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:19.770
these day to day symptomatic needs?
Yeah,

414
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:22.350
there's a lot of research going on in this area.

415
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:27.351
One of the main areas is to just see if we can get a better standard delivery of

416
00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:28.590
the medication.

417
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.250
So that Michael was talking before about how he's trying to time his medication

418
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.980
throughout the day to have the optimal benefit.

419
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:39.000
But there's a lot of research to just try to see if you could reformulate the

420
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:44.001
medication either with a patch delivery or more rapid onset delivery just so you

421
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:48.270
can get a more continuous,
consistent,
more predictable day.

422
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.580
And a lot of that is driven by the disease,

423
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:54.840
but also by how your body is handling this medication.
One,

424
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:58.860
a comment that Michael made was repurposing drugs and I think it's been really

425
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:03.210
brilliant what one of your programs has done,
if you want to describe that.
Yeah,

426
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.380
this is a big effort,
not just in Parkinson's,
but an effort we focused on,

427
00:28:07.381 --> 00:28:12.360
which is there's a lot of commonalities in the underlying biological mechanisms

428
00:28:12.361 --> 00:28:13.410
across disease.

429
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.910
And you could take advantage of some of the innovations that have been made to

430
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:22.380
develop molecules or compounds in other diseases and now apply and test them in

431
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:23.214
Parkinson's.

432
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:28.230
Right now there's a large trial going on looking at blood pressure medication as

433
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:31.980
actually a treatment for Parkinson's because the same calcium channels are

434
00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:35.010
involved in,
in the nervous system.
So there's a lot of efforts.

435
00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:38.460
This is the whole point of this to try to short circuit some of the slowness of

436
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:42.690
the drug development pipeline and take advantage of existing treatments and

437
00:28:42.691 --> 00:28:44.580
apply them to the disease.
And Michael,

438
00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:48.450
was that your intent in creating the foundation to,
to you know,

439
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.480
find new drugs or find a cure or all the above or started that to finding a cure

440
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.770
but then it,
it,
we,
we,
we,
we realized that they're doing no pathways to the queue.

441
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.960
There's silos,
but they're very few

442
00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:06.070
<v 3>thruways pipelines.
And,
and,
um,</v>

443
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.100
so we,
as we evolved,
we found,

444
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.920
we found ourselves with a whole new issue,

445
00:29:11.921 --> 00:29:15.550
which was finding drugs and therapies and improving what was there and

446
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:20.880
incentivizing drug companies to,
to take us on because we had a million,
we're,

447
00:29:20.881 --> 00:29:24.990
we're a relatively small population,
uh,
of,
of,
of

448
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.720
sufferers or people that have it.
And,
and,
and so,

449
00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.040
uh,
we,
we,
we would,

450
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.460
we have a drug company and we'd say we're going on a compound and introduced it

451
00:29:38.461 --> 00:29:43.090
and we,
we lend a multibillion dollar,
give a multibillion dollar corporation,

452
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:48.130
$5 million to try to keep your eye on the,
on the,
on the ball.
And then,

453
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:51.940
then we,
then we inserted some situation with big follow on funding once,

454
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.930
once those results were good.
And,
and,
um,
he,
she said,
I mean,

455
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.950
I credit these guys with it.
He came up with it and,
and,

456
00:29:58.951 --> 00:30:03.400
and it's been amazing.
Our,
she put Pharma who,

457
00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.930
I always kind of thought it was bad guys,
but,
but,

458
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.190
but we went away to work with them and then have good results.

459
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.710
<v 4>Have the goals of the foundation changed from when you first envisioned it to</v>

460
00:30:15.711 --> 00:30:16.190
what your,

461
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.060
what you think is important now or do you feel there's a certain concept?

462
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:23.650
<v 3>Let's see.
I,
I didn't see that we do so much.</v>

463
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:29.390
Uh,
uh,
just fine.
He's just finding new ways to,

464
00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:31.360
to approach it.
And I thought it was,

465
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.480
I thought it was you find scientists and you fund them,
but,
but,

466
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.520
but it's bigger than that.
It's funding scientists and,

467
00:30:37.521 --> 00:30:40.270
and knowing what you want to,
what you want from them.

468
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.970
And that's one of the reasons that they tell you about accountability.
We,
I,

469
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.920
I remember saying in early meetings when you give this got $2 million and he's

470
00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:51.720
not going to come and tell us what he's doing.
I mean,
I want a report,

471
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:56.250
I want to give them a report card I want to enter into and withhold funding.

472
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.190
If not,

473
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.840
it's not going in a direction that we expected.

474
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.980
So this philosophy came from the top,
it sounds like.
Well,
I,
I kind of,

475
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.600
I'm like Chauncey Gardner and being there,
I just going to spout

476
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.400
no endowment.
Money comes in,
money goes out,

477
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.440
or I would just look a little Colin's and it,

478
00:31:19.441 --> 00:31:23.560
and the Deb translates into policy.
Yeah,
no,
this is fascinating.

479
00:31:23.561 --> 00:31:26.770
So you said money comes in,
money goes out,
there was no endowment.

480
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.230
You raise the money each year and you spend it.
Yeah,

481
00:31:29.231 --> 00:31:32.800
I mean that's what it's there for.
Yeah.
It's that we're not,
we don't want,

482
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:35.590
we don't want to like sit on a pile of money.
I mean,

483
00:31:35.591 --> 00:31:40.120
it's not doing anybody any good.
So,
so it goes in,
it goes down and,
um,

484
00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.190
science hadn't the money and,
and uh,
and I can't think of a million others,

485
00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.880
but,
so I just kind of,
um,

486
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.320
feel confident that we were going in,
in,

487
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.020
in an innovative direction and we're doing it in a new way,

488
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.420
but just see what all you are about.

489
00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.290
<v 4>Speaking of innovative directions,
Todd,</v>

490
00:32:00.291 --> 00:32:04.520
can you give us a sense of the scope of work that the foundation has supported

491
00:32:04.521 --> 00:32:07.730
and is supported over the years?
Yeah,
so,
um,

492
00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.310
I mean we leave no stone unturned,
but,
uh,

493
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.400
we are focused on really developing new treatments.

494
00:32:13.401 --> 00:32:17.000
A lot of this is now coming out of really novel genetic discoveries.

495
00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:20.810
Parkinson's in the past wasn't thought to have much of a genetic component,

496
00:32:20.811 --> 00:32:25.700
but we're now uncovering a lot of the molecular biology and underlying science

497
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.020
to develop new treatments.

498
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.790
So there's a lot of work the foundation does to build that knowledge base around

499
00:32:31.791 --> 00:32:36.791
these new targets and directions and early drug discovery and more importantly

500
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.250
now we're doing additional work on really how going to go and test these

501
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:45.200
therapies to see if they're actually working.
Michael was talking about the,

502
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:50.590
the exam that is done that involves tapping your nose and tapping your feet and

503
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:55.640
then the doctor gives you a one or a two.
This is the,

504
00:32:55.641 --> 00:33:00.050
the whole basis of a multimillion dollar clinical trial is based on those

505
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:00.884
outcomes.

506
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.490
So there's a big effort the foundation has on trying to improve the outcome

507
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:08.660
measures that could be used in trials both biologically and clinically with some

508
00:33:08.661 --> 00:33:10.430
more of the eject objective measures.

509
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.600
And the other thing that I think is important is to get a better handle on

510
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:18.500
really the natural history of the disease and the variability of the disease

511
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:22.730
that the foundation's working on.
You asked Michael what his typical day is.

512
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.490
There's also not a typical Parkinson's patient,

513
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:28.730
so you have varied patients having varied types of days.

514
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.360
So we need to make more sense of this again so we could really understand how

515
00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:34.760
the drugs are working and that's a big effort.

516
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:39.761
The foundation has this baseline that then all the companies and all the drug

517
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:43.370
developers can build on top of this is Ppmi.
You're Ppmi right?

518
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:48.230
Just talk a little bit more about what Ppmi is as a Ppmi is the Parkinson's

519
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:52.570
progression markers initiative that is a large scale,
um,

520
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.420
natural history study of Parkinson's and people at risk for developing

521
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:57.290
Parkinson's.

522
00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:02.590
It's in 35 sites throughout the world and has rigorous clinical data,

523
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:08.300
biological data that's collected genetics,
neuroimaging,

524
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.940
and it's developed as an open platform.

525
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:13.640
So all the data is made available in real time.

526
00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:18.380
It's a collaborative between the academics and the pharmaceutical companies that

527
00:34:18.381 --> 00:34:20.000
is spearheaded through the foundation.

528
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:24.710
And the goal of this is to really establish a new framework for how we would do

529
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:28.940
clinical trials,
particularly trials of drugs that would slow the disease.

530
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:33.590
We talked before about treatments that could reduce some of the symptoms,

531
00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:38.480
but ultimately we want a treatment that can slow the progress of the disease.

532
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:41.630
And in that case we need to have a better understanding of how the disease is

533
00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:44.330
actually progressing both clinically and biologically.

534
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.550
<v 0>We're going to open it up for questions soon,
but I wonder,
Todd,</v>

535
00:34:48.551 --> 00:34:53.290
if you had thoughts about what an organization like verily might contribute to

536
00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:57.760
advancing the field.
As you know,
this is a room full of hardware engineers,

537
00:34:57.761 --> 00:35:02.110
software engineers,
computational biologists,
clinicians,
clinical researchers,

538
00:35:02.111 --> 00:35:05.770
and so many more types of people,
basic scientists,

539
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.530
uh,
w w what can we do to help?
I think the,

540
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:14.420
<v 4>that can be done here is really would be fundamental to how we can change our</v>

541
00:35:14.421 --> 00:35:18.170
potential for developing transformative treatments for Parkinson's.

542
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:20.990
Where we now are in a position where we have a,

543
00:35:20.991 --> 00:35:25.991
an ability to collect a vast amount of data from people with Parkinson's at the

544
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:27.590
extent never before.

545
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.490
And if you think about the study I just talked about the PPMI initiative,

546
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.000
we have whole genome sequencing,
we have brain imaging,

547
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.930
we have proteomics,
RNA sequencing,
clinical data,

548
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.700
all being collected over time.

549
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.570
We would love to have obviously more objective clinical data.

550
00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:49.200
So using technology to track the course of a day.

551
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:53.550
So it's not just that half hour with a doctor to get the clinical sense,

552
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.630
but then how are we going to utilize all of this information and data to make

553
00:35:57.631 --> 00:36:01.650
sense of the disease?
So it's,
we have the input happening,

554
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.510
how do we now sort of make that output,

555
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.290
the analytics and really the innovation on that information.

556
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.980
And I think that the kind of personnel that are here feed into all of those

557
00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:15.981
components that are critical to really take Parkinson's from 1817 to 2017.

558
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.550
I agree.
I agree.

559
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.980
I'm going to wrap up my questions with two of them and I've a feeling you're

560
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:25.660
going to want to answer them,
uh,
with the,
uh,

561
00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:29.110
optimistic answer last.
So I'll,

562
00:36:29.111 --> 00:36:32.880
I'll start with the more pessimistic one.
What have you been frustrated by?
What,

563
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:36.960
what hasn't really materialized in the last 10 years,
15

564
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.000
<v 3>years.
Oh,
well,
I mean cure</v>

565
00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:46.960
you guys do,
we're going to lift where and,
and uh,
uh,

566
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.370
devices that,
that,

567
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:54.390
that did help a Parkinson's patient live on a day to day basis and,
and,

568
00:36:54.391 --> 00:36:58.080
and,
and,
and,
and just be normal,
feel normal.

569
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:03.230
So liftware is spoons that neutralize tremor and it's really great stuff.

570
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.010
And,
and I was saying earlier that the issues that I deal with,
uh,

571
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.560
like,
uh,
was walking,
she just got fascination where you,
your,
your,

572
00:37:15.561 --> 00:37:20.561
your footsteps get so synchronized that you get to a point where you're frozen

573
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:23.760
and then you tip over like a tree.
There's nothing you can do about it.
Um,

574
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:29.070
but there are tricks you can do counting or are you have your shoulders back

575
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.070
and,
and,
and making big steps.

576
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.900
But it's just all this thinking you have to do all the time to do this in,
in,
in,

577
00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:39.990
so I saw you doing it and I have a hallway in my house.

578
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:43.650
I go around a corner and there's a door to the hall,
to the Hallway.

579
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:44.820
There's a door to my closet,

580
00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:47.220
which is just around the thing and then the door to my office,

581
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.930
which is next door.

582
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:53.220
So I have to work on these doors and I had to put tape down on the floor so I

583
00:37:53.221 --> 00:37:55.080
could step over the tape.

584
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.220
So it would remind me to take a step and tonight get shoveled and falling of the

585
00:37:59.221 --> 00:38:02.460
closet.
And my wife,
I said,

586
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:06.330
I really love you but can we get rid of the frigging tape?
I said,

587
00:38:06.331 --> 00:38:11.070
I can't wipe out.
And that's to me it seems like a simple thing to,

588
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.160
to to to some way deal with,
uh,
to,

589
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:20.670
to look down and create a beam for yourself that it's discreet and invisible to

590
00:38:20.671 --> 00:38:24.960
anyone else at me.
You step over it,
I mean kind of stuff you guys do.

591
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.860
Um,
just,
just,
just to,
to,
to,
to,

592
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.850
we offered the reality in a way that,
that,

593
00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:37.390
that you can function and,
and I'm,
and it short of a cure that,

594
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:40.030
that kind of stuff it really valuable and really important.

595
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.700
You talked about some of your frustrations on the flip side,

596
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.450
where do you most proud of in terms of your work in Parkinson's advocacy?

597
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:50.580
Mommy's the happy guy.
I mean,
I just,

598
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.730
I just look at life as endless opportunity and I'm way wake up every day.

599
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:56.330
Curious and,
and,

600
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.740
and I think that that's as important as anything to wake up every day and say,

601
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:02.260
well,
what is this taking to bring me?
What is it they get to bring us?

602
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.440
What are the possibilities in this day and what,
what,
where,
where outcomes.

603
00:39:06.441 --> 00:39:09.230
And I might,
I might see,
uh,
again,
I,

604
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.990
I live in acceptance and not an expectation,
but acceptance isn't resignation.

605
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:18.460
It's,
it's,
it's just acknowledging the truth and being empowered by it.

606
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:25.390
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

607
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.280
<v 4>I think we have time for some questions,</v>

608
00:39:40.281 --> 00:39:42.500
so we'd love to open it up to the audience.

609
00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:45.200
We have some microphones in the center aisle.

610
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:49.040
Feel free to ask questions of Michael Todd.
Debbie.

611
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.400
<v 1>Hi,
how are you?
I'm Vanessa.
I'm in the science team.</v>

612
00:39:54.401 --> 00:39:57.460
I'm work with microbiome and I had a couple of questions not related to

613
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.630
microbiome.
And so,
um,
in diabetes,
right,

614
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.550
we have a pump and you have the glucose monitor and so you can handle titrate

615
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:11.650
your insulin treatment depending on your glucose in your blood.

616
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.990
So I was wondering if,
um,

617
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:18.250
if you could try trade the treatment depending on your physical symptoms.

618
00:40:18.251 --> 00:40:19.570
So if you had like for example,

619
00:40:19.571 --> 00:40:24.340
this watch that is monitoring your movements through the day,

620
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.920
would that inform,
um,

621
00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:30.790
how you would titrate your therapy?
And on that note,

622
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
what are the challenges of using things like the equivalent of an insulin pump

623
00:40:36.671 --> 00:40:40.170
or a patch for therapy?
Uh,

624
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.440
dis giving therapy to the patients,
Todd and Michael.
Yeah,

625
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:47.220
<v 4>so I'll start.
He bill could help too.
Um,</v>

626
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.230
so I think first the answer is,
uh,

627
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.900
in terms of having an objective measure and titrating your medicine,

628
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.480
the answer would be that would be a goal.

629
00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.710
One of the challenges we have is in the diabetes example,

630
00:41:01.711 --> 00:41:06.711
you're actually measuring a realtime Bob biologic impact of the drug.

631
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.580
So that is a need in Parkinson's still to understand more of the biology and

632
00:41:11.581 --> 00:41:13.020
have a biomarker.

633
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:18.500
But we could use a objective measure of the motor symptoms.

634
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:24.050
And if the patient could start to identify when they think their medication's

635
00:41:24.571 --> 00:41:27.450
starting to wear off objectively,

636
00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:32.451
they could actually preemptively take the medicine so that instead of a patient

637
00:41:32.881 --> 00:41:35.390
maybe going like this during the day with their medicine,

638
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:39.080
if you could kind of see I'm about to go off take your pills.

639
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:41.390
So as that kicks in,
you never hit that trough.

640
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:45.860
I think that is a real possibility with the technology.
Um,

641
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.380
in terms of the delivery of the drug,

642
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:53.390
the real challenge with the pumps have been just the biochemistry of Levodopa,

643
00:41:53.391 --> 00:41:55.760
which is the medicine that the patients use,

644
00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.770
the dosing that's needed and being able to formulate enough of it into a pump

645
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:04.730
that would sort of last the entirety of the day.
And that is,
uh,

646
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.500
there's projects that are working on that now.
Um,

647
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.160
but so I think there's a lot of parallels,

648
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:13.280
just more research would be needed to get to the implication

649
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.690
<v 3>of that.
Do you really want to screw around with all that stuff?
I mean,</v>

650
00:42:18.691 --> 00:42:22.290
looking at watches and I mean,
this is me,
it's just simple.

651
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.980
It's simpler than sitting there for,
for we're half an hour.

652
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.640
And I'm grateful that my doctor gives me a half an hour.

653
00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:34.130
Most patients don't get that.
But yeah,
I been to to,
to just to just have an,

654
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.750
uh,
have a,
an impartial,

655
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.440
just factual record of what you're experiencing and to,

656
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.880
and to have someone be able to look that graphic,
to hear your problem areas,

657
00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.250
here's where you're having difficult transitions and then,
and then,
uh,

658
00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.760
adjust the medication accordingly.

659
00:42:50.761 --> 00:42:54.180
Because I answered questions about my typical day and I didn't say that,

660
00:42:54.181 --> 00:42:56.790
but that's the thing.
Typical Day is managing,

661
00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:01.610
it's managing symptoms and you do everything else around that.
And um,
uh,

662
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:06.830
it can't see it's tiring and exhausting or annoying or frustrating or saddening

663
00:43:07.021 --> 00:43:10.830
or maddening or anything.
It just is,
again,
it's this idea of the fact of it.

664
00:43:10.831 --> 00:43:12.120
It just,
it is so,
so,

665
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.980
so that's my thing I work on all days is how am I going to get to a place today

666
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:18.800
that I want to be when I'm comfortable.
Wow.

667
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.620
Did you just said this is what you work on all day?
Yeah,

668
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:27.510
but it's,
but it's kind of like,
it's kind of like walking,
you're breathing.

669
00:43:27.511 --> 00:43:31.170
It's just,
it's just the thing that I do and it's added to my,
to my portfolio.

670
00:43:31.171 --> 00:43:34.920
Would I need to do on a given day?
Another question.

671
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.753
Sorry,
Tom.

672
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.840
<v 5>My name's Tom.
I'm on the mental health team here and,
um,</v>

673
00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:45.940
<v 3>we need to talk.
We do this.
That's what I wanted to ask you about.</v>

674
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:49.440
<v 5>Thanks for coming for all of you from the foundation.</v>

675
00:43:49.441 --> 00:43:51.300
We really appreciate your insights.

676
00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.390
In addition to the kinds of devices that we work on,

677
00:43:54.391 --> 00:43:59.391
we think a lot here about big data and analytics and how to find patterns in

678
00:44:00.211 --> 00:44:03.920
very noisy but often important data.
Michael,

679
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.290
I was impressed by your story about putting the tape on the floor.

680
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:12.850
Most everything you've talked to us about is ways you found to cope and to deal

681
00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:17.940
with this disease so that you can continue to function.
And I suspect there,

682
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:18.960
uh,

683
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:23.670
another million people with the same disease who also have tricks that they've

684
00:44:23.671 --> 00:44:24.504
found,

685
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.330
sometimes even medications that they may have found that they're taking for

686
00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:30.900
asthma or for some other problem that surprisingly helps them with their

687
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:32.303
symptoms.

688
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:37.490
Does the foundation have a way of crowdsourcing that information pulling in from

689
00:44:37.831 --> 00:44:40.560
a million people and their families what works,
what doesn't?

690
00:44:40.561 --> 00:44:43.980
And then people like us can help to make sense of that.

691
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.950
Is that something that the foundation thinks about?

692
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:50.080
<v 3>Why do it under general?</v>

693
00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:53.740
I was talking about how we're specifically doing that,
but,

694
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.940
but one of the big breakthroughs in this,
someone was asking me earlier,

695
00:44:56.941 --> 00:44:59.130
but one of the,
what are the big breakthroughs in the foundation?

696
00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:04.320
One of our big breakthroughs was finding a way to incorporate patient

697
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.410
involvement and patient knowledge and wisdom and enthusiasm and,

698
00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:12.360
and,
and,
and,
um,
and in fact,
it,

699
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:15.180
it's about these people in so they can,

700
00:45:15.181 --> 00:45:19.650
they can help us with what we're trying to do.
And,
and,
um,
uh,

701
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.690
so all those,

702
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:24.690
those things I find really fascinating when I talked to Kip Parsons patients is

703
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:27.090
we don't,
we all have different disease.
1 million of us,

704
00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:31.440
we were a million versions of it.
We have things that we,
that we,
uh,

705
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:36.840
have difficulty with that someone asked me and I deal with it all.
Um,
I,
I don't,

706
00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:40.430
I mean gastro gastro intestinal stuff is that I don't have that.

707
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.490
We had an issue with that.
Um,
I've never had an issue with,
I,
I,

708
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:47.850
until recently didn't have an issue with sleeping,
but,
um,
so,

709
00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:52.851
so there's back and forth between patients really helps doctors and researchers.

710
00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:55.990
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

711
00:45:55.990 --> 00:46:00.990
So more exactly based on this philosophy where in the process of launching,

712
00:46:01.731 --> 00:46:05.140
which is just getting started up a project called Fox insight,

713
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:09.880
which is an online platform for patients to sort of do exactly this,

714
00:46:09.881 --> 00:46:14.470
to collect information from as many patients as we can and have them complete

715
00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:19.471
surveys and also fill out information to just get more insights and a kind of

716
00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:21.560
concern,
you know,

717
00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.480
come confined way on this information and the data will all be made available

718
00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:30.780
from that for people to dig into both surveys and free text and that type of

719
00:46:31.181 --> 00:46:31.841
information.

720
00:46:31.841 --> 00:46:36.130
So we see this as kind of complimentary to the PPMI initiative is a small number

721
00:46:36.131 --> 00:46:40.150
of people and really deep and this would be as many people as we could get,

722
00:46:40.151 --> 00:46:44.140
but more sort of superficial kind of information and then playing those two off

723
00:46:44.141 --> 00:46:46.960
of each other to get in as much insights as we can.

724
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.070
<v 3>That's the question.</v>

725
00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:50.560
<v 5>Hi,
my name is James.</v>

726
00:46:50.561 --> 00:46:55.030
I'm a scientist who also works in the same department with our microbiome expert

727
00:46:55.031 --> 00:46:58.210
over here.
But to follow up on her question about therapy,

728
00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:01.750
it sounds like you and maybe a lot of other Parkinson's sufferers also have a

729
00:47:01.751 --> 00:47:03.890
pretty complicated relationship with their therapy,

730
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:07.450
with their therapy that they're taking their medications.
And I'm wondering is,

731
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:11.950
is compliance with the therapy or the Richmond a challenge that is faced when

732
00:47:11.951 --> 00:47:15.370
trying to interpret information coming off of clinical trial or even to manage

733
00:47:15.371 --> 00:47:16.540
the disease?
Um,

734
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:21.100
and are there solutions that you guys are looking at that might be a way to

735
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:22.743
amend that problem?

736
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:27.170
<v 4>So maybe a two part question.
The first for Michael,
is it a,
how difficult it is?</v>

737
00:47:27.171 --> 00:47:29.740
Is it to manage the medication schedule each day?

738
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.890
<v 3>I mean,
it's difficult,
but again,</v>

739
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.080
it's about someone who's a paraplegic has difficulties.
I mean,

740
00:47:38.081 --> 00:47:40.700
there's all kinds of,
everybody gets arrested today issues and,

741
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:44.470
and I'm aware of that.
And then it's how you deal with them,
uh,

742
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:49.540
the how you deal with them as an individual thing.
And so,
uh,

743
00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:51.560
I,
I,

744
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.870
I struggle sometimes with getting it right for the most part.
If I,

745
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:59.500
if I can function and do what I planned to do during the course of the day.

746
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:00.740
It's great.
I mean there's,

747
00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:05.650
there's things that like I golf and,
and I'm a terrible golfer.

748
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:09.910
I started golfing my forties with Parkinson's,
so that's not optimism.

749
00:48:09.911 --> 00:48:14.010
I don't know what it is,
but,
but,
but I was golfing in the day and,
and I'll,

750
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.030
I'll get 50 tee on the ball and I'll be like,

751
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:20.680
they're literally five minutes putting on it falls off,
it falls off.

752
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:24.070
I put on in Florida by just the tea,
I put her on,
her phone was off,

753
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.880
I put the ball on slow,
I'd get my hand away quicker.

754
00:48:26.881 --> 00:48:30.890
It's foam up and there's three guys waiting and,
and,
and,
and,

755
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.390
and let's just talk him.

756
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.810
It take as long as it takes me to get volunteers and then swinging it and miss

757
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:42.470
it twice.
So,
so it's the hanging in the one day.
Um,

758
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.820
and it's just,
it's just what it is.
So,
um,
so I,

759
00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:51.820
I do deal with titrating the meds,
but,
but it's just the way it is.

760
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.370
I think in general,

761
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:58.360
Parkinson's patients compared to other diseases are pretty compliant with their

762
00:48:58.361 --> 00:49:02.380
medicine because they feel the impact of it.

763
00:49:02.381 --> 00:49:03.700
It's not like for example,

764
00:49:03.701 --> 00:49:07.300
taking it like a high blood pressure pill where Renee antibiotic,

765
00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:10.390
if you forgot to take it,
you don't really realize you forgot to take it.

766
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.790
Michael will realize if he forgot to take as many timing may be off or the,

767
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.040
but it's not like he's not taking it at all.
So

768
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:26.320
any closing thoughts that you would offer the group today?
Um,

769
00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:29.950
I mean I guess just to reiterate,
uh,
are thankful.

770
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.540
Thank [inaudible] thank you for including us in their grand rounds and for your

771
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:36.370
commitment to Parkinson's disease.

772
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:40.930
And I do think that for us to take the research to the next level,

773
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:43.930
which ultimately the goal is to bring the treatments to the next level.

774
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:47.920
We'll take this new approach of bringing new disciplines into the area.

775
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:52.150
And I think the model here is a great one for the field to be following and

776
00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:56.080
integrating because that will really bring us to the breakthroughs that we want.

777
00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:58.720
So thank you for all the work you're doing.
And Parkinson's.

778
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:02.350
Thanks Todd and Michael.
And He,
thank you.
I mean,

779
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:06.320
thank you so much for your interest and for your,
for a applying your,

780
00:50:06.321 --> 00:50:10.900
your intellect to our situation.
And um,
it just,

781
00:50:10.901 --> 00:50:13.450
it just for understanding that,
oh,

782
00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:18.451
I'm here to do a separate from Todd who can speak program and science.

783
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:22.960
It's,
well,
you know,
that,
that it,
that you're affecting patients,

784
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:26.440
you're affecting people.
And then they have my experiences,
my experience,

785
00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:28.460
but they have no experience in and,

786
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:32.340
and yet common bond between all of us.

787
00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.620
We depend on other people and we depend on other researchers.

788
00:50:36.621 --> 00:50:39.180
We depend on smart,
empathetic people that,

789
00:50:39.181 --> 00:50:43.930
that they can figure out what we need and help us get there.
And I'm,

790
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:48.200
I'm,
I'm grateful for you,
for your interest and for your actions.

791
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:53.720
We're very grateful that you visited us today and thanks for your inspirational

792
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:54.554
comments.

793
