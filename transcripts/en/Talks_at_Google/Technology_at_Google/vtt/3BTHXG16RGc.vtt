1
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.200
So I'm going to give a talk today about probably 45 minutes,
15 minutes.

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.040
I'll talk about the future.
Where are we headed?
Technologies.

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.540
I'll talk about different aspects of innovation and as well I'll finish it up

4
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.240
with my personal perspectives on innovation.

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.690
What I've gained from my personal experience working about 20 years in different

6
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.070
organizations that NASA,
so starting with the population,

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.100
if you look at the population of the earth from the beginning of the evolution

8
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:38.400
of the modern human,
about 200,000 years ago until the year 1800,

9
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.790
it's fascinating that we only have a population of less than 1,000,000,200

10
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:48.780
years.
We went from less than 1 billion to about seven and a half billion people.

11
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.980
And that trend will keep increasing as we reached to 2050 to reach about 10

12
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.990
billion people.
And that is fascinating growth.

13
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.310
Even though there is some continent,
the growth is stagnant or not,

14
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.690
or decreasing it.
Like in Europe,

15
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.590
it's expected that the African continent is going to contribute significantly to

16
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:07.420
their population growth in the world.
Uh,

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.440
something interesting is at the same time we have that the exponential growth of

18
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:15.360
technology is something that we've never ever seen before.

19
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.340
If you look at the computational power that's expected in the next 30,
40,

20
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:24.030
50 years,
so in the year 20,
35 approximately,

21
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:28.110
we expect the computational power is going to be equivalent to one human brain.

22
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.700
And if we keep extrapolating that by the year 20,
65,
20,
70,

23
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.990
or humanities brains will be able to be put in a single computational power.

24
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.210
Now imagine the possibilities of that.
Imagine having a small lab lab,

25
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.270
a small iPhone in your pocket and being so powerful that he can do so many

26
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.710
things.
Now that there's a concern though,
because you know,

27
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:52.140
we're talking about huge population growth,

28
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.570
huge expression of technology that's going to be able to have big impact on,

29
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.410
on the job market.
So,

30
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:02.340
so experts will typically tell you that where is there when there is a new

31
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:06.720
technology that typically creates jobs?
And that is exactly correct.

32
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.830
No question.
But the problem is we're talking about different things here.

33
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.000
We're talking about artificial intelligence and advanced robotics.
So we can,

34
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.700
we combine these two things.
It's a very powerful thing.

35
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.490
It's almost like you're creating almost new species.

36
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.180
So imagine a humanoid robot with the computational power of billions of people

37
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.210
being able to think about things a human will never be able to do.

38
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.370
And how does it fit into the,
into,
into the world,
into the life,
into the economy.

39
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.850
So that's going to be very challenging.
And um,

40
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.490
so this is a very controversial topic.
If you,
if you talk to all the scientists,

41
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.600
researchers,
they will tell you I almost,
almost 50,

42
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:48.360
50 distribution,
50 will tell you,
no,
this is going to be good.

43
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.600
It's going to be creating more jobs and 50 are very,
very concerned.
Actually.

44
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:55.470
They tell you this is going to have fundamental impacts on the way we live and

45
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:58.230
economies and jobs and,
and,
and everything else.

46
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.330
I think even they caught him.
He is,

47
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:04.840
will probably look different than in the future.
So if you have huge amount of,

48
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.950
of people without a job and a lot of the things are being automated,

49
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.880
that's going to be big,
big impact.
So it's not going to happen.
Suddenly.

50
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:14.290
Obviously it's going to be a transition.

51
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.240
And I can tell you from our personal experience in the mission control at NASA,

52
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.130
we had initially when they had the polar program,

53
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.060
we had back rooms with hundreds of people supporting people in the front room.

54
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.640
And um,
as we kept advancing,

55
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.000
we went to the shadow where the computational systems became a little bit more

56
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.050
advanced.
And,
um,
and basically we didn't need that many people.

57
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.520
And now with the new ones,

58
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.630
the net new generations for the future was getting less and less and less so.

59
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:41.620
So it will be transitioned.

60
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.350
So jobs will not be requiring as many people to do them,

61
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.950
but at the end there's going to be a significant impact.

62
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.740
I have a lot of doctor friends,
I always joke with them.

63
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.130
So look at it at an example of how the power of these artificial intelligence

64
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.550
systems will be in the market.

65
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.450
So if you are a primary care physician and um,
and you,

66
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.620
you have a patient,
the patient will tell you what the symptoms are.

67
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.960
You'll base take what you've learned,

68
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:11.620
you experience what you know from medical school and you'll try to do a

69
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:15.820
diagnosis.
And often there's percentages that there is misdiagnosis.

70
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.230
So on the other hand,

71
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.510
look at an opportunity where you talked to two system that has access to every

72
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.730
single medical research paper ever published,

73
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.220
every single analysis from or case studies from,

74
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.700
from hospitals,
every single book.
And not only that,

75
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.800
it can actually gather all this information and big data and be able to find

76
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:40.900
trends and,
and,
and,
and,

77
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.190
and diagnosis that nobody will ever be able to do a new human being will be able

78
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:46.810
to do.
So look at the power.

79
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:50.050
So how is primary care physician be able to compete with something like that?

80
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.900
And the same thing with lawyers.
The same thing with engineers.

81
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:56.500
Same thing with pilots.
We can can go on,
on and on.

82
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.050
Sometimes we have talks about,
you know,

83
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.200
argue about what job is going to be difficult to replace.

84
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.650
And obviously there is a lot of jobs will be difficult to replace.

85
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:08.950
Bye Bye bye automations and intelligence systems.

86
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.480
But the t is,
it's going to be a significant impact.

87
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.630
We're not saying that the future is going to be all robots and nothing else,

88
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.260
but what we're saying is there's definitely something to think about because

89
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:24.100
it's going of becoming soon.
I was going to have tremendous impacts on all of us.

90
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.830
So the thing is we need to be able to tackle these problems or,

91
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.200
or this upcoming technology.
We need to start thinking about it from today.

92
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.220
We need to engage academic institutions,
we need to engage government,

93
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.730
industry,
everybody working together.
Um,

94
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.450
and that's the only way that we are able to tackle everything and advanced,
uh,

95
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.240
talking about,
um,
uh,
technologies and um,

96
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.240
and the gap between what academia is producing at what the government that,

97
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.083
what industry,

98
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.960
there is a lot of disconnect between the is produced and then what's being used.

99
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.690
Eh,
do you have a lot of corporations,
for example,

100
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.590
that their produce technologies and,

101
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.430
and did you have patterns and then they put them on the side?

102
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.750
Same thing with academia.

103
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.770
You can go to any academic institutions and talk to the technology transfer

104
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:17.771
office and you see hundreds of Ip and patents nobody is willing to use because

105
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:18.980
they have no use for it.

106
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.660
So I believe before you do something and invest in developing a new technology,

107
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.740
you have to be aligned with who is going to be a customer before you invest in

108
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:30.590
it.
So by the time you have this achieved and completed,

109
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.240
there is the line that's kind of take it,
create a new industry and new business.

110
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.040
Uh,
and,

111
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.100
and that's how we going bridge the gap and capitalized on the technologies and

112
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:41.330
does it research and development.

113
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.300
Not only for the sake of just putting it in portfolios,

114
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.800
but make sure it's being used and we capitalize on it as much as possible.

115
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.283
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.240
<v 0>So let me give you a quick example of why we are interested in innovation at</v>

117
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:57.020
NASA.

118
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.340
So recently then the last few years we retired the special program and the

119
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:04.460
intention from the space shuttle program was to build the space station.

120
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.540
The space station is a national international lab and we're learning so much

121
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.170
every single day.
About the behavior of the human body and in the space,

122
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:13.400
in microgravity environment,

123
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.290
we're learning about the long term effects on humans from that radiation,

124
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.760
gravity environment and so on.

125
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.890
Obviously there's big effects on that in the muscles,
on the bones,
on the vision,

126
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.350
on the psychology.
So when we send somebody to,
to,

127
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.920
to deep space exploration,

128
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.110
we need to understand these things cause in space station,

129
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:36.350
if there's any problem,
any issues,
obviously we can bring them back fast.

130
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.290
But when you're talking about sending somebody to Mars,

131
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.170
which admission could take six to eight months to a year depending on what,
what,

132
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.840
what the way you go in there.
It's a big problem.
It's a big,

133
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:48.270
big issue.

134
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.910
So many of them to stand a lot of these issues before we invest in and commit to

135
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:56.210
sending a person,
uh,
recruit to two different planets.

136
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.680
So right now that the three options that initially we had was going to the moon

137
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:02.300
again and establishing a permanent base.

138
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.360
I'm going to an asteroid or going to Mars.

139
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.320
And recently it seems the emphasis is headed toward going to Mars and that's

140
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:12.370
where we are going to be going.
So by doing that,
uh,

141
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.030
obviously there's significant challenges,

142
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.710
a lot of issues we're going to be facing.

143
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.730
So we're going to be creative as much as possible because the limitations and

144
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:24.260
funding and technology,
either we have become creative,
innovative,

145
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:28.340
and we think out of the box or everything will be much more complicated to
solve.

146
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.430
And the,
if you notice now we have a lot of new commercial,

147
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.540
new space emerging and they're working in the lower earth orbit,

148
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.840
what we call their earth orbit.
Uh,
after we finished that,

149
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:43.050
now we'll concentrate and going deep and we're establishing them that market to

150
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.790
the,
to,
to the commercial.
Uh,
think if you look at the,
uh,

151
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.690
at what NASA is contribution and the government's contribution,

152
00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:54.350
creating jobs and creating innovation as well.
We,
early on in the century,

153
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.580
we heavily in creating,
uh,
the basic research for aeronautics.

154
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.140
And that resulted in salvaging companies like Boeing,
Lockheed,

155
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.590
and so on that that are creating significant amount of jobs and at huge,

156
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.820
uh,
uh,
gross domestic project product.
The same thing we're doing right now,

157
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:16.260
like I said with the commercial is

158
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.860
developing technology and giving everything and enabling the commercial entities

159
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:26.940
to work in the low earth orbit is that by the year 2014,

160
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.340
it was approximately $330 billion,
um,
uh,
worthwhile.
And that trend,

161
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:34.800
obviously we'll keep increasing and we'll,
we'll,

162
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:37.890
we'll talk about some other stuff in terms of miniaturization and how it's

163
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:41.670
impacting technology,
making it better and more effective and so on.

164
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.963
So,
uh,

165
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.600
what are the main technologies that will be mainstream in the next 10 years,

166
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:51.960
let's say approximately.
So big data obviously is going to be an one of them,

167
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.910
a big data internet of things.

168
00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.210
Now the thing is big data is nothing without having a system that can go through

169
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:03.960
it and be able to decipher the big data and make something meaningful out of

170
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:07.380
that information that you have.
Otherwise,
just junk data.
This,
it's worthless.

171
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.910
Look at medical records,

172
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:13.080
if you can have a millions of people's medical records and go through them.

173
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.580
And I'm sure there are trends that currently we don't understand,

174
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.220
but there is actually correlations between certain things.

175
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.180
So they will be able to do diagnosis or premed prevent disease before they

176
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:26.160
happen.
And even when they happen,

177
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:31.190
there'll be able to find ways how to be able to solve in much more effective way

178
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.220
by,
by,

179
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.570
by the suffering millions and billions of data points because we have such

180
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.780
strong and robust,
uh,
artificial intelligence systems,

181
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.300
driverless cars.
So I got familiar with the driverless cars when I was at ames.

182
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.260
You see the little Google cars driving by all the time.
It's kind of fascinating.

183
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.670
And,
um,
I think that's fine by itself could have huge impacts on the market.

184
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.560
So if you look,
what are the benefits from having driverless cars?

185
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.320
So you will have zero accidents.
That's the point.
Obviously.
Um,

186
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.230
initially the way we do it is we need to do more cases.

187
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:11.360
So the more information we have,
the algorithms becomes refined and,

188
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.240
and that's when you become getting better and better.
So the more cars we have,

189
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.830
the more we drive,
the better the algorithms and,
and,
and,

190
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.650
and everything is working properly.

191
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.040
So imagine having a car with no accident because most of the time accidents are

192
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:28.380
human based.
So if we can prevent that,
that's going to be a big advantage.

193
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.320
Another thing is becoming productivity.

194
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:35.130
Look how much productivity we are wasting by driving.
And some people,

195
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.060
especially in the states,
they have to commute for hours.
And so it's,
it's,
it's,

196
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.570
it's completely wasted productivity traffic.
There will be no traffic anymore.

197
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:44.700
First of all will be significantly less cars.

198
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.780
Second cars will be able to communicate with each other so you can drive faster,

199
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.030
close to each other.
And,

200
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.240
and so we'll let you go much faster without creating congestions and highways

201
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.770
that we typically see every now and then.
Air Pollution,

202
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.670
they won't be money pollution,
psychological effects and people like,
um,

203
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.740
when people,
each certain ages they won't be able to drive anymore.

204
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.230
And that causes huge impacts.
I've seen it from my,
my brother,
my,

205
00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.350
my father in law when he got 80,

206
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:15.580
he got his driver's license taken and you can see a big impact on people.

207
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.550
So all that stuff will be something of the past.
Now the thing is,
uh,
how,
what,

208
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:25.300
how is that going to disrupt the industry?
So typically we,

209
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:27.700
if you look at an average house in the states,

210
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.830
we have two to three cars per per house.

211
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.470
And there's absolutely no need to have more than one car.

212
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.750
Even having several cars for that,
for the neighborhood.

213
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:37.780
That's what the trend is going to be headed for.
So you're not,

214
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.050
you're not going to be able to manufacture as many cars cause there no need for

215
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:44.320
money,
cars,
insurance companies,
two things.
First of all,

216
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:47.230
they don't have as many cars to,
to ensure the second wide.

217
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:50.260
Would you insure a car if there zero accidents,
right?
So,

218
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.840
so need to be thinking about these kind of things.
Uh,
and then,
uh,
manufacturers,

219
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.620
uh,
maintenance,
facilities,
oil and gas.
Imagine how much oil and gas we consume.

220
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.380
So it will be a signal.
Imagine if you reduce it by a fraction,

221
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.980
the amount of cars,
and then obviously as all of us see,
not only,

222
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:07.360
it's got to be much less cars,
but it will,

223
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.960
we we're headed toward electricity and maybe solar and renewable energy.

224
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.900
So how are the all the senses you going to be impacted?

225
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.500
I think they need to start sitting together and brainstorming,

226
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:20.320
strategizing about the future because this is coming.
There's no question.

227
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.170
It just a matter of time.
So if you work on it from today,

228
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.990
you'll have much better impact and be able to,

229
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.020
to position yourself in the market.
Miniaturization,

230
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.030
look at this interesting thing in 1956.
That's five megabytes.

231
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.190
And I look at what we have today and keep going on that trend.

232
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.900
I can't even imagine how,
what's going to happen,
you know,
so,

233
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.320
so in terms of medicalization,
um,
the last 25 years,

234
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.570
people that needed satellite,

235
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.660
a satellite used to cost maybe a hundred,

236
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:54.820
150 to a hundred depending on what it is.

237
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.560
And the average age also as of service used to be tens of years and the decades.

238
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:00.920
And,
uh,

239
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.920
the thing now is that that will change the market is we have many

240
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:08.230
generalizations.
So a lot of these big components,

241
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.000
we can put them significantly smaller.

242
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.530
And then the technology is changing at such a pace that if you send something

243
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:16.750
and you want to work for 20 years,
the first,

244
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:20.590
first five years going to be obsolete because technology is already overcome it.

245
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.930
So by having,
for example,
the satellite business,

246
00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:27.850
if you have macro cubes that you send them the last about a year and a and then

247
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.710
they come down.
So it's an opportunity for you to,

248
00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:35.350
to keep replenishing it with the,
with the state of the art technology.

249
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.590
And then access to space is getting space,
getting much cheaper.

250
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.220
That is not a prime to keep replenishing it.
So it's not a cost inhibitor.
Uh,

251
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.980
it used to be $10,000 per pound,
$1,000 per pound.
We're getting $200 per pound.

252
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.260
And now there are companies,
commercial companies,
for example,

253
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:55.820
there's one in New Zealand called a rocket labs.
They're developing robots may,

254
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.390
I'm sorry,
a rocket made from composite and uh,

255
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.770
they're supposed to get the price of pound to orbit about $10 a soldier so he

256
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:04.880
can see,
you can see the trend.

257
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:09.260
So that by itself is going to open huge amount of markets and Google actually

258
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:12.230
was in,
you guys were involved in some satellite,

259
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.460
the things and the Silicon Valley augmented reality.

260
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.180
That's something of importance of significance,
importance,
uh,

261
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.330
not only augmented reality but also in terms of virtual reality.

262
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.100
But wearing the glasses example,

263
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:32.840
we'll look at them in them and space station or even go into two different

264
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:35.840
places where you kind of mission control can see exactly what you're looking at.

265
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.910
You can give you instructions on the screen.

266
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.820
And I know Google came with the Google glasses and we did some,

267
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.630
some work with them too in terms of partnerships,
experiments,

268
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:47.270
some how can be used,
uh,
stuff like that.

269
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.200
And I'm in the medical field can,
can have significant impacts.

270
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.530
And then we're talking about virtual reality is going to be super mature.

271
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.070
It's going to impact several sectors.
Even the tourism sector will be,

272
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.000
will be part of that.

273
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:04.040
So these are things that I'm going to be so common as we move forward.

274
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.240
Autonomous flying vehicles.
I mean who,
who,

275
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.160
who heard about that 20 years ago and now it's like almost everybody can have

276
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:15.080
small,
uh,
android all the UAV.
And um,
it's,

277
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.470
the good thing about them is they're establishing to a new market.

278
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.840
So the key is we're talking about so many technologies here,

279
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.640
but the key is how do you develop service industries to align with those?

280
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.530
So the Internet,
when it came,

281
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:31.520
it was a technology and look at what industry has created because of technology

282
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.180
that it was the foundation.
So same thing with this,

283
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.890
with all these technologies and even other technologies as well,

284
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.670
we know they're going to be there.
We know we're going to be mainstream.

285
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:44.930
How it can you align your business models to create services that will service

286
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.250
all these industries.
That is the key here.
A three d manufacturing,

287
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:54.350
the question is,
is is going to be something of significant importance for us.

288
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.600
If we go to Mars for example,

289
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.370
there is no point of getting so many spare parts with that cause it's very heavy

290
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.750
and we don't know what's going to fail.

291
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:05.960
We don't know who's taking the spare part and with actually use it.

292
00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:11.140
So it makes perfect sense just to have a three d printing machine and the

293
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:15.680
whenever you need something and they beam the foul and you print it there and

294
00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:17.850
not only you can print it,
but we can use a soil.

295
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.380
We'll be doing some analysis and research using the soul,

296
00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.370
a soil of Mars to create actually this feedstock to create these components.

297
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.920
So it will be very,
very effective and very efficient.

298
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.150
And another thing also is when you create very intricate parts,

299
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.320
when you have a launch environment,

300
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:36.050
sometimes very difficult to get these things in tacked onto orbit.

301
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.170
So you'll be able to manufacture a lot of the stuff and in space.

302
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.320
And then it has,
you can look at medical industry,

303
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.430
look into Oregon reproduction with the three d machines.

304
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:51.210
You can look into food industry,
they're even talking about apparel as well.

305
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:53.640
Shirts,
you can,
you can start printing shirts in the future.

306
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.200
There's some people say that and they're distant future.

307
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.250
You'll be able to download a file for the share that you want and you will be

308
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.490
able to print it in a facility and we access to immediately to it.

309
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.160
Now the thing is,
we talked about a lot,
a lot of technologies,
but again,

310
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.710
there is a big,
big thing.
It's cybersecurity.

311
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.500
If you don't have a robust cybersecurity,

312
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.410
then it's gotta be difficult to have effectiveness and everything.
We just,

313
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.690
we just discussed driverless cars,
for example.

314
00:18:21.691 --> 00:18:24.210
You're driving to work or the car's technique to work,

315
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.090
somebody hacks into it and takes it.
So these things are,
are going to happen.

316
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:34.860
And unfortunately it's,
um,
it's,
it's a risk.
So cybersecurity is very,

317
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:37.650
very essential that we understand how to,

318
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.770
how to help to build robust systems.
We'll be able to,

319
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.760
and capable of defending and making sure everything is safe.

320
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.070
Um,
I'll give a couple of examples about some disruptive industries.

321
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.570
So the first one I'll talk about Zara.
Zara's.
Um,

322
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.100
it's a clothing store and right now we have,

323
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.980
they have about 2000 stores worldwide.
And when they started,

324
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.500
people have serious doubts.
It will be successful.

325
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.240
It's a very competitive industry and I'm getting into it.
It's almost unheard of.

326
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.640
So what these people did,
they found a gap.

327
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.550
There's always a gap and Annie Business.
So the thing is,

328
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:18.180
if you are successful filling the gap,
it will be successful.

329
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:21.420
The key is finding what is the gap and do a flawless execution.

330
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.050
So what these people did,
uh,
when,
when you,

331
00:19:25.051 --> 00:19:28.680
when you go to a store and you see a clothing garment,

332
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.910
it takes about a year from the time designers put it together until it hits the

333
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:35.040
shelves in stores,
it's about 12 months.

334
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:40.320
So what what Zara did is they reduce that time for two weeks.
So a designer can,

335
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.800
can draw something until it hits the shelf.
It only takes about two weeks.

336
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.040
And then what they did is also the create sense of scarcity.

337
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.270
So they create only very limited amount of,
uh,

338
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.650
of shirts or pants or dresses and whatever that they're sold out.
That's it.

339
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:56.640
They're not going to do them again.

340
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.760
So you're feeling that you're buying a shirt man year.
It's very unique.

341
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.160
It's very skirt.
A lot of people have access to it and um,

342
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.390
and not only that,
if you walk to any of the stores,

343
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:11.810
they have managers with their laptop or their iPad and take a dose talking to

344
00:20:12.601 --> 00:20:15.900
customers and taking notes.
Okay.
What do you like about this shirt?

345
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.780
Do you like anything different about it?
I mean,

346
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:21.120
would it make sense if this was like this or like that?

347
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.530
And they send all that information into the headquarters and they have analysis

348
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.410
of the,

349
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:31.550
of what the customers want and to see big area that people are interested in.

350
00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.151
Well guess what,

351
00:20:33.151 --> 00:20:36.780
two weeks later they have the shirt with all this input that people had and they

352
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:41.400
keep doing this iteration over and over and,
and,
and they becoming so successful.

353
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.830
I mean,
I'm surprised almost everywhere I go.
I see that company before,

354
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.050
I only used to see it in Spain when I used to spend,
I used to,
I like this.

355
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.180
They had very nice design.
They used to buy stuff there.

356
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.490
But now you can see it anywhere.
Even in Asia,

357
00:20:56.491 --> 00:21:00.040
in Europe and United States.
I mean everywhere they have stores and very,

358
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:00.701
very successful.

359
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:04.810
The owner actually is one of the richest guys in the world right now.
Netflix.

360
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.580
So everybody obviously knows Netflix.

361
00:21:06.581 --> 00:21:11.581
But I want to highlight how finding successful business model,

362
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.750
it's not enough.
You have to keep innovating and moving forward and adapting.

363
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.990
So,
um,
at that time when,
when the,

364
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.770
when that floods came and initially people were having issues going to

365
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.410
Blacksburg,
I used to hate it,
get,
I love movies,

366
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.450
but he used to hate going to blockbuster,

367
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.350
renting it because I never had time to go and return it in time.

368
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:36.010
Almost every single time.
It cost me about 10,
$15 just to rent the movie.

369
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:40.840
And it became very annoying.
So when the technology changed from VHS to DVD,

370
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.030
then Netflix came in with a,

371
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.750
with a brilliant distribution scheme and they put it in major cities.

372
00:21:46.751 --> 00:21:47.260
So you will,

373
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:52.260
you were able to get a DVD and one or two days maximum and they change the model

374
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:55.580
from going to rent to subscription model.
So,

375
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.350
so people were subscribed to the surface and we're able to get one or two DVDs

376
00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:01.210
per month or I'm getting access to that.

377
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.610
So after they did this,
they,

378
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.570
they became extremely successful and even offered to,
to,
to,

379
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.500
to sell themselves to blockbuster.
Blockbuster didn't see the values.

380
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.360
They continued on their own and eventually ended up failing.

381
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.180
But what happened with,
with this,
they weren't satisfied.

382
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.350
So when the technology became mature enough that the Internet became fast and

383
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.340
broadband,
they started streaming the movies.
People get anxious.
You know,

384
00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:30.520
they don't,
the patients goes down and down.
The more technology we have,

385
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:33.500
people don't want to wait one or two days.
They want it.
Right now I'm getting at,

386
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.320
I had to get access immediately to it.

387
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.640
So they started the biggest streaming libraries available in the market and it

388
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:43.450
became extremely,
extremely successful.
Again,
did not satisfy,

389
00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.680
they were not satisfied cause that's a,

390
00:22:44.681 --> 00:22:49.660
that's an area other people can come into it and take advantage of it and be the

391
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:53.230
intent of market.
So they went actually into the production.

392
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.010
So it became a production company.
And from the production company,

393
00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.470
they became like that.
A very successful company.
Look at the,

394
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.380
at the,
uh,
the smartphone companies.
How much impact did it have?

395
00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:09.010
The GPS and radio and the camera and music gaming serving a big,

396
00:23:09.011 --> 00:23:12.190
big impact on a lot of aspects actually.
And that's very,
very essential.

397
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.730
That tells you you have to be looking at a small company that had,

398
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.170
have a big impact on what you're doing.
Um,
if you,
if you look at the startups,

399
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:24.370
sometimes a lot of these,
uh,
activities come from,
from garages.

400
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.940
People work in a small garage and you have to look into,
into,

401
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:30.970
to what's going on because that's where most of the ideas will come from.

402
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

403
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.500
<v 0>I'll give you a couple examples about how to become creative basically.</v>

404
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.880
So there was a city in Europe that people were having problems with,

405
00:23:41.881 --> 00:23:44.660
posters having posters there and um,

406
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.330
and it was ruining a lot of the architecture that we're having.
And uh,

407
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.880
so they thought about having,

408
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.620
how can we use that so that they talked to the city and they met several times.

409
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.270
They were having issues with that.

410
00:23:56.271 --> 00:24:00.470
So they started putting posters with the stamp,
with dates saying,
okay,

411
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:02.360
well this is a,

412
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.810
this is putting it a date thing.
Okay,

413
00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:09.920
they change or a template,
it's been canceled.

414
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.340
And that made it start making some,
some differences with what they tried to do.

415
00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.700
Uh,
there's also a speeding ticket program,
Eh,
there is a small town in Europe.

416
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.040
They were having a lot of issues with the speeding cars.

417
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.700
So one of the people came up with a brilliant idea.
They said,
well,

418
00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.820
what if we actually implement the program where we give some of the benefits to

419
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:33.350
the people that are not speeding?

420
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:36.800
So they put cameras in these towns and the cameras capture this,

421
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.420
the car that we're speeding as a car that would not speeding and the cards would

422
00:24:40.421 --> 00:24:43.190
not speeding.
We're actually being put on the side.

423
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:48.050
And they developed a model where 70% of the proceeds go to the,
to that,

424
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:52.040
to the city,
and 30% of the proceeds go to the people that would not speeding.

425
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.610
So you're rewarding the people that are not speeding at the same time.

426
00:24:55.611 --> 00:25:00.200
You're getting value because you're still making 70% profit.
And that had huge,

427
00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:02.690
huge impact in,
in um,
and having,
uh,

428
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.590
reductions in speeding cars in that specific town.
Uh,

429
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.160
there was a company in Holland that,
um,

430
00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.400
that manufacturer advanced bicycles with a lot of advanced electronics and they

431
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:18.020
were having a lot of problems in shipping.
We're a lot of it,

432
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:20.150
we're getting damaged.
So what they did,

433
00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:23.400
what are the people came up with a brilliant idea saying once we package it,

434
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.920
like it looks like a TV.
And then by doing that,
just simple as that.

435
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:32.150
There are 70 to 80% reduction in the amount of damage as people were having.

436
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.320
But so that tells you the amount of creativity.

437
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.900
So a lot of innovation actually is derived from nature at,
um,

438
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.990
it's interesting how nature actually is very innovative in sense,
right?

439
00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:46.700
So it's a lot of things can be a drag from there.

440
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.480
So about a couple of years ago I was in Japan and uh,
went to the professor to a,

441
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.800
in one of the weekends to a Lotus farm land that I was in us.

442
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.110
I looked at that as a man that's kind of interesting.
Look at that.

443
00:25:57.111 --> 00:25:59.840
The water never sticks to that,
to the plan,
keeps going back and forth.

444
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.610
And then he told me a story that,
uh,

445
00:26:01.611 --> 00:26:05.880
some of the Japanese scientist actually investigated the leafs and the macro

446
00:26:05.881 --> 00:26:10.881
structure and develop the lead for the yogurt containers that a,

447
00:26:11.051 --> 00:26:13.730
the August never sticks to it.
And that tells,
you know,

448
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.270
just looking at something in nature,
how you adapted and you move it forward.

449
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:23.010
Uh,
the same thing with the underwater turbans.
So,
uh,

450
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.930
that's a way to generate electricity from a underwater currents and there is a

451
00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:29.660
lot of drag and they weren't as effective.

452
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.350
So they did an analysis of the world,
the fence at the Norris,

453
00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:34.490
these ridges and the fence,

454
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.650
they create significantly less drag and they're much more effective.
So this,

455
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.730
they put,
uh,
uh,
this area into,

456
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:45.120
into the analysis and design and they come up new fans that looked like this and

457
00:26:45.121 --> 00:26:48.630
they were significantly more effective than conventional fund that they had

458
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:52.740
before.
So I'll tell you now about some cross industry innovation.

459
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:56.370
How combining in innovation in different industries,

460
00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:00.270
you create something very meaningful.
So in Africa,

461
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.190
some of the poor countries,

462
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.220
they were getting gifts and grants as an incubator for four babies.

463
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.140
The problem was is whenever you have them it failure and you need to have

464
00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:15.360
replacement of component.
They didn't have access to that.

465
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.190
So as soon as they had that,

466
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.460
they used to put on the side and storage and that's it.
They had no use for it.

467
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:24.750
So then they started thinking about,
okay,
how can we solve that problem?

468
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:29.820
So they had teams of people,
Eh,
consultants,
they investigate what's going on.

469
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.780
And they found out that one of the Tiara four wheeled cars is very popular in

470
00:27:33.781 --> 00:27:36.390
this region.
So they came together and said,
well,

471
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.790
what if we create something that we can leverage on the parts from this car to,

472
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.120
to,
to be able to replace any components from,
uh,
from the incubator.

473
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:46.420
And they came actually with,

474
00:27:46.421 --> 00:27:51.330
with one very interesting design that can completely be replaced with parts from

475
00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:54.900
the car.
And that's sort of the problem and created much,
much more value.

476
00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:01.470
Now that's a fascinating story.
So this is the car mechanic from Argentina.

477
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:06.390
So if you think a car mechanic,
you know,
okay,
let's see how it goes.
Um,
they were,

478
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.060
they were in dinner one day having a wine,

479
00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.110
drinking wine and I guess they were drinking so much wine that,
you know,

480
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.330
one of the guys just messed up and put the cork inside the bottle.

481
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.920
And then the started betting,

482
00:28:16.921 --> 00:28:20.190
how can we get the cork out of the bottle without breaking the bottle itself?

483
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.590
And they started having different methods and nobody was successful and this guy

484
00:28:25.591 --> 00:28:27.510
came in,
put a plastic bag.

485
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.950
I tried to twist it across the court,
inflated it,

486
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.540
and get the cork out without a problem.

487
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.710
Then the fascinating thing is how about that?

488
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.690
That's an excellent example of Bacardi.
Think outside,
you know,

489
00:28:39.691 --> 00:28:43.200
take it one step further.
He had the gynecology friend,

490
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.780
he was a good friends with him,
so he started talking to him about,

491
00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:48.660
look what I found.
Is there any,
any way we can,

492
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.370
we can actually use that in real life.
How can we use in delivery?
So guess what?

493
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.430
They came up with a system that actually extremely cheap to deliver babies and

494
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.920
poor countries where they don't have access to more sophisticated equipment.

495
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.040
And by doing that,
you see from a party to a court to,

496
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:08.850
to finding something that can save thousands and tens of thousands of people's

497
00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:10.760
lives and developing country.
And,

498
00:29:10.761 --> 00:29:13.650
and that's extremely low cost by just thinking completely out of the box.

499
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:20.910
So dice and actually,
um,
came to solve a big problem.
Uh,
the thing with,

500
00:29:20.911 --> 00:29:23.790
with,
with vacuum cleaners,
the minute you start cleaning,

501
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.240
the filter gets clogged almost immediately.
And the more club you have,

502
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:31.140
the more dust than the less effective it has in the suction capabilities.

503
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.390
So Dyson came in the late seventies and started looking about how can I solve

504
00:29:36.391 --> 00:29:37.760
this problem?
So look,

505
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.040
he looked into the saw mill and he starts Samil actually I would,

506
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.550
evolution of the air,

507
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.060
the dust falls down and then it goes from a different conduct.
And,
um,

508
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:52.320
and that's an example of how you can solve problems from looking at different

509
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:56.620
industries.
But also it's an excellent example of resistance.

510
00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:02.070
So that was in 1979 created almost 5,000 prototypes until he found the perfect

511
00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:05.200
model.
So it tells you you have to be persistent,
you have to look outside,

512
00:30:05.201 --> 00:30:10.201
you have to look into other other venues together is what gives you actually

513
00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:14.830
success.
And that's exactly what he did.
He became extremely successful there.

514
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:17.280
Their revenues getting close to a billion dollars actually it's,

515
00:30:17.281 --> 00:30:20.920
it's an amazing company.
It's one of the best vacuums you can see.
And by the way,

516
00:30:20.921 --> 00:30:22.140
I don't have stock in Dyson,
so,

517
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.260
so combining innovations,
um,
I'll just give you a call.
So quickly example,
it's a,

518
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.270
the easiest form of finding new innovative ideas by having two innovations and

519
00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:39.250
combining them into one.
So the first one is I'm the cook,

520
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.920
the bottles and the cans and then they have a new new designs.

521
00:30:42.921 --> 00:30:44.860
Actually it's combined both of them.
It's a,

522
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:50.010
it's a can and I'm sorry that the cap and you open it.
Like if,
if it was a can,

523
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.160
it's kind of very unique.
And then the cronut,
the cronut,

524
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.700
it's a doughnut and across on,

525
00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.390
and I'm a key and was saying that there is a very nice a cronut place here in

526
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:06.130
Dublin.
I didn't get a chance to go see it,
but it seems like a good deal.
Um,

527
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.001
open innovation.

528
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:10.660
So we've been extremely successful at NASA leveraging on opening innovation.

529
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.110
Most of the time solutions come from completely different industries beside

530
00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:17.200
yours and it's,
it's very important that you take advantage of that.

531
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.670
So we look at the case study done by Harvard,
uh,
uh,
Miss Medical School,

532
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.820
uh,
to,
to develop an algorithm to,
to improve the,

533
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.430
the mega blast nucleotide sequencing.
So the first run,

534
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.270
they spent several years and he spent about $2 million developing this algorithm

535
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:35.643
and uh,

536
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:40.150
they got the solution and for three hours and it was actually very not very

537
00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:45.040
accurate,
about 72%.
Then they hired two postdocs and the postdocs,

538
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.390
uh,
spent about a year,

539
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:51.420
they pay them $120,000 and they were able to reduce the time from 4.3 hours to

540
00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:52.420
47 minutes.

541
00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:57.790
And the accuracy went up from 72 to 77 and then they took advantage of the open

542
00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:01.240
innovation platforms and the port in the market.

543
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:06.780
And by doing that they were able to reduce the time from 4.3 hours to 16 second,

544
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:13.470
the accuracy went to 80% and the only spent $6,000 and the solutions,

545
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.440
uh,
this is actually the best solution.
If you look at the chart here,

546
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.610
all these things above the green are better solutions that the original one and

547
00:32:21.611 --> 00:32:26.050
significantly cheaper.
But that tells you the power of open innovation.
And um,

548
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.890
there is a concern of are for people understand I'm talking to different

549
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:33.700
industries.
If you advertise you your,
your problems,
your gap,

550
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.270
then you're opening it to the competitor to see what's going on in your company.

551
00:32:37.271 --> 00:32:41.120
So it could be a challenge and that's maybe some people haven't taken as much

552
00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:45.860
advantage of that technology,
but recently they've been finding ways to,

553
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.640
to,
to make it anonymous and then break it down into,
into,

554
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.870
into component level that the whole system to break it down to component level

555
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:54.710
to solve the problem.

556
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.450
And then you can get solutions without knowing an advertising.
Uh,

557
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.220
what your issues are.
Two potential competitors in the field.

558
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:07.340
So I'll give you a quick perspectives on innovation based on what I've seen in

559
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:11.410
the past 20 years and things that worked for me.
How can we make,
um,

560
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.210
an environment more creative?
What roadblocks do I get?

561
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:19.190
And I'll talk about some of that stuff.
So there is um,
first of all,

562
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.730
people think innovation or being creative.

563
00:33:22.731 --> 00:33:26.720
You are born creative and,
and that is,
that is true.
You know,
some of us are much,

564
00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:28.640
much more creative than others but um,

565
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:33.700
but still I think there are tools that you can do to significantly improve your

566
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:38.420
creativity.
You can talk to people that are very creative,
engaged with them,

567
00:33:38.421 --> 00:33:39.620
you can read articles,

568
00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:43.370
you can see cases and you can be in an environment that's very creative and,

569
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:46.640
and eventually you will be eh,
you creativity level.

570
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.070
I guarantee you'll definitely is going to go up.
Um,

571
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.810
I've tried that myself as well.

572
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:54.380
I've noticed an improvement of getting to certain environments in terms of

573
00:33:54.381 --> 00:33:56.990
innovation and also an innovation has two components.

574
00:33:56.991 --> 00:33:59.710
Actually there is revolutionary and evolutionary.

575
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.110
So evolutionary is kind of easier to get,
but um,

576
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:07.350
but it doesn't give you as much value and then that revolutionary,
uh,

577
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.140
or as it's being called moonshot and the cortisone shot because it's a,
it's a,

578
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:15.020
it's a problem so difficult to solve,
but if you solve it,

579
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:19.160
it has a game changing applications.
And uh,
so there's two different ones.

580
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.980
The second one,
the revolutionary is very difficult,
but if you get it,

581
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.270
companies actually have business business products that completely have an

582
00:34:26.271 --> 00:34:30.620
impact on the whole industry and it's an amazing,
amazing process.
Now,

583
00:34:30.621 --> 00:34:33.200
as most of you know,
innovation is very risky.

584
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.720
So don't put all your eggs in one basket because you're,
it's very,

585
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:42.140
very probable that most of the innovation ideas will fail.
But you have to be,

586
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:43.061
keep doing it.

587
00:34:43.061 --> 00:34:46.340
Cause definitely you'll have some success that will make some difference in your

588
00:34:46.341 --> 00:34:50.120
business.
And we'll have big impact in terms of employees.

589
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.750
There's typically farmers and hunters,
so farmers,

590
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.480
they want just want to have their domain,
they want to work on it.

591
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.620
We didn't want anything new that you just kind of nurtures of,

592
00:34:59.621 --> 00:35:02.740
of ideas and farmers they want just going back and forth,
back and forth.

593
00:35:02.741 --> 00:35:03.860
They can keep them all in place.

594
00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.580
So the challenge is how do you keep both of them together and create an

595
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:11.780
environment that uses farmers to get ideas maybe and then give them,

596
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:15.680
pass them to farmers and work together synergistically to create a very solid

597
00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:20.390
group that actually can give you the best results possible.
Uh,
when you come,

598
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.550
um,
was sometimes too to come up with,

599
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:26.120
with ideas and you're developing solutions.
It's very,

600
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:30.320
very important that you make people feel they are part of the solution.
Um,

601
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.150
obviously you can direct people to do things,

602
00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:35.420
but if people actually believe in what they're doing and they believe they have

603
00:35:35.421 --> 00:35:39.390
direct input into what's being done,
it will go way,

604
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:43.020
way longer as opposed to just directing somebody to do something because you

605
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:44.790
feel this,
well this is part of my product.

606
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.790
You'll find them off and spending significant amount of times,

607
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.380
way beyond what they expected to do because they have passion and they felt

608
00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:56.790
ownership and what's going on.
And there's a for innovation,

609
00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.940
I'm sorry,
ideation.
It's,

610
00:35:58.941 --> 00:36:03.480
it's a very important element and you guys use design thinking which innovation

611
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.450
ideation is part of it and it makes a big difference.

612
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.740
The composition of the team.

613
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:12.420
So the more diverse the team in terms of diversity of age,
technical,

614
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.180
uh,
cultural ages,

615
00:36:15.181 --> 00:36:18.300
I mean so many aspects needs to be diverse.

616
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.800
The more diverse the better ideas you will get.
And,

617
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:24.490
and also people from different in the different industries than the one you're

618
00:36:24.491 --> 00:36:26.820
right.
Cause that will give you a very,

619
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:30.300
very different views of what we're trying to do and then concentrate on quality

620
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:34.560
and quantity,
not quality.
So try to develop as many ideas as possible,

621
00:36:34.561 --> 00:36:38.280
as fast as possible.
And don't judge any ideas because if you,

622
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.630
if you're in a meeting,
for example,

623
00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:41.880
I'm trying to brainstorm and you keep shooting people down,

624
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.740
then nobody else can contribute anymore.

625
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.280
That the energy in the room will go down significantly and try to emphasize on

626
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:50.010
the using.
Yes.
And I like your idea and we can do that.

627
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.040
I think this is a good thing and we can combine it with the other person.

628
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.630
And so saying yes,
but you know,

629
00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:59.631
cause as Esn is the key to continuing that process of creating a flawless ideas,

630
00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:04.400
how many times did we feel failure is not an option.
And um,

631
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.710
as a matter of fact where it's completely an option and the more we fail

632
00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:10.650
sometimes is that we learn so many aspects and so many benefits,

633
00:37:10.651 --> 00:37:11.484
we cannot have that.

634
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:17.240
The thing is it's not an option when you have a rocket for lunch and with people

635
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:21.240
there is absolutely not an option.
But before you get there,
you have to fail.

636
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:24.330
You know,
that's how you learn.
And there were discussing earlier,

637
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:29.070
there are companies that actually have programs to reward the failures that they

638
00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:33.800
had and how people were able to learn from the failures and move with a that

639
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:38.220
think,
um,
uh,
and at Google every Friday,
thank Google,
it's Friday.

640
00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.080
You guys discuss also have some failures as well,

641
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:44.550
which is fascinating cause sometimes people only executive to only discuss ideas

642
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:48.770
our product and are successful and they barely mentioned the failures.

643
00:37:48.771 --> 00:37:52.800
But that is an outstanding thing to share with people because it can show you if

644
00:37:52.801 --> 00:37:55.770
this is you open this door,
there's block behind this.
So don't do that.

645
00:37:55.771 --> 00:37:57.870
Go there you,
there's always a learning process.

646
00:37:57.871 --> 00:38:00.910
I mean there's nothing wrong with failing unless it's uh,

647
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.380
it's the last thing is to do with the final product and this famous guy,

648
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.410
you know,
it has very interesting quote in that regard as well.

649
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:14.490
So I think this statement is probably one of the biggest killers to innovation

650
00:38:14.491 --> 00:38:17.940
that I've seen.
It's,
you find it every single time.

651
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:21.480
Well I'm not interested.
This is perfect.
Why do I need to improve?
You know,

652
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.270
what's,
what's going on with that and to think about it.

653
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:27.270
I mean we could with had been riding horses now to work instead of cars,

654
00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:27.500
you know,

655
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.630
cause you find something that works doesn't mean that's going to be working

656
00:38:30.631 --> 00:38:33.840
together forever.
You kept,
you need to keep improving,
make it,
modifying it,

657
00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:35.820
make it better.
And we,
we,
we,

658
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.860
we give the example of Netflix and that's a small example.

659
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.490
There is thousand of examples like that you always need to be keep modifying,

660
00:38:42.491 --> 00:38:45.280
increasing cause otherwise somebody else who's going to come and take your place

661
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.820
and [inaudible] always people creative the cannot come with up with brilliant

662
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:49.450
ideas.

663
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:54.400
So I think in my opinion this was something really embedded in the culture and

664
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:54.731
it's very,

665
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:58.030
one of the things that the very difficult to change but eventually you'll be

666
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:00.070
able to do it with it,
with enough effort.

667
00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.200
And there was a benchmarking that I use that a lot.

668
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.820
I tried to go out to companies,

669
00:39:05.821 --> 00:39:09.870
especially outside of the aerospace company and try to see how they do the

670
00:39:09.871 --> 00:39:12.990
governance,
the business models,
how they work,
the employees,

671
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:17.370
how do they work with employees.
It's very,
very important.
And even if you,

672
00:39:17.371 --> 00:39:21.450
if anybody's successful always there,
its value by talking to different people,

673
00:39:21.451 --> 00:39:23.220
learning a different perspectives,

674
00:39:23.221 --> 00:39:26.370
how people look into things and I guarantee you,
you will always,

675
00:39:26.371 --> 00:39:29.340
always learn things.
And even the companies net three successful,

676
00:39:29.341 --> 00:39:31.470
there's always benefits you can gain from them.

677
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.490
And together when you start collecting all this value or this information,

678
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.110
it gives you a better insight when you was trying to plan a strategic business

679
00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:40.980
plan for the future.

680
00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:47.760
So risk is very important.
I mean for us for example,
if you don't take risks,

681
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.340
you're not going to launch anything.
Everything is risky.

682
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:54.900
The key is taking measured risk,
right?
And they,
they ask,
I'm the president,

683
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.210
the CEO of BMW,

684
00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.170
why he decided to take risk and invest in the electric cars.

685
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.580
And he said because doing nothing is biggest risk and we can see it's,
uh,

686
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:09.510
there was a big trend not to go into [inaudible] cars and investing early.

687
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.690
We'll give you definitely a significant advantage compared to investing late.

688
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:17.330
You,
you'll always have an advantage by doing that.
So I had the conference,
um,

689
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.260
and last September.
And um,

690
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:23.250
it's interesting quote that by the president of Toyota that he came and shared

691
00:40:23.251 --> 00:40:28.020
with us and he said,
if executives say this will be a success,

692
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:32.220
it will probably fail if it don't see the value.
There's,
you know,
hope for that.

693
00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.250
And that tells you about the disconnect sometimes between the top level

694
00:40:35.251 --> 00:40:38.340
executives and the working force and the managers and the directors.

695
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.280
So there's definitely room for improvement.
And he was referring for,

696
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:43.170
for the Prius,
is it free,

697
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:46.710
is referring to the Prius where a lot of the executives were completely against

698
00:40:46.711 --> 00:40:49.860
going with a such a product and it's turned out to be one of the best products

699
00:40:49.861 --> 00:40:51.120
that you are,
has ever put together.

700
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:54.200
So that's something definitely to think about.

701
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.260
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

702
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.390
<v 0>Now when it comes to protection of innovation,</v>

703
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:04.510
most of the corporations,
whenever there's downturn profit,
one of first things,

704
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.750
they cut his research and development and innovation.

705
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:12.880
So the key is how can you have shelter that,
because it's true,

706
00:41:12.881 --> 00:41:16.360
it's a you'll going through a downturn,
but you,
if you don't keep investing,

707
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.130
then when the downtown goes up,

708
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.670
somebody else that has been invested is already ahead of you in terms of

709
00:41:21.671 --> 00:41:26.170
technology and developing products.
So even in downtimes down here,
down when,

710
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.720
when products are,
when the market is not good,

711
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.990
you need to keep continue investing in innovation,

712
00:41:31.991 --> 00:41:35.060
research and development because that is definitely the future.
And some,

713
00:41:35.061 --> 00:41:35.894
some organization,

714
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:40.760
the the the go way out of the way to shelter them and protect them because they

715
00:41:40.761 --> 00:41:45.620
see the value in doing that.
So I go a lot to,

716
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.560
to the Google main campus and I have some friends there.

717
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:53.650
And it's fascinating that the environment that you encounter similar to the

718
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.800
environment you have here and basically talking to them,

719
00:41:57.801 --> 00:41:59.930
they mentioned is you cannot force innovation,

720
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.380
but you can create an environment in which innovation can allow to exist,

721
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.680
which is exactly right.
There is no way you can force somebody to be innovative.

722
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:10.010
But if you change the culture,
if chilly environment,
the governance,

723
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:13.190
then all these kinds of things will,
will inspire people to be more creative,

724
00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.280
more innovative,
and in and in return.
We'll make a big difference.

725
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.540
Now in terms of uh,
uh,
where does innovation stops?

726
00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.540
Cause we have a lot of young people with impressive ideas.

727
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.800
And often you'd hear executives saying,
oh,
we need to do innovation.

728
00:42:30.801 --> 00:42:33.320
We need to do all that stuff.
But uh,
where does the stop?

729
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:37.450
So if executives are interested,
if employees are bringing the ideas,

730
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.360
why aren't companies so innovative?
Typically stops in the middle management.

731
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.650
And that's because risk people are not comfortable taking risks because if you

732
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:49.220
take risks,
you're,
you're,
you might create some,

733
00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:53.270
some issues for availability in the,
in the company and stuff like that.

734
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.730
So innovation obviously is a risky business.

735
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.580
There's always going to be a risk is failing and as a matter of fact,

736
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:02.490
very high risk of failing.
But if we don't do it,
like I said,
it's the,

737
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.480
you're not going to be able to keep making progress.

738
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:09.570
So the need to be a way that executives force a middle management and put it in

739
00:43:09.571 --> 00:43:13.340
the performance evaluation that they are supposed to go out and take risk

740
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:17.480
measured risk and be able to push technology forward as much as possible.

741
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:22.970
Now in terms of,
um,
environment,
uh,
in an organization,

742
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.930
if you notice kids,
um,
the kids are fascinating.

743
00:43:26.931 --> 00:43:30.080
They can draw something like this.
For example,

744
00:43:30.081 --> 00:43:34.130
this is my daughter and um,
and she painted me like this.

745
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:38.450
My wife is kind of interesting and she was I think four at this age.
And um,

746
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.300
I was thinking if I took that during said,
man,
this is what is this crap,

747
00:43:41.301 --> 00:43:42.480
you know,
and put it the trash.

748
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:46.460
Imagine how would have it would have affected her psychologically.

749
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:48.770
But you take that and say,
man,
this is awesome.

750
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:52.280
This is great and you should see some of the dramas he does now.
It's impressive,

751
00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:55.520
very fascinating.
But you know,
you can translate that into the culture.

752
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.870
You have to develop an environment where nobody's ridiculed.

753
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.380
Every idea is a good idea.

754
00:44:01.381 --> 00:44:05.480
I know obviously you can have the options to implement it or not to implement
it,

755
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.190
but you cannot allow a,

756
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.730
an environment where people are afraid or embarrassed to share ideas even if

757
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:13.100
they are weird because innovation is sometimes they came up with the weirdest

758
00:44:13.101 --> 00:44:16.490
ideas and that's where the most success is actually and the best products comes

759
00:44:16.491 --> 00:44:17.780
from.
So it's very,

760
00:44:17.781 --> 00:44:21.740
very essential that you create the proper environment where everybody's

761
00:44:21.741 --> 00:44:24.950
comfortable sharing ideas even if they're not among the mainstream

762
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.310
in terms of um,
the environment.
Uh,

763
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.290
you guys are the leaders basically in my opinion in and having an excellent

764
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:37.740
environment that creates creativity.
And I'm setting an example.

765
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.260
Last year we were in the company,

766
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:43.950
I was benchmarking with them and we were in a conference room and the setting

767
00:44:43.951 --> 00:44:48.900
was very,
very formal that I didn't feel the flow very often,

768
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.760
which was very,
very rigid.
And uh,

769
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.590
we took a break and they had,
you know,
a nice setting,

770
00:44:55.670 --> 00:45:00.670
the break area with coffees and drawing boards and then the conversation became

771
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:02.040
100% different.

772
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.770
It's like I'm talking to different people at different company about different

773
00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:07.260
topic.
Just by changing the setting itself.

774
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.690
We're talking completely different than what we had before.

775
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.880
So what I often like to tell people is when you're trying to predict the future,

776
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:23.070
don't base it on technology we have today.
Because if you do that,
you'll be very,

777
00:45:23.071 --> 00:45:24.660
very limited in what you can predict.

778
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:29.250
So what you need to do is look at what patents are being in,
what areas,

779
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.230
what venture capitalists are investing in,

780
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:36.440
what research papers and give you all these data points we'll give you want.

781
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.730
They will not give you the direction where we're getting,

782
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:39.930
but we'll give you a better,

783
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.220
better points in the chart to predict a trend and you'll be able to be much more

784
00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:47.070
successful and establishing where the whole direction is going.

785
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.260
And if you invest early on,

786
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.260
then by the time all this technology became mainstream,
guess what?

787
00:45:52.261 --> 00:45:54.450
You're going to be the top.
You gotta be the leader and,

788
00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.350
and you get to have significantly strategic advantage compared to anybody else

789
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:02.610
in the market at that time.
So,
um,

790
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.890
the,
um,
when I was the technology relationship management and um,

791
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.210
and doing previous roles.

792
00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:12.600
So I noticed a lot of that technology and the gaps that we have,

793
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.890
they're very similar to other companies,
other industries.
For example,

794
00:46:16.891 --> 00:46:18.110
the oil and gas in the sea.
I did,

795
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.770
I did a lot of work and trying to develop mutual synergistic partnerships with

796
00:46:22.771 --> 00:46:25.960
products that we can use for both.
And um,
at the,

797
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:29.010
at the beginning people were having issues from both actually understanding the

798
00:46:29.011 --> 00:46:32.760
value from NASA and from the oil and gas industry.
And um,

799
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.510
we had one time a meeting where we brought five engineers from NASA,

800
00:46:36.511 --> 00:46:39.450
five engineers from,
from one of these oil and gas companies.

801
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.760
And it was almost like dragging them.
Nobody wants to do it.
This,

802
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.900
you're wasting my time.
I don't want to do it.
So we forced them,

803
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.470
they got their untangle.
By the time they got together,
we couldn't separate them.

804
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.440
I mean they have so much in common that it,
the fund,

805
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:57.780
the synergy between what they were doing and,
and,
and,
and if you do that,

806
00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:01.290
then you can develop a product with more partners.

807
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:05.340
You can use less resources,
can have better perspectives,
more ideas,

808
00:47:05.341 --> 00:47:09.000
more innovation,
different from different angles and making it much faster.

809
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.460
So when I do that,
you know,
uh,
not necessarily you can accept it.

810
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.860
Don't have to be competitors,

811
00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.590
can be somebody from different industry and solve common problems that will
make,

812
00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:22.680
make big sense.
So if implement that,
I think the possibilities are endless.

813
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.830
We can achieve things that were never been able to achieve by ourselves.

814
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.680
And especially for us.
For example,
look at the space exploration.

815
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.430
I think eventually that's going to be an international effort with all the

816
00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:36.820
international community having a goal and achieving it together.

817
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:37.750
And if we do that,

818
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.600
there is no limitations and we'll be able to do absolutely everything we can.

819
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.750
So with that,
I conclude the presentation and thanks a lot for your attention.

820
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:49.020
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

821
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:56.160
<v 0>huge thanks to Omar for talking to us today.
So we've a few minutes.</v>

822
00:47:56.161 --> 00:47:58.350
I know some of you probably have to rush off to other meetings,

823
00:47:58.351 --> 00:47:59.580
but for those of you here,

824
00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:03.020
we have our trusty microphone that we can throw out into the audience.

825
00:48:03.021 --> 00:48:06.900
So does anyone have a question that they'd like to share that they'd like to
ask?

826
00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:11.190
Please raise your hand if I can see you amidst the sea of people who are

827
00:48:11.191 --> 00:48:15.570
departing their seats.
Does anyone like to ask a question?
We have one over here.

828
00:48:15.571 --> 00:48:20.250
Okay.
I'm going to throw it to you
speaking to the black bit.
Yes.

829
00:48:20.251 --> 00:48:21.030
There you go.

830
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:23.430
<v 2>Hi.
Thank you for coming and sharing.</v>

831
00:48:23.431 --> 00:48:27.870
These are very interesting thoughts about innovation.
Um,
I was just wondering,

832
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.430
so you talked a lot about different types of industries and different types of

833
00:48:32.431 --> 00:48:34.080
structures.
Uh,

834
00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:38.580
I think some of it is a very r and D and technology based.
Yeah.

835
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:43.020
Uh,
and uh,
here we all lot also a ses teams.

836
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:44.210
Um,

837
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:48.870
so wondering how we can derive learnings from what you shared,

838
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:53.340
uh,
in terms of driving innovation for sales teams,
basically.

839
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.130
<v 0>That's a good question.
So it doesn't have to be only technology,
right?</v>

840
00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.870
I mean even the governance model,
how do you iterate?

841
00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:02.950
How do you interact the structure of the organization,
uh,
the environment,

842
00:49:02.951 --> 00:49:04.870
like I said,
in terms of creating things,

843
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.630
how do you compensate people with good ideas?

844
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:12.100
How do you empower people that don't take part of the process to become,

845
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:13.180
become part of the process?

846
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.670
So these are elements you can apply to any other industry.

847
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:19.060
It doesn't have to be certain aerospace or technical or research and
development.

848
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.110
The key elements can be applied across the line and in every single thing.

849
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:26.740
And the duals find substantial value from,
from,
from,
uh,
trying to do that.

850
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:27.940
I said benchmarking is,

851
00:49:27.941 --> 00:49:32.020
is so significant that tried to do with at least once every two months tried to

852
00:49:32.021 --> 00:49:35.050
visit new company,
learn from them.
And the more diverse a company,

853
00:49:35.051 --> 00:49:37.210
the better it is for me because I learned new things that they didn't know

854
00:49:37.211 --> 00:49:40.380
before.
And eventually you build this knowledge that you will be able to,

855
00:49:40.381 --> 00:49:43.420
to apply to your organization that's going to have be much more successful.

856
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:44.980
<v 2>Thanks.</v>

857
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.400
<v 0>I'm okay.
There's another question up there and one here as well.</v>

858
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:51.100
Just do your best to throw those as far yesterday.
Date.
Okay.

859
00:49:51.101 --> 00:49:52.180
You got it because you're closer.

860
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:57.380
<v 2>Okay.
Hi Omar.
Thanks for your very inspiring talk and kid you started off saying,</v>

861
00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:58.320
so in the,

862
00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.320
in the face of automation and in the face of an industry changing environment

863
00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.370
like um,
I was asking myself,

864
00:50:05.371 --> 00:50:08.290
so what we'll be doing right when they're self driving cars and yeah,

865
00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:10.770
plenty of time and perhaps not in a job.

866
00:50:10.771 --> 00:50:14.280
And as you moved on talking about creativity,

867
00:50:14.281 --> 00:50:19.281
design thinking m would you agree or what would you say is the role of a human

868
00:50:19.951 --> 00:50:23.220
being and um,
will we be,
you know,

869
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:28.160
educating people to be creative thinkers perhaps because ultimately that's what

870
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.280
<v 3>makes us human and that what differentiates us from artificial intelligence,</v>

871
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:31.660
I believe.
Yeah.

872
00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.530
<v 0>Oh absolutely.
And that is the question I should,</v>

873
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.480
that is the main question that we need to answer.

874
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:37.900
What is the role of people and um,

875
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:41.480
unfortunately people come touch you when you talk about this topic.

876
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.130
It's nothing 30.
You just the fact,

877
00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:46.340
you know what that's going to have impact like this or like that.

878
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:50.270
If something is going to have an impact,
there's,
we know that for 100% and uh,

879
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.350
what is that all of humans?

880
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:54.620
That is something we need to have think tanks between governments,

881
00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:55.251
between the industry,

882
00:50:55.251 --> 00:50:58.400
between academia and think about what it's going to be roles for humans.

883
00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.720
There's going to be,
regardless of what the automation,

884
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.560
what artificial intelligence environment we're going to be able to have,

885
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:08.660
we still have a structure where humans can have big impact on certain qualities

886
00:51:08.661 --> 00:51:10.070
and attributes that human have.

887
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.980
You will never be able to two to three produce with the,

888
00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:14.870
with the system at the official intelligence system.

889
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.260
But we need to find what those are.
How do they fit into an economy?

890
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:20.120
What did they economy going to look like?

891
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.330
Sometimes they even think about starting to publish a paper on the future

892
00:51:23.331 --> 00:51:26.360
economies after all these things happen because these are unknowns.

893
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:28.640
I mean that is the main question and we'll never,

894
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:32.570
never going to be able to solve it unless we put big teams of people from

895
00:51:32.571 --> 00:51:35.100
different diverse industries working together and,

896
00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:39.230
and we'll be able to stop and get some answers to these.
Thanks.

897
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.350
It was a question up there behind you.
There's two of them even.

898
00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:47.330
<v 3>Oh,
of course.
Thank you for coming and sharing your interesting ideas.
Ah,</v>

899
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.740
you're starting,
um,

900
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:53.770
the presentation with the slides about the future of workforce that a humans

901
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:57.860
will need to compete with Roberts and,
uh,

902
00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.970
artificial intelligence in a perspective of some professions.
Right?

903
00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:06.540
So what would you recommend for,
for example,
now what,

904
00:52:06.541 --> 00:52:07.374
what machine,

905
00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:12.250
what we should invest to learn now to be competitive in,

906
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.640
in 10 years?
Yeah.

907
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:15.820
<v 0>It's funny cause we,</v>

908
00:52:15.821 --> 00:52:19.720
that's exactly what we were talking with a group of people actually a few months

909
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.910
ago.
So what are things that will be difficult,

910
00:52:21.911 --> 00:52:25.570
very difficult for humans to be replaced?
People the create the two.

911
00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.300
That's usually the creative portions of it,
the creative arts,

912
00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:32.510
the creative environment.
But,
um,
so,
so there's how,

913
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:36.850
how do you see the thing is these,
even though we can make an impact,

914
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.230
we can increase the amount of jobs the human can,
can,
can take.
It's still,

915
00:52:41.231 --> 00:52:45.940
it's not enough to,
to for the whole market,
uh,
infrastructure.
Uh,

916
00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:47.980
and Doug said this is very different.
For example,

917
00:52:47.981 --> 00:52:50.500
in the beginning of the century,
people thought then that's a revolution.

918
00:52:50.501 --> 00:52:53.920
We'll keep everybody away from jobs.
And we found obviously it wasn't true.

919
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:56.620
People just be adapted and they used their skill somewhere else.

920
00:52:57.010 --> 00:53:00.490
Now the thing here is if we're talking about creating new species that are

921
00:53:00.491 --> 00:53:05.140
substantially smarter than humans and they can do so many things,
I said,

922
00:53:05.141 --> 00:53:07.480
if you'll be very,
very difficult than a hundred years,

923
00:53:07.481 --> 00:53:10.120
if you can distinguish between a human with a robot and a person,

924
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:14.470
the more we advance,
it's become very difficult.
So how do you compete with that?

925
00:53:14.471 --> 00:53:15.310
I mean,
it's still with,

926
00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.600
we haven't solved these questions are very valid question.
And,

927
00:53:18.601 --> 00:53:22.200
and obviously if we know the answer,
we'll start putting all the resources to,
to,

928
00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:24.490
to creating the solid infrastructure is from today.

929
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:28.340
So we can actually have a balance and you'll be able to minimize that,

930
00:53:28.341 --> 00:53:32.490
that these impacts.
That's,
yeah.
Very good question.
Thanks.
Won't behind you.

931
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:36.000
I can still write better poems than machines.
So I think I got,
I know exactly,

932
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.013
exactly.

933
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:42.160
<v 4>Hi there.
I have a question about this space exploring and the,</v>

934
00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.320
the technology that we use in that.

935
00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:49.660
So we have these shadows that are already in the,
uh,
I don't know all the,

936
00:53:49.661 --> 00:53:50.494
uh,

937
00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:55.800
the end of the solar system and of course the operating system and the machines

938
00:53:57.491 --> 00:53:59.560
used of them.
They are of course our data.

939
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:05.010
How do we plan on the future missions to have them constantly being updated?

940
00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.690
Do we plan on,
uh,

941
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:12.580
artificial technology that will update itself or do we plan to,
to,
to,
to,
to,

942
00:54:12.581 --> 00:54:16.240
to send a different models to update it on the way?
Yeah.

943
00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.630
<v 0>Oh yeah.
So that depends on the mission you're trying to design.</v>

944
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:24.680
If you're designing something with the intention of going to apply and take some

945
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:28.640
pictures and come back,
probably the time period is,
it doesn't give you,

946
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.520
it's not really necessary,
but for longer missions,

947
00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:32.940
that's definitely going to be important.

948
00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:36.620
I don't know if you guys heard of the breakthrough initiative that's being put

949
00:54:36.621 --> 00:54:37.730
together.
Okay.

950
00:54:37.731 --> 00:54:42.731
So this is an initiative that's going to enable us to send a vehicle called a

951
00:54:43.281 --> 00:54:45.640
vehicle.
It's a,
it's a,
it's a hard word,

952
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:50.650
one gram hardware powered by laser and it's going to go at a 20% of the speed of

953
00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.690
light and it's going to go to office and jewelry,

954
00:54:53.691 --> 00:54:55.820
which basically it's the closest store that we have here.

955
00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.680
And we found that there is habitable planets in office and jury.

956
00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:00.080
So habitable planets,

957
00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:05.620
it's essentially a term we call about four planets that are surrounding stars.

958
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:10.340
So for life to exist,
uh,
attempt to have certain distance from there,

959
00:55:10.341 --> 00:55:14.900
from the star,
if it's too close,
then the water will evaporate.
If it's too far,

960
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.940
it will freeze.
And um,

961
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:20.810
and also it has to be certain size if it's too small to have difficulties.

962
00:55:20.811 --> 00:55:23.780
Keeping an environment.
If it's too big,
it will trap poisonous environment.

963
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:27.260
So it's very unique thing that we need to have to have life.

964
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:30.410
Obviously there's billions of galaxies,
so possibilities are endless,

965
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.580
but for machines that are going to send that will take long,
long time,

966
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:39.980
then definitely it will be important to start implementing some of the elements

967
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:43.680
you're mentioning.
It will be difficult.
Um,
uh,
sending,
uh,

968
00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:47.150
distractions from Earth cause it will takes such a long time to reach them and

969
00:55:47.151 --> 00:55:49.250
by the time you reach them as priority already obsolete.

970
00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:54.230
So how do you develop something where the system itself can,
can,
can update.

971
00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:57.680
So I think that that's a very important turning point.

972
00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:02.690
When can artificial intelligence make changes to itself and adapt and change the

973
00:56:02.691 --> 00:56:04.040
algorithm based and what's learning?

974
00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.470
Now we're talking about complete paradigm shift here,

975
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:08.930
but it will be very important for long term missions.

976
00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:14.450
I think we're unfortunately out of time folks.
I know we have to close it out.

977
00:56:14.451 --> 00:56:16.450
So what I will say is perhaps,
uh,

978
00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.570
thank you very much doctor Omar

979
00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.370
<v 1>[inaudible] appreciate it.</v>
