1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,710
Welcome. Thank you for being here for
happiness. So let's start, um, what,

2
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:14,630
start with your sports.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,140
You both are in fairly uncommon sports.

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,100
How did you initially get involved in
losing and flipping multiple times a year

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,240
on skis? Uh, at an early
age to become an Olympian?

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,451
Okay.
Uh,

7
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:33,451
so I grew up close to lake
placid in upstate New York
and my parents volunteered

8
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:37,610
at the Olympics in 1980 at the lose track.

9
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:41,510
So I had been skiing already and
I went with my parents to, uh,

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,360
to see lose every day.
Uh,

11
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:47,020
so I saw the best athletes in the
world competing and lake placid is,

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,860
it's a really small town, so I kind
of got the Olympic bug and saw other,

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,680
I saw a figure skating and hockey
and I saw Eric Heiden when is metals?

14
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:59,681
So I was like all excited
about the Olympics and after
the games there was a two

15
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:04,830
week, a luge camp. So my parents let me
skip school and go to luge camp. Uh, God,

16
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,600
honest led,
loved it from the very first time.

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,160
And at the end of the two weeks I won.

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,220
I won the junior Olympics race in
my age group. And that was kind of,

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,280
that was the beginning of
the next 18 years on a sled.

20
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,760
And how old were you when you first
went to lose you? Really? You're gonna

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,610
lose camp.
Yeah.

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,070
11, 11, 11 which is pretty
typical. So in a, in Luge,

23
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:33,870
there are tracks like a dozen or so
tracks around the world and you, you know,

24
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:36,570
you don't get very many runs
on each track every year.

25
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:41,190
So it really takes years to a, to be good
and to be successful internationally.

26
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:45,830
So 10 or 11 is pretty typical
for a jumping on a sled. Yeah.

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,450
And what about you?
Yeah,

28
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,030
well I,
it's kind of a family affair in our house.

29
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:53,690
So my brother was actually an aerialist
on the US ski team for many years,

30
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:58,100
way before I got into it. I was 21
when I actually got into the sport,

31
00:01:58,101 --> 00:02:01,580
so a little bit later.
But um, yeah, so he,

32
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,880
my brother was in it and I was
actually at school going, uh,

33
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,370
going to school down at Florida
State University. And Yeah,

34
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,170
a lot of good skin down that
way. Um, but uh, you know,

35
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:15,890
there wasn't a lot athletically for
me to get involved in down there.

36
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:19,940
I was actually riding horses and doing
gymnastics growing up a time and both my

37
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,340
brother and I skied since we could walk,
come from a very,

38
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:25,130
very avid skiing family. But, um, anyway,

39
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:30,131
so I decided I was either going to take
a semester off and go to winter park,

40
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:32,480
Colorado and ski.
Um,

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,310
w where my brother was skiing with a
freestyle club there or I was transferring

42
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:39,740
to the University of New Hampshire where
there was an equestrian riding team.

43
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,160
So I first went to winter park,
went out there,

44
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,500
always thought I'd be a bump scare,
a mogul skier.

45
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,170
My brother did Ariel's
I thought he was nuts.

46
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,340
There is no way I would've ever done that.
So anyway,

47
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:54,470
when out and with air,
with freestyle,

48
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:57,050
you usually do all the
events at a regional level.

49
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:01,000
So I did and I actually
did the best in. So, um,

50
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,310
obviously it didn't transfer to Unh.

51
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:07,300
I ended up coming out to Salt Lake City
and training with a coach out there and

52
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,070
basically I was the only woman,
um,

53
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,950
training with five other
men out there. And, um,

54
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,880
it took a little convincing for the coach
Steve and let me come and train. So, um,

55
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,780
yeah, so it's been kind of, you
know, then I, then I was on, um,

56
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,590
basically about 12 years on the US team.
So.

57
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,900
So what was that training like
from when you first started to,

58
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,730
right before your first Olympics?

59
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,590
Was the schedule like and the effort that
goes into two becoming one of the best

60
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:39,010
in your sports in the world?
Yeah, absolutely. Um, do you want,

61
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,420
sure. I can start. So I, uh,

62
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:46,800
I was on the national team for 14 years
and I think Tracy will probably agree,

63
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:51,030
a competing on the level that we did
is basically a full time job. Uh,

64
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,290
so the,
uh,

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,320
the off season is when most of the like
really intense physical training takes

66
00:03:57,511 --> 00:04:00,210
place. So, uh, for Luge, it's a, it's,

67
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:02,580
they're kind of two components
a and it's the start,

68
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,970
which is the only chance that
you have to accelerate the sled.

69
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,660
And then once you pull off from the
handles and you wear spikes on your

70
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:12,330
fingertips, paddle down the ramp, uh,

71
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:16,680
and then you lie down and then it's all
about skill and how well you can drive,

72
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:21,060
uh, drive the lines. So, uh, in the
summertime we would do a lot of sort of,

73
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,290
you know,

74
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,890
basic training at first and then it's
all about sort of power and quickness and

75
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,660
speed, uh, on the start.

76
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,660
So a lot of upper body back core work and
a lot of like Olympic Olympic lifting,

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,900
uh, in the, in the
summertime. And then in the,

78
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,230
in the winter we would be,
uh,

79
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,530
on the road from usually at the
beginning of October until December.

80
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:46,280
So usually 10 weeks in the
fall you'd come home, uh,

81
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,130
for like a week at Christmas and it was
kind of enough time to wash your clothes,

82
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:51,990
eat a couple of meals that your mom made.

83
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,550
And then I'm back on the road for
another eight weeks for the World Cup and

84
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:01,500
world championship season. So, uh,
definitely a kind of year round and,

85
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:06,260
and I, I was able to work actually a
undergrad into that schedule because a,

86
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:08,940
I went to Dartmouth and it had,
it's on quarters.

87
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,060
So I would go with the luge team in
the fall and winter and then I'd go to

88
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,270
school in the spring and summer. I was
there for a little longer than four years.

89
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,690
Yeah. So for Ariel's, um,

90
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,430
basically it starts on a trampoline
and there are hours and hours of,

91
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:23,761
you know,

92
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:27,480
refining your skills for doing back
flips and twists and multiple twists and

93
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:31,170
multiple flips and all of that.
And you're in a big a harness as well,

94
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,980
which has a spinning belt,
so that's attached to a rope.

95
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:38,370
So there's a lot of trampoline
training is a really, really big,

96
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,990
big facet of it.

97
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,010
Then you actually transfer it to water
ramping where you coming down. Um,

98
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:49,011
there's a lake placid and park city have
to water ramp facilities and you come

99
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:52,050
down the ramps.
I'm on plastic surface,

100
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:56,700
go off and land into a big swimming pool
with all your, your skis, your boots.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,930
Um, you know, you have a life jacket on,

102
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,560
usually have a dry suit or a wetsuit
and I'm helmet of course. And uh,

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,210
I've always had the question, do your
ski boots get wet? And I'm like, Oh yeah,

104
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:12,110
they get wet and we break skis
and all sorts of things, but,

105
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,700
and water does hurt. Um, it's a great way
to train. That's where you, like I said,

106
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,750
you, there's a very long
process in taking what, um,

107
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,380
what you see on snow.
Um,

108
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,630
there's a qualification process
for every single jump that you,

109
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,990
that you do on snow. So you'd have
to do it a certain number of times.

110
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:34,460
You have to qualify it in front of a u
s team coach safely five times in a row,

111
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,563
um,

112
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,220
and then then you're able to transfer
it onto snow once the season starts.

113
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,980
And then, you know, I think
like what Cameron said,

114
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:46,670
I think one of the misconceptions
about, um, you know,

115
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,300
Olympic athletes is that the only thing
they train for and compete and are the

116
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:54,800
Olympics and we have a World Cup circuit
that we are on every single year.

117
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,270
And so it goes to our
sports, uh, the Olympics.

118
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:02,930
But right now we have world
championships every other year.

119
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:07,250
So we were on tour from December
all the way to April every year.

120
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:11,720
And then our summer training also, we
would do trampoline starting in May, um,

121
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,620
you know, through October. So we had
a little bit of time off in April,

122
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:18,950
a little bit of time off in October.
But other than that it was,

123
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,010
it was year round training for sure.
Yeah.

124
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,290
And so you've obviously did a lot of the
trampoline training, all these things.

125
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,700
How have you seen the training evolve
from when you started doing it your first

126
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:31,940
couple of years to where we are today
with the technology and the advancements

127
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:36,530
that have happened? Yeah. Well, I I
know for Ariel's, you know, it, I think,

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,280
um, the water ramp facility
itself has become better.

129
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,280
The jumps are the jumps that we
used to use for water ramping.

130
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:50,060
We're not as similar as the jumps that we
now, you know, create on snow. But now,

131
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,040
now they are very,
very similar.

132
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:57,041
So that transition from water to
snow is not nearly as different.

133
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,580
And really the only thing that you have
to modify for on snow is the Landing

134
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,050
Hill.
Cause we obviously land on a very,

135
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:06,710
very steep landing hill and water
your landing pretty much. Um,

136
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,600
you really don't try to
land straight up and down.

137
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:12,590
But we tried to land with our tips
going into the water. But um, you know,

138
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:16,820
aside from that there's still tons
of trampoline training and um,

139
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,620
I don't think that there's,

140
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,120
I think where at least for Ariel's
it's changed as more time on snow.

141
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,640
The more time that we can
actually train on snow.

142
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:29,060
So more training camps have come
about where we've been able to,

143
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,750
where the team's been able
to be on snow more often. So,

144
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,420
so with the, with Luge, the a,

145
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,880
it's hard to see when you watch it on
TV or even when you're standing at the

146
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:44,080
track. A sled goes why it, you know,
90 miles an hour. But they, uh,

147
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,130
the sled is, there's a lot of
technology that goes into the sled.

148
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:51,520
So a single sled and women,
a women just do singles.

149
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:56,400
Men can do singles or doubles,
but the single sled weighs 50 pounds.

150
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,810
So it is a,

151
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:02,450
there's a part that you lie in your
body is sort of in a fiberglass shell,

152
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
a their handles that you hold onto.

153
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,730
And then runners that go the whole length
of the sled attached to that on the

154
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:12,850
bottom are steals. And, uh, they are, um,

155
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,540
there's sort of a lot of technological
espionage and the in the sport.

156
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:22,290
So people are always trying to see what
other countries are doing. Uh, and, uh,

157
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,440
when I was on the team, and it's,
it's definitely still true today. Uh,

158
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:30,270
our coach would make the sleds, so
everything, uh, so it's, uh, you know,

159
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,990
from the fiberglass to the runners,
the steels are a,

160
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:38,991
that's probably the most technologically
a complicated part of the sled and the

161
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:42,480
most important. And it's really, um,

162
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,400
it's like very nuanced sort of what a
metals comprise the runners and what goes

163
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:50,370
fast. And it's, and sometimes
it's just really hard to know.

164
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:55,371
You might have a steels that are made
like two made exactly the same material at

165
00:09:56,521 --> 00:10:00,870
the same time, and one will be faster
than the other. So a, so it's like, yes,

166
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:05,580
there's a lot of technology, but there's
also some art to it, uh, as well.

167
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,470
Um, so I, I had a,

168
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,480
one of our assistant coaches from
Italy one summer, he said, okay,

169
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,850
so, uh, you know, we think
these steels are really fast,

170
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:19,500
but what I want you to do this summer
is to, and I'm not joking here, um,

171
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,380
bury them in your backyard so the,

172
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:26,850
the sun and the moon can get on the
steels. And I think we'll go even faster.

173
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:30,750
I was like, okay, I'll do that. I'll
try and eat. And they were fast.

174
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,540
I have no idea if it was
like burying in the backyard,

175
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,320
I it required a lot of
sanding to get the rust off.

176
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,620
But um, so yeah, so there is a,

177
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:42,990
there's definitely a lot
of technology in the, uh,

178
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,540
in the sleds I didn't mention before.

179
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:49,940
A one part of the training in the
summertime is practicing the start, uh,

180
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,120
on ice. So in lake placid there's
an indoor start ramp facility,

181
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,650
so you can, um, you can
practice the, the start on ice,

182
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,970
you go down the ramp and then up
up the other side because it's a,

183
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,080
it makes a really big difference sort of
being on ice versus being on, you know,

184
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:10,560
wheels, which is possible, but
you don't really get the same, uh,

185
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:15,540
the same sort of feel when one of the
star ramps in. Um, it's actually the one,

186
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,890
uh, at the track and laplant in France
where the Olympics were in 92. Uh,

187
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,000
so the ramp is so steep that when
you're so it would lose, you know,

188
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:27,480
you're sitting on the sled at the start,
hands around the handles.

189
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,720
Normally you can see the, you know, you
can see the ramp, see the first curve,

190
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,430
this ramp, it's so steep you can't see
it. So you're sitting at the start,

191
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:39,090
you can't see the ramp and you
just see the first curve. Okay.

192
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:42,660
I hope I'm going to go straight down.
There was a Dupre a little,

193
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,410
so that leads into my question,
which is most of the audience,

194
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,390
I don't want to assume anyone,
maybe some people have,

195
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,000
but most of the Saudis has probably
never gone down a loser ramp,

196
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,890
80 plus miles an hour or
flipped multiple times on sees

197
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,490
what's,

198
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,330
can you describe that experience of being
in the air or what'd you get down that

199
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:02,830
ramp and the first curve? Go
ahead. Um, oh goodness. You know,

200
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,540
um,
cash.

201
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:09,250
It is so difficult to describe what
it's like to be 60 feet in the air.

202
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,720
I was actually the first woman in the
world to do a triple twisting double

203
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,260
backflip and a double twisting, triple
back flip. Can you demonstrate? Yeah.

204
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,010
But, um, so, you know, um, oh my goodness.

205
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,940
It is, I think, uh, you know,
I'm scared of heights. So if
you put me on top of real,

206
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,730
I know everyone says, oh my gosh, you're
an aerialist, how can you be afraid of,

207
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,770
but just looking out, you know, in down
is just a the nerve wracking to me.

208
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,310
It makes my legs all week.
But, um, going, you know,

209
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,200
you're doing something in the air,
you're coming down,

210
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,180
you're not focused on
really how high you are,

211
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:49,720
cause that's what you need to get your
feet under you. But, um, you know,

212
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,460
it's just an amazing,

213
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,260
amazing feeling of, um, you know,

214
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,570
like I said,
it's hard to put in words.

215
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,930
You're at the top of the Enron and you
definitely have to figure out how to

216
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:05,290
channel the fear in a really
positive, productive way. Otherwise,

217
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,530
you'll never be an aerialist.
But you know,

218
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,740
the adrenaline rush that
you get, um, you know,

219
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:16,090
coming down and doing a triple flip and
landing and skiing away when you're down

220
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:16,690
at the bottom,

221
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,690
it is such a intense amount of
emotion in all of six seconds.

222
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,740
Um, and it is, it's just amazing. I always
say this and I love my husband to death.

223
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:30,250
I really haven't found quite something
that's given me quite the adrenaline rush,

224
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:35,110
the areas that might be too much
information, but nonetheless,

225
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,630
um,
that's the way it goes

226
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,380
onto you.
Okay.

227
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,280
Uh, so, uh, so, uh, Lucia solutions, the,

228
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:49,000
it's the fastest of all of the sliding
sports. So it's faster than bobsled.

229
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:52,840
It's faster than skeleton,
and it's actually the only
Olympic sport time to that.

230
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:57,700
That was in the of a of a second. So
I'm the fastest track in the world is a,

231
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:59,000
is Vancouver,
uh,

232
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,700
from the men start is
about 97 miles an hour. Um,

233
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:06,670
so I've not gone that fast.
I've been from the, uh,

234
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:10,270
the men start in park city and
go on about 87 miles an hour.

235
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:15,190
So fast enough. Uh, so if you've
driven that fast in your car,

236
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,911
uh,

237
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:20,911
imagine sort of that speed lying on your
back on a fairly small sled going down

238
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:25,360
in an ice track. Um,
some of the tracks are a,

239
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:30,280
and every track is different, so some
tracks are sort of wide open curves.

240
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:34,750
Um, of course like you have to steer on
all of them, but some, some requires less,

241
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,040
some required less steering.

242
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,820
So the one in park city is a little
more like an autobahn. It's very fast,

243
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:43,660
not a ton of steering of really
fun kind of smooth ride down.

244
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,370
There are other tracks, however, that
are really technically difficult.

245
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:52,490
And if you don't steer in exactly the
right place at exactly the right time,

246
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,170
you'll crash. So, uh, I'd like those
tracks and I was, I was good at those.

247
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,800
Great. So let's go to the first
Olympics. As you both are multiply, uh,

248
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,130
time Olympians at first Olympics.

249
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,910
What was the emotion when
you first qualified and then
what was the emotional at

250
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:09,470
the opening ceremonies when you're there?

251
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:11,900
Were you really excited to
be there and ready to go?

252
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,330
Or were you really nervous about the
competition and kind of what was going

253
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:17,780
through your head?
So my first Games wiz and 88,

254
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:21,710
and Calgary and a and that
year to qualify for the team,

255
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:26,360
there were a series of races, uh,
in lake placid. So I qualified,

256
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,140
uh, and, and I, it's like, you know,
when you qualify, it's like, okay,

257
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,690
I've made the Olympic team
super excited about that.

258
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,010
But it wasn't really until I walked into
the opening ceremonies that I thought,

259
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,290
oh my gosh,
like I've made the Olympic team,

260
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,580
I'm here representing the United
States and, you know, all of that.

261
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,030
I was 19 at my first game,

262
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:48,140
so I had spent sort of eight
years preparing for that, uh,

263
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:51,740
that moment. And, uh, with that games,

264
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:55,820
I didn't really have any particular
expectation about my finish and like,

265
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,510
I didn't really expect that I
had a chance to win a medal.

266
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:03,860
So I was really just going to, you know,
to do my best and, uh, and hopefully have,

267
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:08,430
you know, as good at race as I possibly,
uh, as a possibly good. Uh, so I,

268
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:11,960
that games, I was, uh, I
was ninth, I had great runs.

269
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:15,400
I was like the happy with the
happy with the results and, uh,

270
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,800
had a few more games after
that. But, um, yeah, so it's a,

271
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:23,300
it's at that moment I think when you
walk into the opening ceremonies is a,

272
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:24,320
is a pretty special one.

273
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,400
Yeah. Yeah. So Mine, mine
was 1994 and I was 26.

274
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,910
Um, but, and actually Cameron was the
flag bearer at the 1994 Olympic Games.

275
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:40,470
So that's, that's a huge
honor. And that they're voted,

276
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:44,190
the flag bearers voted by
there are our teammates.

277
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:48,690
So she was voted by all of us to be
the flag bearer, which was amazing. Um,

278
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,440
for me also,
my brother was actually after he retired,

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,930
went on to coach the Australian freestyle
ski team and Ariel's, so 1994 is a,

280
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,480
again, a family affair. We, um,

281
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,290
he was coaching aerials while
I was competing, so it was,

282
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,960
and my parents were over
there. So that was, um,

283
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:10,230
something that was just obviously amazing.
And like Cameron said,

284
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,730
the process of, of at least
for freestyle, um, you know,

285
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:18,510
of qualifying for the Games is a
pretty long one. And so we know, one,

286
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,010
we didn't find out our team until like
two weeks before the game. So yes, that's,

287
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,660
that's a step.
Um,

288
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,220
but my mentality going into
all the Olympics as well
was to make sure that I had

289
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:33,250
a degree of difficulty that if I,
if I want or could win,

290
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,070
I just put myself in a place to win.

291
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,170
And that was just always like the
Olympics is not a place to hold back. So,

292
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,050
um, that was, yeah, that was just, I mean,

293
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,310
Lillehammer just for sure was just
an amazing, amazing first games.

294
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,980
Um,
but I will say my last

295
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,640
games real quick is that it's rare that
an Olympian gets to compete in their own

296
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:57,360
home country when, um, during your career,

297
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,010
let alone your own backyard. So
I, I live in Park City, Utah.

298
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,160
So the fact that Salt Lake City held
the 2002 Olympic Games was amazing.

299
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:10,020
And that was how I got to end
my career. So it's been, it was,

300
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,790
it was pretty cool.

301
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,300
So that's thought about going
for a fifth of 1998 was my,

302
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:18,750
a was my last Olympics in Nagano,
Japan. And for that reason,

303
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,670
because 2002 wasn't in the United
States, I thought, oh, maybe one more,

304
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,080
but, uh, uh,

305
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:30,110
decided to go to law school
instead of nearly as much fun as,

306
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,720
although I was a, I was in park city
because, um, uh, as Tracy mentioned,

307
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:40,650
I, uh, I carried the flag at
the opening ceremonies in 94,

308
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:45,630
which was a huge honor and really
humbling and to be there, you know,

309
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:50,250
sort of for the u s team and really
for everybody back, uh, back home, uh,

310
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:53,520
as well. So, uh, although
when I was at each,

311
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:58,440
each sport nominates someone to carry the
flag and then the team captains of all

312
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:02,330
of the sports vote on who
will be elected and, uh,

313
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,720
Dan Jansen and Bonnie Blair were
nominated and I was like, okay,

314
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:08,820
so this is kind of going
to be like the Oscars.

315
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,840
I'm really honored to have been
nominated and this great pool of people.

316
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:15,990
And then, uh, and then I got
picked. Yeah, it's a, so I was,

317
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:19,740
I was super surprised and really,
really honored. But in a, in part,

318
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,940
in a Salt Lake City,

319
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,340
the organizing committee invited all of
the flag bearers to come and run with

320
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:30,840
the torch from the opening ceremony
stadium to the first metal ceremony.

321
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,640
So a, and everyone who had carried the
flag from basically who was living and who

322
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,840
could come and manage to, uh, carry the
torch and they said that they're like,

323
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,980
well, you're young and in
pretty good shape and all of
that. And I was like, okay,

324
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm working in a law firm on Wall Street,

325
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,380
like 20 hours a day. And I can't remember
the last time I worked out. So, um,

326
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:53,760
so when we were running,

327
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:58,410
you had to run behind like the van
with the camera on you the entire time.

328
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:03,000
So I thought, and I was like, oh my gosh,
my arm's really tired. If I drop it, like,

329
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,190
should I switch hands?
Like that's not really going to look good,

330
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:09,580
but if I drop it, that's even worse.
But it was all, it was a huff and puff.

331
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,880
I know. It's like, oh my gosh. Yeah.

332
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,440
So is that more nerve wracking or carrying
the flag and the opening ceremony?

333
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,710
Well, before I walked into the, uh,

334
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,160
to the stadium at the opening
ceremonies in Lovell Hommer,

335
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,880
the director of marketing
for USA Luge said, Oh, uh,

336
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,320
so you know, like 2 billion
people are watching the Olympics,

337
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:32,150
so don't trip and fall with
the flag. I was like, really?
Like you had to say that,

338
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:35,250
tell me that right now. I did it.
It was a, it was all good. But,

339
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,210
so Tracy brought up good point that you
got to compete in your home country and

340
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:40,250
really hometown.
Yeah.

341
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,650
Did you ever feel when you went on the
road that you didn't get enough practice

342
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,500
time or the courses were different or
I guess what was the experience being

343
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,810
at a road course or was it common
practice since you traveled?

344
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:59,010
Yeah. Yeah. No, you know, I think
one of the things that I, you know,

345
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,910
even in, in Cameron Sport, it's, you have,

346
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:05,030
that's one of the things as an athlete
you have to be able to do is be able to

347
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:08,330
change from site to site from week
to week and you have to be flexible.

348
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,140
You have to know how to adjust
and deal with obstacles and,

349
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:15,950
and all that kind of thing. So,
um, and you know, not really,

350
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:17,900
I mean that was something throughout all,

351
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,670
all our years of training that we were
used to on a weekly basis. Like I said,

352
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:25,280
World Cup was a different
site every single week.

353
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:29,990
So every Sunday we would travel somewhere
else and then train a couple of days

354
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:33,380
and compete and do it again somewhere
else. So you just learn to adapt.

355
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,390
What about the tracks lose track?

356
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,400
Well yet,
so lose tracks are very different.

357
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,720
But I'll just mention that when I made
the national team when I was 15 and my

358
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:46,280
first couple of years on the team,

359
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:51,281
there was still east Germany and Soviet
Union and Yugoslavia and like we went to

360
00:21:51,741 --> 00:21:53,840
all of those places. So it was, I mean,

361
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:57,950
it was a really great adventure
among other things being on the,

362
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,330
being on the team at that time. Food
was always a challenge. I'm like,

363
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:06,110
I cannot identify that thing,
whatever is on my plate right now.

364
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:09,120
So you'd always bring like peanut butter
and jelly with you just like just in

365
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:13,460
place. Um, so yeah, lose tracks
are uh, definitely like very,

366
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,840
very different from track to track.
And a,

367
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,350
the u s we were at a little bit of a
disadvantage because Germany has four

368
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:22,184
tracks,

369
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,210
a German sort of run the international
federation and there tend to be a three

370
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:31,310
or four World Cup's on
German tracks every year. Uh,

371
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:35,780
so usually the way it works with
countries is that if you have a track,

372
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,920
uh, us has a track a that everyone
else wants to train on your Germany,

373
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,880
they have attract, people want to train
on, you might swap a training times.

374
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,610
No one wanted to train on
the track and lake placid.

375
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:51,180
So it was kind of worth nothing, uh,
in, uh, in sort of track time leverage.

376
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:55,520
So, so we ended up getting, you
know, like not great training times.

377
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:59,530
And uh, with the, with the
lose track, it's about, uh,

378
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,530
so loose bobsled and skeleton all go
on the same track from the top of the

379
00:23:03,531 --> 00:23:08,060
course. The, some tracks are
nearly a mile long, so they're,

380
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,230
most of them are concrete, their pipes
running throughout the entire track.

381
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,660
And there's a big,
um,

382
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,290
refrigeration plant that pumps some
ammonia compound throughout the pipes and

383
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:23,090
you spray water on the track and it
makes it makes ice. Um, so, uh, however,

384
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,481
uh,

385
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:27,380
one thing that the Germans like to do
when we were training on their tracks was

386
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:31,010
like, give us track time at like nine
o'clock at night. Uh, and yeah, great.

387
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,220
And then six o'clock the next
morning, uh, and then, uh,

388
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:37,160
they would crank up the
refrigeration. So, uh,

389
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:41,060
it grows like frost on the ice.
So it would,

390
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:45,860
the track would be really slow when
we were training and in, in Luge, the,

391
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,220
you know, it's, it's so fast and it's
time to the thousandth of a second.

392
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,070
So if the track is even
like half a second slow,

393
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,820
it makes a really big difference in
your timing and in how you steer.

394
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,870
So training there would be like all sorts
of frost on the ice and then race day,

395
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,260
I mean literally you would sit on your
sled and like look at the ice at the

396
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:07,010
start and think like, oh, like I can see
my reflection in the ice. And it's like,

397
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:10,940
so I used to be like really hard
and really smooth and very fast.

398
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,450
So that was always a little bit of
a challenge. But like Tracy said,

399
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,980
you adapt it something that you know,
you learn how to do as an athlete.

400
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,100
Yeah, yeah. I, you know, I, that's, it's
so different for Ariel's. It's like, so,

401
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:25,030
you know,
we have,

402
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,900
we have four jumped and there's usually
two double kickers into triple kickers

403
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,920
and we arrived there and they're just big,
you know,

404
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:37,900
piles of snow that are, you know,
that we have to basically go shape.

405
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,490
So there's certain shapers on our, um,
you know, from different countries.

406
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:46,390
And so each jump likes to be his shape,
just a little bit different.

407
00:24:46,391 --> 00:24:50,170
Sometimes people like Steve Jumps,
some people like a little bit less, um,

408
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,140
at the top, so it doesn't throw you
up quite so much if those you out.

409
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,650
But everybody, I don't
know, you know, that, that,

410
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,040
that definitely we all
trained at the same time.

411
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,420
Everybody was very supportive and,
and not that that's not an extreme sport,

412
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:09,130
but, um, we, I don't know, there was
definitely a camaraderie between,

413
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,910
um,

414
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,870
between our countries and between everyone
to make sure that the jumps were just

415
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:17,080
right for everybody. Um, so yeah,

416
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,040
we have family that's a coach from another
countries will, yeah, exactly that too.

417
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,560
Um, but yeah, um,

418
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,720
it definitely a little different
dynamic I think. And, and I think the,

419
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:32,320
the Olympics in Vancouver probably
pretty good example of that because a,

420
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:37,180
so prior to Vancouver, the two other
times Canada hosted the Olympics,

421
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:40,810
so Montreal in [inaudible] 76
and then 88 and Calgary, uh,

422
00:25:40,811 --> 00:25:44,710
they didn't win any gold medals
zero at home, which is really,

423
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,330
really unusual.
Usually you kind of have the,

424
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,350
like the home field advantage and
you're going to win more gold medals.

425
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,320
A Canada had not done that,
so they were determined,

426
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:57,670
I think in Vancouver to make sure that
they won gold. So one of the strategies,

427
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:01,450
they funded, a lot of athletes they
thought had the chance to win medals.

428
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:06,451
And then the other strategy was to limit
access to Olympic venues for a athletes

429
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,940
from other countries. So if you, I mean,

430
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:13,540
if you are a figure skater or a
hockey player, maybe, you know,

431
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:18,040
not such a big deal because a lot of the
rinks are like fairly similar and maybe

432
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,180
a little bit different,
you know,

433
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:22,030
ice quality or it's slightly
different dimensions, but you know,

434
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:25,960
fairly much the same,
uh, loose, not so much.

435
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,910
And that was the fastest
track in the world.

436
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:32,530
So actually the day before the opening
ceremonies and athlete from Georgia, uh,

437
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:37,450
died, uh, on the track. So he had 25 runs
and I think the average Canadian head,

438
00:26:37,451 --> 00:26:39,820
like 250. Uh, so

439
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,840
yeah. Yeah, it matters. So
let's pivot post Olympics. Um,

440
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,220
so there's a lot of Olympians
in some cases struggle posts,

441
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,280
a professional athletic career
and pivoting to a new career. Um,

442
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:54,480
Youtube I've done very well.

443
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,870
So can you tell us what you're doing now
and talk about maybe your foundation as

444
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:00,840
well? Sure. Um, yeah. So Gosh,

445
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,900
I am retired after obviously the 2000
actually I retired after the 98 games,

446
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:11,220
took two years off and went down to
California and started a division of my

447
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:15,420
brother's sports marketing company.
Um, it a warm place for two years.

448
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,730
I needed a break anyway. Um, yeah,

449
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,430
and started a casting a sports casting
a company and placing athletes in

450
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,970
different sports production, mainly
commercial and print stuff. Um,

451
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:33,450
it was a great break and I came back
obviously for the 2002 games and then

452
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:37,770
afterwards, um, went back
to casting. So, you know, I,

453
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,000
I feel just very fortunate. I mean, I
did, I did finish getting my degree,

454
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,060
took me 10 years, but I had done that
while I was, it took me seven now

455
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,240
I had my 10 year high school reunion
that weekend. I was, uh, walking.

456
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:55,940
I'm the my college degree.
Yeah. But anyway, um,

457
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,490
yeah. So I, I, you know,

458
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,040
I feel pretty fortunate that I
had a pretty smooth transition.

459
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,760
I also was very much in the eye.
That's just my personality.

460
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:09,840
Like I knew I had to have
something to move on to. And um,

461
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:14,340
so having a business that was
already somewhat set up was,

462
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:18,450
was great. And I did that for a
long time and still doing that.

463
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,520
But also along the way, I, um,

464
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,860
went on a volunteer trip to my mother's
prompting basically. And, uh, um,

465
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,660
ended up starting a foundation
called kids play international.

466
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,320
And this really truly is my,
my absolute passion without a doubt.

467
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,550
And it was really this one little
boy's words, 10 year, 10 year,

468
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,320
10 years olds,
and name's Thomas.

469
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:44,580
I went out and volunteered trip and
he said to me at the end of the trip,

470
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,710
I can see girls can play.

471
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,630
And the background to that
is that we were there, um,

472
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,230
in Africa and in Malawi,
Africa. Yep. And, um, basically,

473
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,440
of course we are playing soccer.
Um,

474
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,200
but we also introduced a new sports
with the boys and girls over there and

475
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,680
obviously developing countries. Girls
just are not encouraged to play sport.

476
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,640
So when we actually
pulled out, um, you know,

477
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,200
baseball and softball after playing
soccer where the boys were just absolutely

478
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:17,580
aggressive and the girls stood there
like orange cones and wouldn't interact

479
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,670
very well together. But
we, we pulled out baseball,

480
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:24,840
softball and it just leveled the playing
field. They had never picked up a bat,

481
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,630
never played, never heard of the
sport and never played the sport.

482
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:32,870
And it was just for me to watch how
differently boys and girls we're learning

483
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,510
side by side and um,
you know,

484
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,890
just that everything that sport and the
Olympic values have taught me and I,

485
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,470
I'm really came back after that trip and
decided that I wanted to do something

486
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:51,880
with, um, gender quality and
sports. And so, um, you know,

487
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,620
it's been about 10 years in the making.
We have a year round program in Rwanda,

488
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:58,240
Africa.
Um,

489
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,690
and it's really all about building better
relationships between boys and girls

490
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:06,080
from a very young age. And you know,
boys and girls are so segregated, um,

491
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,320
um, in developing countries from an
early age that it's just, you know,

492
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:15,390
through our program it, it definitely
goes from simple to complex learning. But,

493
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:16,660
uh,
it's been an amazing,

494
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,750
amazing journey and a such a great way
to be able to take everything that's

495
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:26,630
sport has given me in debt.
Pay It forward a bit. So cool.

496
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,840
And you're involved too.

497
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,610
I am an athlete ambassador and I've been,

498
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:37,040
I've been to Rwanda where our program is
a a couple of times and I went first in

499
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,530
2011 and,
uh,

500
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,580
and it was really like one of the best
things I think that I've done sort of at

501
00:30:43,581 --> 00:30:48,260
the, uh, you know, using a sport in a, in
a way that makes it, makes a difference.

502
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:53,120
So, uh, so I went back this last
summer on a trip that was, uh,

503
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,940
funded by a State
Department grant and it's,

504
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:59,510
it's amazing to sort of see the difference
that the program has made in the

505
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:04,160
community. So, not just with the kids,
but the parents and teachers and everyone,

506
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,670
uh, had like really great
stories of how, uh, the,

507
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,270
the let's play fair program
has impacted them personally.

508
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:16,070
So you went to law school
after I did. So I, uh,

509
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:21,140
my 98 was my last games and I went to
law school that fall and I decided,

510
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:26,540
I decided to go to law school because
I had been on the US Olympic Committee

511
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:31,460
board of directors and on the Athletes
Advisory Council for eight years. And,

512
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:36,020
uh, there are a lot of lawyers in
sports. I, you know, NBA is, you know,

513
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:40,460
nothing but attorneys. Uh, so, uh,
it true in Olympic sport as well,

514
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:44,690
a lot of lawyers practicing or, you
know, working at a sports organization.

515
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,890
And I thought,
oh,

516
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,790
well maybe that's an interesting way to
sort of combine professional career with

517
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,970
my interest in sport. Wasn't quite
sure how that was going to happen,

518
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:56,830
but it seemed like a, a, a good sort
of general, a direction. Anyway,

519
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:01,100
so I went to a,
I went to BC for law school and a,

520
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,840
and Yay. Right on. Uh, and, uh, uh,

521
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:10,430
I spent, uh, I, I've worked, uh, in
new, I've been in New York since, uh,

522
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:14,480
since I graduated law school. Uh,
so I worked on Wall Street at a big,

523
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,620
big from Milbank tweed, uh, for, for
two years. Kind of went through the, uh,

524
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,680
you know, law firm bootcamp. And, uh,

525
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,220
and then I went to a smaller media and
entertainment. It's a boutique, um,

526
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,650
that had, you know, really
interesting clients. So, uh, we had,

527
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,280
I worked on the last JD Salinger
copyright infringement case.

528
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:35,950
A Nike was a client.
So I,

529
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,580
I mostly litigated a intellectual
property cases. Um, while I was there,

530
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:42,290
I also had a,

531
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,740
because I'd been involved with the US
Olympic Committee after I graduated law

532
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:46,850
school,
I put my name,

533
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,540
there was like a list of lawyers who
were available to athletes who had,

534
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,770
you know,
some kind of issues.

535
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:55,970
So I put my name on the list and I got
a call from an athlete who had tested

536
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,490
positive for,
uh,

537
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,450
some drug called modafinil
and the rational for like
three or four athletes that

538
00:33:01,451 --> 00:33:05,140
I represented, uh, the
all of them. And, um,

539
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,690
so that I'd settled that case.
And, and when you're a lawyer,

540
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:10,520
it's like you're learning
something new all the time,

541
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:14,720
especially when you're litigating.
So I knew, of course, like new,

542
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:19,270
the whole drug testing routine, but,
uh, it was, it was, you know, from, uh,

543
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,880
from the lawyer's perspective, I kind
of enjoyed the, enjoyed the process.

544
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,610
But at the end of, at the end
of that first case, one of
the, one of my clients, uh,

545
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,401
Christy gains,

546
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:33,401
so she was a two time gold medalist and
ran on the four by 100 meter relay team

547
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:37,790
with Marion Jones and probably
see where this is going. They, uh,

548
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,230
she was one of the athletes who were
sort of caught up in the Belko a

549
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,880
investigation in California.
Uh,

550
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:48,440
and that ended up being like a
16 month long, uh, sort of, uh,

551
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,780
made new law in a, in doe, in the
doping world, a kind of case. But, um,

552
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,260
so I practiced law for
10 years and, uh, the,

553
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:00,260
the spring of my last year,
um,

554
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:05,240
I got a call from Nyu and they asked me
to come speak on a panel about women in

555
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:10,100
sports. So I did that. I
went out to dinner with the
faculty a afterward and, uh,

556
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:13,880
and want the academic director
at the time. I said, Oh,

557
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:18,860
we'd love you to come teach a class. I'm
like, right in my free time. Oh, New York.

558
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:23,060
Okay. Uh, so actually I left my
firm, I went to Rwanda with Tracy,

559
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:27,410
and then that summer, uh, Nyu,
uh, they sent an email, uh,

560
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,250
was a Monday and they said,
uh,

561
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,420
would you be interested in teaching
international sports governance?

562
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:34,340
And I thought, well, I know that world.

563
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:38,320
It's like the IOC and national
Olympic Committees. And I
said, great. I, you know,

564
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,270
I'd love to. Uh, so I
said yes to that. And uh,

565
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:44,000
and then on Friday they called and
they said, how about sports law?

566
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:48,080
Can you teach that? I'm like,
well, I don't know what's,
uh, what are the topics? So,

567
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,460
um,
so I looked at this,

568
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:53,780
it's a pretty broad survey course and a
lot of the things like Ip, I'm like, fine.

569
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:56,780
Like I, you know, did that for 10
years. It can certainly teach that.

570
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,940
But antitrust and labor law were on the,
on the syllabus. And I said, okay, just,

571
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:05,630
you know, full disclaimer here, I don't
know anything about these areas of law,

572
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,840
like at all. And they said, oh, that's no
problem. You can learn it. And I'm like,

573
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,080
like, okay. So, uh, and I,
I think that's, you know,

574
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:15,530
something like that's in my nature anyway,
being a luge athlete.

575
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:19,100
Like I'm really not afraid of anything.
So I'm like, yeah, sure, why not?

576
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:21,410
I can do that. So, uh, so I did,

577
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,670
the first semester was a little
bit of a learning curve. Um,

578
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,010
international sports governance was great.

579
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:32,480
I had terrible reviews and my sports
law class, like I cried. I'm like,

580
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,110
Oh God, it's awful. And I
said, listen, like I, um,

581
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,120
I said to the director said,
I,

582
00:35:38,121 --> 00:35:41,370
if you want to get someone else to teach
the class, totally fine with me. Like,

583
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:46,170
I don't need this kind of thing.
And, and he said, go, like,

584
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:48,990
go, you know, take the Christmas
break and come back. But like,

585
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:52,440
I think you should teach it one more
time. I said, Oh God, all right. Uh,

586
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:57,060
so I came back and I thought, okay, and,
and again, I think both of us as athletes,

587
00:35:57,061 --> 00:36:01,080
like you were very determined and you
don't get to three or four Olympic Games

588
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,980
without having,
um,

589
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,530
some sense of feeling like you can
accomplish what you set out to do. So.

590
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,340
So I said, okay, like I'll give it
another try. And it was then it was great.

591
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,090
And so at, that was seven years ago.
I'm on the full time faculty in the,

592
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,900
in the sports business program
and uh, I love it. Awesome.

593
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,850
So let's briefly talk with the
Olympics are coming up. Yes. Um,

594
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,550
what advice would you give to a first
time athlete going to the First Olympics?

595
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,250
Oh, okay. I'll go ahead. Um,

596
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,540
Gosh, um, I think I, you know,

597
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,700
you're so obviously focused on just your,

598
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:42,140
your sport and obviously that's
what you should be focused on and,

599
00:36:42,141 --> 00:36:43,880
and competing.
And all of that.

600
00:36:43,881 --> 00:36:48,200
But I think for me it was always
about also a balance. I could not,

601
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,680
um, at least as for the
way I worked as an athlete,

602
00:36:51,681 --> 00:36:55,010
I could not 24 hours a
day think about my sport.

603
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,920
I really did me a disservice.

604
00:36:57,921 --> 00:37:02,870
And so I always like to try to remind
people to take a little bit of, you know,

605
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:06,950
do something else that will take your mind
off of it. And, and you know, and that,

606
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,270
that doesn't mean go go party and
the, you know, outside, you know,

607
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:15,600
before your event or anything like that.
No, no, no, nobody did that. But um,

608
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,360
anyway, um, but or spend too
much time in the cafeteria,

609
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:21,194
that was the big thing.

610
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,060
Everyone to do not spend so much time the
cafeteria at the inside of the Olympic

611
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,870
Village because that was just the
biggest social social place ever. But um,

612
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,660
anyway, but it, but it
is there. They're really,

613
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,950
you really should just be able to take a
little bit of time away from your sport

614
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,780
and so balance your Olympic experience
and it's okay to, like I said, you know,

615
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,650
you go out and enjoy yourself
mostly after your event,

616
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:49,640
but even leading up to it,
um, to have a good balance of,

617
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:54,620
I think just mental it, you
know, the physical side of
it at that point, you know,

618
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,910
you're not rushing. I mean, yes, you're
maintaining whatever you need to do,

619
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:02,830
but you're not looking to
like get a major workout into,

620
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:06,140
to hope that your quads are
stronger for landing at that point.

621
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:11,210
But it's really a mental, it's
such a mental, um, I, you know,

622
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:15,420
pointed that I always say after the
Olympics, people say like, Gosh, you know,

623
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,643
you know,
how do you,

624
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,580
how do you feel after your events
over after the Olympics are over?

625
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:24,470
And I literally felt like I had
held my breath for about four years.

626
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:28,640
And then so when you finally were done,
the exhaustion,

627
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,820
you know, is, it's
really hard to describe,

628
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:35,890
but it's like you finally get to breathe
again before you start ramping it up

629
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:40,330
again. But still you, you
do. It's exhausting. So, um,

630
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,400
my advice I'll, you know, it
was just to make sure that you

631
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,830
give yourself a little bit of a break.
So I would say,

632
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,700
um,

633
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,760
to try not to be distracted by everything
that's going on at the Games because,

634
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:55,360
uh,
Tracy,

635
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:00,370
I'm sure would agree it is
such a different experience
than any other race that

636
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:05,740
you, that you go to. So if you're on
the, if you're on the World Cup tour,

637
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:10,570
you're there with only lose athletes and
everybody goes from track to track and

638
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:14,320
you see the same people, you know,
a training and a, and in the race.

639
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,130
And in that context with the team,
you stay in a hotel,

640
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:20,800
you eat all of your meals together.
Like at the same time,

641
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:23,350
there's a room where you keep,
uh, your sleds, you know,

642
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:26,680
where you can work on your sleds, you get
your sled. Do you go put it in the van?

643
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,690
You drive to the track. It's pretty,
you know, it's, it's pretty simple. Uh,

644
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:35,320
at the Olympics it's an entirely
different things. So at, uh, you know,

645
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,890
you're staying at the
village with people from,

646
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,750
I think what I last read for Pyong Chang,
uh,

647
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:45,820
there are 93 countries right now
sending athletes to the games.

648
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:50,140
So you're in a village with, you know,
athletes from dozens and dozens of a,

649
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:54,760
of countries. Uh, you are, you're
not eating necessarily, you know,

650
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:55,940
where the dining hall is,

651
00:39:55,941 --> 00:40:00,820
is maybe not great where you stay
and where your equipment is stored is

652
00:40:00,821 --> 00:40:02,710
someplace else.
So like,

653
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:07,690
logistically it's much more complicated
and I mean there's a, there's a lot,

654
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,840
there's so much going on.
Um, you know, being mobile,

655
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,480
definitely media requests, um, you know,

656
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,790
press conferences and so there's
a lot that can sort of draw you,

657
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,590
I think outside of your,
sort of your zone of a,

658
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,370
of focus during the games lose.

659
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:28,150
I felt like we were always
really lucky because, uh,

660
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,390
the races at the beginning
of the Olympics every time.

661
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,670
So it's the opening
ceremonies are on Friday,

662
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,910
men's singles race on Saturday and Sunday
the women are on Monday and Tuesday

663
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,000
doubles on Wednesday and then you're done.

664
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:45,220
So it's like six days into the games.

665
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:49,330
There are 11 more days to go
and you can go and you can go,

666
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,130
you go see your teammates compete and
then you figure out which a sponsors are

667
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:55,000
having the best parties.

668
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

669
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:02,041
See for areas as their competent moguls
was always first and Ariel's was always

670
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,190
second week.
So we actually,

671
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:06,770
for Nagano did not even show
up for opening ceremonies.

672
00:41:06,771 --> 00:41:11,150
We were at a training camp before we,
even before we came.

673
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:15,680
So we came well into the first
week of the Games. Um, so,

674
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,450
uh, yeah. Yeah. And there are, there's
definitely a lot of distractions for sure.

675
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,090
I always found it so nice.
Like you said, you know, when,

676
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,560
when we actually got to our site, it
felt like home. Um, because you know,

677
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:31,100
you're obviously that's,
that's the familiar I already have of,

678
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,050
of your sport being there and you're
right. Nothing can prepare you for the,

679
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:39,920
when you look down and,
well it's different probably
at the top of the track,

680
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:42,080
but for us at the top of a of a hill,

681
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,970
you look out and see the
entire, you know, spect,

682
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,870
all the spectators and it's massive. Can
there is like, we obviously have had,

683
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,570
yeah, the spectators at World
Cups and world championships.

684
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,130
Nothing was like the first time I was
like, I was like, oh, oh wow this, okay,

685
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:00,980
let's not, let's not
focus on that, you know,

686
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:03,140
let's just turn around and just
think about what we're doing.

687
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:04,930
Not everyone down there.
In fact,

688
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,940
this is very funny story and I'm in a
2002 as in deer valley where our site was.

689
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,010
I was at the top of the hill just training
and can I just healing somebody down

690
00:42:17,011 --> 00:42:21,370
at the bottom really like just
annoying yelling something.

691
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,090
I was that, yeah, Lansky do it, practice
jump, come down, back up. Same thing.

692
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,400
Come down again and I'm really like,
wow,

693
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:31,190
I don't know why this is really
irritated me. It was my family.

694
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,380
That's why it was my family. And I
was like, oh my gosh, I went over,

695
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:37,790
found my phone,
called my brothers,

696
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:42,230
and you need to go over there and tell
them to be quiet. I was like, oh my gosh,

697
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:47,120
that is really annoying. So it's
amazing that that, you know, kind of,

698
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:51,650
uh, you heard that, but yes.
Yes, exactly. So anyway,

699
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,480
so I do want to open up
to audience questions.

700
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:55,690
There's microphones on
both sides and maybe

701
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,950
just mentioned that we're both going
to the Olympics and pf Chang's. So, uh,

702
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:05,270
I am a, I'm an arbitrator on the
Court of Arbitration for Sport and uh,

703
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:10,271
I'm one of six arbitrators who will decide
any doping case that comes up at the

704
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:14,570
Olympics. So I'll be over there for
the whole time doing that. Yeah. Yeah.

705
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:16,500
I think all of the Russian
cases will be taken care of

706
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,170
and Tracy is going to be there as well.
Yeah. Getting an award. Well, yeah.

707
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,720
So I have a fun question when all people,

708
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:30,070
if people want to start lining up my
phone question is, what is the craziest,

709
00:43:30,071 --> 00:43:35,071
wildest family friendly Corey of things
you saw during the Olympic Village in

710
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:40,240
the Olympic Village? Goodness.
Family friendly. Hmm. Wow.

711
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,780
Goodness. Uh hmm. Well,

712
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,730
I don't know that I have
any. Yeah, yeah. Ah,

713
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,660
I'm a lawyer. I have no stories
and you have no stories.
Yeah, exactly. No, you know,

714
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:59,830
I think just with the, the Olympic Village
really it has everything in anything.

715
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:04,690
If you wanted to go get your hair done,
go get your nails done. Um, you know,

716
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:09,100
they had, uh, they had, uh, um,
you know, disco, Yellow Bar.

717
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,030
No, no, there was no alcohol
inside. I do have a story. Okay.

718
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,260
Speaking of bars. Yeah. There's no,
there was no alcohol on. Oh, well,

719
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:22,120
campus wasn't finish your
story. Yeah. Anyway. Um,

720
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,630
and yeah. You know, and
I dunno, there's, yeah,

721
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,060
it was just very much in all inclusive.
Uh,

722
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,910
but it was just a very unique,
all inclusive.

723
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:38,490
Yes, yes. Yeah. So, uh, in a, in 1992, a,

724
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,120
the Olympics were in France
in Albertville. And, uh, the,

725
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:45,520
the main village was in la,
in the city of Albertville at,

726
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,100
but none of the venues
were very close to town.

727
00:44:48,101 --> 00:44:50,920
So you had to drive
basically two hours to,

728
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,880
to any venue and you'd have to drive
down a valley and then up at mountain.

729
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,410
And then to get to any other venue,

730
00:44:56,411 --> 00:44:58,970
you'd have to go back down
the mountain backs, you know,

731
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,990
down the valley to Albertville and
then out in some other directions.

732
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:05,600
So at that games,
we lose the illusion.

733
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:10,600
Athletes and bobsled athletes were
together in a sort of separate village.

734
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,070
Uh, and it was a club med,
uh, in La Pylon and there,

735
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,460
and there was beer and wine on tap.
Well, it was that they were treated,

736
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:24,380
it was like the sort of club med practices
were still going on, like, you know,

737
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,850
drive around with a cheese called and,
and I think after,

738
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,100
maybe like the first five
days of the Games, I,

739
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,520
maybe we drank like all of the wine
and beer and ate all of the cheese or

740
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:37,240
something. But they're like, okay, maybe
we need to cut a cuddle a little bit off.

741
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,940
Yeah. Yep. Exactly.
Like audience question.

742
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,970
Thanks so much for coming. I'm curious
just given how intense the training is,

743
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,260
uh,
between games,

744
00:45:47,261 --> 00:45:51,400
how athletes support themselves
sort of year to year to year as,

745
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:53,620
as their careers sort of stretch?

746
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,540
Yeah, great question.
Uh, so, uh, so I was a,

747
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:02,250
I was on the national team for
14 years and uh, and lose, uh,

748
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,320
had and still has some, uh, there's like
a race incentive programs so you can,

749
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:12,000
depending on where you finish in World
Cup races, uh, win money, that's a,

750
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:16,920
that comes from the u s Luge Association.
So I did well enough that I, uh,

751
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:19,980
I got enough money that, uh, that
I supported myself through that.

752
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,600
And there were also grants
available like through the, uh,

753
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,860
through the US Olympic
committees. So, so I,

754
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:29,340
I feel like I was fairly fortunate in
that respect that I didn't have to,

755
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,970
you know, work like that much. I did,
you know, some at school, but, uh,

756
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,660
but otherwise I didn't really
have that really big challenge,

757
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:41,370
I think of sort of balancing work and, uh,
and training at the same time. But, uh,

758
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:44,670
so, so I think some athletes sort of
survive that way. Some have, you know,

759
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:47,580
sponsorships that help support
them and then others I think,

760
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,740
I think I can can be a
really big challenge.

761
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,680
Yeah, absolutely. You know, support
yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Same here.

762
00:46:53,681 --> 00:46:58,330
I mean we would have ski sponsors,
boots, sponsors. I had gear sponsors,

763
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:01,960
so you would set up a retainer with
your sponsor and then a victory schedule

764
00:47:01,961 --> 00:47:05,440
depending on how well you did throughout
the year or if you made the world

765
00:47:05,441 --> 00:47:07,280
championship team.
He um,

766
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,270
you get a bonus for that are obviously
Olympic team and all of that.

767
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:14,110
And also for us the way you
were on a team B team c team,

768
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:18,320
so you would get some funding from your
federation as well cover, you know, uh,

769
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:23,290
you know, flight and travel and
training expenses basically. But,

770
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,610
um, you know, having said that,
exactly, what's really difficult,

771
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:31,780
I think in general with is when you're
trying to come up through the ranks,

772
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,680
it's such a double edged sword because
you can't get sponsors without results.

773
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:38,380
Well, you can't get results until
you actually start competing.

774
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,830
And so it is so difficult I think for,

775
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:46,210
for upcoming upcoming athletes too,
to be able to,

776
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:50,650
unless you have parents that can finance
it, you do, you have to get a second job.

777
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,190
Eric Burgiss gold medalist
in 1998 lived out of his car,

778
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,840
ate peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches for,

779
00:47:55,841 --> 00:48:00,760
I don't know how many summers in years.
I mean that you just wanted to do it.

780
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:05,910
One good thing is the Olympic training
centers now lake placid and Colorado

781
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:10,660
Springs, depending on your sport, you can
go there and live, live and have that.

782
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:13,900
But again, you have to also have
worked your way up to a certain point.

783
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,110
So it's difficult. Yeah, it's not a, it's
not always an easy, unfortunately you,

784
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,990
you probably lose some really incredible
talent just due to lack of support.

785
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,840
And I, and I think in Olympic sport,
most athletes don't have, you know,

786
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:31,050
really big sponsors or a
ton of financial support.

787
00:48:31,051 --> 00:48:33,150
So like the Michael Phelps
of the world are, you know,

788
00:48:33,151 --> 00:48:35,550
very few and far between
in Olympic sports.

789
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:38,190
So most of us do it because you love it.

790
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,110
11 yeah. The shelf life of even a
gold medalist these days is so short,

791
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,700
especially now with the
Olympics being every two years.

792
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,240
So as soon as you know the winter
games are over, boom, you're,

793
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:53,290
you've got maybe a month to
kind of really, um, you know,

794
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:58,390
if you want to meddle in and do
everything with media that you can try to,

795
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,740
you know,
reap those benefits.

796
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:03,910
But then sponsors are looking at the
next Olympics already right after that.

797
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,070
So again, there's, there's
clearly exceptions to that,
the to those rules for sure.

798
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,880
But majority of Olympians, you gotta love
what you do. You got to love the sport,

799
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:15,160
you got to love it. Um,
you're not going to,

800
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:19,090
even if you are a gold metal does
not mean you are set for life. So

801
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,150
audience question. Hi.
I have two questions.

802
00:49:23,151 --> 00:49:26,360
The first is actually related to what
you're just talking about with this shift

803
00:49:26,361 --> 00:49:29,420
from being every two years this winter
and summer versus when they were

804
00:49:29,421 --> 00:49:34,210
concurrent, like how you saw things
change. And the other is, uh,

805
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,980
can you talk about your
day to day or like a week,

806
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,950
what would a week look like with
training and how did your training groups

807
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:44,870
changed as he went from one
Olympics to the next? So, uh, the,

808
00:49:44,871 --> 00:49:48,930
I, I kind of went through that
a, the transition from when, uh,

809
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,310
the summer and winter games were
in the same year or two, you know,

810
00:49:52,311 --> 00:49:55,280
being staggered every,
every two. Uh, so, uh,

811
00:49:55,310 --> 00:50:00,310
1992 was the last year that summer in
winter we're in the same year and then

812
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,400
winter was again in [inaudible] 94.
So normally, which, Eh, you know,

813
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:08,720
it sounds great, like I had four Olympics
in 10 years, but actually that was a,

814
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,590
it was a really quick turnaround because
normally like after our games you,

815
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,790
you've kind of got a like a year where
you might experiment with your equipment

816
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:19,730
and try a new sled or some
different things that,

817
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:24,170
because you've got cover in time leading
up to the next games. But after 92,

818
00:50:24,171 --> 00:50:24,981
it was like,
okay,

819
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:28,610
we're actually that next season you
were qualifying for the Olympics again,

820
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,260
a already. So I think though that
it's for winter sports particularly,

821
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:34,970
I think it's,
it's good that it's a,

822
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:39,830
that the games are every two years
because the media can, uh, can focus on,

823
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:44,870
um, you know, give as much attention
almost. Uh, it's a winter as a, as,

824
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:49,370
as the summer. So I think that, I know
for and in general it's a, it's positive.

825
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,900
Um, and uh, on the, on
the training, uh, um,

826
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,280
front in the,

827
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:58,850
it's so it's different sort of in the
winter and the summer sort of in season

828
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:02,820
and out of season. But uh, in
season usually a, if you're,

829
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,590
we would be at like a track for no
longer than a week. So if you're in the,

830
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:10,280
if you're in the World Cup season,
the race ends on Sunday,

831
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:15,430
you pack up all of your stuff and
we lose like the equipment is heavy.

832
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:19,950
And uh, one time we were in the, we
were in the airport and there was a,

833
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,900
a scale in the floor and we actually
put all of the stuff on to it.

834
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:27,860
You had to weigh it. And we're always,
we're paying like extra baggage fees.

835
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:31,340
But when we literally
had a ton of equipment,

836
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:36,560
so you had to pack that up every Sunday
into the cargo van and then you drive to

837
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:40,670
the next place. So usually then Monday,
like afternoon, you'd be on the track,

838
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:45,440
you train twice a day on the track, get
a physical workout in, work on your sled,

839
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,430
take a nap, eat. So it's a,
you're, you're pretty much in a,

840
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,640
in a routine that summertime
it's, you know, you might be,

841
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,080
I was at Dartmouth a lot of,

842
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:58,760
a lot of the time or in lake placid and
that's more like in the gym I'm doing

843
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:01,250
start practice and more,
more physical training.

844
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:04,920
Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, so I,

845
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:09,630
my first Olympics was 94 and I, I, my
first year on the team was 91. So, um,

846
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:10,740
you know that your,

847
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,550
your having been in the Olympics
and then have to turn around.

848
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,450
I did not experience that,
but um,

849
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,300
but I was actually very happy when it
got on the team that the Olympics were

850
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:22,620
coming again in two years. So for
me, um, yeah, uh, you know, that's,

851
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:26,140
I agree. I think it's good
for Winter Olympic, uh,

852
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,840
Olympics to be its own,
um, you know, its own year,

853
00:52:30,841 --> 00:52:34,800
so to speak, because I do think that when
they were concurrent that Eh, you know,

854
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:39,180
summer always kind of overshadow
winter. So, um, anyway,

855
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:44,070
I think that that's, I think it's a
good thing. Um, so training, yes. Gosh,

856
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:46,220
for training, for Ariel's. Um,

857
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,400
our summer time training is
definitely far more intense than, um,

858
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:51,960
than it is when we're on the road.

859
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:55,800
Once you're on the road and competing
week to week, it's more of a maintenance,

860
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,030
um, type of, um, you know,
uh, mentality so to speak.

861
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:03,360
But our summer training
definitely was pretty intense.

862
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:06,360
We would get up and have a
couple hours on the trampoline.

863
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,320
We do a couple of hours, uh, water
ramping. Um, we'd have lunch,

864
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:14,040
we'd go to the gym for another couple
hours and sometimes even a trampoline

865
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:18,660
session at nighttime. So it just,
it kind of, uh, we inside the gym,

866
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:21,660
so to speak. But, um, so yeah.

867
00:53:21,661 --> 00:53:26,550
And you were just really
trying to, you know, you would
definitely, I think it, it,

868
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,060
you know, it depends on where you are
in your career. Obviously if you're,

869
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,890
you're just starting
off and you're a rookie,

870
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:34,500
you're really trying to do a
lot more jumps in qualifying,

871
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:37,770
a lot of jumps as your, you know,
becoming more of a veteran on the team.

872
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,800
You're trying to have a
different type of training.

873
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:45,730
It's quality over quantity basically.
Um, so that's, that's kind of how,

874
00:53:45,731 --> 00:53:47,310
how it worked. Um, you know,

875
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:51,270
in the summertime everyone kind of had
more of an individualized plan depending

876
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:56,220
on what you were, what you were doing,
uh, with your, with your jumps. But,

877
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:59,070
and then, yeah, the winner pretty
much with Cameron said, I mean,

878
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:03,450
it's week to week train traveling.
Um, you'd get into a site on Monday,

879
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,220
you would work on the jumps.

880
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:08,820
You would hopefully at least have one
day of training on the jumps sometimes

881
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:12,870
with whether you didn't even get to train
on the jump till the day you competed,

882
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:16,680
which was never fun. But usually you have
at least one or two days of training.

883
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:20,730
You'd compete back up, move
on to the next, next place.

884
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:24,830
So it'd probably one thing I would add
to this for both of us would be, um,

885
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:28,980
maybe later in your career you might
spend some time in sports medicine and

886
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,190
doing some rehab on your various joints.
A,

887
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,520
I've had four knee surgeries and
one on each shoulders. So, uh, it's,

888
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:41,760
it takes a tick, definitely takes
a toll on the body for a skier.

889
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:45,390
I actually have both my acs,
which is very rare. So I've been,

890
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,950
I feel like I got out of the
sport pretty unscathed. I, yeah,

891
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:53,490
I definitely have some things, but
Tracy, Cameron, thank you for being here.

892
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,500
Thank you so much for coming
and, uh, that's it. Awesome.
Thanks everybody. Thanks.
