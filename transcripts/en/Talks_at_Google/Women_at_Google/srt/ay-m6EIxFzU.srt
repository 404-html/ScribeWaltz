1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,960
Welcome to toxic Google. Uh, so today
we have a, a special guest with us,

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,250
Zaria Foreman, um, who, uh,
uh, my wife grew up with her,

3
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:19,150
so I've known her for a while, but, uh,
I always remember a few years ago, um,

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,620
a photo of her in front of working
on one of her large scale drawings.

5
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:28,090
I showed up on the front page of
Reddit and created quite a buzz,

6
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:28,990
like a just like,

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,000
I think seeing the artist in
front of this giant work of art,

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,990
a big iceberg was just really
visually striking and I feel like the,

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,940
the momentum from that is still going
and she's on a fresh off the, uh,

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,810
another sold out show.
Congratulations. Um, so yeah,

11
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:51,310
here is Zaria Foreman to talk
about her new work and uh, yeah,

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,563
welcome.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,933
Okay.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,240
Thank you for that intro. I
yes, my mic is on. Okay. Um,

15
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,930
I'm really honored and excited to
be here and today. I thank you,

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,810
Phil for inviting me. Where are
you? There you are. And Sad. Um,

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,250
and thank you all for
coming. This is just, yeah,

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,380
I'm really thankful to be here. So, um,

19
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,450
I consider it my life's mission to convey
the urgency of climate change through

20
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:27,110
my work.
And to that end,

21
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:32,111
I've traveled to the polar regions to
capture this unfolding story of ice melts

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,620
and also to the equator to document the
rising seas that are a result of the ice

23
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:44,051
melts and my drawings exploring these
moments of transition and turbulence,

24
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,500
but also tranquility in the landscape,

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,710
allowing viewers like you to connect
emotionally with places that you might

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,050
never have the chance to actually visit.

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,740
And I choose to convey the beauty of these
very remote regions as opposed to the

28
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:08,531
devastation in the hopes that it
will inspire people to want to help,

29
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,210
uh,
help protect and preserve them.

30
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,480
So I'm just to start out,

31
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:19,050
I want to play you something that I
recorded on the Antarctic peninsula. Um,

32
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,540
it's a sound piece that just premiered
to my solo show in Seattle, Washington.

33
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,610
Um, and I recorded in 2015 the
winter on the Antarctic peninsula.

34
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,740
And so really subtle sounds.

35
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:35,741
So I invite you to close your eyes
or just relax in whatever way feels

36
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:36,830
comfortable for you.

37
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,690
So this sound is fondly referred to as
ice is as you might be able to see if he

38
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:33,250
squinted. Um, I've also heard it
called Burgee Seltzer and ice sizzle,

39
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,750
which I've adopted is my DJ
name. Um, but when it is,

40
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,860
is the sound of ancient
air meeting new air,

41
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:47,020
it's the sound of glacial ice melting and
these tiny little air bubbles that are

42
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:49,510
trapped inside of it breaking free.

43
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,770
And also there's a whirring sound, which
you may have heard in the background,

44
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,030
and those are Gentoo penguins.

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,720
So each of these tiny bubbles popping
open contains a treasure trove of

46
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,910
information for scientists.

47
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,970
And I recently met with one
of them named John Higgins,

48
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:11,971
who is a professor of geosciences at
Princeton University and Higgins and his

49
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:17,371
colleagues can basically obtain the age
of the ice by studying these bubbles.

50
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,070
And what they do is use very careful
chemical measurements to reconstruct both

51
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,340
the local temperature and
the ancient atmosphere.

52
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,900
So basically how much carbon dioxide and
methane were there from the time when

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,900
the ice bubbles were locked
inside of the ice sheet.

54
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,430
So the records from these archives show
basically how our climate has changed in

55
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:45,340
the past and what that might
pretend for our future.

56
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,970
So it's important information that we
need to know and these ice bubbles are

57
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,250
hundreds of thousands of years old.

58
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,000
Then in this picture I'm holding a
piece of ice that's a million years old

59
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,790
actually. And he, he told me
it was a million years old
after he handed it to me.

60
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,970
I was just like, oh, I got,
don't melt my aunts. Um,

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,350
but actually the results
from John's latest trip, uh,

62
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,830
suggest that he collected ice. That's
two to two and a half million years olds.

63
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,430
And it's no news to any of us that these
massive ancient cooling systems that we

64
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:23,140
have at our poles that can
take millions of years to grow,

65
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,500
are rapidly melting and that that could
have devastating consequences and we

66
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:33,120
know it actually already is
having devastating consequences.

67
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,030
There is all kinds of horrible news
out there about climate change.

68
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:40,990
There is the fact that the past three
years have been the hottest on record or

69
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,260
that the polar bear population in
the Arctic is in rapid decline. Um,

70
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,090
and now we're faced with
as an administration that
is choosing to ignore these

71
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:52,810
problems. I mean even just these last
two weeks felt like apocalyptic to me.

72
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:53,620
I was,

73
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,130
I mean I'm sure you've heard about the
earthquakes and the hurricanes and I was

74
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:01,340
just in Seattle last week and there
was literally ash falling from the sky,

75
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,880
from the forest fires fires
in Washington. And so, um,

76
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,730
yeah,
bad news.

77
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:11,720
But I want to switch gears and tell you
about an interview that I read recently

78
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:16,640
where Al Gore is talking about how we're
doing in this battle against climate

79
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:19,820
change 10 years after
an inconvenient truth.

80
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:23,900
His first documentary and what
he said actually surprise me,

81
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,670
which is why I want to talk about it.
He said,

82
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,110
even though we're behind on the scoreboard
when it comes to climate change,

83
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,120
that the momentum has shifted
and that we're starting to win.

84
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,700
And I think he's right.

85
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:42,110
I think he's onto something because we
do actually have a lot to celebrate.

86
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,960
First,
of course there's the Paris accord,

87
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,270
which even though the
u s has pulled out of,

88
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,740
I actually think that's a good thing
because what it did was galvanized the

89
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:52,790
whole rest of the world,

90
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:57,770
including most major US corporations
to reaffirm their commitment to it.

91
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:58,910
Um,

92
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,750
Obama managed to permanently ban offshore
drilling and most of the Arctic Ocean

93
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,780
and part important parts of the Atlantic,
which is a huge,

94
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,800
when Iceland and Costa Rica are
one on 100% renewable energy,

95
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,040
solar power in Chile is selling
for half the price of coal.

96
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,430
Even just in the beginning
of this year, we, um, uh,

97
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,140
the world economic forum let us know
that solar and wind is either the same

98
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,110
price or even cheaper
than then fossil fuels,

99
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,060
at least 30 countries nationwide.
There's a long backlog.

100
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,450
What are for electric cars,

101
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,400
there are real solutions that
exist and they're already starting.

102
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,040
We're already starting
to see benefits of them.

103
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,970
And I think it's a pretty effective
tactic to emphasize the positive,

104
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,900
right?
Like a bombardment of terrifying news,

105
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,690
which I just threw at you is paralyzing.

106
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,040
But focusing on the positive
I think is empowering.

107
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,580
So that's what I tried to do with my work
to celebrate what is still here and to

108
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,340
give you,

109
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,370
give viewers the sense that it is still
possible to do something to protect this

110
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,930
earth. It sustains us. So
with that mission in mind,

111
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,640
um, my process always begins by traveling
to these places at the forefront of

112
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:22,430
climate change.
And while I'm on site,

113
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:26,300
I take thousands of photographs
and then back in the studio,

114
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:31,280
I work from both my memory of the
experience as well as the photographs to

115
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,510
create very large scale composition,
sometimes 12 feet wide,

116
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,120
like the one in this video.
Um,

117
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:42,620
occasionally I'll like reinvent the water
or the sky or maybe change the shape

118
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:47,300
of the ice just a little bit to
create like a balanced composition.

119
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,380
Um,

120
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,380
but I'd say 90% of the time I'm depicting
the exact scene that I witnessed

121
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,710
because I want to stay
true to the landscape that
actually existed at that point

122
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:01,410
in time.
Um,

123
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,460
which just something to take note of
is often very different by the time I

124
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,470
finished the drawings
several months later. Um,

125
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:12,471
so I begin with a really simple pencil
sketch just so I have a few major lines

126
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:16,300
to follow, maybe the outline of the
iceberg and the horizon line. Um,

127
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,430
and then I typically jump in pretty
quickly with the color layering pigments

128
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:24,300
onto the paper and I smudge
everything with my fingers and palms.

129
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,693
Um,

130
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:32,030
I tend to break the pastel into these
sharp shards or I work with soft pastel.

131
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,540
I should have told you that. Of course
it's basically like charcoal, but uh,

132
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,420
colors.

133
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,750
So I'll break it into these little sharp
shards that I can use to render the

134
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:44,130
finer details on top of the base layer
of pigment that I've already put down.

135
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,060
And typical paper used for soft pastel
has a lot of tooth meaning a very like

136
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,070
textured surface so that it's able to
absorb as much pigment as possible.

137
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,263
Um,

138
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,230
I actually prefer to work on
a much smoother paper than
what most pestel artists

139
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:05,940
would want because it allows me to get
those finer details without the texture

140
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:09,300
of the paper getting in the way.
Um,

141
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,240
the challenge with this though is that
there isn't a lot of room for error or

142
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:14,910
reworking since the paper
can't absorb so much pigment.

143
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,330
But I honestly enjoy this challenge
because I think that I get so lost in the

144
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:24,480
tiny details that I would just
never know when to stop if you know,

145
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:28,440
if the pigment in the paper didn't
provide those kinds of limitations for me.

146
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,463
Um,

147
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,430
so I am aware that,
you know,

148
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:40,431
most people can't access many of these
really remote places that I draw.

149
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:45,360
And so in a lot of ways the environmental
issues there might seem remote and

150
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,460
disconnected from their lives.

151
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,880
So that's one reason why I choose to work
on such a large scale to recreate the

152
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:59,860
wonder of witnessing an
iceberg or a glacier up close.

153
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,420
And I rely on other specialists like
scientists to make rational data driven

154
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:10,350
arguments for why we must take
action to protect our ecosystems.

155
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,540
But through my work,

156
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,350
I'm trying to make an appeal
on a more elemental level.

157
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,520
According to behavioral psychologists,

158
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,210
much of our decision making
comes from our emotions.

159
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,810
And I think art has a special
ability to tap into those emotions.

160
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,200
And it's not just something I think
it's scientifically proven that it does.

161
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,510
So when I make these drawings,

162
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:41,511
I'm trying to create immense images that
are just overflowing with detail that

163
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,050
draw you in and transport you.

164
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,930
Um, and an author named Elaine scarry,
she's a Harvard English professor,

165
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:55,030
wrote a book called on
beauty and being just,

166
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,660
and in it she talks about how,
um,

167
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,120
she suggested I should say that when we
witnessed something really beautiful,

168
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,240
be it a wave or a face
or a poem or a glacier,

169
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,040
that it causes an s what she
calls a radical decentering.

170
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,850
And she says, quote, when
we see a beautiful thing,

171
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,130
our own importance is diminished.

172
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,670
It is not that we ceased to stand
at the center of the world for,

173
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:25,660
we never stood there.

174
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,920
It is that we ceased to stand even
at the center of our own world.

175
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,510
We willingly cede the ground to
the thing that stands before us.

176
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,710
That is the exact experience that
I hope to evoke through my work.

177
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,610
So this past last school year,

178
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:50,590
I gave a series of lectures at Harvard
University and in my preparation for my

179
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:50,951
talks,

180
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,700
I was scrolling through
their environmental center's
website and looking at

181
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:58,420
their, um, climate week from 2015
there were a bunch of videos from,

182
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,620
from it and there was one that
was particularly compelling
to me that featured a

183
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:05,500
father and son duo,
Bob Cohain on the right,

184
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:10,030
who's the professor of
international affairs at
Princeton University and his son

185
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:12,100
not on the left who works at,
um,

186
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,380
on climate issues that the
environmental defense fund.

187
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,920
And one thing that stood out to me that
they both emphasized was this notion of

188
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:25,360
momentum, the same momentum that
I think Al Gore was talking about,

189
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:29,170
that for there to be
effective climate policies,

190
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,860
we need people and parties from different
arenas to work together in an ongoing

191
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:36,964
way.

192
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,770
So that's how I see my work
fitting into the bigger picture.

193
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,560
I just want to be part
of that conversation,

194
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:49,561
helping to generate momentum and
unity of purpose across boundaries of

195
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:54,640
discipline and geography
and political affiliation.

196
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,350
So I guess by sharing
these moments of stillness,

197
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,070
paradoxically I'm hoping
to help generate momentum

198
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,501
in their talk.

199
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:10,501
I also found it really touching to see
how one Cohain had passed the torch onto

200
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,570
the other because I think it taps into
something essential about climate change

201
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:19,900
work,
which is its purview is intergenerational.

202
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,470
The work is about passing the torch
and thinking ahead several generations.

203
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,650
And I think perhaps I might
be particularly attuned
to that dynamic because of

204
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:34,600
the debt that I owe to my
mother. Rena baths, foreman.

205
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,550
She was a fine art landscape photographer
and in the last 10 years her of her

206
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:44,350
life, um, her work focused on the Arctic
and she passed that torch onto me.

207
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,850
My mother's love of photography just
propelled her to the most remote,

208
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,370
far flung places on the planet
that she could possibly find.

209
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,230
And my family and I were fortunate to
join and support her on those adventures

210
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:04,910
from riding camels through northern
Africa to mushing near the North Pole.

211
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,260
She always said that she was
a polar bear and a past life.

212
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,270
And I never doubted that to be true.

213
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,340
She could just stay out for hours on end
with like frozen eyelashes and a giant

214
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:21,020
smile on her face. And the rest of my
family was like, I'm hungry and cold. Um,

215
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,460
but she just loved it.

216
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,990
So in August of 2010 and 11,

217
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,440
she and I were planning an Arctic
expedition together to Greenland called

218
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,440
chasing the light.

219
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:38,530
It was to be the second
ever Arctic expedition with
the mission of creating art

220
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:42,020
inspired by the dramatic geography there.

221
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,410
And the first was led in 1869 by an
American painter named William Bradford.

222
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,510
And what was unique about that trip was
that its main purpose was art as opposed

223
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:56,510
to science or exploration,
which is what was happening in that day.

224
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,100
So my mom thought,
well,

225
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,420
wouldn't it be fascinating to Mirror
Bradford's for journey and travel up the

226
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:07,421
northwest coast of Greenland to seek
inspiration from the same landscape nearly

227
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:10,610
150 years after Bradford had.

228
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,610
So she and I were in the very early
stages of planning this trip when she was

229
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,020
diagnosed with brain cancer.

230
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,610
And the cancer pretty quickly
took over her body and her mind,

231
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:24,500
and she passed away six months later.

232
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,990
But during those six months,
during those months of her illness,

233
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,790
her dedication to the
expedition never wavered.

234
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,850
And so it felt like a duty to me.

235
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:41,960
Like I felt responsible to carry
out this mission in her honor,

236
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:46,961
which I did in August of 2012 leading a
group of artists and scholars on a four

237
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:48,620
week expedition.

238
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,660
My mother's affection for the landscape
really echoed throughout my own

239
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,800
experience in Greenland.

240
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,250
And I felt both the power but also
the fragility of the landscape.

241
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:05,931
I mean,

242
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:10,931
the sheer size of the icebergs
is humbling and the ice fields,

243
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,320
they like vibrate with movement and
sound in a way that I never expected.

244
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,920
That's what prompted me to
bring my recording equipment
and my more recent trips

245
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,420
so I could bring that back to you.

246
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:25,421
And it's also why I decided to expand
the scale of my work to give viewers that

247
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:29,810
same sense of awe that I had experienced.

248
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,120
The melting glaciers in Greenland are one
of the largest contributing factors to

249
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,300
rising sea levels,

250
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,560
which have already begun to drown some
of our world's lowest lying islands.

251
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,260
One year after my trip to Greenland,
I decided to fly to the Maldives,

252
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,140
which is the lowest and flatus
country and the entire world.

253
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
And while I was there,

254
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:58,170
I collected images and inspiration
for a new body of work,

255
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,120
drawings of waves lapping
along the coast of a nation,

256
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,370
a whole nation that could be entirely
underwater within this century.

257
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,510
While I was there with my collaborators,

258
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:16,560
we shared the concept of our project
with children at the Iskander elementary

259
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,020
school,
the nation's Capitol called Molly.

260
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,940
And we basically just invited them to
document their landscape as it transforms

261
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,770
throughout their lifetime.
Um,

262
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,610
and hopefully that can help to
bring awareness to their island,

263
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,700
which is actually still very much needed,
surprisingly enough.

264
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:38,730
And I'm also just help
them kind of inwardly,

265
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:42,480
emotionally process what
is happening around them.

266
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,690
Last winter,

267
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:50,220
I had the honor of serving as the
artist and residents aboard the National

268
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,840
Geographic explorer in Antarctica.

269
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,670
I've traveled to many stunning places,

270
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,660
but Antarctica is just
in a category of its own.

271
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,920
The ice,
just like radiated a sapphire blue,

272
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:08,250
as you can see in this video.
And it just took my breath away.

273
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:12,690
It's what inspired a whole body
of work that I just completed,

274
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,630
that I worked on for the last 18 months.
Um,

275
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,280
and I'll just show you a time
lapse of one of those pieces. Um,

276
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,470
it's called Wale Bay. It was inspired
by a place called Oil Bay, uh,

277
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,000
that's on the Antarctic peninsula.

278
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:32,001
And the bay is situated near a glacier
that's calving icebergs into the sea as

279
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,660
all glaciers eventually do.

280
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,020
But the wind and water currents carry the
icebergs directly into the bay because

281
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,600
of where it's situated.
And since the bay is kind of shallow,

282
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,430
the icebergs will scrape against the sea
floor and become what's called grounded,

283
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,420
which basically means they remained
there until they've melted completely,

284
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,190
which is a process that can take years
if the icebergs are large enough, like,

285
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,750
like this one. Um, and
bays that enclose icebergs,

286
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,750
like these are called iceberg graveyards,

287
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,880
which to me just seems like a
metaphor for the bigger picture. Um,

288
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,081
you know,

289
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:15,081
I had the opportunity to ride around
this bay for two hours in a small Zodiac

290
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:17,010
boat.
This is a video that I took there.

291
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,150
A Zodiac has a little rubberized
like 12 foot boat. Um, and you,

292
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:24,510
you'll actually start to see the iceberg
on the righthand side come into view.

293
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:27,870
That's the iceberg from the drawing
that you just saw me making. Um,

294
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,750
it's from a slightly different angles,
so if you don't recognize it,

295
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:34,290
it's not my fault. Um, but yeah,

296
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:38,310
we got to ride around for two hours
just weaving around the most intricately

297
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:42,960
sculpted, glowing blue icebergs
I have ever seen. I mean, the,

298
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,760
the longer that they stay there,

299
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:49,761
the more the water and the wind sculpt
these blocks of ice into just other

300
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:55,000
worldly shapes.
And I shot like thousands of photographs,

301
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,630
um,

302
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,630
at times I had to just force my camera
into my lap so I could simply be present

303
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:04,030
and take in the overwhelming
beauty of it all.

304
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,160
And so I hope that my drawings as much
as you can see on these screens can offer

305
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:11,380
you a similar experience.

306
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,603
Um,

307
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,800
so this past October I had the opportunity
see Antarctica from a whole different

308
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:25,270
perspective. NASA invited me to
join them on operation ice bridge,

309
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,320
which is the largest airborne
survey of earth's polar ice.

310
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:30,971
Um,

311
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:35,971
we flew 12 hours every single day
that the weather permitted on the DC,

312
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,900
which has the most comprehensive suite
of instruments ever flown on long range

313
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:45,370
flights, including laser
radar, an infrared sensor,

314
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,750
digital photography,

315
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,410
and something called a groove
emitter that houses Einstein's brain.

316
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,240
But it like measures gravity
somehow. I don't know. Um,

317
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,230
and it was just,
I mean it was an incredible experience.

318
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:04,231
It was humbling to witness the science
team and air crews dedication to their

319
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:09,361
seriously hard and grueling work and
the data collected provides crucial

320
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:11,590
information about ice loss.

321
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,630
Basically what the melting of ice sheets
could mean for sea level rise and what

322
00:22:16,631 --> 00:22:20,620
the melting of sea ice could mean
for the entire global climate system.

323
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,470
This year, the Antarctic Sea ice
loss has been particularly swift.

324
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,250
We even had to make some
last minute modifications to
one of our flight plans to

325
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:35,251
account for the significantly diminished
cis when NASA measured its extent for

326
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:36,790
this time of year,

327
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:41,680
it was at the lowest level ever
recorded and reliable satellite history,

328
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,330
which dates all the way back
to 1979 and since that year,

329
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:47,860
since 1979,

330
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,100
the planet has been shedding massive
amounts of cis annually that equal the

331
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:57,700
amount of, um, an area larger
than the state of Maryland.

332
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,080
The scale of this loss is
difficult to comprehend.

333
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,100
Um,
and similarly,

334
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:10,420
my sense of perspective was completely
warped as we flew over the ice.

335
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:11,710
And just to give you an example of that,

336
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:16,711
this is a photo from one of our flights
over glacier called land glacier and it

337
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:22,060
covers the equivalent of 54 football
fields in that photo is just,

338
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:25,420
I mean, it's crazy to me. It looks like a
little crumble advice like the sidewalk,

339
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:29,080
but that little blue crack is
probably a hundred feet wide.

340
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,910
Um,
so this past April,

341
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,940
I was actually able to join NASA is ice
bridge team again on some of their art

342
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:43,360
dick missions. And we
flew over, um, ice sheets,

343
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,240
CIS and glaciers,
Arctic Canada and Greenland.

344
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,370
And it was just, I mean, totally
thrilling to fly once again,

345
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:57,170
only 1500 feet above the ice that's there.
The instruments need to be 1500 feet.

346
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:57,530
So it's,

347
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,550
it's actually pretty low for a plane and
you really get to see the detail and it

348
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:05,580
was just like so exciting for
me to compare the ice to it,

349
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:07,250
southern counterpart,
um,

350
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:12,200
but also just reconnects with the
science team and the air crew and um,

351
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,560
kind of chilling to learn of some of
their more recent discoveries such as a

352
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:20,720
giant crack that is forming
in the Peterman glacier,

353
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:25,520
which could in the future. This is a
picture of the crack. Um, so it could,

354
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:28,640
if it splits off the shelf,
you mean a new Ice Island?

355
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:31,970
Basically a giant iceberg that's
twice the size of Manhattan

356
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,950
findings from this close to a decade now.

357
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:41,951
Long project are numerous and
some of them mind blowing to me.

358
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,641
For instance,

359
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:48,641
they found a canyon larger than the
Grand Canyon under Greenland's ice sheet,

360
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,520
just like we had no idea that was there.

361
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:54,420
It was just hiding under the ice sheet
bigger than the Grand Canyon. Um,

362
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:59,470
but the most significant data from the
project have shown that the entire West

363
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:06,670
Antarctic ice sheet has likely entered
an unstable state and might now be in

364
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,020
irreversible decline.

365
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,280
And although the timing of
that retreat is unknown,

366
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,550
it's still a powerful reminder that
we've entered a new era with significant

367
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:20,840
changes on the horizon.

368
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,240
Our president has already begun to
defund NASA climate research and the lead

369
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:35,831
scientist at iceberg named Nathan cards
recently emailed the team and I to say,

370
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,150
quote,
in these uncertain times,

371
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:41,900
it is vitally important that we reach
the hearts and minds of people around the

372
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:45,310
world to communicate the importance
of the work that we're doing. Right.

373
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:51,330
So I just want to thank you for having
this opportunity to share not only their

374
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:56,330
really important mission, but also my
own work. Um, and I hope that, you know,

375
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,180
you'll spread it as much as you
can and it's just an honor to,

376
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,770
to speak to such an influential audience.

377
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,570
So when I was in Greenland in two
back in 2012, that first trip,

378
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,020
I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the
melting ice and now she remains a part

379
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,240
of the landscape that she loved so much,

380
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,890
even as it two passes
and takes on new forms.

381
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,820
Among the many gifts that my mom gave
me was the ability to focus on the

382
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:32,890
positive rather than
dwell in the negative.

383
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,140
And honestly,

384
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:40,090
that lesson has rarely felt more
necessary than now. And yes,

385
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:45,091
it's become far more challenging to
stay positive since January especially.

386
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,690
But I'm doing my best and I
encourage others to do the same.

387
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,560
And former Secretary General Ban,

388
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:56,370
Ki Moon said at the most recent
climate change conference in Morocco,

389
00:26:56,371 --> 00:27:00,240
that action on climate change
has become unstoppable.

390
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,910
And he's absolutely right.

391
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,310
And those are the words that
I just keep reminding myself,

392
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,743
mmm.

393
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,420
On our family travels.

394
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:16,130
Every time that we came across
a really spectacular view,

395
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,910
my mom would do this thing and I apologize
in advance because I'm going to have

396
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:23,660
to get loud. She would go, oh my God.

397
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:31,240
And that in taste cause I sound
exactly like hers. Um, but it was,

398
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,210
she's, it was special. Like she saved
it for only the best of the best.

399
00:27:35,211 --> 00:27:37,190
And so it would happen once,

400
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:42,191
usually maybe twice if we were lucky on
a four to six week trip on each four to

401
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:46,580
six week trip. And so every single time
we approached a really beautiful view,

402
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,380
my dad and my sister and I would like
glance at her wondering if it passed the

403
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,753
test.

404
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,950
I tried to uphold her reverence,

405
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:03,430
her legacy of drawing attention to
the beauty of these remote places.

406
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,720
And I tried to embody her,
resolve an intrepid newness.

407
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,380
I am so utterly grateful for the time
that I had with her and also for the time

408
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:20,210
that we all have to appreciate what is
around us and to take action to protect

409
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:21,740
it.
Thank you.

410
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,800
So, but what are we going to do?
A Q and. A, but I also have, um,

411
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,240
a video piece that is also premiering
currently and my solo show in Seattle.

412
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:44,470
And it's kind of subtle.
I recorded it on the Antarctic peninsula,

413
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:48,210
same place where I did that drawing
that I showed you the timelapse up. Um,

414
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,400
and so I'm just gonna let it play in
the background while you guys ask me

415
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:53,650
questions.
And here it is.

416
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,650
Maybe here we go.

417
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,850
Is there ever a question
about a technology and how
it's been used to amplify

418
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:18,300
your message? I'm Seth
talked about reddit. Oh,

419
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:23,180
I know what the campaign that you raised
money too for the trip to Greenland. Um,

420
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,900
and then now with Youtube,
uh,

421
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,500
can you talk a little bit more
about how technology is helping, uh,

422
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,040
with the momentum as you say?

423
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,350
Yeah. Um, yeah, a few years ago my,

424
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:37,760
as Seth mentioned,

425
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:41,380
my work kind of went viral on the
Internet then I have still to this don't

426
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:44,680
really know how it happened,
but I'm grateful for it. Um,

427
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,630
and the momentum that that started
hasn't really ever stopped.

428
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:50,890
And,
um,

429
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,130
I mean I think like I had done enough
work in the 10 years previous to kind of

430
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:58,540
like back to back that up. Like it was
like a ripe time for it to happen. Um,

431
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,470
but I'm certainly really grateful that
it did cause it just helped. I mean,

432
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:06,650
it's so easy to spread these
kinds of messages really far, um,

433
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,290
across the planet, across the globe. And,
um, yeah. And so I really use, you know,

434
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:15,700
like especially Instagram, social
media as a tool to, to share, you know,

435
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:20,290
these the missions I went on with NASA
and also just the work that I'm doing.

436
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,560
Um, what was it? Did I, did I answer
everything you ask? Yeah. Okay, cool.

437
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,250
Yeah. Oh, also, I shouldn't say that
like Instagram itself has really become,

438
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,641
I think,

439
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:34,120
like the best way for artists especially
to promote their work because it's such,

440
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,630
it's such a visual platform. So, um, yeah,

441
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:40,190
I mean I've sold a lot of work
on Instagram, which is, you know,

442
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,040
that never would have
happened 10 years ago.

443
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,590
It's just interesting
how things have changed.

444
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,710
Hi. Hi. First of all,

445
00:30:48,711 --> 00:30:52,780
thank you for your very beautiful
work and your positive energy, uh,

446
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,670
on a topic that I think is
pretty tough and scary. Um,

447
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,620
my main question is, with your
work, what is your main goal?

448
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,680
Is it to document and share or to
inspire or are you urging people to take

449
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:10,760
action? Like just people like
us or organization or politics?

450
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,700
Yeah, good question. Um,

451
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,890
my main purpose is to share,

452
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:21,540
to give viewers a place,
a time and a moment to feel like they're,

453
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:25,110
they're like they're transported to these
places that are otherwise like so not

454
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:27,280
connected to our everyday lives.
Um,

455
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:32,281
and to ideally stir up an emotional
connection because like I said,

456
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,240
you know, when you, when you have an
emotional connection with something,

457
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,460
when you love something,
you want to protect it.

458
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,410
And so that's the idea is that I spur
that emotional connection and then they go

459
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:47,100
on to take action. And I do, you
know, I'll, I'll offer things,

460
00:31:47,101 --> 00:31:51,930
I'll give websites, I'd donate a
percent of my sales to three fifty.org,

461
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:54,000
but I have a whole page
on my website that's like,

462
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:56,460
here's how you can cut down
your carbon footprint. Um,

463
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,670
but I feel like there's a lot of
that out there, which is awesome.

464
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,860
And that's not like my main
purpose. Even though, yeah,

465
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:05,730
of course I want to direct people in the
right way so that they can take action,

466
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:10,360
but I'm trying to translate the,
the debt,

467
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:14,640
like the data is out, like we know
the science, but somehow still,

468
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,720
almost half of our planet doesn't believe
it or just doesn't want to see it.

469
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:23,550
And so clearly that hard science isn't
enough. So I'm trying to just offer,

470
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:28,420
you know, the best way
that I can communicate the
importance of that and the,

471
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:31,730
and the scientific stuff that might
not be as easy to digest and have an

472
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,470
emotional connection
with. Thank you. Yeah,

473
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,820
that's very great. I know, me too.

474
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,780
Yeah, thank you as well.
It's really inspiring,

475
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:45,510
not only to see some of the
context behind what you're doing,

476
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:47,250
but also how you do it.

477
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:51,060
So I liked that you touched on both
pieces and actually how you work with the,

478
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,590
um,
pastels and,

479
00:32:52,591 --> 00:32:57,480
and what the reasoning behind it and
to touch on your last point of, um,

480
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,050
kind of accessibility of the message.
Right? So I think the data is out there,

481
00:33:01,051 --> 00:33:05,650
the science is out there
that's very difficult for a
lot of us to understand and

482
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,870
many more to understand.
Right?

483
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:11,400
And so I think sometimes these decisions
are emotionally driven rather than

484
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:16,230
driven by the data and the science
backing it up. And I'm just curious,

485
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,160
I think the way that you're going about
it kind of tried to create an emotional

486
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:25,161
reaction is probably making this a
more accessible message then maybe NASA

487
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,870
message or something to
a much bigger audience.

488
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,850
And I was wondering if you
could just touch upon that,

489
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:34,790
if you've seen that you're able to, um,
make that message more accessible, um,

490
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,910
or maybe any lessons learned do you
have from making that a more accessible

491
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:39,744
message?

492
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,470
Yeah, absolutely. I mean,
and that's exactly what I'm
trying to do. So thank you.

493
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:47,890
I'm glad that you think gets it.
It's doing that. Um, and I, uh,

494
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:52,110
a big part of that too is the,
the, the realistic way that I draw,

495
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:56,260
like the way that I'm, I'm drawing all
the details. It's not abstract. It's, um,

496
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,570
accessible not only to people who
aren't interested in science but also,

497
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,070
um, people outside the
art world bubble. Um,

498
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,230
I get a lot of like people who want to,

499
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,440
who have purchased my work and you
want to our first time art buyers,

500
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:14,910
like they just want to be able to
see that image in their home. Um,

501
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,300
cause you know,
I think there,

502
00:34:16,301 --> 00:34:19,890
there is a lot of art out there that's
not so accessible and this is just like

503
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,780
you look at an image and,
and you know,

504
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:24,870
you know what it's about and you can
have a connection to it because it's part

505
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:29,160
of our planet. We all live here. So yeah,

506
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:33,390
I mean in every facet I try to
make it as accessible as possible.

507
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:37,680
And I do think that it's, um,
succeeding in that way. You know,

508
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:41,410
hopefully I get, you know, of course
the only people only tell me, you know,

509
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:46,080
that they love my work. I don't tell me
if they hate it. So, but, um, but yeah,

510
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:49,590
I mean I have had a bunch of people come
up to me and just say like, thank you.

511
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:50,850
Like I had no idea.

512
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:54,480
Or like now I've changed these actions
in my life because of what you said.

513
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:59,190
And so that's like the most
gratifying things that I can hear.

514
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:01,523
Yeah.

515
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,420
Hi.
Hi.

516
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:11,000
You said that you take thousands of
images and you have access to videos.

517
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,580
So how do you choose which
images to actually draw?

518
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:19,110
Oh, good question. Um, that's, it's
probably the hardest part of my job,

519
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,233
I think.
Um,

520
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,350
it takes hours and hours of just scrolling
through and editing because I, I mean,

521
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:29,970
at this point I have like
lifetimes over enough material to,

522
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,520
to continue making work for,
for many lives. And, um, and,

523
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,070
and I still want to go back and,

524
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,350
and continue be inspired by
these places selfishly. But, uh,

525
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,760
it's,

526
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,870
it's hard to describe because I think a
lot of the time it's just like a feeling

527
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,660
like I'll be scrolling through images
and then all of a sudden something will

528
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:50,700
really stand out to me.
Um,

529
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,380
and so that's often how it happens is
just like the composition just feels

530
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:59,280
right. It's not about math
or like, um, you know,

531
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:02,400
art theory about the horizon line has
to be one third up from the bottom.

532
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:03,960
It's just, I was just like, oh,

533
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:08,070
there's something about that that just
like has the right feeling. Um, yeah.

534
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,411
And it,

535
00:36:08,411 --> 00:36:11,970
and it can be hard because even I have
an endless amount of photos and video,

536
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:16,580
but then I can also crop them
endlessly and zoom in endlessly.

537
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,440
So, yeah, it's definitely
the hardest part.

538
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,130
I spent a lot of time scrolling through
and staring at their computer screen and

539
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:24,900
lots of icy pictures.

540
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,370
I'm wondering what comes next after the
icebergs and the disappearing islands in

541
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:37,540
the Maldives where you sort of stay on
theme with environmental changes or maybe

542
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:38,710
do something else entirely?

543
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,640
Um, yeah, I mean, I, you
know, I can't tell the future,

544
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:47,641
but I do think that I could continue with
ice and sea level rise for the rest of

545
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:52,930
my life. Um, I don't feel like, and like,

546
00:36:52,931 --> 00:36:55,960
and until it stops inspiring me,
I'm going to continue with it.

547
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,840
And I don't see that end anywhere
in sight. And just because there,

548
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,980
there's so much more that I still
have to learn about rendering.

549
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:05,190
It's different textures and surfaces and,

550
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,260
and that's what excites me and just to
like learn something new with every piece.

551
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:11,970
And so immediately what's next is,
um,

552
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,960
from all these trips I did with NASA,

553
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,700
I gathered a bunch of aerial
footage and photography and, um,

554
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:21,220
and I'll be making a series
that's from that perspective.

555
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:23,680
So some of those photos you saw
it all kind of look like that.

556
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:27,310
It's a little bit more abstract
looking and won't, it's, it's real.

557
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,660
It won't look abstract. But, um,
I'm curious to see, you know,

558
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:33,460
how that all unfolded
and it's exciting for me,

559
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:38,140
but that'll be my next exhibit in
New York, um, in October of 2018.

560
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,880
So, but yeah, like I said,

561
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:43,960
there's just so many textures and
surfaces and ways that it's like melting.

562
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:48,100
I mean water has so many
different forms and, um,

563
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,730
I just don't see an end in sight where it,
where it will stop inspiring me.

564
00:37:51,731 --> 00:37:53,380
And I also think,
you know,

565
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:58,000
climate change is like arguably the
largest crisis we face as a global

566
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,700
community. And I don't see
that going away anytime soon.

567
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:05,500
And so it's important to me to connect
whatever I'm doing to something, um,

568
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,420
you know,
meaningful for the rest of the world.

569
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:12,190
So I see myself doing that
forever. Thank you. Yeah.

570
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,173
Thank you.

571
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,253
Anyone else?

572
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,780
So when you're drawing,

573
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,890
are we making a conscious effort
to stop yourself from exploring and

574
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:24,900
transforming the image,

575
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,460
the photograph or like how the hell do
you trade off between kind of maintaining

576
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,780
the accuracy of the photograph
and going into an abstract thing?

577
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,030
Yeah. Um, I mean, I'm, I,

578
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:41,890
I want to portray the exact landscape
that I witnessed because I'm trying to

579
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:43,210
stay true to it. And, you know,

580
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:46,870
I just want to be honest about what I
saw and tried to give people that same

581
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:51,430
experience. So the only
time I ever, um, you know,

582
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:55,180
elaborate or change it,
it's a very small percent of the time,

583
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:59,500
but it's really just like if I have this
beautiful image and I feel like is like

584
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:03,190
really more powerful than
anything else, you know, um,

585
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,280
that I've been looking through.
But there was like, oh,

586
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:09,570
the corner of the iceberg goes off
the corner of the image and I don't,

587
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:12,700
I want it to stay contained inside with
a little bit of background behind it.

588
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:16,720
It's just that just to like artistically
creative bonds composition so that it

589
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:21,100
gives you, you know, as much of
a, uh, a wonderful, comfortable,

590
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,990
loving feeling as possible.

591
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,583
Yeah.

592
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,650
Hi. Sorry, ma'am. Could you
talk a bit more about, um,

593
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,800
the collaboration with NASA in that,

594
00:39:31,801 --> 00:39:36,440
how did that come about for
you as an artist? Yeah, so, um,

595
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,290
one day I got an email from,
um,

596
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,620
from NASA is,
uh,

597
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:48,650
he was a navigator is basically their
lead navigator for airborne terrestrial

598
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,520
exploration, not extraterrestrial.
So like basically flying,

599
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:57,930
exploring arth from, from flight, you
know, in flight. And he just reached out.

600
00:39:57,931 --> 00:40:00,810
He came from a family of artists and
I mean he didn't say that in his first

601
00:40:00,811 --> 00:40:03,860
email, but he was just like,
Hey, I found your work on,

602
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,780
I saw your Ted talk on apple TV in my,
you know,

603
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,150
preparations and research for
my next trip to Antarctica.

604
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:13,740
And I thought you shouldn't come with us.
And so here's my phone number, call me.

605
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,280
I had,
if I remember very clearly this day,

606
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:21,350
I had a friend we know coworking with
me in my studio and I was like, wow,

607
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,600
I read him the email. He was
like, oh my God. I was like,

608
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:27,660
I think I'm going to call him immediately,
but I kinda think this is a hoax.

609
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,280
And I called him and he had this
like radio voice and I was like,

610
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:33,920
this just can't be a real.
Um,

611
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,710
and after several conversations in
several months and lots of planning,

612
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:41,760
I still didn't think it was real on the
plane flying down to Punta Arenas, Chile,

613
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:45,280
where I was going to meet the team.
And it really wasn't until like the,

614
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,280
that evening when I walked into the first
science meeting that they have every

615
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,100
night at 6:00 PM where
I was like, oh, this is,

616
00:40:53,101 --> 00:40:57,180
I'm not being kidnapped there.
An appointment of NASA scientists here.

617
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,850
So yeah, I, I mean I'm just,

618
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:04,650
I'm so grateful for this opportunity and
to collaborate with such an incredible

619
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:09,200
project and, um, and I was so
intimidated to at first to,

620
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,520
to go meet a bunch of, you know,
I'm an artist, I'm a weird,

621
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:15,000
quirky artists to go meet a bunch of
NASA scientists was like really scary,

622
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,420
but they were so warm and welcoming and
a bunch of them had even like known my

623
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:24,150
work before and we're really excited
to meet me and, and you know,

624
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:28,660
way more than I expected. They
really valued the, you know,

625
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:33,770
understood the value in communicating
their message in a different way that they

626
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,240
haven't been able to do.

627
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:38,750
So I think all of them are like really
grateful that I was there and doing,

628
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,620
doing what I'm doing. So it's, it's
been a really incredible experience.

629
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:45,620
I'm actually going there tonight.
Right after I leave here,

630
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:49,700
I'm getting a hundred chain and I'm
going to be speaking at Nasa Goddard

631
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:53,120
tomorrow. So I'm excited
to see all of them. Yeah.

632
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,320
All right. Thank you. Hi. Um,

633
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,910
there's definitely like an element of
scale in your work and I think, uh,

634
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,590
also in how you're,

635
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:11,660
you're really amplifying the
message and um, you know,

636
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:15,080
this change, I think like you, you had
an image up there that was, you know,

637
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:16,940
some cracks and you're like,
that crack right there,

638
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:18,080
it could be a hundred feet across.

639
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:21,260
Like I'm curious about
how you think about scale,

640
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:25,550
like did your work start at
a smaller scale and um, yeah,

641
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:26,450
just more on that.

642
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,370
Yeah, I, I um, I consider it,

643
00:42:30,371 --> 00:42:35,371
I guess like my professional work began
in my last year in college and I was

644
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:39,440
working pretty big actually. I made a
couple of, um, eight foot, you know,

645
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:43,580
step six by eight foot pieces
for my senior show. And, um,

646
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,750
and I was drawing a really big, you
know, sky's storms, hurricanes, um,

647
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,560
from like whether photography and,
um,

648
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,270
so scale has always been important to me,

649
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:57,020
but especially after I got back from
that first trip to Antarctica and the

650
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,390
winter of 2015,
I was just like,

651
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,470
how can I do this landscape justice,
um,

652
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,120
without going as hugely massive
as possible, as you know, as,

653
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:12,110
as much as I can afford and
can do in my studio. Um,

654
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:17,530
because it's just so epic and it's
like you can use all these, you know,

655
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,660
grandiose words and it's like
nothing really describes it.

656
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,440
And that's why I'm trying to draw them
because I don't know how to put it into

657
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:26,180
words, but, um, so yeah,

658
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:30,140
I feel like the scale is really important
to make you feel like you're, you're,

659
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,710
you know, standing in front of a
glacier, you really, you need that scale.

660
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:37,010
It's so important. And so,
um, I do work, you know,

661
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,530
I make smaller pieces is
kind of more like studies,

662
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:43,790
but also just because there are so
much easier to transport and, and so,

663
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,650
um, but the, the, the larger ones
are really where my heart is.

664
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:50,720
I love to spend a whole
year working on one piece,

665
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,730
making it as large as I possibly can.
So if,

666
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:53,900
you know anyone that
wants to pay for that,

667
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,550
but yeah, it's one thing that
people tend to comment on.

668
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:05,180
So I'll just say something about it is
like there isn't a lot of the drawings or

669
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:05,601
most of them,

670
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:09,140
there isn't really a sense
of scale because I'm not
putting a little penguin in

671
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:13,940
there, a little boat. Um, and,
and I, I kinda, you know, I,

672
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,790
part of me wishes that there were
something I could put in there that didn't

673
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:21,590
seem cheesy like a penguin, um, that
would offer that sense of scale.

674
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:26,390
But, uh, on the flip side, I think it's
kind of Nice sometimes because there,

675
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,930
there are drawings that I showed
you in this presentation where, um,

676
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:34,680
like an iceberg was maybe as
big as the drawing itself. Um,

677
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,410
but people think it's like when people
ask me, they're like, how big is that?

678
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:40,440
Because it looks like a mountain range
to me. I'm like, oh, that's great.

679
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,310
It was this pig.

680
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,980
And I actually like when they think
it's like larger than than life. Um,

681
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,970
but I love especially drawing at like
a one one ratio as much as possible,

682
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,970
meaning the scope, the scale of the ice
was actually as big as I'm drawing it. Uh,

683
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,300
cause it just allows me to really get
into all the nitty gritty details and just

684
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:05,100
like show you show viewer is exactly what
the ice texture it looks like up close.

685
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,230
Thank you.
Yeah.

686
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,830
First I think Google should
pay for that gigantic

687
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,580
drawing somehow. I'll,
I'll, we'll email after.

688
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,280
Yeah. So, uh, I, I really
liked how you shared the sound
with us and it sound is it,

689
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,020
it seems like it's definitely, um, uh,

690
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,760
an attribute that will help
people get more embarrassed. Um,

691
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,800
and so I'm curious if you collaborating
also with people that can create VR

692
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:42,801
experiences or interactive experiences
and sort of like scale it in a different

693
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:47,040
way. I like you, you know,
uh, the topic and everything,

694
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:51,870
but you can probably share it yeah.
In different mediums as well.

695
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:52,590
Yeah,

696
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:57,500
it is definitely a direction that
I see myself going in especially,

697
00:45:57,501 --> 00:46:00,200
I mean, this exhibit
that's up right now, um,

698
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:02,270
is the first one where I've
shown that sounded piece,

699
00:46:02,271 --> 00:46:03,500
I played you as my first sound piece.

700
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:07,490
The video piece I was playing during
the Q and a is my first video and um,

701
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,930
the exhibit in Seattle right now,

702
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:12,890
I was really trying to create that
kind of immersive experience like you

703
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:15,890
mentioned because it just
allows you to feel like you're,

704
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:19,370
they're that much more and Vr
is like almost at this point,

705
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:22,610
like the ultimate of that.
And so, yes, I would,

706
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,360
I would really love to venture into
that arena. And, you know, I've,

707
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,300
I've been,
you know,

708
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:32,900
just starting conversations with people
and thinking about projects in the works,

709
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:37,310
but nothing is, is planned yet. But yeah,
definitely in direction I want to go in.

710
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,893
Okay.

711
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,650
I feel like everyone
here asked a question.

712
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,340
Thank you. Oh yeah. Really fast.

713
00:47:00,341 --> 00:47:03,680
And I feel a little bad at asking after a,

714
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,670
you've explained why the
scale is so important,

715
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:11,150
but can we purchase prince
anywhere and well, yeah, no,

716
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,160
that's a great sense.
Okay. Yeah. Right now.

717
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,960
So I'm art star.com sells.
My friends used to be [inaudible].

718
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:24,400
Now we also have, um, a new print that
just came out of that, that first slide,

719
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,140
if you,
I dunno if I want to pull it up there,

720
00:47:26,141 --> 00:47:30,100
but I'm the one that I first showed you
of me. Like I'm in the corner drawing it.

721
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:32,680
