1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,980
All right.
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:07,050
Thanks for joining during your
lunch break and over VC. Um,

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,920
I'm really excited to
introduce my research Rober.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,490
She's a Stanford professor and author
who is here to share some really great

5
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:18,250
tips on how to juggle your work
life and your home life. Um,

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,350
I'm going to jump right in because we're
a few minutes behind and she's going to

7
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:24,440
read an excerpt from one of her books
and go over some slides and answer any

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,550
questions that you may have.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,440
So myra is a labor economist
and the professor and at
the School of Education at

10
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:31,700
Stanford University.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,750
She is also the professor of economics
at the Graduate School of business at

12
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:36,890
Stanford University.

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,570
Her research and consulting
focus on gender issues at
the workplace and work and

14
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:46,400
family. She is the author of numerous
articles on occupational segregation,

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,510
women in the professions and management,
the economics of childcare,

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,570
feminist economics and
the teaching of economics.

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,140
She was the founding director of the
Michelle are Clayman Institute for Gender

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,470
Research at Stanford and she was also
the first chair of the National Council

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,010
for Research on women, a consortium
of US Centers for research on women,

20
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:10,310
which today has more than
100 members centers. Um,

21
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:14,010
over the year is Myra has consulted with
several corporations on improved that

22
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:17,840
utilization of women in management
and unwork family issues.

23
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,580
She has also been an expert witness in
cases involving the valuation of work in

24
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:26,300
the home,
sex discrimination and sexual harassment.

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,900
So with that I'll have you take it away.
Great.

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,720
Thank you.
Hello everyone.

27
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm going to start by
reading from my memoir,

28
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:39,681
which was published recently by MIT
press and it's called sharing the work.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,260
So I'm going to read from the
very beginning of the memoir.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Then I'll talk a little bit about how
partners can balance family and careers

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,730
and then we'll take questions

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,290
you'll be able to tell in just a minute.
When this takes place,

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,160
it's because you live in Palo Alto.

34
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:04,161
The chairman of Berkeley's Economics
Department tells me I can't have a regular

35
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:08,130
job here because I live in Palo Alto.
He nods.

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,940
Chairman break is tall with football
players shoulders and although I'm tall to

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,560
his massive frame towers over me,

38
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,290
he's the big shot in one of the most
prestigious economics departments in the

39
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,380
country.
I'm the assistant professor want to be.

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,840
If this meeting doesn't go well,

41
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,020
he could decide not to hire me for
next year under my jacket reveal of

42
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,350
perspiration, I'm making their way
down my dress for success blouse,

43
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,260
you have to live in Berkeley to be
on your tenure track again. He nods.

44
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,310
I'm baffled. I never
knew that. My husband,

45
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:51,840
Sam is a medical resident at Stanford
and works incredibly long hours.

46
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,160
Often he goes back to his lab late
at night to check on his experiments.

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,310
We have to live in Palo Alto.
Okay.

48
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:04,000
I say softly getting up to leave.
Thanks very much.

49
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,480
When I get to my office,
my hands are shaking.

50
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,130
I can hardly insert my key into the lock.
I feel drained,

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,570
disoriented. Did I take something out
of my freezer for tonight's dinner?

52
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,800
Lamb chops, hamburger,
I dial home, but Margie,

53
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:25,180
my babysitter doesn't pick up. She's
probably taken the kids out somewhere.

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,570
I leave my office and walk across
Sproul Plaza, surprisingly quiet.

55
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,180
After all the years of
student demonstrations,

56
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,340
it's 1970 and the Vietnam war
is beginning to wind down.

57
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,030
I slide into my full size blue Chevy
with a trunk large enough to hold both a

58
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:48,730
stroller and a carriage and
review my meeting with break.

59
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,000
I spend a lot of time
in big blue these days.

60
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,710
It's about an hour between Palo Alto in
Berkeley in the morning and longer in

61
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,950
the late afternoon and I do
the commute three days a week.

62
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,540
Gradually crawling and stop and go.
Traffic toward the bay bridge.

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,170
The absurdity of breaks.
Answer registers.

64
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,520
My first response is to cry.
I grew up around in my purse,

65
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:17,320
pull out some tissue and Dab at my eyes,
but now the road is blurry.

66
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,120
I switched my thoughts to my
children. Mommy, mommy, Jason.

67
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:27,121
My three year old will scream with delight
when he hears my key in the lock and

68
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,980
Liz 11 months will follow his lead.

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,890
She'll speed across the
living room on all fours,

70
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,830
tug on my leg and make joyful noises.

71
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,500
Suddenly the traffic starts to move.
I can never tell why the snarls dissolve,

72
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:45,070
but I'm always grateful as
I drive at normal speed,

73
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,510
my thoughts turned back to break,
but this time instead of tears,

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,750
I'm aware of growing anger at myself.

75
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,480
What's wrong with you? I scream inside
my head. You let him intimidate you.

76
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,550
You let him make you mute.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,060
You're a smart woman and you
let him make you look stupid.

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,990
Faculty don't have to live in
Berkeley to be on the tenure track.

79
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,080
He fed you pure bull and you bought it.

80
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,220
You want to know why you can't have
a tenure track job at Berkeley?

81
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,990
Look at what's real.

82
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,550
There are no women except Margaret and
the whole economics department faculty

83
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,500
and although she's been there for more
than 20 years, she's still a lecturer.

84
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,873
Wake up.

85
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,490
The difference between a lecturer and
an assistant professor is monumental.

86
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,980
Assistant professors have a regular job
with an opportunity for promotion and

87
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,000
lifetime tenure.

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,020
Lecturers on the other hand
are on a road to nowhere.

89
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,240
They are appointed from year to year,

90
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:50,260
generally only a few months before
they're teaching is to begin and have no

91
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:51,430
chance of advancing.

92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,470
I've worked too hard for too many
years to be content with second class

93
00:05:56,471 --> 00:06:00,170
citizenship.
I intend to get the real deal at Berkeley.

94
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,580
When I finally get onto the bay bridge,
my anger changes.

95
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,770
Now I'm furious with break dairy.
Tell me I have to live in Berkeley.

96
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,990
The radio was tuned to a talk station
and I registered Joe Carcione,

97
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,120
the popular green grocer instructing
the whole bay area about choosing

98
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:23,810
Pumpkin's. Ah, Halloween is coming.

99
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,020
Maybe I should revisit breaks,
office and costume.

100
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,950
Which skeleton?
Big Bird.

101
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,070
Surely some costume could
shake him out of his.

102
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,420
We all have to live in Berkeley routine
with my sheets,

103
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:42,830
skirt and matching man tailored jacket.
I'm wearing stockings and high heels.

104
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,810
The stockings feel sticky and the
shoes pinch every time I accelerate.

105
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,780
How I would love to kick off those shoes.

106
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,920
Whoever invented high heels definitely
didn't have driving in mind.

107
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm getting angry by the
second at the traffic,

108
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:04,001
which has snarled again at my gluey
stockings and to tide high heels and it my

109
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:08,490
own naive tay.
But most of all I'm angry at brake.

110
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Slowly I begin to understand what people
mean when they say their anger makes

111
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:18,530
them see red because of swelling.
Fury,

112
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,490
a deep scarlet anger now floods the car,

113
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,300
the steel frame and glass windows can't
contain it and it bursts onto the road

114
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:33,500
like a flaming oil slick,
a torrent sliding over the bridges,

115
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:36,350
girders and thundering across the bay.

116
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,590
As the lights of San Francisco began
to flicker against the darkening sky,

117
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,920
I feel a flicker of light within myself.

118
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,730
I become a feminist on the bay bridge.

119
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,190
So the followup to that story is

120
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,180
the morning afterwards I called breaks
office again and asked for another

121
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:04,080
appointment and his secretary
told me he was very busy.

122
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,580
It would be several weeks
before he could see me. So

123
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,880
I had a second meeting several weeks
later and I asked him the same question

124
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:15,714
again

125
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,600
and he asked me if I wanted him to
be frank and I said, yes, I did.

126
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,440
And basically he told me that they knew
that I had both a three year old and an

127
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:33,210
infant and that they didn't know
what was going to happen to me.

128
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,340
I said,
happened to me,

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,770
what do you think's going to happen to
me if you give me a position in six years

130
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:44,430
I'll come up for tenure and promotion
and we'll all see what happens to me.

131
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,900
He said, no. He said, I could
never sell that to the department.

132
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,250
Well, in the meantime,
having nothing to do with me,

133
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,940
the women faculty at Berkeley filed a
complaint with the Labor Department under

134
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:05,871
a new executive order and investigators
from the Labor Department came to

135
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:11,660
Berkeley and I thought to myself,
you're going to have to sell that to the,

136
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,600
to the department.

137
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,630
And I was right because after two years
I got an assistant professor offer from

138
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,220
Berkeley and if anybody ever tells you
that the law doesn't make a difference,

139
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,203
argue with them.

140
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,100
I also got an assistant professor
offer from the Stanford Business School

141
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,810
because although Stanford had not
had a complaint filed against them,

142
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,910
they were nervous that there might be one.
And so in 1972,

143
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,700
I was hired as the first
woman at the business school.

144
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,250
The first woman at the
law school was hired.

145
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,140
The first woman in engineering
was hired and on and on. So,

146
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:51,630
um, I, uh,

147
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,840
wound up teaching at
Stanford and not at Berkeley.

148
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,620
And I have had as one of my fields of
study all that time how partners can

149
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:06,600
balance family and careers.
Because as you see,

150
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,070
my experience at Berkeley was that they
didn't believe that I could possibly

151
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,750
balance a career, uh, at Berkeley
or presumably anywhere else.

152
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,630
Um,
and also have young children.

153
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,470
So what I wanna do now is talk about the
main issues that I see for people who

154
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:30,930
do want to balance two
careers, uh, and, and, uh,

155
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,510
a family too,
demanding careers and a family.

156
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,880
So let's take a look at these slides.

157
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,700
You can't have it all.
As an economist,

158
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,550
I'm always perplexed when
people ask me the question,

159
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:48,990
can you have it all kind of Mr into
tradeoffs? Nobody can have it all.

160
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,630
Something has to be traded off,

161
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,930
so you can have two demanding
careers and a family,

162
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,350
but something has to give.

163
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,070
Maybe it's no longer cooking five
gourmet meals a week or playing tennis or

164
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:11,940
exercising regularly or seeing
your friends as frequently,

165
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:15,090
but something is going to have to change.
However,

166
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,770
if two people are committed
to two careers and a family,

167
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,610
it's possible to achieve all of that if
they understand what they have to give

168
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:28,470
up in order to do that,

169
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,240
and if they're fully
committed to two careers,

170
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,060
what does it mean to be fully
committed to two careers?

171
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,780
It means that each spouse has to,
or partner,

172
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,420
has to be committed not
only to their own career,

173
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,550
but to the other career as well.

174
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,010
That's not easy and there are
challenges all along the way.

175
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,510
The most important career decision you're
going to make is not really a career

176
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:59,170
decision. It's about who you're
going to marry or partner with.

177
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,000
And if you're already married and,
uh, things are not working out well,

178
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,340
make sure you have a
conversation about this.

179
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,910
Make sure you understand what it's
about to be committed to two careers.

180
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,330
The first challenge is where are we going
to live and where are we going to work?

181
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,890
Um,

182
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,210
and the answer to these questions are
different for each couple because the

183
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,700
specifics are different.
So for example,

184
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,270
if one partner is much more
mobile than the other partner,

185
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,720
then that suggests that the couple should
locate where the person who needs more

186
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:41,380
mobility is,
uh,

187
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,560
should we take turns advancing our career?
You know,

188
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:49,510
should we move here and the first instance
for one career and then five years

189
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,880
later move, uh, for
another career move? Uh,

190
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,690
sometimes that works out well.
Sometimes it doesn't.

191
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,620
Sometimes if you keep switching
careers and nobody has priority,

192
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,530
then you wind up with two
careers that aren't working well.

193
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,130
So you have to really think about
these issues. They're tough.

194
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,750
Should we choose only locations
where both people can flourish?

195
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,910
Usually that works well. And usually
that means a fairly large area.

196
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,440
So you know, the bay area, Los
Angeles, New York, Chicago,

197
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,550
Atlanta,

198
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,550
places where both members of a
couple can find jobs and move up.

199
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,780
Should we have a commuter
marriage? That's tough. Uh,

200
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:36,781
the literature seems to suggest that
a commuter marriage works for a while.

201
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,530
If it's time limited,

202
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,180
if both people know that it's not
going to last forever. And of course,

203
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:47,170
if there are children involved,
then a commuter marriage is really tough.

204
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,910
How about dividing housework
and home management?

205
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,320
While you may be able to outsource
a good deal of housework,

206
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,900
but unless you're extremely rich,
uh,

207
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:03,120
you and your partner will
be managing your home. Um,

208
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,560
how will you divide the management work?

209
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,430
People often forget about the
management function. You know,

210
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,030
they decide who's going to cook and
who's going to clean up, but they forget,

211
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,440
you know, somebody has to be involved
in who's going to call the plumber.

212
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,520
But somebody has to know that a
plumber has to be called. Okay.

213
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,560
Somebody has to know that you have to
sign up the kids for camp before all the

214
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:30,460
slots are filled.
Those are all management functions.

215
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Are you going to be cozy CEOs or are
you going to divide up the function?

216
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,090
If you're going to be cozy Yos then you
have to have a lot of communication.

217
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,750
As is always the case when
there's more than one,

218
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,940
a CEO involved deciding
when and if to have a child.

219
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,580
Well from people always ask me when
is the best time to have a child?

220
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,740
The answer is that it's always the best
time and it's always the worst time.

221
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,820
Now, if you want a child, it's the
best time whenever you have a child.

222
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,530
But a child is likely to slow
your career to some degree.

223
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,310
And if you're both members of
the couple of sharing childcare,

224
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,570
then it may slow both careers.
So again,

225
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,220
this is a tough decision. How are
you going to care for your children?

226
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,800
Well, leaving the workforce
one, one member of the
couple leaving the workforce,

227
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,360
um, is one possibility.
Uh, and more and more, uh,

228
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,680
dads are leaving the workforce,
but that is a very costly decision.

229
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,860
The person who leaves the workforce,
uh,

230
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,100
generally loses a good deal of his or
her network unless they make a really

231
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,510
conscious effort to maintain that network.

232
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,900
Often their skills
depreciate unless again,

233
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,960
they make a very conscious effort
to keep those skills going.

234
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,730
And the literature shows that when
you come back, when women come back,

235
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,630
there's not enough men coming back
from childcare to, to study it yet,

236
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,670
but when women come back,

237
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,740
their earnings are permanently
lower by as much as 20%.

238
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,310
Now this could be because of the jobs
that they choose or because their new

239
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:16,940
bosses don't see them as good material
for promotion because they've taken time

240
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:19,430
out. But in any case, uh,

241
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,200
the combination of factors leads
to an earnings decrement. Also,

242
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:28,850
people lose insurance in case of divorce
because if you have to come back to the

243
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:33,200
workforce in case of divorce and you
haven't been in the workforce for a long

244
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:37,520
time, you're going to have a
lot of trouble getting back in

245
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,930
part time work is another
potential solution,

246
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,480
but often it's not a very good solution.

247
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,930
It can be the worst of all worlds because
often employers don't pay per hour.

248
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,140
What you would get if you had a
fulltime job. Benefits are often lower.

249
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,860
Uh, often employers don't
see people who work time,

250
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,890
part time as good
candidates for promotion.

251
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,660
And the other problem that people tell
me about all the time is that even though

252
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,810
they've negotiated a part time schedule,

253
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,000
they wind up working full time.

254
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,530
So now it is the worst of both worlds
because you're working full time but you

255
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:20,060
only have a part time salary.

256
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,630
So we are part time seems to work best
is when you've already been a full time

257
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:31,001
person and you negotiate for
part time in a limited way.

258
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,810
So you say, you know, I'm, I'm
coming back from having a child, um,

259
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,480
and I want to work part time
for the next six months.

260
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:42,740
Can we work that out so that,
that seems to be a good solution there.

261
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,990
Inform yourselves about
childcare options early.

262
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,940
Like when you know you're
going to have a child, uh,

263
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,410
because it's often difficult
to find good quality childcare.

264
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,270
And we know that good quality childcare
has been official to children.

265
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,170
Uh,

266
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:06,170
but not all childcare is good quality
and inform yourselves about what to look

267
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,120
for in terms of the quality of childcare.

268
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,370
Now people always talk about
balancing work and family,

269
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,940
but that could be not the ideal metaphor
because if you think of balance as,

270
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:26,580
you know, the scales of justice
with equality for most people,

271
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:30,780
work in family is not equal. You
know, for some work is higher,

272
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,590
but some families higher.
Um,

273
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,640
but it doesn't mean that the
balance has to be, you know,

274
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,370
equal.
Um,

275
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,930
I think the better notion
is the jar of life.

276
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,070
So figure out what things
in your life are the rocks,

277
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,510
what are the things I really should go
into that jar and put those things in

278
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:58,920
first.
So after the jars filled with rocks,

279
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,190
then the pebbles can all pebbles and the
sand can all fill in around the rocks.

280
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,790
But you know that you fit
in the most important stuff.

281
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,050
And I think in striving for balance,

282
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,470
it's probably fruitless to imagine that
you'll work in family life is going to

283
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:23,430
be in balance every day, every
week, maybe not even every month.

284
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:29,180
But what's important is that you both
continually work to move back into what

285
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:34,020
you decide is the right balance.

286
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,090
And I like to think about a
band of acceptibility. Okay,

287
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,500
so my work family is in
balance within this band.

288
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,580
And if I'm out here or
my family is out here,

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,290
then we agree that we got to get
back into our band of acceptability.

290
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,020
We've got to change
some things to get back.

291
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,390
So I liked that notion of work,
family balance rather than, uh,

292
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,040
the scales of equality. And
finally, let me just say that,

293
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,120
you know, work, family balance is
not just about you and your family.

294
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,980
Many of you are or will be in a
position to help other people,

295
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,010
to balance their work and family. And, uh,

296
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,550
when you make decisions
with your employees,

297
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:25,140
people who report to you about how they're
going to be able to balance work and

298
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,520
family, think about the
power that you have, uh,

299
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,860
to make their life more livable.

300
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:37,550
And also think about how we can jointly
put more flexibility into the entire

301
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:42,240
system.
As you probably know,

302
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,690
the United States is the
only industrialized country
without a paid leave for

303
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:51,690
maternity let alone paternity.
Uh,

304
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,570
we need to change that and
we have no childcare system.

305
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,200
The last time there was a bill in
Congress for a childcare system was 1971.

306
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,780
Nixon vetoed that bill and no
bill has come to Congress in sin.

307
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,420
So, uh, Hillary Clinton now has
a, a plan for a childcare system,

308
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,570
but it's been 45 years since congress
took up the notion of a childcare system

309
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:22,084
for the country.

310
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,360
So there's work to do obviously in your
own family and your workplace and in the

311
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:30,220
society as a whole.
Thank you.

312
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,360
I've always put about 30% on as the figure
for how much extra are family spends

313
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,890
that it wouldn't if one
parents stayed home full time.

314
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,480
And that's for house cleaning,
takeout,

315
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,660
guilt gifts for the kids.
Um,

316
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,820
is that an accurate figure? It
had. Do you got any stats on that?

317
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,500
I don't have stats on that,

318
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:09,010
but I think that as families
make decisions about
whether both parents should

319
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:13,570
work or not.
Um,

320
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,620
you don't want to make a decision
based on short run factors. So,

321
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,480
you know, what some people
do is they say, you know,

322
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,530
this is the salary that the second earner
could earn in the workplace and here's

323
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:32,010
what we have to pay for all the
factors you talked about childcare,

324
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,440
extra cleaning, takeout,
often an extra car.

325
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,310
Okay, so you know, does it pay?

326
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:45,430
Is My salary or the other person's salary
high enough to cover all those costs?

327
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,820
So I don't think that's a good way to
think about this because this is not a

328
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:56,210
short run issue.
This is a longterm issue.

329
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,520
And if you take into account
the decrease in salary,

330
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,200
that's going to take place when the
person who left the workforce comes back

331
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,010
then over a lifetime of,

332
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,980
well now lifetime but a work lifetime.
Um,

333
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,690
those childcare costs and guilt gifts.
And I love that.

334
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:22,610
Guilt gifts and extra cleaning and
whatever are going to be minimal.

335
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:28,570
It's really an economic investment to
pay for those things in order to keep a

336
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,670
person in the workforce,
keep those skills current,

337
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,680
keep those networks up and,
and get the income from the second person.

338
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,810
And also it's not a good idea
to think about, you know,

339
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,590
will the second person's salary cover
these expenses because really these are

340
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:55,880
family expenses and you don't want to
think about them as having the second

341
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:59,090
earner needing to cover those
expenses. You know, both,

342
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,530
both people are responsible.

343
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,900
Oh, I have a question. And uh,

344
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,080
around kind of the lean in
movement and having women who, uh,

345
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,600
you know, going on maternity leave,
coming back reporting into me,

346
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,960
everyone has different
experiences around it. Oh, for me,

347
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:19,290
I read the book of the very powerful time
when I had my first child and it kind

348
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,010
of inspired me to really come
back and come back full force.

349
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,380
But I have a lot of women who,
when we talk about it,

350
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,720
they feel that there's
almost double pressure.

351
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,700
So I've had a different experience.

352
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,940
I actually think the lean in movement
and all the research has been helpful in

353
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:35,850
my career on sticking with the workforce.

354
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,300
But there are people that report to me
that say it's put too much pressure on

355
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:42,720
them as women. I'm curious in your
research at Stanford and your engagement,

356
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,470
how you address it, and I know
it's not one size fits all right,

357
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:49,650
but ultimately how do you
respond to women that feel, God,

358
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:53,940
there's so much pressure to be amazing
moms to be fully full throttle into our

359
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:54,774
career as well.

360
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,010
So I think the point you make that
no one size fits all is the key.

361
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,660
And we have very interesting
discussions in my classes.

362
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,900
I teach a class at the Stanford business
school on work and family and 40% of

363
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:14,080
the students are men.

364
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,890
And some of them have had a fair amount
of work experience because they're back

365
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,400
for what used to be known at the
business school as the Sloan program.

366
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:24,910
Now it has some other name
ms x or something. Um,

367
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:30,090
and so a lot of those men are very proud
of the way in which they helped women

368
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,080
to handle, uh, coming back
to work after pregnancy.

369
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,360
And so they talk about what they did.

370
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,320
And invariably some woman
will raise her hand and say,

371
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,080
that's not what I want when I come back.

372
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,610
So your point that different
women want different things.

373
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,600
One woman will say, when I come
back, I want to be full force.

374
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,450
I don't want anybody
change my travel schedule.

375
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:02,410
I don't want anybody to change my,
uh, you know, number of meetings.

376
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,390
I want to be there full force.

377
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,530
And others will say what
some of your reports say, no,

378
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:12,790
I can't handle that right now.
I need to move over a little bit.

379
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,030
Uh,
take away some of my responsibilities.

380
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,510
And in a few years I'd like
to be able to move back.

381
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,970
That's the key. It used to be that
the so called Mommy track, you know,

382
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:27,850
tuck away responsibilities,
but then you were gone.

383
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,570
You were gone from the screen and
when you said you wanted to come back,

384
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:35,620
the answer was too bad for you.
You've missed the train, uh,

385
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,420
you can't get on that track anymore,

386
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,950
which is really a foolish way to think
about human resources and know you were

387
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:46,230
at for a few years. So now we're never
going to use your full force again. Uh,

388
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,260
but the manager really has to have a
conversation with the report to find out

389
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:57,960
what's what's desired. And the
second thing about that is, you know,

390
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:59,610
people can change their mind.

391
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,090
So you have that conversation before
the woman or even the man leaves for a

392
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,760
family leave and then they come back
and they have a different perception.

393
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,460
I mean,
so many things can happen.

394
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,000
They might have a child
with special needs. Well,

395
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:21,540
they didn't anticipate that when they
told you they wanted to come back full

396
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:26,541
force or they might find that their own
health is not as strong as they thought

397
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:30,930
it was going to be for whatever reason.
So yes,

398
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:34,230
it's good to have a conversation
before the person goes out on leave,

399
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,790
see what they're thinking.

400
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,200
But then the real key is to having a
conversation when they're ready to come

401
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,780
back.
And you know,

402
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:47,280
I think lean in is very important
because it says, you know,

403
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,001
try to do.

404
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:52,710
But I think Sheryl Sandberg's main
message is don't leave before you leave.

405
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:57,030
That's critical. You know, keep going
full force for as long as you can,

406
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:59,070
assuming your health is good.
Uh,

407
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,930
but I think that in a leaning
in is only part of the story.

408
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,180
I think that you need to have
employers who meet you halfway.

409
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,190
Otherwise,
I always tell my students,

410
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,740
if you keep leaning in and
nobody's there to meet you,

411
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,120
you're just going to fall over.
So that doesn't do anybody any good.

412
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,430
So yes,
you need to work hard,

413
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,760
but employers need to have
policies that meet people halfway.

414
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,640
I think that Deloitte has done a really
good job of trying to figure out how to

415
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:37,131
have lots of different paths after people
leave the workforce or come back part

416
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:42,730
time. Um, and then you know,

417
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,440
as they're ready to resume a full tilt,

418
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,750
then they're welcomed to do that.

419
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:53,700
I think that's really ideal is what
is a real world example of a band of

420
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:57,720
acceptability agreement a couple could
have in place in their relationship?

421
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
Well,
one,

422
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,940
one aspect of the band of acceptability
might have to do with how many nights a

423
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:09,690
week the family eats dinner together.
So,

424
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,310
you know, seven is one possibility,
but you might say, look,

425
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:17,490
it's fine if, um, you know,

426
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:22,200
one partner Mrs dinner with the family
one night a week and a second partner Mrs

427
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:23,220
dinner with the family.

428
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,450
So now the family is going to have
dinner five nights a week or maybe the

429
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:30,420
couple's going to go out for dinner
by themselves one night a week.

430
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,780
So now the family eats
together four nights a week.

431
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,670
When children get older,
that may be impossible.

432
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,940
Not because of the parents work scheduled
because of the kids' sports schedules.

433
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,880
No. So then you might say, okay,

434
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:51,090
every Sunday morning our family is going
to have a pancake breakfast together.

435
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,510
And that's, you know, nothing
can interfere with that.

436
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,280
So that would be a band of acceptability.
Or You could have,

437
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,060
um,
acceptibility rules about travel.

438
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,450
So how many nights a month is it
okay for one or the other partner,

439
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,960
uh, to be outside the city
in some other city? Okay.

440
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,860
Is it fine? Five nights a
week, four nights a week, um,

441
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:24,430
10 days a month,
whatever your family decides is right.

442
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,540
Then if things begin to move
toward more and more nights away,

443
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,240
you can sit down and say to one
another, wait a minute, look, this is,

444
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,280
this isn't what we said we wanted to do.
Something has to change here.

445
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,960
So that would be an example.

446
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,900
Um, it's common for working mothers
to be asked why they have children,

447
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:45,020
if their children will spend most of
their waking hours with someone else.

448
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:49,250
How do you think about the role of a
working parent and in particular how best

449
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:51,500
to measure your contribution
to your children?

450
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,290
If you can't win on quote unquote time,

451
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,860
although you may be away for
many of the child's waking hours,

452
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,570
you as a parent,

453
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:07,571
I'm going to be right there for other
of those working of those of the child's

454
00:31:08,091 --> 00:31:12,500
hours. Uh, certainly on the
weekends, in the evening,

455
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,460
in the early morning.
Um,

456
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,330
and I think parents have a tremendous
effect on their children. Uh,

457
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:24,200
even if their children are in childcare
or if they are raised by a third parent,

458
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:27,050
like a grandparent or a nanny.
Um,

459
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:32,530
one of the interesting ways to think about
this is when a child is cared for not

460
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,970
only by his or her parents,

461
00:31:37,971 --> 00:31:42,971
but also by another person and the
other person has a different accent.

462
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,420
The child picks up the parents accent.
So,

463
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,440
you know, over hundreds of years, uh,

464
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:59,441
English royal children were raised by
people who didn't necessarily have the

465
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:05,090
upper class English accent and somehow
or other those children figure out which

466
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,890
accent they're supposed to imitate.

467
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,720
And I think that's true
for not just language.

468
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,900
I think children know very
early who their parents are and,

469
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,650
um, the kind of love that they
get from those parents hopefully.

470
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:27,070
And there's a bond that isn't a created
by a nanny or child care worker or even

471
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:34,670
a grandparent. There's a different
kind of love with a grandparent.

472
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:40,060
So I think there's plenty of hours in
the week for to interact with their kids,

473
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,520
to show them they love
them. And, you know,

474
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:48,521
I'm just amazed all the time
by my students and former
students who talk about

475
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:54,290
ways in which they have created to
interact with their children even when

476
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:57,620
they're traveling. So now
we have Skype. I mean,

477
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:01,550
that's a phenomenal way to
be involved with your kids.

478
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:05,560
Before that we had phone
conversations. Um, so I,

479
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:10,610
I just think that children know who their
parents are and know the kind of love

480
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,490
that they get from those parents.
And you know,

481
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,520
also stu students tell me that when
they can't be at their child's a ballet

482
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:21,760
recital, they, uh,

483
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,100
have somebody there who videotapes it and
then they sit with the child and watch

484
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:28,990
the videotape and they say,
no,

485
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:32,660
that's even better than having been in
the audience because now we can stop the

486
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:35,690
tape. We can talk about what
the child was doing and feeling.

487
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,920
So I think with technology and with
a little bit of thinking about this

488
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,420
appearance can have very fruitful
relationships with their parents,

489
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,580
with their children,
even if they're working hard.

490
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,950
My question is about the body of
work available on this subject.

491
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,340
How much research is available
with children being the subjects.

492
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,310
There's a tremendous amount
of research available. Um,

493
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,840
my daughter in law,

494
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:08,610
Joanna Strober and a coauthor Sharon
mirrors have a book called, uh,

495
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,420
getting to 50, 50,
which was published. Um,

496
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,170
I think 2009 maybe.
Um,

497
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,550
and that has a review of the
research up to that time, uh,

498
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,580
from BF for beyond that really you
can go onto the internet and find a

499
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:29,220
tremendous amount of research
if you want to. You know,

500
00:34:29,221 --> 00:34:33,090
Google scholar is terrific
on this, uh, to find the,

501
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:37,230
the serious journal articles,
but also government publications.

502
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:40,680
There's just an enormous amount
of stuff out there. Too much.

503
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,910
It's hard to sift through it.

504
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,400
It's kind of gray area where men,
they're not leaning out,

505
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,760
it's not the primary caregiver,

506
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,700
but they are put potentially taking a
little bit of a valley and their career to

507
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:56,270
support potentially a woman,
their partner who's really full force.

508
00:34:56,271 --> 00:35:00,350
It could be a new job, it could
be a move. And just the way is,

509
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:04,700
as society evolved enough to accepted and,
and it comes from a personal example.

510
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:08,870
I've moved from New York for this
Google position. It's a very big job.

511
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,790
My husband's kind of leaning
in and supporting me and
he, he, it's interesting,

512
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:16,280
he shares with me, he's still
working. He's running his business,

513
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:21,110
but it's not the New York base and
a lot of parents in school and just,

514
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:24,710
he does more of the dropoffs kind
of always hint to him like, Hey,

515
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:27,290
when are you going to get back in
when you, and he's like, I'm in,

516
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,720
I'm just not in at 120% like Molina
is right now because Google's new,

517
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,563
it's intense.

518
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,860
It's interesting as gray area that
maybe people don't want to talk about.

519
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,010
And I'm curious if you see
when the men are kind of

520
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,910
supporting their wives,

521
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:41,610
but then society thinks that they've
completely leaned out. I Dunno.

522
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,363
It's just curious.

523
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:48,620
I think it's really tough for men who
are trying to make these changes because

524
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:53,900
they do get those kinds
of comments. Um, and they,

525
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,840
they have to be not only strong
in terms of their career,

526
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:00,930
they have to be strong and
facing all these other,

527
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:04,220
usually mothers who have all these,
uh,

528
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,430
words about what they should and
shouldn't be doing. And, you know,

529
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,440
I've often thought it'd be fun
to have a class for men who are,

530
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:19,830
as you say, uh, leading in
a, to support their wives,

531
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:25,190
to give them some comments that they
might offer in return for these negative

532
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:31,020
comments about, um, you know, when are
you going to get back in and so on. Um,

533
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,520
you know, I, I just think that
whenever you're a pioneer,

534
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:40,340
you have to face these societal norms,
uh,

535
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:45,210
that haven't changed yet. And in my
book, uh, sharing the work, you know,

536
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:46,350
I was a pioneer.

537
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:50,220
I was the first woman at the Stanford
Business School and the book is filled

538
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:55,200
with these kinds of discussions
about what I had to face.

539
00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:00,350
Now the pioneers are people like your
husband who are really bucking the trends,

540
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,160
um, and are saying, no,

541
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:09,720
my wife has gotten a great job at
Google and I'm going to support her.

542
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,650
And she's going all the way
and I'm still staying in,

543
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:17,280
but I'm doing more childcare
than I might've done otherwise.

544
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,670
And um, you know, I think you have to,

545
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,330
you have to be a pioneer
and you have to be strong.

546
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,640
Can you talk about challenges taking
care of aging parents and family members

547
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,690
and any nuances to what you've covered
with regard to partnering balance on this

548
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:35,321
top?
Sorry.

549
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:39,580
With regard to partnering slash balance
on this topic versus childcare balance?

550
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,700
That's a really important question.
Um,

551
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,300
I didn't have a section on elder
care in my work family course,

552
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:50,931
uh,

553
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:55,931
until maybe seven or eight years ago when
one of the men in my class did a paper

554
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:01,190
on elder care.
And at the bottom of his paper he said,

555
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:06,260
I think this topic should be in the
class. And I thought to myself, yes,

556
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:10,370
it's really should. And so since that
time we do have the topic in the class.

557
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,110
And in many ways elder care is
more challenging than childcare.

558
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,410
I mean,
even though children may be rebellious,

559
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,290
basically the parents are in charge,
you know,

560
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:25,700
the parents make the decisions and you
know, try to get the children to go along.

561
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,630
That's not true with elder care.

562
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:33,230
Adult children are not in charge
of their parents, adult children.

563
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:37,180
I have to wait for the appearance,
make decisions that they can support.

564
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,300
They can try to influence them.
But the parents are in charge.

565
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,500
The other thing is that,
you know, children grow up.

566
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,150
So childcare is only for a few years
and then they become teenagers,

567
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:51,460
which is a whole different story.
But you know,

568
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,290
then they stopped being teenagers and
they grew up more with elder care.

569
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,890
You don't know how long your
parent is going to need care.

570
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,220
Um,

571
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,870
you don't know whether the situation's
going to get better or more likely worse.

572
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,140
Um,
it's much less predictable.

573
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,830
They often don't live in the
same city where you live.

574
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:20,430
And the statistics seem to show that
more days are lost from work by adults

575
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,310
doing elder care.

576
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,610
Then childcare because childcare is
predictable so you can line up help,

577
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,360
but elder cares,

578
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:36,010
particularly if you have to go to another
state to take care of your parent is

579
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:36,970
not predictable.

580
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,620
And I think elder care is still not
talked about much in the workplace.

581
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,150
A lot of people don't want their manager
to know that they're involved in elder

582
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:50,380
care because they're spending a
lot of time at work doing this.

583
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,800
And so I believe this is the topic
for the future with regard to work,

584
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:59,920
family balance and you know if there's
an emergency with your parents,

585
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,300
there is no balance.
None at all. You know,

586
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:08,310
150% of your time and effort is involved
in trying to deal with this emergency.

587
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,770
And then you have to make
all the other arrangements,

588
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,240
especially if you're in the cell called
sandwich generation where you not only

589
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:18,820
have elder parents but
you have young children.

590
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,300
So then you're really running from one
to the other to try to get the balance

591
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,400
that you need.
Interestingly,

592
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:32,430
more and more studies show that men
are more involved in elder care.

593
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:38,100
So it used to be when wives or at home
and not in the workplace that they did

594
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:43,660
the elder care, not only for their parents
but also for their husbands parents.

595
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,150
But that's not so true anymore.

596
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:51,390
So more and more men are doing the
care for their own parents and um,

597
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,260
really stepping up to
that. So again, that's a,

598
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,510
that's a whole new sort of pioneering.

599
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,870
Can you give any guidance on the proper
timing and method to start speaking with

600
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:09,070
your manager about your decision
to start family planning?

601
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,030
So I think this idea of when you
should talk to your manager also,

602
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,190
uh, is very specific.
Um, they're very, this,

603
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:23,340
this specifics of the
situation are really important.

604
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:28,200
If you know that your manager
is going to be helpful,

605
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,820
um, and isn't going to say
to you something like, oh,

606
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,320
why you go and do that,
you could have had a great career,

607
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,890
then you might want to talk
to your manager early on.

608
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:44,270
If you think your manager is
not going to be supportive,

609
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,220
you might want to wait a little bit
more before you talk. But you know,

610
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:52,580
pregnancy has a way,
particularly for women of showing,

611
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,590
so your manager's going to find
out at some point or other,

612
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:02,950
and it's probably better if you talk to
your manager before he or she can see

613
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,290
that you're pregnant.
Um,

614
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,440
and so I think the best example I know
is a former student of mine who was in

615
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:16,370
strategic planning at a tech company.
This was years ago.

616
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,120
And she went into her
manager early on and said,

617
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,080
this is the plan.

618
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:29,500
This is the strategic
plan for my pregnancy and,

619
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:30,920
and, uh, childbirth.

620
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:36,220
So here is a flow chart and here's what
I'm going to be doing for the next six

621
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:37,340
months.

622
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,270
And then I want to take some time off and
I'm going to check in at each of these

623
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:45,890
points. And then after, you know, six
months, I'm coming back full time.

624
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,650
Um,
and she said,

625
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,160
you can't find anybody to do this job
better than I can given the strategic plan

626
00:42:55,911 --> 00:43:00,090
I just gave you. And he
sort of said, bless you.

627
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,530
Uh, so you know, if you say what you
want and how are you going to do it?

628
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,800
And you're confident and
of course everybody has to
understand that things might

629
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:15,920
not quite work out that way depending
on what happens. But you know,

630
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,930
you can say with 90% confidence perhaps
that this is what is going to happen.

631
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,190
Here's what we're going to do.

632
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,700
I was wondering if you could share some
of your suggestions for how to make that

633
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,880
dip in a career for,
you know,

634
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,920
a couple to young professionals with
let's say six relatively successful

635
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,450
[inaudible] when I took your class,

636
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:43,230
I remember when you talked to about
one suggestion which was hiring a night

637
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,480
nanny even though it's quite expensive,

638
00:43:45,481 --> 00:43:48,750
but there's actually quite
a lot of benefit of getting
a good night's sleep for

639
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:52,560
both partners and then having a more
productive day and the psychological.

640
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:55,650
So I was hoping to get a
refresher on things like that.

641
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,880
Well of course, you know, if you have, um,

642
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:06,480
a lot of money, then there are lots
of solutions like a night nanny.

643
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,333
Um,

644
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:14,280
if you are not in such a
great financial situation,

645
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,990
then of course you're more limited
and you have to be more creative.

646
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,570
When I see graduate students at Stanford
who by definition do not have a lot of

647
00:44:24,571 --> 00:44:28,260
money. Well unless their parents
have a tremendous amount of money,

648
00:44:28,261 --> 00:44:32,430
but they don't have a lot of money.
They use a co op method.

649
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,830
So they went when they want to go out
to a movie or they want to go out for

650
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:41,430
dinner a date night or something,
they probably won't go out for a movie.

651
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:45,340
But you know, for four out for
dinner, just the two of them. Um,

652
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:50,400
instead of hiring a babysitter, which
can cost you no more than the dinner,

653
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:54,630
um, they will trade off.
So they'll say, you know,

654
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:56,190
tonight we're going to go out for dinner.

655
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,100
You Watch both your children
and mine and then, you know,

656
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,160
tomorrow night you go and I'll watch you.
It,

657
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:07,370
I think there's lots of
ways of cooperating with
other people who also have

658
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:11,490
young children that work out
very well. Even, you know,

659
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:13,510
would you take my child,
uh,

660
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,560
for the afternoon so I can get a nap
if your child's not napping anymore,

661
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:23,760
otherwise try to nap when the job
maps in it. Good thing. But, um,

662
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:24,421
you know,

663
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:29,421
I think your question is wonderful because
it shows you that you have to think

664
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:33,660
creatively about how to do this.
You know,

665
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:37,980
it was easier in the old days where you
had lots of family living around you and

666
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:42,150
you could just drop your kid off for a
few hours with somebody in your family.

667
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,950
Now you have to arrange those kinds of,
of um,

668
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,440
new family arrangements with,

669
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:54,441
with people who are actually no friends
by choice rather than family members.

670
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,050
But truly if you,
if you have a lot of money,

671
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,110
I mean I know people who hire
more than one nanny, you know,

672
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,620
some nanny comes,
you know,

673
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:09,621
from eight to six and another
nanny comes from five to nine and,

674
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,820
and then if the child is a newborn
and not sleeping through the night,

675
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:16,260
they might hire a night nurse.

676
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:20,190
So all of those things are
possible for a very few people.

677
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,210
So this is sort of adding on to the
Koa question, but how important it is,

678
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,640
it is it to have a network of women,
not your job,

679
00:46:27,641 --> 00:46:30,960
but when she come back that are sort of
experiencing the same experiences as you

680
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:34,750
are? Well, I don't think
it's necessarily, um,

681
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,910
necessary to have it at your job. Uh, uh,

682
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:43,930
some women prefer to have a network of
women doing the same thing they're doing,

683
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:49,380
but at other companies so
that they can be, you know,

684
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:54,381
100% frank about what's going on and
not worry that somebody is at their own

685
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,040
workplace.

686
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,660
Other people like to have a
network at their workplace,

687
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:05,280
but no matter how you slice it,
a network is key.

688
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,590
I know when I was raising my kids,

689
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,940
there were very few
professional women and, uh,

690
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:17,030
my network consisted of my kids'
friends' mothers at their nursery school.

691
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,640
So they, they weren't professional women
at all, but they were so helpful to me,

692
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,390
uh, in, in so many ways. Um, no.

693
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:32,140
If my babysitter couldn't come
because she had a family emergency,

694
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,040
I would call one of them. And they
would take my children home with them,

695
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,800
you know, at lunchtime. And um, you,

696
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,830
you can't do this just by yourself.
And of course,

697
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:49,831
the luckiest thing is if you can get your
parents to move to near where you are

698
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,750
or you move back.
I mean,

699
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:57,751
I had a student who she and her husband
moved back to Shanghai because that's

700
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:02,500
where their parents were and they could
not imagine doing this kind of thing

701
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,260
without their parents help. So, you know,

702
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:09,700
the geographic location had nothing to
do with their two careers and had to do

703
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:13,030
with where their parents were.
Thank you so much. You're welcome.
