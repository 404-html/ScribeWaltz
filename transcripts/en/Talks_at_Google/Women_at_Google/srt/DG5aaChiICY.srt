1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello.
Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,550
Happy to be so great to have you here.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,940
Thank you very much for joining us.
Thank you for all of you.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,170
Thanks to everybody here who's
joining us on video on live stream,

5
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:25,440
or it's potentially watching this later.
Uh, we met, we met for the first time, uh,

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,230
at one of our camp events, uh,
in Italy if fire her. Remember

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,710
that's my kind of camp. I can tell you
that it was so fun. It was, it was,

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,080
it was amazing.
And we had,

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,500
there's so many interesting
discussions and, uh,

10
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:41,310
I think from that we had the idea of why
don't you, why don't we bring you here,

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,770
uh, and basically talk
about some of those real,

12
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:46,420
really insightful things a
little bit more in public, uh,

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,060
in as part of the Google public,
uh, within the Google family. Um,

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,910
but maybe just a little bit of an
introduction about who you are.

15
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:56,250
I think that most of the people here,
obviously a no,

16
00:00:56,251 --> 00:01:00,920
you have one of the most impressive
cvs that I frankly ever seen. Uh,

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,773
you are the,

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,350
yes. Yeah, that's actually a
worthwhile, that's worthwhile.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,040
Pause a, you're the president of
rel investments, uh, in Chicago. Um,

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,710
that's a big role. That's
a very, very big role. Um,

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,740
you are also a regular contributor and
analyst for CBS News and you're very

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,750
passionate advocate for financial
literacy and investor education.

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,530
You're sitting on the board of Estee
Lauder or you're sitting on the board of

24
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:29,730
star, uh, of Starbucks. Um, I
was just about to say star wars.

25
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,950
Okay.
So this is a,

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,853
you are,

27
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,990
that's actually a, that's actually
funny. Maybe German humor. So you are,

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,000
you are a obviously deeply involved and
the George Lucas Education Foundation,

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,350
a lot of,
lot of different things.

30
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:49,860
I could go on and on a Time magazine
voted you as being one of the most

31
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:54,300
influential people in the world. Uh,
congratulations. Um, uh, so it's a real,

32
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:57,110
really interesting, I was very
lucky to have you here. Uh,

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,100
but let's get going right away.
Let's start.

34
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,300
The first one is obviously a
top off mind for all of us.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,100
You've heard me talk about it
quite a bit or leadership team. Uh,

36
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,010
I have to address it.
The US presidential election.

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,790
How do we move forward from here?
Well,

38
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,740
I think two people that I admire very
much. I have said it very well. So one,

39
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:23,060
President Obama and Hillary Clinton,
um,

40
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,180
I think we're both very elegant and
eloquent in their statements after the

41
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,010
election that the people have spoken.

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,020
We have a democracy and we all have
to respect the outcome of a democracy.

43
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,050
This is how the system works despite
if the end result is one that makes you

44
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,270
excited and happy or one that
doesn't it. Um, I think that's sad.

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,850
Clearly there are some tremendous,
uh,

46
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,410
dissension and a d there was tremendous
division in this country right now that

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,100
it's hard to mess. It's particularly
hard to miss when you're a woman,

48
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,200
a person of color, a
Muslim and immigrants. Um,

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,010
we are in a new day for us.

50
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:10,510
Some people are calling it civil rights
2.0 and while I respect the decision,

51
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:14,890
I do and I hope with everything
in my heart for the best,

52
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,590
um, I think we have to, um,

53
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,750
recognize that we all have a role in
making this better no matter what side you

54
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,584
were on.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,360
And recognize the troubles that
exist in our country right now.

56
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,330
It's just factual.
This is not speculation.

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,230
And that's everything from protesters
who are exercising their first amendment

58
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,160
rights to free speech to um,

59
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,080
what we've seen in terms of some
of the things happening. Um,

60
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,400
in terms of cabinet picks on the,

61
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,870
like this is the process and together
we're going to have to come up with a

62
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:47,681
better solution.

63
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:51,370
And I'm not saying that with rose colored
glasses and not trying to buy the pie

64
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:55,660
in the sky about it. Um, I think
America is best when we're at our worst.

65
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,240
And so I'm hoping this
will be one of our moments.

66
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,650
So we obviously have to respect,

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,640
you said that a democratic process and
we have to respect that there are many

68
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:08,090
people who obviously, uh,
exercise their political choice,

69
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:11,090
their freedom to do that. And, and,
and in a sense of full inclusion,

70
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:14,000
we obviously do this and we
do this at Google as well,

71
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,660
but what would you say to the people who,
for the good reasons you mentioned,

72
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,670
are actually really
concerned at the moment?

73
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,160
Like what would you say specifically?

74
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,790
It's been what I've been telling
myself. So, um, I was very sad.

75
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,880
I mean last week we had the 30th
anniversary of our mutual fund,

76
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,690
the day after the election, we
were like, what is wrong with us,

77
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:37,130
right that we picked this day. So we had
all the press coming in and everything.

78
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,000
We had all of these,

79
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:41,300
we had hundreds of people that were
coming to Chicago for this event.

80
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,080
And all morning I'm sitting at
my desk weeping, you know, like,

81
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:49,550
pull yourself together, pull yourself
together. And I wasn't weeping for myself.

82
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:53,450
I was weeping for stories that I was
being told to have. One of our, uh,

83
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:54,231
women in our firm,

84
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:58,740
her sister was a teacher in an inner
city school in Chicago and she said the

85
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,840
kids were going up to eight year old
kids saying like eight year old Hispanic

86
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:07,160
kid sang. So I guess you have to move. And
my heart was so sad. I mean, it's still,

87
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:11,540
I can barely speak those words without,
you know, feeling, feeling awful. Um,

88
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:11,961
and I thought,

89
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:15,620
what would it be like to be eight years
old and feel that level of insecurity?

90
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:16,970
I have felt that before.

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,390
And so knowing that level of insecurity
would exist for a child and how that

92
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:22,400
destabilizes you and how it leaves a mark.

93
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,560
That was something that
really affected me.

94
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,590
But what someone said to me
that completely forced me
to snap out of it is many

95
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:36,800
of us, not just people of Color,
black, Hispanic, Muslim, Jewish.

96
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,790
We can go through all, you know,
Italian immigrants, Irish immigrants,

97
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,000
we can go through everything when
it comes to America, our answers,

98
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,810
ancestors dealt with much worse with less.
Yeah,

99
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,670
that much less than we come at these
problems with. And when they were dealt,

100
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,530
you know, horrible blows.
They got up and so said,

101
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,460
our goal right now, we must get up. This
is not a time to wallow and be overly,

102
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,260
overly emotional. This is a time
to recognize what is at hand.

103
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,310
This is a time for us all to stand
for what we believe in. And I, I, I,

104
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,520
I respect the other rat other sides,
right? To believe in that too.

105
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,010
And hopefully to find, that's my
mentor. Bill Bradley would say,

106
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:23,930
you're better angels that we can find
our better selves in this situation. And,

107
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
and I really do believe that with us
all taking that stand and being vocal

108
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,710
around the core values of America,
a country built on inclusion.

109
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:37,640
I went back and read,
I have the constitution and my purse.

110
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,810
I know that sounds really, I was
reading it on a flight. I was like,

111
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,710
I just want to go back. And someone gave
me a little copy of the constitution.

112
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,940
I found it and I said, I need to reread
it to remember what we stand for.

113
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:53,450
Then I went and looked up the statue of
Liberty or liberty, giving your, you know,

114
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:57,350
your poor, your huddled masses, et
cetera. When you read these words,

115
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,360
you know what America is all about.

116
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,460
And I am just confident that even
those of us who may have voted,

117
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,560
um, with Donald Trump, president
elect Trump and I again,

118
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,880
I respect the office.
Um,

119
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,900
I hope that they will understand what,

120
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,370
what is that risk in
terms of what America is?

121
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,330
Yeah. It's, um, it's a touching or
your tired, your huddled masses.

122
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,340
Look, I were fully respectful if
everybody who was voted the other way. Um,

123
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,000
obviously, uh, I mean, I had this
mentioned the story with your kid.

124
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:36,990
I had my four year old walk up to me and
he knows that he's the only American in

125
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:41,760
the family. And he basically said, well,
I'm the only American in the family. Uh,

126
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,210
it seems like you have to leave. I will
still miss you. And he was crying. Yeah.

127
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,100
But he was, but he was, but he was crying
and shaking when he said that. Right. And,

128
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,110
and, um, like just, it even happens
to, to like somebody like me,

129
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,800
although, yeah. So, um,

130
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,791
and I think,
you know,

131
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:02,990
there are moments and society has those
moments over and over again. You know,

132
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:07,100
Rahm Emanuel, my mayor from Chicago is
very famous for that line. You know,

133
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:10,580
you can't let a crisis go to waste.
You know,

134
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:13,550
a crisis becomes an opportunity
and we have to use this crisis.

135
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,210
I think we could come out of
this better, stronger, faster,

136
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,220
something like we've never been before.

137
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,540
I think it will unite people in ways that
we have never been United as we stand

138
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,340
up for Truth and justice.
And I mean truth when I, I'm,

139
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:30,860
I'm so happy to read and see all the
things that are coming out of silicon

140
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:34,670
valley right now about making sure
fake news doesn't exist and making sure

141
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,350
untruths can't be perpetuated
to become truths. Now.

142
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,630
The thing that I think the
challenge for all of us right now,

143
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,300
and I do think it happened a
little bit in the election,

144
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,470
we can't normalize and justice, you
know, that's what I'm worried about.

145
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,900
We can't become so numb to these issues,

146
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,380
seeing hate seeing these moments
that you just sort of walk them off.

147
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,190
And we're seeing early instances of this
with some of the hate crimes rising and

148
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,690
aggression rising and bullying rising a
little bit. And so, so although there,

149
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,720
there have been clear statements that
people should stop doing that. Right. But,

150
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,540
but still, yeah. Well, you know,
I hope from war. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

151
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,360
Um, okay. Let's hope for
more. Let's talk about, uh,

152
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,660
but we all have to do our
part. You know, we have a role.

153
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:22,280
We are not bystanders anymore. Yes. So,
you know, we all have voices. Absolutely.

154
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,580
You all are best at it.

155
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,030
Yes. Uh, yes. Um,

156
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,180
let's move on to another
super important subject.

157
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:35,210
And when you have referred to the
subject of race as a conversational third

158
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,330
rail,
could you explain that a little bit more?

159
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,210
Yeah. What do you know what I mean by that
is in a lot of conversations when race

160
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:46,420
comes up, it's one of those
things that is like you, you know,

161
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:49,990
you've stepped on the electric rail
on the train car and did their shock,

162
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,910
you know,
and there's this sense of,

163
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,710
of it's a taboo subject even in this
day and time where we see race so

164
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:59,110
prominently figured into our headlines.

165
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:04,000
It's still this very
uncomfortable conversation. And,

166
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,930
um, I'm asking people to actually
embrace the uncomfortable,

167
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,280
to become comfortable with
the uncomfortable and to
be willing to step on this

168
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,860
third rail in conversation
and everyday life.

169
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,080
And I think to the extent that we do that,

170
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,860
we will find new ways to
understand each other.

171
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,540
And I think that it will
lead to heightened levels
of tolerance and inclusion.

172
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,420
And so even though it is the third rail,

173
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:30,790
there's certain things we'll all
taught not to talk about. You know,

174
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,610
you don't talk about money,
you don't talk about religion,

175
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,880
you don't talk about race.
These are things that when
you're growing up, you know,

176
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:38,920
there can be fighting words there.

177
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,160
I'm saying not talking about it has
somewhat put us into the situation that

178
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:48,400
we're in and we have to
actually, uh, subject matter
that I'm talking a lot about.

179
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:52,870
Also be brave. We have to be brave
and go there on this subject.

180
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,801
And in going there,

181
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:58,540
I think it will lead to great moments
of enlightenment just like now and both

182
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,590
sides. They help us. Can
you give us a side? Okay.

183
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,540
Yeah.
Give us a few examples from your own life.

184
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean we talked about this quite
a bit. I know you, you, you,

185
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,030
you've really helped me understand a
lot deeper and they're things that just

186
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:13,530
have happened to you and that are part
of your life that are, are, are very,

187
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:18,480
very hard to understand. Uh, especially
for non black people. So, so, so,

188
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,000
oh,

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,370
the one I led in my ted talk that I just
have to give because it's the one it's

190
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:25,310
so easy,
is Harold Board,

191
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,590
who was a congressman in Tennessee,

192
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:32,591
was running for us Senate at a time when
obviously the Senate and still is not

193
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:36,200
very diverse, the a hundred senators
we have. And so he called me one day,

194
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:39,350
we're contemporaries were peers and he
said, I need to get some national press.

195
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:40,184
Can you help me?

196
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,060
So I had a friend who was vice chairman
of one of the largest media firms in the

197
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,040
world. Yes. And I called
her and I asked her if, um,

198
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,050
she might have some ideas for Harold
and what we can do when she said,

199
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,630
let me host a editorial board
for you with all of our people.

200
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,440
And she's like, it doesn't get better
than this. So we were, and she said,

201
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:02,500
you come with him because you're from
the business world and you give them a

202
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,990
different kind of credibility
than just pure politics,

203
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,890
even though Harold is phenomenal, you
know, and impressive in every way.

204
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,730
So Harold and I meet in New York, we'd
get to this building. We're so excited.

205
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,320
We literally,
I told this story many times,

206
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:17,530
I'm literally wearing like my
best suit and you know, he,

207
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,540
we looked like starched and pressed and
we get there and we walk in and we get

208
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:26,410
to the receptionist and the receptionist,
we get to the floor and she tells us,

209
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:29,410
follow us, you know, we said, we're
here for the lunch, we follow her,

210
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:31,450
we follow her through all these corridors,
et cetera.

211
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,690
And we finally end up in this room
and it's just completely blank.

212
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,750
And she looks at us and she said,
where are your uniforms?

213
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,600
And we were like,
and she thought we were the waiters.

214
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,340
And so we said, we're here
for the lunch. He's the gas.

215
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,280
And the person who was hosting us runs
into the room because we've obviously

216
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:57,550
been announced that were there and she
realizes we're not where we should be.

217
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,500
And literally as I explained this, the,
the white drains from her face, I mean,

218
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:06,550
literally all the color Janes from her
face. And she looks at me and she's,

219
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,880
you know, at a loss for words.
And I joke back with her, I said,

220
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,750
don't you think we need more
than one black US senator?
It doesn't this prove it.

221
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,890
Yes. You know, that this person
can't even see us in another way.

222
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:19,930
And interestingly,
if you watch that Ted talk,

223
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,610
I'm wearing a black and white dress,
white color, black dress, white cuffs,

224
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,170
and I called it my uniform. Yes.
Now it happens to be Valentino. But

225
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,600
the idea was to, you know,
really sort of say, how is it,

226
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:39,601
do we get so stereotyped where you
can't see beyond that story is one of

227
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,060
hundreds that people like making share.

228
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:47,050
It's all the time meetings where
someone won't make eye contact with me,

229
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,400
you know, a plane rides. We just
had something very recently,

230
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:54,220
I was on a private plane and the,
um,

231
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,230
the person on the ramp kept saying, you
know, ma'am, your catering is not here.

232
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,270
And I said, okay. You know, it was like,
all right. And he said, um, you know,

233
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,160
you need to go and get your catering right
now from the, you know, the building.

234
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,140
And it was like, uh, she does
that, you know, like talking,

235
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,750
finding to the flight attendant.
And he's like, no ma'am,

236
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,410
you're not listening to me.
You're catering is not hearing.

237
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,510
You need to go and get it.
So the pilots now come out,

238
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,530
the flight attendant comes
out and literally I'm the
only black person amongst

239
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,660
the four.
And I'm like,

240
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,440
they do that. I don't, and he looks
at me with such disbelief, you know,

241
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,490
it's like, well, you can't be the person
on this plane. It's just not possible.

242
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,390
And I, you know, we all sit there and
there was nothing to say, you know,

243
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:47,560
it wasn't his, his, it wasn't,
I wasn't angry with them.

244
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:52,190
I just was, why couldn't it be
me? How, how does it make you

245
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,690
feel over time?

246
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,920
I had quite a few discussions with
our black cougar a network and,

247
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,260
and they told me the stories about,
uh,

248
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,810
being singled out more frequently as
part of the normal security controls when

249
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:06,290
people are coming in. Right. I mean at a
higher likelihood if you're a black, uh,

250
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,490
you were being asked, can I please, can
you please show your your badge. Um,

251
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,860
I heard from them the second they
leave the Google environment,

252
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,150
the hopefully slightly safer,
uh, environment in that context.

253
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:21,650
The probability of them being stopped
by a cop and even feeding aggression and

254
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:25,480
being afraid to significantly higher
than for any, any non Black Cobra.

255
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,240
So they taught,

256
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,180
they taught me the word
[inaudible] [inaudible] which
is a term I wasn't really

257
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:31,110
familiar with before off microaggressions.

258
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,710
And I'm a hoe wears you down
and hotel like over time.

259
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,510
How do you feel? Like how does
it, what do you think it can do?

260
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,550
What does it do for you? How, what
you found to protect yourself.

261
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:46,320
Why like help help me understand
the emotions behind that.

262
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,990
So the emotions are very clear. One, and
I've explained this to people for years.

263
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,590
Black kids are taught this
is going to happen to us.

264
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,000
We are taught this when we're very young.
When I was seven years old,

265
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,730
my mother explained to me that
everyone would not treat me well.

266
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,520
Seven now that was also at
the same time she told me that

267
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,930
crossing the, the, the non black we are,
it's really important that you're taught,

268
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,440
you're being taught and,
and everybody is being,

269
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,350
we were taught how to deal with police.

270
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,510
We're taught to how to deal
with people of authority.

271
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,480
We're taught this and that
goes back for generations.

272
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:22,900
I mean obviously you had black kids who
were told never look a white person in

273
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:25,180
the eye in during slave times.

274
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,410
So Emmett till died because he supposedly
whistled at a white woman. You know,

275
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,210
I don't know if it's true or not. So
that goes back into our history. We are,

276
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,480
we are armed for what we
are going to deal with.

277
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,610
And I mean that in the best of ways.

278
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:44,380
I appreciate our parents and mothers and
fathers for doing that for us because

279
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:48,760
there is no surprise there isn't.
So in terms of micro aggressions,

280
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:52,330
we know there will exist because we're
told very early and we've seen them,

281
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,380
we've seen how our parents have been
treated. That then becomes not to be,

282
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,740
you know, defeated by it. So when you
said, how does it affect me emotionally,

283
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:02,320
et Cetera,
I actually become stronger.

284
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,200
I become more clear about
my place in the world.

285
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,040
I become more certain about
what role I must serve.

286
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:13,330
I become more emphatic about being brave
myself on top of it's like this about

287
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:13,700
race.
Yeah.

288
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,670
What helped you? Who
helped you? How, how, how,

289
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,120
how do you manage to turn this
negative energy, this, this tension,

290
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:23,900
this additional layer of stress on
a black person's life into this?

291
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,620
I definitely, I guess I'm one of these
people, you know, partly glass half full,

292
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:32,850
not being, you know, a rose colored
glasses as I said before, but just like,

293
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,760
how can I use this to my advantage?
So I'll give you one example.

294
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:36,511
In the investment business,

295
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,740
there aren't a ton of black women
in the investment business. Uh,

296
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,760
there are few.

297
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,350
I probably am the only black woman
chair by mutual fund board in the United

298
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,400
States,
only one.

299
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,980
There are thousands and they're more
than mutual than there are stocks in the

300
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,060
New York Stock Exchange.

301
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,900
So I remember going to lots of investment
conferences when I first started

302
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:57,720
working at air wheel and I would go to
investment conferences and people would

303
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:00,600
come up to me and they're like,
you're a melody. And I was like,

304
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,310
how do they know my main? And then it
very calm, very clear to me. I was like,

305
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,690
I'm the only black person here and
there'd be hundreds of people in the room.

306
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:10,524
So I was like,

307
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,100
I'm melody like Beyonce
or share one word person.

308
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,010
Like I don't even need a last name.
And I was like,

309
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,650
I am using those to my advantage.

310
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,400
So it's like instead of seeing it,
it's like I'm the only one here.

311
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:30,420
It's like I can stand out in such a
big way and then feel like I'm melody.

312
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:34,120
I'm like, yes with two
L's, you know, you know.

313
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,850
So owning it now I want more people in
that room who looked like me and I'm

314
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,650
working really hard to make that happen,

315
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,740
but I'm not going into that
room afraid or defeated. No,

316
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:46,620
I don't also need swagger. As
someone said to me once, they said,

317
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,850
they said this about me and I thought it
was an interesting comment. They said,

318
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:54,330
you're not threatened and you're
nonthreatening. And I was like,

319
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,870
that's a fine balance because
a lot of times, you know,

320
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,830
you have to come on really
big in order to, you know,

321
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,210
feel secure or you're,

322
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,270
you make yourself really
small in order to fit in.

323
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,290
And I've tried not to do either of those,
but when I've been in those situations,

324
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,040
I just said, okay, here's the situation.
What am I going to do about it?

325
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,360
And it can serve me very, very well. No,

326
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:23,361
I don't believe in standing
on some platform being
excited about being first and

327
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:27,150
only, I don't think that's a good
thing, you know, in our community,

328
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,510
in minority communities first and only
is something that people brag about,

329
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,380
you know, and they want to be first and
only for a long time. I'm not that way.

330
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:38,970
I want to be first of many,
at the very least. But, um,

331
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,540
you know, I think that instead of being
defeated by you have to ask yourself,

332
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,030
you know, for the same time, which
my mother did something genius.

333
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,120
On the one hand she told me what
to expect. On the other hand,

334
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:52,080
she told me you can be anything.
And I believed her.

335
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,300
She was like,
this is going to happen too.

336
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:58,500
I remember going home when I was in
second grade and I told my mother I had

337
00:19:58,501 --> 00:19:58,981
first grade,

338
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:03,150
I had this teacher that I just did not
like and she did not like me and I really,

339
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,890
I was like sick going to school.

340
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:08,700
I couldn't stand it and it was
chaotic and she wasn't nice to me.

341
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:10,200
And I remember saying to my mother,
I said,

342
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,680
my teacher is not being nice to me
and I think it's because I'm black.

343
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:17,580
While I was the only black girl in the
class and my mother looked at me and she

344
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:19,500
says,
I never want to hear that from you again.

345
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:25,140
Ever get over it.
Life is not fair.

346
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,940
There was no, Oh, let me go to the
school and shake it up. Let me do this.

347
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:33,510
That near there. It was like, get
over it. I was in first grade,

348
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,650
so on the one hand, you know, she was
making that clear, but she was like,

349
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:42,000
you can't use this as an excuse.
Step over it, step over it,

350
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:46,410
find another way. But you can't
come and complain to me about this,

351
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,780
the world not being fair,
because that is the world that we live in.

352
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,790
And that's a fantastic message to,
in some ways it's,

353
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,410
it's very, very pragmatic and
probably more unvarnished truth.

354
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:02,240
And you maybe you should give a
five or six or seven year old. Yeah.

355
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:06,010
But at the same time it's
also inspirational and
saying nothing's holding you

356
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:10,330
back, but you, you know, your mind can be
the one to hold you back on this issue.

357
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,270
Yeah. Proof or wrong.
Get the answers right.

358
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,150
You, I have a quote here
that I heard from you, uh,

359
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,300
be unapologetically black
and unapologetically

360
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,280
a woman. It's not an original idea,
so I'll have to tell you that. Yeah.

361
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,380
I learned it from, uh, John Johnson,

362
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,410
who was the founder of
Ebony and jet magazines.

363
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,580
One of the most successful American
entrepreneurs of all time, his funeral.

364
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,330
So were at his funeral in
Rockefeller Chapel in Chicago.

365
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,710
Literally thousands of people
literally does, you know,

366
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,270
probably two dozen eulogies.

367
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,970
And it was one of those things where
you sat down and you see the list of all

368
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:52,000
the Lila gs and you're like, oh my God,
this is going to be a really long morning.

369
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,380
But every eulogy is better than the next
one. And it's like President Clinton,

370
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,300
it's, you know, just the most
amazing people. So he has,

371
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,340
um,
Tom Joiner,

372
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,970
who's a very famous disc jockey in the
black community called the fly jack

373
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:10,360
because he used to fly every
single day to do two shows,

374
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:15,130
one in Dallas and one in Chicago
every day for years. So Tom Joiner,

375
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,350
who's very,
very well known in my community,

376
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,070
got up and did the eulogy and he used
to work for John Johnson at his radio

377
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:23,980
station called Wj PC
Johnson publishing company.

378
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,470
And Tom Joyner said John Johnson was
unapologetically black. And I literally,

379
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,730
it was like someone threw cold
water on me. Like I was like,

380
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,920
this idea is profound. I know it
doesn't maybe seem that way to you.

381
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,980
And I was like unapologetically
black and I said,

382
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,840
imagine being unapologetically back.
I immediately thought about it and I said,

383
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,550
that's exactly what I want to be.

384
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,270
I want to be unapologetic genetically
black and I want to be unapologetically a

385
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:56,380
woman because I find even though I had
this mother to told me I can be anything,

386
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,460
there are times I'm apologizing for
who I am in the smallest of ways.

387
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,960
So I'll give you a little example.

388
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,260
I was at an investment conference
speaking to another woman,

389
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,050
my business partner who started aerial,

390
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:10,120
John Rogers walked up to the conversation.

391
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,660
The woman and I were talking and we were
literally talking about close 100% and

392
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:17,021
some dress.

393
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,690
I was wearing something she was wearing
and we were going back and forth about

394
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:23,290
how we loved it, et Cetera. He walks up,
we're still talking about it and she says,

395
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,110
Oh, I'm so sorry this topic
subject must really bore you.

396
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,080
We can talk about something
else. And I said, no. I said,

397
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,490
how many times have we walked up?

398
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:33,670
Two guys talking about like the
hockey game from last night.

399
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,260
They didn't apologize to us about talking
about the hockey game or something we

400
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:42,220
totally weren't interested in.
Yeah. And we sat there and you know,

401
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,800
they went on with their conversation.
We waited until they were done.

402
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:48,920
Why are we apologizing to him? And
he's like, wow, melody. Okay. You know,

403
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:51,980
it's just a little strong.
But it was the exact point.

404
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:55,550
It's like this idea of apologizing.
I remember I went to a board meeting once.

405
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,690
This one's small, I swim.
One of the things I do,

406
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,840
so went to go go swimming
before this meeting,

407
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,730
not one of the boards I'm on
where we were representing. Um,

408
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,590
we were pitching business
for Ariel and I walk in,

409
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:12,700
my hair is slicked and one of the
people looks at me and they said,

410
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:17,240
what happened to our girl? And I started
into this thing where I was like, oh,

411
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:20,420
I went swimming this morning and
this, that. I'm like, wait a minute,

412
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,500
you're wearing Nike's and uh,
you know,

413
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,230
a sweatshirt and Khakis with stains.

414
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,210
Why am I apologizing to you right
now about coming in with flip tear?

415
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:34,850
I know that may sound really small,

416
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,320
but we see it sort of time and time again
that it shows up in our lives and we

417
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:43,160
have to remind ourselves
they're not apologizing.

418
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,310
They were showing up as who they
are owning and an embracing it.

419
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,130
And so when I heard that comment
about John Johnson, I was like,

420
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:52,580
it was life changing for me. And
I said, that's what I want to be.

421
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,960
I said that to Cheryl. And
Cheryl says in, in lean in,

422
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,200
and one of the opening statements,
my friend Melody said this to me,

423
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,310
looks at Facebook. Yes, you know her. Um,

424
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,170
but it's just, you know, it had
a follow on effect. And so again,

425
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,110
I can't take credit for it, but I can
take credit for embracing it and saying,

426
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:16,010
I'm taking that message out into
the world because that's a big idea.

427
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:21,190
So you take an amazingly important message
all to the world openly talking about

428
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:23,620
race,
openly talking about diversity.

429
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,500
There is a better business angle to this.

430
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:29,650
I'm the business representative in a way
of Google and actually deeply believe

431
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:32,620
in this. But I'd love to hear an and
my teams. I've heard from me many,

432
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:33,760
many times about it.
Why?

433
00:25:33,761 --> 00:25:37,970
Why do you think that diversity actually
matters from a pure business person?

434
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,700
And that's the thing.
This is not the people of Color's problem.

435
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,700
This is everyone's problem because this
is about enlightened self interest.

436
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,730
This is you're your own best opportunity
is leverage through having someone like

437
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:55,220
me and others like me around you.
For this reason,

438
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,000
there's a book that I love called the
difference by Scott Paige Scott Pages at

439
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:03,050
the University of Michigan and he wrote
a mathematical formula for diversity.

440
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,720
And his point,
which again I talk about in my ted talk,

441
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:10,100
is that if you are trying to
solve a really hard problem hard,

442
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,350
you want diversity of thought,

443
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,280
diversity of experiences and
diversity of intellect in that room.

444
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,650
The example that he gives is the,
the um,

445
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,010
smallpox epidemic that
was ravaging Europe.

446
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,550
The best scientists in the world were
brought together to try to solve the

447
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,400
problem. They were
stumped. People were dying.

448
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:33,110
And the person who led them to solution
was a dairy farmer who recognize that

449
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:37,520
the nope maintenance, we're not
getting small pox. So smallpox vaccine,

450
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:42,160
the smallpox vaccine is a bovine based
vaccine. Because of that dairy farmer, no,

451
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:44,940
he couldn't develop the
formula for the vaccine,

452
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,420
but he could lead them to sell the
solution through his own observation,

453
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,180
which is very different
than the scientists who were
sitting in the room with

454
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:53,940
the best training and
the best, uh, pedigrees.

455
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,510
[inaudible] spent so much time on a form
ever, right? Yeah. Probably we keep,

456
00:26:57,511 --> 00:26:59,160
we don't know.
We can't know.

457
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,700
But the point being is in
solving a real hard problem.

458
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,480
They had this person, they'll maybe
the science, this farmer was a genius.

459
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,470
I don't know. But he did notice something
and, and noticing it led to the outcome.

460
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,551
So what I tell people,

461
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:15,990
when you think about a room you want to
ask yourself is everyone in the room is

462
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:17,820
every or all the people who wreck,

463
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,580
who can help me solve
this really hard problem?

464
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,300
I give the example of a friend of mine
who was the editor of a major city

465
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:27,390
newspaper that was celebrating
one of the two anniversaries.

466
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,830
It was selling burning the hundred and
50th year of this city and the editor of

467
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:36,831
this newspaper had put two of the best
reporters in the city on a task them with

468
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:42,390
doing a special pullout section on
this anniversary hundredth anniversary,

469
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:43,320
excuse me,
of the city,

470
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,700
and it was a very diverse city and
the special section was finished.

471
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,790
They threw it on his desk and just like
in a fluke there running the presses,

472
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,450
printing it, he opened it up and he
starts going through it, going through it,

473
00:27:57,451 --> 00:27:59,780
going through it, and the entire, this,

474
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:04,810
this majority minority city had a special
edition on its hundredth anniversary,

475
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,740
would not one person of color
in the entire pullout section.

476
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,670
And he said, what went wrong? He said,

477
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,870
these are two great reporters.
They are two good people.

478
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,530
They have no malice against anyone.

479
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,160
They couldn't see these other things.

480
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,950
So he came up with the saying
that I love so much. He says,

481
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,150
is everyone in the room?

482
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,850
And it's a very simple idea to check
yourself on diversity and inclusion is

483
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:40,260
everyone in the room. So I have everyone
here that it can help me to solve this.

484
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,960
And I can tell you in our world
of picking stocks, which is hard,

485
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,230
we're picking stocks that are undervalued,
that something's broken.

486
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,950
You want everyone in the room
to push sides of it. You know,

487
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,950
we have a a democratic
leader at Ariel Ceo,

488
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,550
I'm more democratic than not a president,

489
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:01,020
but one of our senior most people has
a book about an culture on his desk.

490
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,840
And you would say like how do
those worlds come together?

491
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,720
Well we want those ideas.

492
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,090
We want everyone's perspective.

493
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,590
And that's cause he's a fan of the book
was there. And that's until you'd say,

494
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:14,790
well how is that possible?

495
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:17,760
It's possible because we said
we're inviting that into our life.

496
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,780
And ultimately I think that's led to
this cassette success of our investment

497
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:22,614
portfolio.

498
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,180
So it is in your own interest
to invite those differences.

499
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:31,830
And it's not just race, it is
religion, it is diversity of thought.

500
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,520
It is different schools, even different
political views, different political.

501
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,240
It's all of it because the,
even the political views
can shape things. You know,

502
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,190
it's interesting in the investment world,

503
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,900
obviously policy can affect companies. We
all know this, it good, but regulation,

504
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:50,320
et Cetera. And if you hold a point
of view very as we like to say it,

505
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,360
Ariel dearly,
you in our world,

506
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:57,310
you have to hold an idea lightly used to
be able to change your mind because new

507
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:00,290
information comes to you that may
force you to change your mind about the

508
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,890
investment that you've made.
When you hold it dearly,

509
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:05,980
you're working really hard to prove that
you can write and you can lose a lot of

510
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:09,700
money like that. Until the interesting
thing about political perspectives,

511
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,630
views on regulatory views, on
politics, et Cetera, can actually,

512
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,690
in fact you're thinking, okay, so you want
someone pushing from the other side, um,

513
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,860
and bolt all sides. Yes. Um, that,
that is helpful to us to make,

514
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,850
to allow us to make better decisions. When
you're picking companies to invest in,

515
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,690
you want all the information you possibly
can have and you want to try to make

516
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:33,760
the most unbiased decision
that you can make.

517
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,000
And that is knowing that we all from
the world of behavioral finance,

518
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,510
we all have biases that
we've worked really hard to
overcome and sometimes can't

519
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:43,050
overcome it all, which is
also true of life. Yes.

520
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,220
So talking about everybody in the room.

521
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,250
I mean we have our own challenges here
in the Silicon Valley, uh, as we know,

522
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:51,460
I mean we have women in leadership
positions, but not nearly enough.

523
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,250
We have women in stem positions,
but not nearly enough.

524
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,840
We have a women on very prestigious
boards, but not nearly enough.

525
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,460
Like what can we do about it? What,
how can we be better at it? What?

526
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,210
What are we still missing?

527
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,440
Right. Your card. We're
trying hard trying. You don't
get points for trying. Yes,

528
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,400
exactly. No, it's like there
are no, you know, you know what?

529
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:15,220
You remember you were a kid
and you in math they would say,

530
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:18,480
sure you're working with give you extra
credit even though your answer was wrong.

531
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,300
That's not how it works in real life. We
know that it just doesn't work that way.

532
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:24,370
You don't get extra credit
for showing your work. Yes.

533
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:25,980
Remember when we were
talking about sales quotas?

534
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,740
Just a little reminder to everybody.
You have to make your numbers. Well,

535
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:32,590
it's interesting. I'll give my own
time. I told my team this morning,

536
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:33,520
we're doing budgets.

537
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:37,150
I was sitting with our CFO here in San
Francisco yesterday for hours and hours

538
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:41,920
working on 2017 and I miss my numbers
this year in terms of new business coming

539
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:44,230
into Ariel. So I told the
team on the phone, I said,

540
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,820
I own that is what I'm telling
you right now. I get no raise,

541
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,090
nothing. I said, because I said
that's not going to happen to you,

542
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,380
but it didn't happen. It doesn't matter
how many flights I took, how hard I work,

543
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,500
it does not matter.
When I go in front of that board,

544
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,190
I'm going to tell them I did not make that
number and that number was aggressive,

545
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,740
but I,
I put the number on the page.

546
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,890
So if you could give us advice,
what should we do better? What are

547
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:13,160
we demanded? So this is
the point. Google is huge.

548
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,890
Let's just do one small thing.

549
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,210
What if every vendor that you worked with
you at the ask them about their board

550
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:24,020
diversity, do you think that
would get their attention?

551
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,370
That will give their attention?
Yes.

552
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,030
And we have a lot of the amount
of money that you spend. Yes.

553
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,910
If you say we want to work with
companies that have diverse boards,

554
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,670
we want to ask you some questions about
your board diversity as we look at

555
00:32:34,671 --> 00:32:37,910
approving your contract. Yes. Even
if you don't have enforcement,

556
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,200
having asked the yes,
we would have this ripple effect.

557
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,940
And then if you asked the question,

558
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,640
apple would ask the question
if apple has the question.

559
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,400
But you know what the great
thing is about us talking here.

560
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,030
I actually run the largest vendor
operations at Google. I can control this.

561
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,020
Alan and Manuel, I hope you're
watching on video, right? This,

562
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:01,400
this is right away. Go out with and ask
them like literary, I controlled it.

563
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,160
It's my budget. Do it.
Write literary. Do it.

564
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,940
Let's just do it. Let's see how easy
and literally asking a question. Yes,

565
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,530
it's a great, great more ideas to
come on here. We are actually that's,

566
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,010
I mean you all are colleagues with
people throughout Silicon Valley. Yes.

567
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,610
And you can influence them in terms of
talking about what you're doing and what

568
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:25,860
you're standing up for.
The thing that amazes me,

569
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:30,861
you've got iconic leaders here
globally iconic and Larry and Sergey,

570
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:38,290
Eric, Eric and I sat on a board
together. Now your new CEO. So I did,

571
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,140
I mean you got it here.

572
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,210
The amount of influence those people
have just by asking questions and raising

573
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:46,590
this issue with peers.

574
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,540
Clearly leading by example and you've
done that with you know, your woman,

575
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,000
CFO,
a woman treasurer.

576
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:57,600
I mean there's so many things happening
here that are so good in so many ways

577
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,620
and obviously coming from behind. So I'm
not going to make this into you know,

578
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,610
utopia yet,

579
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
but there has been an effort and there
has been some signs of effective change.

580
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Obviously Cheryl was here who casts a
big profile in the technology space and

581
00:34:12,611 --> 00:34:15,440
she was born here in some ways.
So there,

582
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:19,800
there is a legacy of success that
you can lean on but then leverage,

583
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,530
which I think is so interesting and,

584
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,330
and I think that if you were to do that
because of your leadership place in the

585
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:31,620
world, it just would have all
these knock on the facts. Yes.

586
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,853
So

587
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,470
I had to, I had a Google of recently
challenged me and said, Phil,

588
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,870
you meet basically every CEO in the world,

589
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:43,550
probably the relevancy or at one
point, uh, just during your normal job,

590
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:46,970
do you actually talk to them about
diversity or do you challenge them and ask

591
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:48,260
them how they think about diversity?

592
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:52,190
And I have to say that's not what I've
done so far and thought that was a great

593
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:52,710
idea,
actually

594
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,300
think about how much wealth
has been created here,

595
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:02,330
which we know and how generous Googlers
are and they're giving to hospitals,

596
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,950
universities, etc. Imagine if
Googlers, as they were donating money,

597
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:11,400
ask questions about the
diversity of those institutions,

598
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,840
which are some of the biggest institutions
in the world and the most prominent

599
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:19,140
ones.
Imagine if huge Stanford donors,

600
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,750
we're asking these questions about,
you know,

601
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:24,960
if Stanford started asking
their vendors about diversity,

602
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,880
but Googlers sent on the Stanford Board,
you know, this has a ripple effect.

603
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,140
You've hospitals that are giant,
you know, it's not just in, in,

604
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:38,630
in pockets. You know, if you are
about diversity it in what you do as,

605
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,520
as you live in this world,
you don't compartmentalize this issue.

606
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,340
Yes, great idea. Great.
Great ideas. Thank you. Um,

607
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,490
well we should actually go on and move.

608
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:51,110
I'm watching time here because I promised
everybody time for, for, for the,

609
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,300
the Q and a. But I have
to ask you about, um,

610
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,680
and we could've gone on this subject
for him and we'll spend more, uh,

611
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,640
we'll spend more time on those
ideas as well. Um, dreamworks,

612
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,260
Jeffrey Katzenberg, uh, which I
think everybody here knows well, um,

613
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,760
has referred to you as the
Jeffrey whisperer. You just sit,

614
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:11,880
you sat on their board. Um, so you
have a very close relationship,

615
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,380
a amazing experience.
Um,

616
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,530
how did this actually shape your
own experience of how you do things,

617
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:19,130
how you run things,
what you've learned from the laughing?

618
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,410
Because we sold the company this summer.
Yes,

619
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:26,060
we officially closed in the
beginning of the fall. And Jeffrey,

620
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,320
I talked to Jeffery more now than I've
ever talked to him. And then that last,

621
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,400
you know,
couple of years of dreamworks as Chair,

622
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,830
I pretty much talked to him
multiple times a week now.

623
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:36,990
I talked to Jeffrey
Multiple Times a day and um,

624
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,490
Jeffery has had a dramatic
impact on my life in a good way.

625
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:41,750
But dreamworks in general,

626
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,320
that Board Room was one of these board
rooms and talk about walking into,

627
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,230
I called it moguls are us.
When I got there, you know,

628
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,050
one of my friends said he didn't
put together a board. He cast it.

629
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,730
Nathan Myhrvold said best,

630
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:56,570
and if you know Nathan Nathan
from intellectual ventures,

631
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:59,360
but before that Microsoft,
Nathan was on the board as well.

632
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,040
And so the board when you walked
in was Paul Allen, Nathan,

633
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,490
David Gaffen, Meg Whitman, Howard Schultz.

634
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,070
Jeffrey and me and I was like,
Oh my God, I'm the scrub. Like,

635
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,280
like this is like crazy. This is,
you know, the most amazing thing.

636
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:19,100
We went to dinner once a day
that Gavin's house and I said,

637
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:23,180
and David is one of my dear friends,
I love him so much and he's,

638
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,250
he's one of the truth tellers to me.

639
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:29,480
Like he hits me right between the eye
with truth and he does not allow me to be

640
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:32,660
intellectually dishonest with myself.
And I so appreciate that about him.

641
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,570
But we went to his house once for
dinner, first dinner, you know,

642
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:38,750
when the first centers in David lives
in this unbelievably beautiful house,

643
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:41,420
like one of the most beautiful
houses I've ever seen.

644
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:44,690
And I've seen some pretty houses.
So we walk into the house and I was like,

645
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,560
oh my God, this is like one of the most
beautiful houses I've ever seen. You know,

646
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:52,940
and I'm like, like, like a running
chatter. And I'm like, it's so beautiful.

647
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,160
And I'm literally looking at
MAG and Paul and I'm like,

648
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,080
isn't this house really pretty?

649
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,050
And they're looking at me and all
of a sudden I'm like, wait a minute,

650
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,850
you all have really beautiful houses.
I was like,

651
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,940
I'm the one who changed.
So,

652
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,520
so it was one of those things of,
you know,

653
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:14,810
sort of being in this room and what
Jeffrey did for me and Roger and Rico was

654
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:19,811
the chair that I will never forget is
I was a peer of everyone in that room.

655
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,020
I was equal.
Roger Enrico called me one day and I,

656
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,270
it really taught me about how to treat
people. We were early in the board,

657
00:38:29,271 --> 00:38:30,440
having been a started the company,

658
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:33,950
it just IPO and he called me
one day and he said, hey melody,

659
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:36,730
now this is the former and CEO of Pepsi.

660
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,920
We manage money for Pepsi at Ariel. So
it's like, you know, this is the big boss,

661
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,340
you know, this is my client. He
calls me and he says, hey melody,

662
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,780
it's Roger. Roger have just passed
away very recently in the last year,

663
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,050
which was very sad.
And I said Hi.

664
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,770
And I remember being a little nervous
and I like stood up, you know,

665
00:38:56,771 --> 00:39:00,790
to make sure I'm like just, you know,
be your best self. And I was like, hi.

666
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,690
And he's like, hey, just calling
to check in. And I was like,

667
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,530
I'm thinking to myself like,
what am I supposed to say?
You know, it's like, what?

668
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:12,970
Check in. He's like, what's
going on? I was like, nothing.

669
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,710
Like Oh really? I was like
think of something to say.

670
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:22,030
So he would call like once
a month and just do that.

671
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,160
And what I thought was really great,

672
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,480
he just wanted me to feel comfortable
and as included as everyone else,

673
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,630
he probably worked overtime on me then.

674
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,450
I don't think he was causing a
call meg every month to check in.

675
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,630
But I think he was just saying,
I want her to come into this room.

676
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,730
And Jeffery would always say your eye,
you know,

677
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,260
your ideas are as good as anyone else's.
I want the ideas. And I wasn't afraid,

678
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,460
but it was interesting.
I mean,

679
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:49,480
you literally are in a room with capsules
of vendor street, and this is, you know,

680
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,110
15 years ago,
this isn't melody today,

681
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:57,130
this is melody at 32 you know,
walking into a room.

682
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,260
So it was something that was a gift.

683
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,190
And so I give Jeffrey a lot of credit for
that because I saw what it was like to

684
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:03,881
be a peer,

685
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:07,540
which was so different than all we're
talking about when you're in rooms with

686
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:10,070
microaggressions where people
make you feel differently. Yes.

687
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,340
So then when Roger was no longer chair,

688
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:17,200
Nathan went to Jeffrey and said melody
as chair. And I was like shocked.

689
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:19,840
He's like, she's earned it. And
she's the person who should be chair.

690
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,950
And she's the one who we have the most
faith and confidence in. So again,

691
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,400
it's the people in the room, you're
thinking, well, they've picked me. No,

692
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:30,490
I did always made sure I did all
my homework. I showed up, you know,

693
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:33,420
really ready to go, et
cetera. But from Jeffrey,

694
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,430
I learned about what it was like to see
people for not anything that comes in

695
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,860
packaging purely on ideas
and the merit of those ideas,

696
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,580
purely not to be an influence
about anything else. And two,

697
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:51,670
and then Jeffrey and I had a constant
conversation and what I joke with with

698
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:52,570
Jeffery,
I said,

699
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:57,990
I am Jeffery's head deflator of gravity
boots because this is a guy with a

700
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:00,550
million ideas a minute.
And sometimes I've just take a pen,

701
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,040
a pen and stick it in and his
head just Tryna shrivels up.

702
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,280
And other times I have to like keep
them down on the earth like Jeffrey,

703
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:09,250
stay with us so we're losing you.
Um,

704
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,810
and it became this wonderful working
relationship that Greg gave me. Great Joy.

705
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,830
I was, I was so sad when dreamworks
was over because I loved the work.

706
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,290
Talking relationships.
You were raised by a single mother,

707
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,040
Dorothy. Um, talk a little
bit about this experience.

708
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,030
There was something very special about it.
Well, my mom was, I was one of six kids.

709
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,650
I'm really young relative to my siblings.

710
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:36,860
My oldest sister is more
than 20 years older than me.

711
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:41,550
My siblings continually told me that I
was left on the doorstep and that really

712
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,490
wasn't their sister.
Um,

713
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,400
and that's very weird when you're like
five years old and the person telling you

714
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:50,360
is 27. Um, uh,

715
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,870
but ultimately they were
great. Um, five girls,

716
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:56,030
one boy and my mother,

717
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:59,950
I already given you a sense of this
brutal pragmatism that she had. Um,

718
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,440
she was very impractical in every
way you could possibly imagine.

719
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:05,900
Like she would buy Easter dresses
instead of pay the phone bill.

720
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:09,470
So we always got evicted and our lights
got disconnected and our phone got

721
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:11,570
turned off all the time.
Our cars got repossessed.

722
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,030
And that was talking about
that sense of insecurity.

723
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,760
I felt that I think about when I think
of that Hispanic kid thing saying,

724
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:20,030
so you have to move. Um, but
at the same time she was great.

725
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,570
And one of the things that I think that
has come through with my mother is that

726
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:27,680
she did give me great optimism
and hope I was never downtrodden.

727
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,480
I may not have had things and I may have
had some serious setbacks along the way.

728
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,470
Um, but I was not down tried and she
did not have, let me accept that idea.

729
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,220
And you know, I once heard Magic
Johnson say, um, you can be poor,

730
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:43,190
but you don't have to have poor dreams.
And I was like,

731
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:46,380
I think my mother sort of intuitively
understood that, you know,

732
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,240
during some of our more challenging time,

733
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:50,160
she always had these fantastical dreams.

734
00:42:50,161 --> 00:42:52,360
She was totally unrealistic
and a lot of ways

735
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,590
to share those dreams with, oh
my God, my mother, my mother was

736
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,120
blind at the end of,
of starting when I was in high school.

737
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:02,660
She went blind every single day.
My, I mean, my mother was blind,

738
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:07,790
but she would not acknowledge it. And
she, every single day she was like, oh no,

739
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:10,910
I'm going to be healed now. I mean,
she would literally, she was blind.

740
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,640
She was like, no, I'm going to
wake up tomorrow and see tomorrow.

741
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:18,530
I'm going to be able to see
tomorrow, every day. Like,

742
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:23,240
what kind of faith is that?
Right? Every day, you know,

743
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,570
she was blind from when I was in
high school until she died, you know,

744
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:30,050
four years ago. So that's
a long time everyday, oh,

745
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:34,040
tomorrow I'm going to be able to see.
And we're just like, no. But you know,

746
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:37,610
you don't want to take that away from
someone, you know, at the same time.

747
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:40,010
Hope and faith, I'm very
important. You know,

748
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,150
that you don't play around with
someone's optimism. And I learned that.

749
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,583
That's inspiring.

750
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,570
Okay. We want to go to the questions. Um,

751
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,160
we just to just end on a
lighthearted question. You, you're,

752
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:57,360
you're married to a, let's
say a star wars fan. Um,

753
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:03,340
uh, you're, you're actually, um, I
always say I'm married to Yodas Dad,

754
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,690
dad married to so and so. Um, how,

755
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,860
how it doesn't go backwards. How does
this, I mean, how does this feel?

756
00:44:13,861 --> 00:44:17,190
You actually, um, I, um, when
it was sold the last time,

757
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:20,950
I actually realized that you're actually
a character in one of the movies. Um,

758
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,230
not the movies, the television. Yes, yes,
yes. That's, yes, that's, that's correct.

759
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,670
Talk to us a little bit about how
this, how this fields, and by the way,

760
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:32,040
there's a big value piece in this

761
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,370
as well as well.
And,

762
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,720
and that's something I
actually only realized by
interacting with you and George

763
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,980
A. Little bit more is just talk to us a
little bit about like this part of your

764
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:42,240
life.
Well,

765
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:46,650
I have to say it's a crazy part in
so many ways and it's fantastic.

766
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,580
Um, George is iconic, you know,

767
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:53,840
he's known around the world
wherever we go, you know,

768
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,520
literally we walked down the
street, people are wearing
star wars tee shirts. Um,

769
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:02,130
we, um, it's a part of
society in the world,

770
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,930
you know, the sayings, the, you
know, there's so many examples. Um,

771
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:10,560
and we'd literally, we joke and bring them
into our lives all the time. You know,

772
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:15,000
it's just so funny. Um, which
is really, really great. Um,

773
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,720
my husband knows I'm always like a
hawk around like commuting desserts and

774
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:21,090
things like that, cause they
say, you know, he's much
older than me and I was like,

775
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:24,510
I need 20 years, so I've got to get
you to live 20 years. So they're like,

776
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:26,190
he'll have an ice cream cone.
And he's like,

777
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,670
this is not the ice cream you're
looking for. You know? And he's like,

778
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:31,590
starts to of convinced me
that I didn't see a meeting,

779
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,380
nice cream or would have you.
But the thing you know that he,

780
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:36,630
when he set out to write star wars,

781
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:41,010
he wrote it to teach 12 year
old girls and boys values.

782
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,850
And it's a story about
following light versus darkness.

783
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:49,500
And he says very clearly that
in the movies the darkness
can give you more power.

784
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,390
The dark side can have more power.

785
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:54,840
We've seen that with the emperor and
Darth Vader and it can et cetera.

786
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,290
But the light will bring you more joy.
And he's very,

787
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:03,291
very clear about that in life of the
pursuit of joy over power and the,

788
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,410
the certainly the pursuit of joy over
pleasure. You know, he talks about,

789
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:10,890
and he's told me a lot about pleasure
being fleeting and joy being permanent,

790
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,950
that when you seek pleasure,
you always have to up the ante,

791
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:17,610
which is why drug addicts become drug
addicts. They need another level.

792
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:21,960
We see that with people with great wealth.
It's like another car or another boat,

793
00:46:21,961 --> 00:46:25,500
another house. You're always trying
to up the ante. And he's like,

794
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:26,400
the thing about life,

795
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:29,970
it's the pleasure that stays with you
don't need to up the ante on pleasure

796
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:34,590
because it's in you watching a child
grow up or smile or some of these things

797
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,080
that are really just
sort of deeply in you,

798
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,870
memories that you know that
will bring you joy forever.

799
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,530
And so that's been something that,
especially in this time today,

800
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,830
I've been thinking a lot about are
we going to go to the darkness?

801
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,050
Are we going to go to the light?
And the delight,

802
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:51,900
the darkness may being bring power.
And we're certainly seeing that.

803
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,750
But the light will bring
joy. You know, I still,

804
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:59,370
if you don't even like Barack Obama,
you can't look at him and not see light.

805
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:02,580
You may not like a thing he says,
a policy that he has,

806
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,150
but there's an elegance and lightness
to him that is inspiring that you would

807
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:09,750
like your child to have. And so
I think about that. Not a lot.

808
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:13,710
And it's not about he, he lifts us us
as opposed to putting us down. Yeah.

809
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,570
And you know,
again,

810
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,570
that is something that means a lot to
me and it means a lot to me now that I

811
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:22,530
have a three year old, I want those
examples and George tapped into that.

812
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:24,510
That's why it's gone on for 40 years.

813
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,960
That's why people keep going back to
the stories because there's such depth

814
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:31,720
there to them and he has,
he's teaching us in those movies.

815
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,830
He's teaching us a lot. And you
know, I tell people, I've learned,

816
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,681
I know more stories.

817
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:39,880
There's facts and you could possibly ever
imagine I'd probably have the largest

818
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:43,360
collection of star wars tee shirts
of any person walking, watching,

819
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,360
walking the earth. Because
every day, every week,

820
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,200
George gets everything that has ever been
made with star wars on it once a week

821
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:52,750
that week.

822
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,110
So the archives are gigantic and he
brings home all the things that he thinks

823
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:58,600
will like. But in, in, in doing this,

824
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:01,510
he's explained so many things to me
about what he was thinking. For example,

825
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,344
with Yoda,

826
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:07,060
Yoda talks backwards because he said he
was trying to teach 12 year olds and if

827
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:10,420
Yoda said everything he says
directly it was preachy.

828
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:14,560
So he said if I turned it around the
kid had to listen and untangle it.

829
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,760
So it forced them to listen in a different
way. So when you hear do or do not,

830
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:23,440
there is no try. It doesn't offend you.
Yeah. Versus how it may have come across.

831
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:24,970
If you say, you know, try, yeah,

832
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,490
you don't think about this level of
depth and thinking at the time this was

833
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:29,450
basically created,

834
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,630
well there's nothing accidental and
star wars. That's the thing about it,

835
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:34,860
and this is the piece
which I find fascinating,

836
00:48:34,861 --> 00:48:38,990
like Yoda is the dimensions of a two year
old. And the reason that that is true,

837
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,600
the face we are cutest.

838
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,590
A human being is the cutest they ever
are between the ages of two and three.

839
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,180
And that is actually for a reason.
They say you have the terrible twos.

840
00:48:50,181 --> 00:48:52,790
This has been studied.
George has lots of facts on that.

841
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:57,290
Children are so awful between two and
three that if they weren't cute we would

842
00:48:57,291 --> 00:49:01,490
kill them.
And when you think back to caveman times,

843
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,550
so they made them so cute
so you couldn't kill them.

844
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:09,140
So he said he actually intentionally made
Yoda all the dimensions of a two year

845
00:49:09,141 --> 00:49:14,000
old. He's an 800 year old, two year old
to make him so cute. All of his eyes,

846
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:18,500
the spatial dimensions,
nothing is accidental. Nothing.

847
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,770
He's like thought it through to another
level that you would never imagine. Yeah.

848
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,760
Okay. I'll be cute. Does of two year
olds. We have a few minutes left.

849
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:29,410
Maybe we can go a couple of
minutes over, uh, on the question.

850
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:33,120
So I want to get started right away. We
have our doors here. Uh, let's start.

851
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,330
Animated movies are lagging behind
as far as diversity is concerned,

852
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,710
not that real movies are perfect.

853
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,650
Is this something you
discussed in board meetings?

854
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,680
Do the hero's ethnic ethnicity and gender
have an impact on the revenues and so

855
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:45,190
on?

856
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,920
I love this question because I
have a real life story on that.

857
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,400
So we're in the dreamworks board meeting.
Jeffrey knows I tell this story.

858
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:55,330
So I'd been very open about it
and we saw the movie mega mines,

859
00:49:55,331 --> 00:49:56,380
which was a dreamworks movie,

860
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:58,720
cause we would watch the movies in
the board meetings all the time.

861
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:03,460
So we watched mega mines, we come out
of the theater, we're in the boardroom.

862
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,860
And he always say like, well what
do you do? Think of the movie.

863
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:08,650
So I wait for everyone. I'm sitting
around waiting, waiting, waiting.

864
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:13,810
And finally I'm like, the city
was metropolis. He's like, yes.

865
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,380
I was like,
the only person of color was blue

866
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,560
in the entire movie.

867
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,880
There was one scene where the hero kiss
a baby that's black. And I was like,

868
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,070
it didn't even have a black parent
that went with that. And I was like,

869
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,630
there are no people of Color
in this movie. None. None.

870
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,330
Except for the, you
know, the main character.

871
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:40,750
So Jeffrey sort of a couple of people
pile on and then the meeting is over.

872
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:44,360
So I get a call from Jeffery when
I land in Chicago and he's like,

873
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:47,060
I need you to come to La and have
lunch with me. And I was like,

874
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:49,970
come back to la now.
We don't know each other well at all.

875
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:53,870
It's early in my tenure at dreamworks.
And I said, okay, I'll come back.

876
00:50:53,871 --> 00:50:56,430
So I get back and we're sitting in this,

877
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:01,010
the grill in Los Angeles and he
looks at me and he's like, you know,

878
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,060
you really embarrassed me in that
board meeting and I'm thinking like,

879
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,080
get ready for a fight. You
know, like in my mind I'm like,

880
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,540
like in my mind I'm like this.
And he's like,

881
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:13,550
and it will never happen again.

882
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,010
I'm mortified.
I didn't see it.

883
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,570
It will never happen
again, ever. And he's like,

884
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,900
that's why you have to be in the room.
And I said back to us,

885
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:29,930
everyone in the room, right?
And he said, I didn't see it.

886
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:34,530
So interestingly in tip,
uh,

887
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,810
the mood, the character
tip in, um, oh my God,

888
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,390
the name of the movie just
went in and out of my head.

889
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:45,650
Rihanna is the main character. Um, Oh God,

890
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:48,530
it'll come to me on one
second. Sorry. Yeah,

891
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:53,300
it's Google home. Excuse me.
Home. So thank you, Jamie. Clara.

892
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,360
So in home, Rihanna is the
first mixed race protagonist,

893
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,350
main character j lowest her mother,

894
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:02,990
and it's very clear of father's
black based upon her hair.

895
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,810
And so we don't see her
father in the movie.

896
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:10,130
And so Rihanna has obviously
this huge following.

897
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,110
We do the movie and all of these people
start writing Jeffery these letters and

898
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:16,640
these letters are things like,

899
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,600
I just want you to know my child has
never seen a character in a movie that was

900
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:23,360
the main character, animate it
with hair that looked like hers.

901
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,220
My child has never seen an animated movie
with a main character where the child

902
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:31,520
was participant Mac. My child
does. And so Jeffrey was like,

903
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:37,250
melody is the reason that we did this
because she's the one who told us mega

904
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:41,330
mine nest and we want it to push this.
And the thing was,

905
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:44,240
which I explained to you know that it
didn't take rocket science to figure out

906
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:47,820
again as this in your own best interest
African Americans and Hispanic overindex

907
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,610
and movie going.
We do.

908
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,850
And so there are certain things where we
over index in a big way and movie going

909
00:52:52,851 --> 00:52:55,190
as one. And I just said,
this is one of these things,

910
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:58,140
this is not only feels great and
it's wonderful and the movie,

911
00:52:58,141 --> 00:52:59,390
it was this tremendous success,

912
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,650
but it's also great that we've inspired
all these people because they see people

913
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:07,640
who look like them when most often
than not, that is not the case.

914
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,260
Now we've had the princess and the frog.

915
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,900
We had will Smith as a main
character and one of our movies,

916
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:15,020
I mean we've had a lot of diversity
but this was one of the, you know,

917
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:18,950
the most direct and outward signs of that.
And that was really invigorating.

918
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,610
Is that enough? No. So
we need to do a lot more,

919
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:26,760
but that certainly was one where that
was a good example on a great start. Yes.

920
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,000
Yes. We have a live question.
Thank you. Hi Melodie.

921
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:34,030
Thank you so much for being here and um,
on behalf of Google, I think you just,

922
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,750
you're such an inspiration
and what a powerful message,

923
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:39,570
and I know the room is not totally
full because it is the Friday before

924
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:41,130
thanksgiving,
so apologies on that,

925
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:44,160
but everyone is on the live stream and
we will absolutely share it on demand to.

926
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,540
Thank you so much for your time.

927
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,320
My question actually is about your two
or three year old beautiful daughter,

928
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:53,970
Everest and thanks to your great mother
and all of the values and messages she

929
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:54,780
instilled in you.

930
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,590
What is that hopeful optimism that
you're planning to instill in her as she

931
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,870
becomes a beautiful lady?
Well,

932
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:04,770
the most important thing that I believe
in is making sure she's a good person.

933
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:09,720
I think that trumps everything. It's
not what you do, what you achieve,

934
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,220
you know, anything else, how successful
she is. I just want a good person.

935
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,460
I want a person who is empathetic,
who has concerned for others.

936
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:21,420
My child that Warren Buffett has a
saying that if you're born in America,

937
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:25,950
you've won the birth lottery.
My child won the birth lottery in America.

938
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,000
She has two extraordinarily
devoted and successful parents.

939
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,410
She has a life that any person
would dream auth in every way,

940
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:37,530
a life that I could never
have even remotely understood.

941
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,730
She has devoted CareKit caretakers.

942
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,480
My child does now fluent because we
started when she was born in Mandarin,

943
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,160
so we started teaching our Mandarin.

944
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:50,640
She goes to a Chinese immersion
school with no English, so she's,

945
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,510
she's been to China three times
and she's three. You know,

946
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:59,160
these are things that are just not
normal. Right? But at the same time,

947
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,870
what I have told people,

948
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:05,310
I have very clear and high expectations
of the contribution that she must make

949
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:09,390
and give back to society. And people say
to me, you can't burden her with that.

950
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,250
I said,
hell yes I can.

951
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,550
Because she got way more
than her fair share.

952
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:18,150
She will never wake up in the morning
wondering about food or clothing or

953
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:21,780
shelter. I've been there and I don't
want to put all of that on her,

954
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:26,040
but I want her to be aware of what that
is like as it relates to other people.

955
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:27,210
One day she came to us,

956
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:31,200
she would go to the Chinese American
Service League in Chicago to play with the

957
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:35,160
kids starting when she was one years
old and they're all immigrants.

958
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:39,060
Children who were the parents would go
to learn how to assimilate in America and

959
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:41,970
the kids would be put in a room
to play together. And Everest,

960
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:46,670
the little brown child was the only
non Chinese child in the room. Beige,

961
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:51,390
she's not quite brown as my husband
said when she was born. What happened?

962
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:55,740
I already ordered a brown
one. Um, but anyway, she um,

963
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,110
she goes to this class one day,
she comes home,

964
00:55:58,111 --> 00:56:02,580
she's two years old and she starts
picking up her toys and she starts putting

965
00:56:02,581 --> 00:56:04,710
them at the front door in our
apartment in Chicago. And we said,

966
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:05,610
what are you doing?
And she said,

967
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:10,440
we have to take these toys to school
now in broken sentence. You know,

968
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:13,710
she can't even form a full sentence
at that age. And so we said, she said,

969
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:18,300
the other kids need the toys. And
I was like, that's the kid I want.

970
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,350
That is the kid I want. Where she saw
they were playing with broken toys. She,

971
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:26,950
we were, she was born, we got 600 baby
gaps. Even though I told people no gaps,

972
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,150
600 someone sent us 2000 bucks,

973
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:36,370
2000 and so I said to,
I said it was such an Mba,

974
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:41,420
we got literally like 30 copies
of goodnight moon literally.

975
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,470
So we're sending them the
hospitals and everything.

976
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:49,210
So I want her to understand like this is
too much. So when she started putting,

977
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:50,980
they get her and she's like,
their toys are broken.

978
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:54,850
I was like that is what we have to
instill in her for the rest of her life

979
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:59,320
because she has more than her fair share
and that will be where I would be most

980
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:03,760
proud of her if she has that goodness in
her and she sees now they say bilingual

981
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:06,940
children are naturally more empathetic
because they understand when someone

982
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:10,360
doesn't understand, which was part of
the reason I wanted her to be bilingual.

983
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:15,040
That was the start to this life of empathy
that I hope that she has not sympathy.

984
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,560
Empathy.
Oh,

985
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:22,050
can we go on for a few more
minutes? How are you guys?
Okay. All right. Okay, great.

986
00:57:22,051 --> 00:57:22,740
Thank you.
Um,

987
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,710
you've been actively engaged in financial
literacy with all of the new apps

988
00:57:25,711 --> 00:57:27,920
tools available today.
Do you see more opportunity for women,

989
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:31,920
minorities to dramatically improve
their financial literacy? And if so,

990
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,470
are you involved in any
interesting projects in this area?

991
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:37,940
Yes, I think this is, we're
at a precipice of a moment.

992
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:41,180
The thing about America is we are
not financially literate, literate.

993
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:42,043
That's everyone.

994
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:46,220
You can go to high school in America
today and take wood shop or auto and not a

995
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:50,900
class on investing, which always leads
me to ask people who whittles, right?

996
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:54,320
Who is cleaning their own
carburetor when you can't.

997
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,110
The class on investing in America.
So all of us,

998
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:59,210
even if you've gone to the best schools,

999
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,840
you may have taken corporate
finance at an Ivy League school,

1000
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,350
but you didn't take a class on the
stock market and investing most likely.

1001
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,950
So we hand people the keys to their
financial future when they go to work at

1002
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:13,070
their first job because we tell them,
here's your 401k plan,

1003
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:16,580
pick your investment options.
And no one taught you how to drive.

1004
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:21,170
So I said it's the equivalent of handing
literally the keys to our core bat to a

1005
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,770
16 year old with a bottle of Jack Daniels
and no driver's license and say have a

1006
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:25,340
good time.

1007
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:30,340
Like it has dramatic implications for
your life as well as your children and

1008
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:35,570
your parents. If you help support
them, it's, it's a big damn deal.

1009
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,040
So as a result of that,

1010
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:40,300
I've been an evangelist on this
idea of financial literacy.

1011
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:43,700
That is why I wake up when I'm
out here on the west coast,

1012
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,690
I had to go to CBS at like they come to
blow dry my hair like one in the morning.

1013
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:50,780
My husband is literally like,
you have a night shift.

1014
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:56,060
Literally because I'm getting up to
go to dcbs and by 4:00 AM in the city.

1015
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,360
And people say, well why do you do
it? I don't do it for publicity.

1016
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:00,410
I don't do it for money.

1017
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:04,100
I do it because it's my opportunity
to educate people about money.

1018
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:07,070
And I see that as part of my calling
in life because I've gotten this

1019
00:59:07,071 --> 00:59:10,730
opportunity to understand. And because
we don't learn about this in school,

1020
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:14,240
the good news is that there are
more tools than ever before.

1021
00:59:14,241 --> 00:59:18,450
Four one k plans have gotten so much
better at providing financial information

1022
00:59:18,451 --> 00:59:22,250
of people would take advantage of
it. I just, uh, actually invested in,

1023
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:24,890
I say this not because of it's an
investment. I hope it works out,

1024
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,440
but that's not the reason
I'm giving them a plug.

1025
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:31,430
I've invested in this company
called Ellevest, which is a, um,

1026
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,880
Robo advisor targeting women,
which I think one,

1027
00:59:34,881 --> 00:59:38,210
the name is great and Sallie Krawcheck
who started the company who came off of

1028
00:59:38,211 --> 00:59:42,110
Wall Street, uh, first alliance
Bernstein, then Bank of America.

1029
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:46,370
She is fantastic and I think she's put
together something really special to

1030
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:48,030
appeal to women.
Um,

1031
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,290
I've been here and I've gone to talk to
Sal Kahn about what he's doing when it

1032
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:54,810
comes to financial literacy. So I,
and he has some great things, uh,

1033
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:58,790
at the Khan Academy that will help people
and he's doing great things with Bank

1034
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:00,410
of America in that regard.

1035
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,710
So I do think there are more
opportunities than ever before.

1036
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:06,620
But I do think also we have
to understand as a society,

1037
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,050
we hold the keys to our
own financial future.

1038
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,880
The days of working for a company for 30
years and require retiring with a gold

1039
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:16,010
watch and a secure pension are over.

1040
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,460
The average American will have
11 jobs in their lifetime.

1041
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,950
And even if you have
done right by yourself,

1042
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,900
if you've saved and
invested appropriately,

1043
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,180
if you're maxing out with
your four one k plan,

1044
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:29,480
you have may have someone in another
office or the next cube that has done

1045
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:31,490
nothing.
And it's because of that,

1046
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,550
they will be a burden on society
and ultimately affect you.

1047
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:39,620
So this is everyone's problem.
And the one thing that we can do about it,

1048
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:42,170
because we'd say an area,
one of our famous sayings,

1049
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,160
we have admired this problem
long enough on this one.

1050
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:51,430
You can take this cause into your own
life demanding your children's schools,

1051
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:55,850
your, your, your nephews or
nieces, your God children's,

1052
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:59,810
that they ultimately have financial
literacy programs in those schools.

1053
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:04,160
And that ultimately that we start to
develop a language around investing for

1054
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:07,700
young people so that when they hear about
the Nasdaq, the Dow and the s and p,

1055
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:11,360
it's not a foreign language to them
and that they ultimately become more

1056
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:15,680
comfortable and fluid in these ideas
of a saving and investing which have

1057
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:18,740
profound implications for our society.

1058
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,620
Anyone who thinks this is
social security as a safety net,

1059
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:25,430
especially the people of this generation
in this audience and in this company,

1060
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,710
millennials,
it's a safety net with holes.

1061
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:32,510
If you're under the age of 40 it is a
question of what the social security will

1062
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:36,470
look like and not to mention the average
social security check in America today

1063
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:41,471
is $1,100 that is not when any of us
would consider the golden years and yet 80

1064
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:47,570
million Americans ate oh are currently
working in companies where there is no

1065
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:50,990
retirement plan for them and so
security will be their only option.

1066
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,260
By the way, if there's anything
we can do to help more,

1067
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:55,430
especially in the youtube side,

1068
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:57,320
we work closely with the
Canada Academy and so on.

1069
01:01:57,321 --> 01:02:00,140
Maybe there's some interesting ideas
because that's obviously a great medium to

1070
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:04,540
um, uh, to, to display and show some
of this information. Let's do, uh,

1071
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,120
let's do one more question here. Just
looking at time. Uh, it's so important.

1072
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:10,130
Children grow into leaders
that are accepting of all,

1073
01:02:10,131 --> 01:02:12,920
I have a biracial niece that is
eight years old and has already felt

1074
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:15,680
discrimination. Do you have a
recommendation for a book or something?

1075
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:16,850
Children of all types,

1076
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:20,160
especially girls can read that
emphasizes leadership and equality.

1077
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,711
This is hard one.

1078
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:25,500
Obviously I have a biracial child as
well and I always tell my husband,

1079
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:28,110
he is always kind of reminding, trying
to remind me. He's like, you know,

1080
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:33,111
she's part white and I'm like in
America when you have any black in you,

1081
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:35,610
you're black.
That's just how you're seeing.

1082
01:02:35,611 --> 01:02:39,300
You're not seeing as part white people
don't look at Barack Obama and say he's

1083
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:44,190
part white. They said we have a black
president. And so, um, again, in the,

1084
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:46,400
in the spirit of truth,
even though my child, we,

1085
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,440
my husband told her that Baba,

1086
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:54,300
she calls him Bob Bob because it's Chinese
for Father Baba is a white and Mama

1087
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:58,620
is black. And he said Everest is
black and white. And she said,

1088
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,910
and Mandarin
because she thinks she's parked Chinese.

1089
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:06,460
Her favorite food is me, fat rice. And um,

1090
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,370
so we have a long way to go before her.

1091
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,740
She really does understand that
she's part black and white.

1092
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:15,420
I've got to get some sweet potato pie to
her or something, a bean pie. But anyway,

1093
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,380
she, um, I think the one thing we
can do, especially for girls, I just,

1094
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,150
when I was a kid,
I read all of these.

1095
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,170
There were these little red books
in my library at school. Um,

1096
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,740
where I grew up in these little red book.

1097
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:27,960
We're biographies of
famous people and they had,

1098
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:32,670
they had literally had books on any
Oakley and Louisa may Alcott and Harriet

1099
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:33,331
Tubman and all these people.

1100
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:36,840
And I had this desire before I graduated
from eighth grade to read every

1101
01:03:36,841 --> 01:03:40,260
biography that was on the shelf.
And there were a couple hundred of them.

1102
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,010
And reading about people makes a huge
difference in your life. You know,

1103
01:03:44,011 --> 01:03:46,260
when you can read about their
struggles and what they went through.

1104
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:50,520
I don't think there's any one book. I
think it's just the idea of reading about,

1105
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,470
uh, individuals, um, that makes
a huge difference in inspires.

1106
01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:00,660
And so I, there's no magic bullet on
this. Knowledge is power and information.

1107
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:04,410
We all know that. And hopefully the, in
reading about the struggles of others,

1108
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:09,411
she'll get the confidence to the eight
year old biracial niece to take this

1109
01:04:09,631 --> 01:04:11,310
world on,
uh,

1110
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:16,110
with great energy and enthusiasm
and confidence. But you know, it's,

1111
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:19,680
it's, it's uh, it's not,
uh, one thing, uh, one book,

1112
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:21,720
a one conversation.
It's a,

1113
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:25,800
it's a narrative and that narrative
has to go on for life. I mean,

1114
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:27,750
I still feel like I have
to be infused with that.

1115
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,750
When I was having my hard time last week,
it was someone else who told me,

1116
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:34,200
think about your ancestors.
You're not in a field picking cotton.

1117
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,560
You didn't give birth to Everest and
a field and have to get back to work.

1118
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,040
That's the truth of what happens.

1119
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:45,450
So get over yourself and um,
you know,

1120
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:48,300
I have great optimism for the
young kids that are out there,

1121
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:53,250
but what I tell people do not tell them
not to see race, tell them to embrace it.

1122
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,480
You know, I think that's just as
important. They can't look beyond it.

1123
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:00,330
All these people talk about how
they're colorblind and I, you know,

1124
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:01,710
as you give real life examples,

1125
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:05,580
I had a friend who worked at MTV and they
said they did a survey of millennials

1126
01:05:05,581 --> 01:05:08,550
and they asked them all these attitudinal
questions and they were all like,

1127
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:11,070
spot on, you know, in terms
of views about things.

1128
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:14,010
Just lined up exactly with
what you want with society.

1129
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:18,190
And then the ask them what would they do?
Would you date a black girl,

1130
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:22,150
the college football, uh,
captain? He was like, no.

1131
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,243
And I was like,

1132
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,120
of course I know that because the black
girl in all white schools doesn't have

1133
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:33,100
dates. I was one of them.
That's just what happens. So,

1134
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:37,330
you know, let's, let's not
have them in this vacuum of,

1135
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:40,600
I don't even see that
because it's not real.

1136
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,620
That's not the reality that we live in.
Let's embrace those differences.

1137
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:46,200
And so telling your eight year old niece,

1138
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:49,000
making sure she understands
where she comes from,

1139
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:52,120
who she is and all the people
are out there who are like her,

1140
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:55,960
who've done extraordinary things
and Barack Obama is one, you know,

1141
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:58,380
one of my heroes. It doesn't
have to be yours. I, you know,

1142
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,970
we all have a right to our different
ups differences of opinion,

1143
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,580
but there's some people out there who,
you know,

1144
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:08,200
are pretty remarkable and have been
pretty remarkable who don't live anymore.

1145
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:11,710
This is so interesting. Are you okay
to go on for a few more minutes? Yeah,

1146
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,390
I mean we are fine. A couple of more
minutes. Are you guys okay? Sorry.

1147
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:17,120
What did this I feel we have,
um, it's just, we should,

1148
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,660
I mean we stream and we record so,
so even if people watch it later,

1149
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:24,440
you want people to have
uncomfortable discussions about
race. But for some of us,

1150
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:28,610
that discomfort is because
these discussions have a
nontrivial probability to be

1151
01:06:28,611 --> 01:06:32,360
quite literary career ending.
How can we have these discussions safely?

1152
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,590
I have to tell you, this is one
where I understand the trepidation.

1153
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:42,060
I think that my profile and

1154
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:44,340
opportunity,

1155
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:48,990
the opportunities that I have in life had
been magnified by my willingness to go

1156
01:06:48,991 --> 01:06:52,980
out on a limb. People told me
not to have this discussion,

1157
01:06:52,981 --> 01:06:54,690
that it would be a career ender for me.

1158
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:58,770
And yet having this discussion has allowed
me to be invited to be here and one

1159
01:06:58,771 --> 01:07:01,170
of the greatest companies in the
world to sit and talk to you.

1160
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,960
And so I see it a little bit differently,

1161
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:07,410
but I know it takes a
tremendous amount of bravery,

1162
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:11,070
which is why a lot of my speeches
right now are about being brave.

1163
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,880
I talk about this article that I read
about a woman who every single day told

1164
01:07:14,881 --> 01:07:18,480
her daughter to be brave when she went
to college. All of her letter she signed,

1165
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:19,860
be brave, not, I love you.

1166
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,390
Be Brave because she wanted
that to be the message to her.

1167
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,000
And that's what I tell Everest.
Be Brave her, my George,

1168
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:30,600
the other don't tell the Everest she was
silly. She said, I'm not silly. I'm brave.

1169
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,360
And I said,
that's exactly what I want her to feel,

1170
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,190
but this is going to take bravery.

1171
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:38,280
And what I tell about tell people
who says it could be, you know,

1172
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:39,900
you lose your job,
your career,

1173
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,900
you have to have confidence to
believe you can get another job.

1174
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:45,240
You just have to have that confidence.

1175
01:07:45,241 --> 01:07:47,940
I know that sounds really
cavalier and people say, Oh,

1176
01:07:47,941 --> 01:07:52,350
you can see that sitting where you are
now. I have always believed in my ability.

1177
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,320
If I did excellent work,
excellent,

1178
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:58,590
killed it every single
day I would be wanted.

1179
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:00,900
And I believe that to this day.

1180
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:04,770
And if I can't get the benefit of the
doubt for talking about something that I

1181
01:08:04,771 --> 01:08:08,160
think is important,
I think that is what is killing us.

1182
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:12,360
Every one is in these rooms. And
they're not saying it. You know,

1183
01:08:12,361 --> 01:08:14,280
people keep telling me
what is happening to them.

1184
01:08:14,281 --> 01:08:18,890
My soul being crushed by the nots.
The people who are not speaking up.

1185
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:24,280
And a young woman come to see me the other
day who was busy on being just beyond

1186
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:30,050
stunning, like Mussai
warrior beautiful. You know,

1187
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,780
literally she was six feet tall,
chocolate brown,

1188
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:37,130
unbelievably beautiful,
had just graduated from college,

1189
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,080
works in this um,

1190
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:42,350
company that's very big
company that you would know.

1191
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:47,450
And she said that her boss
keeps calling her cookie.

1192
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,620
Um,
who was the woman from empire cookie?

1193
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:57,050
What's your last name? Lions. She goes, he
goes, her cookie Lyons. So was a cookie.

1194
01:08:57,051 --> 01:09:00,890
Lions come here, Cookie Lyons do this,
cause their lines. So she finally,

1195
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:05,090
she came to see me to say,
what do I do?

1196
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:09,740
She's 22.
I am in shock,

1197
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,820
right? And she says, there's another
woman who works there who is black.

1198
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:17,810
There are two of us. I'm 22. I said, well,
how long has she been there? She said,

1199
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:21,470
she's been there for eight years.
He calls her cookie Lyons to,

1200
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:28,220
so I said, oh my God. So he
said, her name is Taylor.

1201
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:34,460
So she said, I said, you got
to go and tell him. So she
goes and tell him. She said,

1202
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:38,510
listen, my name is Taylor.
I want to be called Taylor.

1203
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:42,470
I don't want to be called Cookie Lyons.
I want to be called Taylor.

1204
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,760
And he said to her,
what if I call you Taylor Swift?

1205
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,553
And she said,

1206
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:53,840
my name is Taylor and no one else on
this whole floor has a different name.

1207
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:58,190
You call them by their name,
I just want to be called Taylor.

1208
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,480
So he says, okay, I understand
he stops calling her Taylor.

1209
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:07,660
So the other woman who's eight years
older than her walks in and says,

1210
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,580
oh my God,
he stopped calling you cookie Lyons.

1211
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,130
Do you think I should
walk in and say something?

1212
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:18,710
So for eight years now, I know
cookie came into existence, what?

1213
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:21,860
Three years ago? I'm assuming there
was something before that maybe,

1214
01:10:21,861 --> 01:10:22,850
I shouldn't assume,

1215
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:26,930
but at least for the last three years
he's been calling that other woman who's

1216
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,580
been there.
You know,

1217
01:10:28,581 --> 01:10:32,510
this woman just graduated from college
this summer and that is what she's

1218
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:37,280
dealing with, not doing her
job being called Cookie Lyons,

1219
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:42,080
who's like a sister girl.
I had got no problem with Cookie Lyons,

1220
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:45,350
but if you saw this woman, I
was like, I don't even get it.

1221
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:47,770
She's like six feet tall. She's, you know,

1222
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,170
there's nothing about her that you
can't say like, you look just like,

1223
01:10:51,171 --> 01:10:55,730
are you seem like her, you
know, she didn't know why
even are a Gucci trench coat.

1224
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:59,780
And I was like, really? I
just don't get this. So,

1225
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,620
but it's the silence of the other
people that allows that to perpetuate.

1226
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:07,160
And people come to me all the time with
things that happen in rooms and I'm like,

1227
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:10,190
it can't just be us
fighting for ourselves.

1228
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,920
There were other people
on that floor who knew.

1229
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:16,200
He called her cookie Lyons
and they didn't say anything.

1230
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:19,260
She actually gets the,
the,

1231
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:24,270
the metal here because she's the
youngest most defenseless, no experience,

1232
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:28,710
probably most afraid. But she had
the foresight to say, help me,

1233
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:30,330
what do I do?
And I was like,

1234
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:33,690
go stand up for yourself and if this
does not work out, I told her, I said,

1235
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:38,430
you can roll yourself right into here
at Ariel and I will make a place for you

1236
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,110
and you will be a superstar here.

1237
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,980
So wow. So, um, let me say one thing
here, just from my perspective.

1238
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:46,540
I'll give you a pledge here.

1239
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:51,541
If anybody ever at Google cause worry
about speaking out about race or fields,

1240
01:11:52,631 --> 01:11:55,330
they have a negative
career impact from that.

1241
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,830
Tell me all sorted for you.
You should not ever,

1242
01:11:59,831 --> 01:12:02,950
ever feel in such a position.
Feel free to contact me.

1243
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,410
And I think from the other part
of the story, also important.

1244
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,600
If you are in a situation where
you observe behavior like this,

1245
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:14,650
I feel if you're not black,
if you're not a minority,

1246
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:19,090
it is your responsibility to
observe, learn, understand,

1247
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,450
speak out.
And if you're not being he heard about it,

1248
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:27,160
feel free to contact me at any point in
time. I will engage. We'll, we'll sort it.

1249
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:30,960
So let me just give you one example of
this. At Princeton we an honor code.

1250
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,590
So some of you had this, so we,
every time we sent to take a task,

1251
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,510
the honor code was on the front.
You signed,

1252
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:40,650
then you broke the seal and the Honor
Code said if you cheated or you saw

1253
01:12:40,651 --> 01:12:44,100
someone cheat and took, didn't turn
the men, yes you were accountable.

1254
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:48,240
You could have the same repercussions for
not turning them in. It's interesting.

1255
01:12:48,241 --> 01:12:51,390
If we could adopt an honor
code around these issues.

1256
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:54,600
And so we're actually going to take it
upon ourselves that when we actually see

1257
01:12:54,601 --> 01:12:57,060
this injustice, yes, we're
going to call it out. Yes,

1258
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:00,660
we're going to live within the honor of
having this fair and honorable society.

1259
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:03,810
We have to look at it exactly right.
We're used to that.

1260
01:13:03,811 --> 01:13:07,290
Many of us have already lived with honor
code. Yes, we have. We have to learn.

1261
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:08,370
We have to understand this better.

1262
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:12,150
Part of the reason why we're having
this discussion here. Right. So, uh, so,

1263
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,680
so people that are,
um,

1264
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:16,550
that actually have a non
diverse background understand
those issues better and

1265
01:13:16,551 --> 01:13:18,350
that they own,
because only if you know,

1266
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:21,490
you can realize what it means and only
then you can actually go ahead and,

1267
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,570
and speak out and you actually,
you have to speak out.

1268
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:27,620
Like I fundamentally believe you have
to speak up. Speak Up, speak out. Yeah.

1269
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,480
We have one more live question that's,
go ahead

1270
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,860
melody. I love your voice. Thank you
for being here. Speaking of jobs,

1271
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:36,750
have you considered running for president?

1272
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:44,960
No, I haven't considered
that. I, uh, you know, no, I,

1273
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:48,180
I actually, you know, there are
moments now that I have to say I'm,

1274
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,880
we all have to do something.
You know,

1275
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:53,640
we all have a role and I'm
taking mine very seriously.

1276
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,700
So on the phone on the way here,
I was on the car for two hours.

1277
01:13:56,701 --> 01:13:59,040
I was on the phone with planned
parenthood's Cecile Richards.

1278
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:03,690
I was on the phone with
someone representing the head
of the Naacp and the legal

1279
01:14:03,691 --> 01:14:04,410
defense fund.

1280
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:07,620
Those are my three calls on the way here
about mobilization and what we will do.

1281
01:14:07,621 --> 01:14:11,950
So I plan on, you know,
rising to the occasion and,

1282
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:14,920
and hopefully giving all that I've
got doing everything that I can.

1283
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:18,960
I don't think I'm the right person
for Washington, but I do think, um,

1284
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:24,330
I have a lot of hope that there's someone
here or someone else that we can all

1285
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:28,150
get behind and help change the world
and make it what we want it to be.

1286
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:32,110
The one thing I am hopeful despite being
disappointed and discouraged in some

1287
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:32,921
ways and again,

1288
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:36,610
being very cognizant of other people
who have different of opinion and

1289
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:39,890
respecting those opinions
and the other side. Um, I'm,

1290
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,820
I am going to push for the light
as opposed to the darkness.

1291
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:46,330
I'm going to fight for
light. Yup. Thank you.

1292
01:14:46,331 --> 01:14:50,560
I think you could be right though
about the office being there.

1293
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:54,910
Thank you. Should we just finish off
with the two live questions please?

1294
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,430
It's a little tall. Hi. Hi.

1295
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:05,200
I've looked up to for a really long time
because they feel like you're amazing

1296
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:08,170
at succeeding environments that
aren't necessarily built for you.

1297
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:12,670
Like I read your essay
in Sheryl Sandberg's book
about going to like a mostly

1298
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:14,970
white, proper twice school,
like going to Princeton.

1299
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:18,550
I'm working in finance and
that's something that I
could personally relate to.

1300
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:22,080
Going to a private boarding
school, it was mostly white, um,

1301
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:26,410
and studying econ and math at
Harvard and like working in tech. Um,

1302
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:30,610
but I think the differences are you've
been in one job since you graduated

1303
01:15:30,611 --> 01:15:32,650
college. It's very rare. Um,

1304
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:37,680
you've also kind of achieved a lot of
professional success before you've settled

1305
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:39,370
out in marriage and having kids.

1306
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:43,480
Like do you have any advice
for millennials who are
kind of navigating places

1307
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:47,350
that aren't necessarily built for them
but are also having to adjust like,

1308
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:52,150
you know, seven jobs in a
lifetime and um, you know,

1309
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:55,720
like the career clock in your biological
clock not necessarily be in sync.

1310
01:15:56,570 --> 01:16:00,530
My major advices, um,
what I think is just true,

1311
01:16:00,531 --> 01:16:01,730
if you follow your passion,

1312
01:16:01,731 --> 01:16:05,860
you're going to be successful no matter
what because one, you'll be happy. Um,

1313
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:09,230
and I think happiness is really important.
You can't do anything.

1314
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:13,400
Well if you're not happy, you can't be
a good parent, good spouse, girlfriend,

1315
01:16:13,401 --> 01:16:16,670
boyfriend.
You can't be a good coworker.

1316
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,880
Happiness is important and that
doesn't mean euphoria everyday,

1317
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:23,960
but a basic sense of peace.
And for some of us,

1318
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:27,650
especially type A, and especially
people are hard on ourselves,

1319
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:30,290
we don't give each other
give ourselves a break.

1320
01:16:30,590 --> 01:16:34,670
And so the pursuit of happiness as
we have it written obviously in our

1321
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:39,620
declaration of independence is
something that is, um, challenging.

1322
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:44,270
So pursuing happiness. I do think is
important as a pursuit of anything else.

1323
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:48,110
I also think my big advice is to
millennials is stand up for you what you

1324
01:16:48,111 --> 01:16:51,230
believe in.
Do not back down.

1325
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:55,460
And that doesn't mean you have to do it
with a fist in the air or um, you know,

1326
01:16:55,461 --> 01:16:56,900
with,
with the,

1327
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:02,150
with the aggression you can
do it with grace and um,

1328
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:07,010
I cannot be talked out of what I believe
that that doesn't mean like in my core

1329
01:17:07,011 --> 01:17:07,880
values,

1330
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:12,800
you cannot me that racism will
ever be a path to something good.

1331
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:17,240
You cannot convince me that excluding
people is ever leads to a better outcome.

1332
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:21,110
You cannot convince me of that.
I will not be moved.

1333
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:24,980
I will not compromise that point of view.
And so as a result of that,

1334
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:28,100
I'm going to do everything I can to
keep pressing those perspectives.

1335
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:29,330
And I think if any,

1336
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,360
any issue I have with some
of the millennials that
I've had the opportunity to

1337
01:17:32,361 --> 01:17:37,340
work up close with, don't be compliance.
You know, just you know, you were,

1338
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,340
you were taught. Sometimes winning
is the path of least resistance.

1339
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,030
And I think this is now more than ever,
or your voice and you know, being,

1340
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,670
being willing to put
yourself in harm's way.

1341
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:50,360
It's like the question of losing a job.
I know it sounds like I'm being flip.

1342
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:54,980
I've often asked myself, do I belong here?
Should I walk out? Nothing is worth us.

1343
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:57,530
And you know, I think that, you know,

1344
01:17:57,531 --> 01:18:00,860
just really pushing yourself to understand
that sometimes certain things are

1345
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:04,190
just going to have to walk away. If
you really, really, really believe it,

1346
01:18:04,191 --> 01:18:07,870
you've got to stand up for
something. So, you know, I, I would,

1347
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:11,540
I went to this program at
the Aspen Institute, the
Henry Crown fellows program,

1348
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,870
and we were in these small leadership
groups, 20 people and skip battle,

1349
01:18:14,871 --> 01:18:19,100
who's this amazing guy and known
in Silicon Valley was my moderator.

1350
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,410
I have so much respect
and admiration for him.

1351
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,660
And one day we were in the
room and he said to me, melody,

1352
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:26,750
I know you will do good. I was
like, 30 years old. He goes,

1353
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:31,250
but will you stand in harm's way? Will
you put yourself in harm's way? He's like,

1354
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:35,630
you could go through your whole life
just doing the easy path and feeling good

1355
01:18:35,631 --> 01:18:37,550
about yourself and patting
yourself on the bat.

1356
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:39,680
But when you allow yourself to be hurt,

1357
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:44,750
will you allow yourself to
have a tremendous setback
because you stood up for

1358
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:45,740
what you believed.

1359
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:51,010
And that forced me to really think about
the path of least resistance and saying

1360
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:54,350
versus believing that I will
allow myself to be harmed.

1361
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:59,750
And then I started to think about people
like John Lewis Standing on the Edmund

1362
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,190
Pettus bridge.
And I start to think,

1363
01:19:01,191 --> 01:19:04,130
I literally cannot even say
this without calling up saying,

1364
01:19:04,131 --> 01:19:06,050
could I have that kind of courage?

1365
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,050
And I think this is the moment
we're standing in right now.

1366
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,770
We have to have that John Lewis courage,
that Martin Luther King, courage,

1367
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:17,390
that dog's turned on. Teenagers,
fire hoses turned on people courage.

1368
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:20,000
Because I think that if we were
standing there, I was standing there,

1369
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:23,780
I think I would run. And now
I'm telling myself, stand.

1370
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:29,090
So millennials, you've got so
much power and control. Use it.

1371
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,420
Last question. Hi Melody. Um,

1372
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:40,770
I was actually watching via live
stream and then I realized, well,

1373
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:42,690
I might as well just come and see you.

1374
01:19:42,691 --> 01:19:45,210
And you said instead of
just through the computer.

1375
01:19:45,211 --> 01:19:50,211
And so as a Latina and as someone that
has had to exercise my muscle of bravery

1376
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:55,830
all year at Google,
it's just thank you.

1377
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:58,170
Thank you for reminding me.

1378
01:19:58,171 --> 01:20:02,400
Like even this week I had to be
very brave and I was very scared.

1379
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:07,140
And so I help lead our efforts
for Latinos here at Google and,

1380
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:11,370
and really like this, the
past two weeks, I just,

1381
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:16,980
there's so much more that we can do as
Googlers for our Googlers, but our users.

1382
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:21,750
And so I want to know like, what do you
think we can do as Googlers for our, our,

1383
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:23,640
our family of Googlers,

1384
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:28,590
for our families as Googlers
and for our users. Because,

1385
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:33,270
you know, we're, we're really trying
to, to figure this out, um, with,

1386
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:34,440
with everyone.

1387
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,380
And so the good thing is that the
intention is there and that will lead to a

1388
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:41,190
good outcome. The one thing I should
say, you can't be brave without fear.

1389
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:44,370
So just always understand that
it's a necessary ingredient,

1390
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:49,250
ingredient to courage and bravery is
fear. It's overcoming it. You know, it's,

1391
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:50,670
it's not the absence of fear.

1392
01:20:50,671 --> 01:20:52,740
It's overcoming the fear
that leads you to be brave.

1393
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:57,520
So we all just have to
understand that that's a
vulnerability, but an honesty. Um,

1394
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,520
the other thing in terms of
what I think you all can do,

1395
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:03,390
you have the most magnificent voices and
you have the most magnificent platform,

1396
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:05,220
probably one of the best
in the entire world.

1397
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:07,650
And when I'm saying use
that power for good,

1398
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:11,520
I do think you have unique
opportunities to do so. And to me,

1399
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:13,890
I think your opportunity
is to preach tolerance.

1400
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,170
It's not about one idea
being right or wrong.

1401
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:18,480
It's been tolerant of
ideas that are different.

1402
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:21,840
And that's where it seems
like our conversations have
really broken down in our

1403
01:21:21,841 --> 01:21:25,230
society. Respecting someone's
right to have a different opinion.

1404
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:29,700
And that's why I said at Ariel,
it's hard to do. You know,

1405
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,800
in the different Scott pages book,

1406
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:34,700
he said if you were in a meeting and you
find yourself violent leak disagreeing

1407
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:35,543
with a colleague,

1408
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,240
you just stand up and clap because you're
going to have a better outcome just

1409
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:40,290
from that disagreement.

1410
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,460
And so I think the idea that
you can use this platform for,

1411
01:21:43,461 --> 01:21:47,250
of tolerance and use these voices,
which are magnificent,

1412
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:50,100
as I've said multiple times now,
because I really think they are,

1413
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:54,090
you are so unique, so educated, so bold.

1414
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,930
You are innovative. You've done something
that has never been done before.

1415
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:00,330
You show growth that
we've never seen before.

1416
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:04,560
You've created an environment that I
literally, I could just move in, you know,

1417
01:22:04,561 --> 01:22:07,770
literally, um, what do you need
here? It's up for like a toothbrush,

1418
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:12,210
but I'm sure those are in the bathroom,
right? So, you know, bottom line, I mean,

1419
01:22:12,211 --> 01:22:16,020
I think that there's something so special
here to galvanize that the way you've

1420
01:22:16,021 --> 01:22:18,810
galvanized it with this great,
tremendous,

1421
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:23,640
never before seen corporate success can
be galvanized into greatness globally

1422
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:28,200
with this voice and you representing
Latinos, um, is wonderful.

1423
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:31,260
And you knowing them,
knowing the responsibility you have,

1424
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:35,640
you have a responsibility. Own this.
It's not about Google, it's about you.

1425
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:38,700
Thank you so much.

1426
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:42,170
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1427
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,270
Thank you everybody for coming.
Thank you so much.
