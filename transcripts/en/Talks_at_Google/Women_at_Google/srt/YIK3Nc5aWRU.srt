1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,750
Thank you. Hi everyone.
I'm Jeff [inaudible].

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,780
I'm the vice president of global resorts
at Burton and I've had the pleasure of

3
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:18,450
knowing Kelly Clark for 18 years.
She is absolutely incredible,

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,580
whether it's helping us out with a resort
photo shoot or helping us introduce

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,900
really young kids to snowboarding and
physical education in elementary schools.

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,670
Kelly has always made the time,

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,150
whether it no matter what
community she's living in,

8
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:34,830
she always wants to give back.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,570
Okay.

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,290
If you take a look at her career,
it's absolutely incredible.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,360
Spanning 18 years,
five Olympics,

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,310
three Olympic medals,

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,930
eight u s opened metals
and 14 x games medals.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,710
Now, if you stack her against the top
female athletes, if you look right there,

15
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:05,450
that 47% wind rate is outstanding,

16
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,220
so 47% of the time she entered a
snowboard competition, she won.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,830
So impressive. If you stack it
against the top male athletes,

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,730
once again, you'll see how
impressive that win rate is.

19
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,880
So I'm very honored and excited to
introduce Kelly Clark to you today,

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,960
but before I do that,
I want to share one of her winning moments

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,153
also

22
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,570
in the history of this event coming out of

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,460
riding for Burton snowboards.
This is Kelly. Hello

24
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,510
today, and it was typical Kelly
Clark. She drops in for her first run,

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,450
puts down a score of 86.88 the
highest of the day. The other riders,

26
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,030
she's not too far ahead of crop cassoulet.
What did she do on her second round?

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,890
She ups it by three points. 89.33 and
I would not be surprised, right? Yeah.

28
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,890
Can we put down a run in the 90s even
though she goes even though victory,

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,580
can we put an exclamation point on this?
When you look at the standings tomorrow,

30
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:18,330
are you doing
and she's doing so right here.

31
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,490
Look at how high she's leading on that
transition right below the big hunting,

32
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,820
keeping a hard edge to get flat bottom.
Absolutely massive.

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,130
Carrie did just put it on.

34
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,700
Wow. Ladies and gentlemen, Kelly Clark.

35
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,300
Okay,
thanks for the introduction Jeff.

36
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,070
I'm thanks everybody for coming
and hanging out with us today. Um,

37
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,550
it's a, it's a huge honor
for me to be here. Um,

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,380
I'm excited to get the share some
of my life, some of my process. Um,

39
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,920
sports have such a good way of just
illustrating kind of life's principles.

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,320
Um, I've been with, um,

41
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,490
with Burton snowboards
for the last 20 years.

42
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,410
This marks my 20th year with the brand,

43
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,630
which is a pretty incredible
relationship I've had with them.

44
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:23,650
I've had a abnormally
long snowboard career. Um,

45
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:28,310
I'm technically very old to be
a pro snowboarder at 35. Um,

46
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,390
so it's, uh, it's been really fun though.

47
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:36,391
I've really learned everything that
I've learned to kind of develop into the

48
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:39,070
person that I am through snowboarding.

49
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,340
They have kind of a rubber meets
the road type of ability to,

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,480
to show you what you're,
what you're capable of and
show you what you built. Um,

51
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,780
I always say I trained 30 seconds,
uh,

52
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,780
high train for years for 32nd half pipe
run. So there's a lot that goes into the,

53
00:03:55,781 --> 00:04:00,310
behind the scenes that people don't see
any snowboarder's in here.

54
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,620
Any, any skiers in here? A, okay.
You guys can stay. We still like you.

55
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,130
I was up in Tahoe last week and um,

56
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
there's a lot better snow than
there has been the last few years,

57
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,420
so it should be a really fun winter.
Um, I grew up in Vermont. Um,

58
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,420
I live in Sacramento currently and I
started snowboarding when I was seven.

59
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,640
It was the first year was even
allowed at my home resort. Um, 1990.

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,970
I always say that I started
snowboarding before it was cool. Um,

61
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,050
there was no such thing as the winter
x games and it was long before it ever

62
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:41,560
became an Olympic sport. And
honestly, I never wanted to compete.

63
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,900
It was really,
uh,

64
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,700
I actually was a ski racer and I
skipped enough ski racing practice to,

65
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:49,150
uh,

66
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,540
have my parents stopped paying for that
just so I could snowboard all the time.

67
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,440
And I never wanted,

68
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,980
I never want it to compete because
the kind of ski racing vibe was really

69
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:01,000
cutthroat and competitive. And as a young
kid I did, it just didn't appeal to me.

70
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,140
And I had the opportunity to go to the
high school where it was essentially a,

71
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:10,000
a private school where I could go to
school half day and snowboard half day.

72
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,860
And that sounded like a
pretty good gig to me.

73
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,150
And I just knew I wanted to spend more
days on the hill and to be able to go to

74
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,930
this school I had to compete.
So I thought, okay, I'll,
I'll get in the competition.

75
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:24,400
That was when I was 14 years old and I
actually just kind of fell in love with

76
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:27,610
him. It was, um, I was
halfway decent at it,

77
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,390
which was great and I really enjoyed it.

78
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,520
And then I remember you don't often think
you make big decisions when you're 14

79
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:37,354
years old.

80
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,580
It was 1998 and it was the first year
that snowboarding became an Olympic sport.

81
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,620
And I remember I had
recorded it on a VHS tape.

82
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,120
Anybody VHS tapes,

83
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,740
I probably like recorded over an episode
of friends or something. But I, uh,

84
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,460
had recorded the Olympics snowboarding's
debut and I remember everything about

85
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:02,330
that day. I remember where I was,
I remember what I was wearing,

86
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,790
I remember what the weather was like and,

87
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,710
and I saw snowboarding
become an Olympic sport.

88
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,270
And I knew right then and there that
this was a dream that I wanted to give my

89
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,720
life to. And, um,

90
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,480
four years later I found myself
and my first Olympics in 2002, um,

91
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,080
and then followed it up with
Italy in Torino, Vancouver, Sochi,

92
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,850
Russia. And then my last
Olympics was in Korea. Um,

93
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,380
so over 16 years,
uh,

94
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,930
I've had the privilege of representing
my country five different times. And, uh,

95
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:38,210
I have one last draw all that.

96
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,860
I've had a wide range of
Olympic experiences. Um,

97
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,660
and it's been fun to kind
of pull on those and,

98
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:48,470
and see the personal growth
growth in my life. Um,

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,300
you know, through snowboarding
I've learned to be successful,

100
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,200
so to speak.
I've learned a great deal about failure,

101
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,560
but more so than anything I've
learned to enjoy what I do.

102
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,180
And that's what I want to talk about
today. How do we not only be successful,

103
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,920
but how do you actually thrive in the
environment that you're in? And you know,

104
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,600
I live in a performance culture
every weekend in the winter.

105
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,410
I go out there and see what I built
and see if I have what it takes.

106
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,120
But you don't have to be an Olympian to
find yourselves living in a performance

107
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,890
culture. Um, you know,

108
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:32,891
we only have to pick up our phones to
have a glance at social media and start

109
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:35,000
comparing ourselves to one another.
It's,

110
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,320
it's where we find ourselves living a
lot of the time is in this performance

111
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:43,610
world. Um, but the,

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,250
the good news is,
is just because we live in this culture,

113
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,800
it doesn't mean that culture
gets to live with inside of us.

114
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,380
So there's a few things that I want to
touch on today that have really helped me

115
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,020
learn to thrive in that environment
and that performance world.

116
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,550
And I'm just going to hit on those and
I'm going to tell a few stories to kind

117
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:03,230
of illustrate that.
Does that sound good?

118
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,960
So we talk about performance, culture. Um,

119
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,730
but what does that actually
mean in the performance world?

120
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,550
It says,
I wonder if I'm enough.

121
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,850
I will sacrifice respect
and honor to get ahead.

122
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:25,100
I will work for everything and I
will compete to earn what I deserve.

123
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,460
And this is the big thing.

124
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:32,510
External success is the only thing
that matters and it performance world.

125
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,570
So those are the things,
that's the place we find ourselves in.

126
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:37,640
It seems pretty extreme
when I lifted out like that,

127
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,700
but those are the things that's,

128
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,900
that's the race we find
ourselves in a lot of the time.

129
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,060
And I'm just going to touch on
thriving here for a minute to, um,

130
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,590
how many of you guys have succulence at
home? Anybody proud? Succulent owner?

131
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,470
Would you say they're thriving or our IP?

132
00:08:55,471 --> 00:09:00,390
Succulence maybe rip succulents.
Huh? That happens. Um,

133
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,400
you know,
you can be successful and not be thriving,

134
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,440
but it's hard to be thriving
and not feel successful.

135
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,360
And it only takes us looking at our house
plants to see if something's driving.

136
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:14,760
And usually when something's
driving it means that it's growing.

137
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,770
And that's honestly what
it means to thrive. If
something's growing, we say, oh,

138
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:21,870
we put that plan right
where it needed to be.

139
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,280
We gave it the right amount of water.
It's in the right environment.

140
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,750
And when it grows, that's, that's what
we say. Hey, it's my plants are thriving.

141
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:35,730
I don't know how many green thumbs
we have in here, but I know, um,

142
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,000
you often think you're
thriving when you're winning.

143
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,330
You think you're thriving
when you're successful. Um,

144
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,800
but as I'll kind of dive into this,

145
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:47,610
success just looks like growth and that's
what we need to be doing in our lives

146
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:49,890
and that's, that's what we need
to be putting in the win column.

147
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,830
So the few things that I,

148
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,250
I want to bring up that I've really
found in my career that have helped me be

149
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:04,950
successful and thrive and
enjoy what I do. Um, honestly,

150
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:06,330
it all starts with our identity.

151
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,140
It's so easy to get a sense of self worth
and a sense of significance wrapped up

152
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:16,500
in our performance. Um, in
sports we see it the most.

153
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:20,340
We see the roughest transitions when
people want athletes retire because they

154
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:23,940
get so much of their self worth
and their performance. And it's,

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,910
it's a natural thing to do. That's how
we identify each other. When we meet,

156
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,630
when we meet people who say, Oh, who are
you and what do you do? You know, it's,

157
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,830
it's, um, it's very easy to find
yourself operating in that place.

158
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,700
But I'd like to propose that success
isn't what we're looking for.

159
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:44,160
I think we're looking for a deep sense
of significance and I think we try to

160
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,460
fill that with success
and with performance.

161
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,980
I know I've done that a ton in my career.

162
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,530
When your self worth is a
tied to your performance,

163
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,480
we can't take risks. Um, think about it.

164
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:04,650
If I'm in a snowboard contest and,
um,

165
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,450
I'll actually use an example from,

166
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,890
from Russia heading
into the 2014 Olympics.

167
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,240
I was a heavy gold medal favorite.
Um, I was supposed to perform well.

168
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,330
That was, uh, I was probably,
if I looked back at my career,

169
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:22,230
that was probably kind of the
prime time of my snowboard career.

170
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:26,190
And I was 30 years old and it was my
fourth Olympics. I had kind of all the,

171
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,200
all the bugs out of my system.

172
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:30,990
I was pretty comfortable knowing what
I wanted to accomplish that time.

173
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,130
And uh,
when we showed up for the event,

174
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,060
it was a 55 degrees and if
anybody knows what snow does,

175
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:45,210
when it's 55 degrees, it becomes
very challenging. And, um,

176
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,080
I took my first run at a 1:00 PM and three
rounds of competition happened before

177
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:57,310
my final run, which was around 9:00 PM.
And if you can imagine in those terms,

178
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,370
the pipe deteriorated.
I'm in epic fashion.

179
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,770
When I showed up for finals, uh, I moved,

180
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,890
I remember it took five runs in
practice for finals and I moved my 10 83

181
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:14,410
different times and I
couldn't get it to work.

182
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:17,320
I fell five runs in a row
in my practice for finals.

183
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,970
And now that doesn't necessarily mean
you're going to a fall in the contest,

184
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:25,660
but especially at the Olympics like you
want, you want your practice to go well,

185
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,140
it's going to kind of set the tone
for your performance that evening.

186
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,170
And I remember I went down
and I saw a sea of team USA.

187
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:38,620
People kind of staring at me knowing
that the train had completely fallen off

188
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:43,600
the tracks. And I saw my
sports psychologist and I
looked at her and I said,

189
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,260
hey,
you know what?

190
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,090
I actually need to go and have a good
cry and then I think I'm going to be

191
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:50,380
ready.
Um,

192
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,070
I think if your significance and your
personal view is tied to your performance,

193
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,030
you really can't take those
risks that you need to.

194
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,240
And because everything in life
is an opportunity or a threat.

195
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,110
And I needed to look at that
moment as an opportunity.

196
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,210
And in a performance world,

197
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,750
we're at our worst when we're
afraid we ever seen somebody,

198
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,910
uh, hardest store. If someone
drowning, you know, when,

199
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,110
when somebody goes to save them,

200
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:22,900
they actually tried to drown the
person that's trying to save them.

201
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,470
We are at our worst when we are,
when we're afraid.

202
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,990
And I was looking at these next two
runs in the Olympics. I had waited,

203
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,060
um, for years. I had spent an
entire lifetime since I was 14,

204
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:41,740
investing in this dream and it's
going as bad as it possibly can go.

205
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,510
Um, after my ugly cry, I went
to the top and I said, okay,

206
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,490
this is an opportunity to overcome
a bad situation. And uh, you know,

207
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:53,740
what happened?
My next run I went and um,

208
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,070
I landed my 10 for the
first time that night,

209
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:01,870
but took off early on my seven and I hit
the deck and I like to call it like a

210
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:04,180
reverse Taco.
If you can imagine that.

211
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,130
I bounced to the flat reverse
Taco and I fell an epic fashion.

212
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,830
Um, and I was probably more prepared
for first run fall than a poor practice.

213
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,190
I knew even though I'd
fallen six runs in a row,

214
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,440
I still had an opportunity if I was so
caught up in the expectation of being the

215
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:24,310
gold mental favorite,

216
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,880
if I was so caught up in maintaining my
reputation and what people thought and

217
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,670
what I even demanded of myself,

218
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,170
I would not be in an opportunity
that would be in a threat.

219
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,450
And in a performance world,
we need to be at our best. Um,

220
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,950
I went back to the top, I saw
my coach and uh, you know,

221
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,540
we had been through this scenario a
lot of times it was first run falls,

222
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:51,220
it happens. I, this last week I
was counting up a bunch of my, um,

223
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,030
my competition bibs and I have over 190.

224
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,760
And so those first run falls,

225
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:03,350
it's happened a few times and I went
back up and um, to be quite honest,

226
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:07,940
it was the, it was the hardest thing that
I ever did. But I told my coach, Hey,

227
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,730
what an opportunity. Six runs.
I've fallen consecutively.

228
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,200
I was the last person to go over the
entire event cause I'd qualified first for

229
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:15,621
finals.

230
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:20,621
So we run in reverse order and I dropped
in and I landed a run and it was good

231
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:25,850
enough to put me on the Olympic podium
and I'd fallen six runs in a row,

232
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,520
only Atlanta my seventh,
when it mattered most.

233
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,050
And I was so proud of my performance.

234
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:35,210
It wasn't necessarily
my best snowboarding.

235
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:36,890
I've still boarded a lot better than that.

236
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,490
But to overcome that personally
in that situation, um,

237
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:46,040
I was really able to,
to those situations,

238
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,880
they reveal where your identity is.
When you look to what you're,

239
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,750
what you're responding to around you
and how you're gonna react in those

240
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:57,920
situations. We need to be our
best and that sort of outlook,

241
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,030
looking at things as an opportunity is
really a big way to do that. Hey guys,

242
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:06,580
doing you off the quiet?
Everybody good? Um,

243
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,760
so the next thing I want to touch on,
um,

244
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,240
is we need to have a
healthy idea of success.

245
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,850
If you want to thrive in
a performance culture,

246
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,400
that's something that you're
going to have to work out.

247
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,930
What does success look like to you?
Um, you know, honestly, that's what I,

248
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,680
that's what I set out to do with my book.
Um,

249
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,000
I wanted to help people define
success in a healthy way. Um,

250
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,010
as you can gather,

251
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,040
my idea of success doesn't necessarily
isn't confined to just winning.

252
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,910
If I were to say what my
personal definition of it is,

253
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:49,210
I want to be able to look back at my
journey and say I was really faithful with

254
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:53,960
the opportunities that were in front
of me and I didn't let one go by.

255
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,100
And I also asked myself if I was growing,

256
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,040
if those two things are
happening in my life,

257
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,940
if I made the most of my
opportunities and I had some,

258
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,400
some measure of growth,
honestly that's,

259
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,860
that's more successful than
you could ever hope to be. Um,

260
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,680
and the last,

261
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,800
the last thing on my little mini list
here that I want to set you guys up with

262
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,160
is, you know, after 20
years of snowboarding,

263
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:26,390
I've come to the conclusion that
if your dream only includes you,

264
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:30,230
it's too small of a dream.
Um, I found that were,

265
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,090
were really thriving in life when other
people are involved. Um, you know,

266
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:37,700
whatever culture you live in,
whatever dream you're building,

267
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,260
if you're the only one in it,
it's just too small of a dream.

268
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,490
If you build your, if you build
yourself, your influence will go away.

269
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,100
When you're no longer performing,
you yourself.

270
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,720
If you only build yourself.

271
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,760
We have to figure out how to build
things that will outlast our ability to

272
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:57,594
perform.

273
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,190
So a few of the just kind of
fundamental building blocks,

274
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:05,530
we've got to work out that identity piece.
Uh,

275
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,510
we have to develop a healthy idea of
success and we have to find value and

276
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:11,344
building others.

277
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:17,280
But the most important thing that I've
learned throughout my career has really

278
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:21,390
helped me thrive. Um, I've learned to,

279
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,770
to look at the things that no one sees
and treat them as more valuable than the

280
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,750
things that everyone sees. Um, if
it sounds strange and unfamiliar,

281
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:35,100
it's because it is. It's not, it's
not natural. It's not our Goto,

282
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,353
but the,

283
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,550
the world inside of me and the personal
victories and the winds that, um,

284
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,880
aren't on TV that nobody beyond my
friends and family will ever see.

285
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,863
Um,

286
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,520
those are the things that I value much
more than any placement than any metal

287
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,383
that I could win.

288
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,290
The world inside of you has to be more
important than the world around you.

289
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,620
If you ever find yourself,
um,

290
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,930
if you ever feel like life is
happening to you, uh, it's a pretty,

291
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,580
pretty good indication that you're
not living from a value set and making

292
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:15,510
decisions. You're not living
intentionally. You're living reactionary.

293
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,910
And, um, we really have to work on
this inner world, this idea of success,

294
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,830
this identity stuff are our big
picture and building others.

295
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,283
Um,

296
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,620
and we have to learn to treat the things
that nobody sees is more important than

297
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:36,450
the ones that are on display.
So there's a,

298
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:37,284
um,

299
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,850
how many of you guys watched
the Olympics is last year?

300
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,040
Anybody catch the woman's
halfpipe? How's there? Um,

301
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,990
you know,
this is a,

302
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:53,991
this is the ultimate story of valuing
things that no one sees more than what the

303
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,100
NBC cameras we'll show you.
Um,

304
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,290
I set out to do the
impossible. Last year. Uh,

305
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,910
no woman from the u s had ever made, made
five Winter Olympic teams in any sport.

306
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,270
And, um, you know, um, I've been
the veteran now for, I don't know,

307
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,330
10 years and snowboarding. Uh, uh,

308
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,020
the women that I compete with are quite
literally half my age. If I, I remember,

309
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,400
I believe it was two summers ago,

310
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:28,170
I was on the podium with two women and
if you added up their ages at literally

311
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:31,890
equaled mine and I'm not,
I'm 35.

312
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:33,660
It's like I'm not old.

313
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,680
I didn't think I was old until I look
around and they say the TV shows that I

314
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:41,470
like aren't funny because they
have live studio audiences. Um,

315
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,870
it's interesting. It happens
quick, but you know, I,

316
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,350
I knew this would be my last,

317
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,370
my last Rodeo. It would be the last
time I got the chance to do this.

318
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,010
And in January I found myself name
until the Olympic team. And um,

319
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,080
it was in mammoth, mammoth
mountain, California,

320
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:04,390
which was my home resort for a long time.

321
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:08,410
And it was just a sweet when at that
final Olympic qualifier, now they,

322
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,380
they named the Olympic qualifier
or they named the Olympic team.

323
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:14,410
Last qualifier is only two weeks
before opening ceremony starts.

324
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,750
So it's not this, you know, you're
on the team for a long time.

325
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:23,950
There's literally two weeks and I think
the night that you get named to the team,

326
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,160
the team manager is calling you to book
your plane ticket because they need to

327
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,260
pay for it.
And um,

328
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,760
there's a small contest that falls in
between when they named the team and when

329
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:38,761
we go to the Olympics and it's called
the x games and a lot of people will,

330
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,850
you can look at it two ways and you go
look at it as an opportunity or a threat.

331
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,900
You could say,
hey,

332
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,080
this is a great opportunity to go to
this big event and get ready for the

333
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:50,890
biggest event. Or I could play
it safe and saying, you know,

334
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:54,400
I don't want to get hurt. I should
probably protect myself and play it safe,

335
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,310
which is something I've
never been good at.

336
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,750
And best way to get ready for a big
contest is going to a big contest.

337
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:05,560
And so I go to this event and I'm trying
to get my snowboarding and where it

338
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:08,910
needs to be. And my first run
is pretty good. I think I'm set,

339
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:13,570
it's sitting in second or third
place and I'm pushing myself,

340
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:15,430
trying to get my snowboarding
to where it needs to be.

341
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,130
And in my second run I
go down extremely hard.

342
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,120
I hit the deck again and bounced
to the flat and I actually was,

343
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:29,500
was pretty okay up until that
point. But when I hit the flat, um,

344
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,910
my left knee was so crumbled,

345
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,590
I was so crumbled in my left knee,

346
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:40,591
hit my left shoulder and I heard
a loud pop in my left knee.

347
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,080
And I remember sitting there with the
Mega Moe Follow Cam ski guy in my face

348
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:50,800
with a camera not being able to breathe
because I'd knocked the wind out of

349
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:55,090
myself thinking I'm pretty
sure I just blew my ACL.

350
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,720
And I'm thinking,

351
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:03,721
I just made the Olympic team and I don't
think I'm ever even going to get to go.

352
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,670
So I picked myself up.

353
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,200
I go down to the bottom of the pipe and a,
the u s team,

354
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:15,610
we have all of our doctors and
surgeons on hand and I said, Hey, uh,

355
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,060
I pretty sure I heard a pop.

356
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:23,860
And I'm pretty sure I just heard my ACL
go and my knee and I can feel there's,

357
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,450
there's fluid in the back of my,

358
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,610
my top of my calf above my boots
filling fluid and my joints beginning to

359
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,550
stiffen up.
And um,

360
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,220
so we go there and x Games has their
team of orthopedic surgeons and on my own

361
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:40,060
team of Ortho Orthopedic Surgeons and uh,
there's a manual test you can do.

362
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:43,690
You guys are familiar to kind of see
if you have an end point. So they,

363
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,500
they're doing all the manual tests,

364
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:50,300
multiple high level orthopedic guys
are all with testing my knee and they,

365
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,490
they think I have an end point.

366
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,810
Like we think you have an ACL but we're
going to have to wait till Monday and

367
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,430
we'll get the MRI and we'll
figure out what's going on.

368
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,660
Monday comes around and um,

369
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,310
the radiologist is looking at the films
after my Mri and they can kind of, um,

370
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:07,991
they,
they,

371
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:10,460
they know how to read the films and they
can kind of get an idea of what's going

372
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:14,300
on in there. So I was asking the guy,
I was like, Hey, do you, do you see a,

373
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,170
you see my ligaments in there? You know,
how's it, how's it look? And he's like,

374
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:19,580
you know,
I don't know much about your ligaments,

375
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:24,290
but I do see the tibial plateau fracture
that's clear as day. And I thought,

376
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,960
I'm sorry, what? He's like, yeah,
the fracture and your Tibia. That's,

377
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,240
that's a really clear to see.
I don't know if you have ligaments or not,

378
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:36,140
but definitely broke your leg.
And uh,

379
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,190
I didn't, I didn't see that coming. I, uh,

380
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,780
I talked to my surgeon that night and I
say, what, what's going on? And he said,

381
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:46,820
you, you have an ACL, um,

382
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:51,260
you have a severe bone bruise and
you've cracked your Tibia plateau. Um,

383
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,560
the good news is is it's in an area
where it's not extremely weight bearing,

384
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,770
but you definitely have a
fracture. And, uh, so what,
what does, what does this name,

385
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,150
you know,
what are we looking at now?

386
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:08,450
We've got maybe a week and a
half until we fly to Korea.

387
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,040
So we get my coach on the phone and we
look at everything and they say, hey,

388
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,520
you know,
we think we can get you through this.

389
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,420
And, uh, he said, here's the plan.

390
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,510
We brace you up with this
giant mechanical leg.

391
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,960
We medially load your knee to create a
little bit of space in your joint and we

392
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:35,380
load you up on a Wada and Usada
approved anti-inflammatories.

393
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,660
And,
uh,

394
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,360
you have to agree not to
practice up until send me, uh,

395
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,810
qualifiers for the Olympic
Games. And I said, hey, I,

396
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,490
I think, I think we
can do that. Um, but I,

397
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,090
I had to ask my coach, I said, hey,

398
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,410
if you want to send somebody who
perhaps doesn't have a broken leg,

399
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,520
I would give up my spot. I understand.
I understand that. And he said, no,

400
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,040
I would always bet on you,
you know,

401
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,960
and so I have the most
incredible support team. Um,

402
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,500
and I put full faith
and full trust in them.

403
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:17,501
And I flew to my fifth Olympic Fifth
Olympics with a fractured Tibia.

404
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,270
I remember I was late for my plane,

405
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,260
actually in San Francisco and I was
trying to get to the plane quickly and I

406
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:27,500
couldn't even run, walk. It was
excruciating. And I'm thinking,

407
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,420
what am I doing?
I got to Korea,

408
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,550
we gradually got me in the gym.
Um,

409
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,000
I didn't practice for the entire event.

410
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,440
I think I took three runs in
the halfpipe before qualifiers,

411
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:48,350
qualifiers came around and I just barely
snuck in there cause I mean every half

412
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:50,760
pipes, so different. Um,

413
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,350
and I'm honestly learning to ride with
the mechanical leg sort of brace was very

414
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:58,950
new and very challenging for
me. Um, and I snuck in there,

415
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,220
they took 12 people in the finals
and I qualified in 11th. You know,

416
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:06,610
it was not my best snowboarding,
but I made it. Yeah. And um,

417
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,950
I was honestly believe in the dream.
Again, at this point I was thinking, Gosh,

418
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:16,620
I've overcome so much. I totally, I
totally want that fairy tale ending.

419
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:19,740
I want that. I want that
metal. I want one more,

420
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,550
kind of just a fairy tale ending.

421
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:28,100
I wanted to finish well and um,

422
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,460
I can honestly say the day of Finals,

423
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,590
anti-inflammatory pills, uh, adrenaline,

424
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,690
whatever it was,

425
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,960
I can honestly say my injury did
not affect my performance that day.

426
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:45,630
I,

427
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:50,630
I rode lights out as the kids
say out of my mind and I rode,

428
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,790
I rode so well. I put down three
runs that were perfect in my mind.

429
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,480
I could have dealt with less
tears and more practice,

430
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,710
but my performance said day, um, it
was as good as it could have been.

431
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:11,610
I put down some of my best runs
at my fifth Olympic Games and,

432
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,500
um,
I came so far,

433
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,270
overcame so much,

434
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,350
and I was waiting for my final score to
pop up and I didn't see the letter or

435
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,380
the number one,
two or three,

436
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:31,180
but I saw the number for pop up
and I would remain in fourth. Um,

437
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,260
keeping my Olympic streak alive to never
worse than fourth, which is pretty good.

438
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,570
But a fourth,
uh,

439
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,810
you only get your participation
medal from the Olympics,

440
00:28:40,811 --> 00:28:44,000
which is probably controversial in
itself, just patient metals. Um,

441
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:49,350
but I didn't get on that podium and
I remember standing there and I had a

442
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:56,661
microphone put it in my face and in
front of millions and millions of people,

443
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,280
I was asked for a reason why this
didn't work out, what happened, Kelly,

444
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,270
what went wrong.

445
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,140
And I had every opportunity to find a
reason why I actually had a good reason

446
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:16,260
why I'm I, yeah. Ps, I broke
my leg two weeks ago. Um,

447
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,030
but you know,
what happened?

448
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:23,031
The world inside of being popped to the
surface and I was able to respect the

449
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:27,510
people I was competing with.

450
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,590
I was able to respect the
judging and the formats.

451
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,100
I was able to keep my integrity and
keep my honor and the world inside of me

452
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,290
proved to be much bigger. The world
that I was in at that time. Um,

453
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,943
you know,

454
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,380
people always ask me what one
of my Olympic medals, which I,

455
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,510
I brought with me today,
I'll, I'll let you guys all
check them out at the end. Um,

456
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,780
you know, which one of your Olympic
medals means the most to you.

457
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,530
And I've really found that
they're very prestigious,

458
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:11,531
but it's what they represent that gives
them value and you value things based

459
00:30:12,351 --> 00:30:17,270
off of what they cost you. Um, you know,

460
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,430
some of these metals are more
expensive then, um, perhaps the one,

461
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:24,980
when I was 18, you know, uh,

462
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:29,270
I won Olympic gold in Salt Lake City
when I was 18 years old. And it's a,

463
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,260
it's easy being a rookie. No
expectation and pressure. Um,

464
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:39,190
Russia I would say is probably my favorite
metal because I know what it costs

465
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:43,280
me. It was so expensive. It
took everything that I had.

466
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,020
You know,
my,

467
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:50,020
my idea of a fairy tale ending was
one more shot at that Olympic podium,

468
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,580
but I think standing upright in
the face of loss and the face of,

469
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,243
um,

470
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,530
disappointment was perhaps the most
valuable end than I ever could have had.

471
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,030
And that moment was much more costly.
Keeping your integrity costs a lot.

472
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,350
Sometimes you don't find it
and very fun situations often.

473
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,150
Um,

474
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:19,010
but I'm beginning to see that perhaps I
should view that experience differently

475
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,980
because of the success and the,

476
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:26,981
when that actually happened on the inside
of me that people wouldn't say wasn't

477
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:31,670
necessarily successful. No one
knew, knew what I overcame that day.

478
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,690
Um,
you know,

479
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,820
at the end of the event I went,

480
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:43,390
I went home and I had hundreds of text
messages and voicemails and emails and,

481
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,740
um,
I kind of just blurry eyed,

482
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,800
stared at my phone and there was
one message that popped up that

483
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,580
caught my attention and I think speaks
to the value of what actually happened

484
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:04,550
that day. It's from one of my, uh,

485
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:09,610
my longtime manager who I've been with
since I was 15 years old and he had

486
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:12,460
watched, he'd watched the event, um,

487
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,190
on TV with his son and he wrote me
this email I'm going to read to you.

488
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:22,040
He said, congratulations on an amazing
finals. If you've taught me one thing,

489
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,060
it's that we're fools to allow the
judgment of others to influence our own

490
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:30,140
appreciation of performance.
This seems especially true today,

491
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,250
having seen each of your Olympic
runs over your long career.

492
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,060
I can say this with some of your
best work, you started strong. Yes,

493
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:39,290
strategically contained,

494
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,140
pushed it further in the second
and under the greatest pressure,

495
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:46,880
crushed it in the third and reminds me
of Turino where you did more for women's

496
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,960
snowboarding than most gold
medal performances combined
your enjoy listening to

497
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:53,360
Todd Richards commentary about
what he thought about your run.

498
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,440
I saw your interview after
the event with Tina Dixon.

499
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,980
I could see and feel your
frustration and disappointment,

500
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,690
but your maturity and
perspective prevailed and you
showed class and composure

501
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:07,160
that few athletes could muster.

502
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,500
Benny who is a son who is now 14 was
watching with me and he asked me,

503
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,780
dad, how can she be so calm and nice
after that? I smiled when he asked me

504
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,250
when he asked me that
through five Olympics. Kelly,

505
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:27,830
you've managed to find so many ways in
addition to winning and metals to inspire

506
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,020
people and we better than they
could have previously imagined.

507
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,510
And as much as I know you want it to
win and I wanted you to win as a parent

508
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:35,344
would,

509
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,980
it's much more precious and opportunity
to discover a moment of such magnitude.

510
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:44,360
And as an athlete have such profound
talent and historical significance to

511
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:46,160
demonstrate the values you embody.

512
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,100
There will be many metals
awarded over these Olympics,

513
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,050
but I know Benny would have
asked me that question,

514
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,750
had you not thrown down the runs you did,
been dealt,

515
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:56,120
the scores you received and
handled that the way you did.

516
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,250
And in terms of inspiration,

517
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,840
it's moments like that that can make a
huge difference in a kid's life and in

518
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:06,410
the world. I'm so proud of
you, Kelly, what you've done,

519
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,670
who you are and how you've lived your
life and I've been a privileged to be part

520
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:14,780
of it. And the effect you have on people
transcends results metals and transcends

521
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:15,614
snowboarding.

522
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,270
I can't wait to see how you inspire people
outside of the halfpipe whenever that

523
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:20,960
may be.

524
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,920
And I promise you that I'll support you
in those efforts however I can for as

525
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:25,754
long as I can.

526
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So we measure success based off of what
color metal we get and we don't always

527
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:38,200
place a value on things like this.

528
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,030
That was the message that I needed
to hear when I went home. Heartbreak,

529
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,230
heartbroken that day.

530
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,950
Realizing that there's so much
more than just performance.

531
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,760
Um,
it wasn't something everyone saw,

532
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,480
but perhaps it's more valuable than
a million gold medals could ever be.

533
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,620
We have to build things that outlast
our ability. Perform to perform.

534
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,320
Yeah.

535
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,190
My life is a testament
to going after a dream.

536
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,170
We're supposed to go after all that's
in our hearts with an hit all of our

537
00:35:13,171 --> 00:35:17,310
potential. And it's not going to be all
rainbows and butterflies all the time.

538
00:35:17,311 --> 00:35:21,570
There's going to be a lot of hard days,
but it should be enjoyable. I think.

539
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,020
We think everything should
always be fun. And, um,

540
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,710
people are also here what I do
for a living and they say, well,

541
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:32,070
I must be really fun. And I'm
like, it is really fun. Um,

542
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,900
and a lot of people, especially
professional athletes are
like, why do you do it?

543
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:39,540
And you're like, it's so fun. Like,
I'm sorry. It's like, spoiler alert.

544
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,570
It's not always going to be fun.
What? It should be enjoyable.

545
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,490
And if you can work out

546
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:49,560
how to not be defined by what you do,

547
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,870
how to build others up,
how to define success in a healthy way,

548
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,520
and how to value the things that no one
sees more than the things that are on

549
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:01,090
display.
Um,

550
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,530
you will have a successful career and
there's going to be a lot of growth.

551
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,250
You're going to be thriving and you're
going to be enjoying what you do.

552
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,740
Um, you know, for me
as a, as a snowboarder,

553
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,820
I've had a very long career and I've
had more success than anyone could ever

554
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,060
dream when I was 14.

555
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:28,920
I've had more success than I
ever began to dream about. Um,

556
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,670
and I'm so thankful and it's
been such a privilege. Um,

557
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:37,530
and if it was about accomplishing things,
if it was about winning things,

558
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,470
I honestly, I probably should
have stopped a long time ago.

559
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,620
You have to figure out how to
make what you do. More than that,

560
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,990
you have to figure out how to develop
something inside of you that will sustain

561
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:53,310
you no matter what environment.
And you go into, um, you know,

562
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,560
burnout doesn't come
from too much activity.

563
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,190
If anybody should be burned out,
it should be me.

564
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,050
I've done a million snowboarding contest.

565
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,840
It really comes from unmet expectations.

566
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,850
And so if you can spend time
developing that inner world,

567
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,080
you're going to be able to go into any
world and hit your potential and be your

568
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:17,970
best and enjoy it and always remember
that if your dream only includes you,

569
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,490
it's just too small of a dream.
Thank you.

570
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,130
I was curious at the beginning,

571
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:34,900
you said you are training Oise for
basically 30 seconds of a halfpipe run and

572
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:39,880
I'm curious how you go about sort of
maintaining that mindset of training when

573
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:41,170
the actual live performance.

574
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:45,360
It seems like to me it seems like it's
always like so far away and such an

575
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,533
uplifting time.

576
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:47,571
You know,

577
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:51,380
I think you need to have an idea of what
you want to accomplish regardless of

578
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:55,370
what's going on around you. Um,
as I would approach Neil Olympics,

579
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,250
I knew where my snowboarding
was going to need to be.

580
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,240
I think it's easy to get caught
up in looking around to what, um,

581
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,390
my fellow competitors were doing.
Um,

582
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,980
but if you can figure out what
it is you want to accomplish, um,

583
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,330
it's something that you can
work on regardless of what's
going on around you. So

584
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,630
it's, um, you know,

585
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,950
it may look like what we do is
kind of like, oh my goodness,

586
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:29,870
I just tried this trick today. I think it
took me, I think it took me seven years,

587
00:38:29,871 --> 00:38:31,130
the first land at 10 80.

588
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:36,790
So it's very much in the scope of what
you want to and no matter what you

589
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:39,520
accomplish,
and especially in snowboarding,

590
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:43,960
like you're never the best and there
isn't a day that goes by that I'm not

591
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:46,420
challenged. And I think that's
what kept me motivated is I,

592
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,810
I enjoyed the challenge.
I enjoyed constantly learning things.

593
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:51,880
And if I wasn't learning new things,

594
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,130
I probably would've been in
the game for as long as I was.

595
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,610
Hi, I'm so thematic to everything
you've been able to discuss today.

596
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,120
Did you ever have a situation in your
career where you felt disconnected from

597
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:05,900
the things that brought you and
kept you in the sport and if so,

598
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:09,340
how did you recognize it? Disconnect?
How did you identify that was happening?

599
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,290
I talk about a lot of these concepts and
a lot of things that have sustained me.

600
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:16,500
I mean, goodness, I like,
I wrote a book about it,

601
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,050
but there's,

602
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,680
you just never arrive in life and
there's so many times where I have to be

603
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:30,591
willing to examine my heart in situations
where I maybe didn't find my inner

604
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:35,670
world as well developed as I hoped were.

605
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,910
Maybe jealousy popped up.
Maybe I want it to be right.

606
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:42,780
Maybe I want to have an excuse and
the way that I was able to really,

607
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:48,540
you have to be okay not having it all
together. You just, you never master it.

608
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,760
You have to be willing
to be a work in progress.

609
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,240
And when I found myself maybe not
operating the way that I wanted to,

610
00:39:57,601 --> 00:40:00,780
maybe on a feeling really threatened
all of the sudden, and I'm like, wow,

611
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:01,770
I thought I had that figured out.

612
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,530
I thought I looked at everything as an
opportunity and I, I was killing it. Um,

613
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,320
I actually really pulled on other people.

614
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,790
So being in community and allowing
people into your process was really,

615
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:15,750
really healthy. Um, I
think we have the idea,

616
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:19,640
especially in sports where,
I mean in,

617
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:21,180
in all of culture,
we,

618
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,380
we champion a self made millionaires.

619
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,820
We say when you're isolated, when you came
from nothing and now you're something,

620
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,780
um,
I think you can be successful,

621
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:36,510
but it's not very fulfilling
doing it that way. Um,

622
00:40:36,511 --> 00:40:40,040
and letting people in behind every great
athlete is a team of great people. Um,

623
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,420
there's no self made millionaires
in the athletic world.

624
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:44,550
And every time that I failed,

625
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,990
messed up felt like I
learned this lesson long ago,

626
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:51,940
but I was relearning it
for the hundredth time. Um,

627
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,920
it was my coaches and it was
people who believed in me. Um,

628
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,600
on the days that I
didn't believe in myself.

629
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,520
So first of all, thanks for coming
in, fixing things or to talk. Um,

630
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,250
my question is like, you know,
now looking back, you know,

631
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:07,200
after having gone for your career,

632
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:10,480
if you were to look back and talk
to the 14 year old you who were,

633
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,850
was dreaming at the time and how
things have changed since then,

634
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,550
what type of advice and recommendation
would you give them but you didn't

635
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:18,660
necessarily have back then?

636
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,850
Honestly,
the,

637
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:25,410
the most important thing that I've ever
learned in my snowboarding careers at

638
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:27,840
identity thing,
um,

639
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,980
I think not a lot of people get
to reach the top of something.

640
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,391
Most of the time,

641
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:39,230
life is a journey and all of a sudden
I was 18 years old and I won the,

642
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,680
I won the x games,

643
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,490
the Olympics in the u s
open all in the same season.

644
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,280
I'd accomplished everything
I ever wanted to do.

645
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:54,281
And I just had equated that
success meant that I was fulfilled.

646
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,880
And at a really young age, I had to
figure that out. I was like, wow,

647
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:00,230
this isn't what life's about.

648
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,950
My life is not complete because
I accomplished a list of to do's.

649
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,160
I had to develop a strong
sense of self outside of that.

650
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:10,280
And in the sports world
you just see it so plainly,

651
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:15,760
there's such a level of insecurity
and performance culture that is just

652
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:20,940
unsettling.
And so when I look at the young girl says,

653
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,450
that's the number one thing
that I say young athletes,

654
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:28,451
hey you got to figure this part out
before you can navigate this really well.

655
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:34,230
Cause it just, it just makes it, um,

656
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,770
it just doesn't make it fun when it,

657
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,440
there's so much more freedom and so much
more enjoyment when you can sort that

658
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,640
identity piece out.

659
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,210
Uh, three mountains to
snowboard. What'd you say? Oh,

660
00:42:51,211 --> 00:42:52,990
what's your top three
months in system board?

661
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,293
Um,

662
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,060
I lived in mammoth California
forever and I love that resort.

663
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,650
They do a great job kind of maintaining
their terrain parks and then they get

664
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:07,050
like, um, 300 days of Sun.

665
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:11,460
And when it's not sunny
it's just nuking snow. Um,

666
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:17,490
that's a great mountain.
Snow mass in Colorado was really fun.

667
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:21,630
If you like the groomers,
really top notch groomers there.

668
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,880
Um, and then my favorite destination
to go snowboarding would be Japan,

669
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,990
Hokkaido, north island. Japan
is always my number one pick.

670
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:33,570
He ever get the opportunity to go there.
I would highly recommend it.

671
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,420
Thanks so much for couple of Kelly.
I'm curious just on training routines,

672
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:39,470
training for an Olympics,

673
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,150
what did a typical day look like and how
did that change over the course of your

674
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:44,984
career?

675
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,850
Yeah, that's a great question. Um,
well, like I referenced before,

676
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:53,680
Snow Morning Really wasn't a
sport when I started and um,

677
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:57,160
there's so much kind of lifestyle and um,

678
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,350
easygoingness attached to it.

679
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:04,630
And I remember in 2010 I had
been to three Olympic Games,

680
00:44:04,631 --> 00:44:08,590
I had two Olympic metals and
the US snowboard team said, hey,

681
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,720
would you like to come
in for fitness testing?

682
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,950
Like it just wasn't even on our radar
before then. We're not like real athletes,

683
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:19,570
you know? And so, um, I was like,
yeah, sure, that sounds good. I'll,

684
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:23,320
I could, you know, do some
high jumps for ya or whatever.

685
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,280
And I did it. And I was like, Hey,
what, what do I, what am I results mean?

686
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,160
And I'm my trainer to this day,
still bring this up.

687
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:36,090
Every once in a while she says,
wow, you are really mentally,

688
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,320
it must be really mentally
strong. And I was like, wait,

689
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:41,820
it's a fitness test.

690
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,840
Like that's like telling someone they
have a nice personality. You're like,

691
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:49,410
you're, you're beautiful on the inside,
you know? And I'm like, seriously?

692
00:44:49,411 --> 00:44:51,720
And then she was like, yeah,
like it's pretty incredible.

693
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:53,390
We've been able to accomplish.
And I'm like, what?

694
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,860
And hence all this like inner personal
inner world development, you know?

695
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,113
Um,

696
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,350
but I could have either been
really offended or looked
at it as an opportunity.

697
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:08,040
And I said, you know what?
This is an untapped resource.
So in 2010 and I said, hey,

698
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:11,070
let's figure out what it looks like to
train a snowboarder. We don't even know.

699
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,600
There's no data. We know how to train
baseball players and football players and,

700
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,920
but we don't know what does it look
like for ideal body comps in different

701
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:21,810
things. So we, I could, I was like,

702
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:25,820
I give you four years and in those four
years when I was mentioning like kind of

703
00:45:25,821 --> 00:45:29,220
my peak of my year of my career,
um,

704
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:34,221
I went up to winning 86% of the contest
I entered and my consistency and my

705
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:38,400
durability went through the roof. And, um,

706
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,240
I was the only one on the US team and
four year span who didn't require surgery

707
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,440
and I was older than everybody and
I was just like, oh my goodness,

708
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:49,980
this is a incredible resource. And so, um,

709
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,020
that was a big part of the
second part of my career.

710
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:54,420
And heading into this last Olympics,

711
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:59,421
I think I was logging 22 to 24 hours of
dry land training week and it's a lot

712
00:46:00,081 --> 00:46:03,540
of, we lightened lien is
what we would train for.

713
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,750
We'd have two days of cardio.
Um,

714
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,640
we'd have two days of strength
training, three days of core, um,

715
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,700
and they would kind of overlap over
a six day span with one day off.

716
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,860
So lightened lean, a lot of stability
stuff, lot of body weight stuff.

717
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:27,960
Um, I can get more into detail after it,
but it's, it's kind of a work in progress.

718
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,460
And we would profile my body comps when
I would perform really well and we'd

719
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:36,810
start to discover, okay, so I'm performing
my best on my body, looks like this.

720
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,710
Okay. Let, that's our target like
we were starting from scratch. So

721
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,480
thanks for coming. Thanks for everything
you've done for this board. Um,

722
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,840
my question is being a woman snowboarder,
um,

723
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,680
was there a point where you realize that
you are not only a champion for this

724
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:59,890
snowboarding asset sport as a whole but
for women borders and then becoming a

725
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:04,700
household name as a
woman athlete? Um, yeah,

726
00:47:04,701 --> 00:47:09,140
you know, in snowboarding
there is not, um,

727
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,760
the different size ball that we play with.
We are,

728
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:16,790
we're on the same kind of
venue as the guys. And, uh,

729
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:21,620
when, when I was growing up, I was
one girl kind of in a pack of guys.

730
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:22,830
And um,

731
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:27,530
I got on the u s team and I found kind
of a crew of girls to ride with. And,

732
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:28,783
um,

733
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:33,370
there was people who went before me that
really inspired me and that I looked up

734
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:34,530
to a,

735
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:39,580
I remember waiting in line to get
people's autographs at the u s open.

736
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:44,581
And then I found myself having little
kids waiting in line to get autographs at

737
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:48,400
the u s open when I was
18. And I thought, Gosh,

738
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:53,500
I'm in a position to be
able to inspire people. Um,

739
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,030
and that's kind of how I looked at it.

740
00:47:55,031 --> 00:47:59,500
I thought I have a responsibility
and an opportunity to,

741
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,250
to impact people in a positive way. And
I just looked at it as a privilege and,

742
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,210
um, I tried to do my
best knowing that, um,

743
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,770
I really had a lot of influence and,
um,

744
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,950
you know,
there's not a ton of,

745
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,450
I think at Burton we have a woman CEO
and she's been an advocate for women and

746
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,900
for everything from equal prize money to,
um,

747
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,310
women in leadership at the
company, uh, for a very long time.

748
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:32,310
And so we didn't see it as a huge kind
of contrast between the men and women

749
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:37,330
because I think I was so close to it and
our leadership was always empowering to

750
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,760
women.
It just kind of seemed natural and normal.

751
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:41,770
When I kind of grew up a
bit and saw other sports,

752
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:45,160
I realized how unique
snowboarding actually was. Um,

753
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,630
so I just tried to,
to make sure that I was always,

754
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,430
uh, I guess the same person too. I think
anytime you're in a place of influence,

755
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,264
you want,

756
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,240
you want to be the same person that you
are when you're winning or losing at the

757
00:48:58,241 --> 00:48:58,781
top of the hill,

758
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:00,730
at the bottom of the hill when you're
home with your friends and when you're

759
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:05,000
with your family. And so I strive
to live a life of consistency, um,

760
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:08,770
and authenticity because I think that's
a huge attribute and snowboarding that

761
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:12,760
we have a huge value for.
And, um, I think it's,

762
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:17,210
it's been a cool journey to see the sport
grow, especially with the young women.

763
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,161
Again,

764
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:26,161
sort of like a question about how you
deal with challenges and like when you

765
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,960
take these massive slams,
you touched on this a little bit,

766
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,230
but was wondering if you could go to a
little bit more detail about what do you

767
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,370
really thinking about,

768
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:38,371
like how do you actually get yourself
to like come over that hurdle right then

769
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,500
and get yourself up and go again?

770
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,660
Um, my coach has a saying, uh,

771
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,470
it's, uh, if it was easy
everybody would be doing it.

772
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,900
And um,

773
00:49:55,890 --> 00:50:00,750
I heard that often at the top of
the pipe when I was discouraged.

774
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,960
Um,
you know,

775
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,250
I kind of always had an idea that nothing
was impossible and I wouldn't let my

776
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:12,700
circumstances decide things for me.
So even when I did take those big crashes,

777
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,490
when I did take those big falls,
it was a mix of,

778
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,860
of personal drive and then
people believing in me and
speaking into me as well.

779
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:25,380
It was those coaches,
it was those friends.

780
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:30,381
It was the people being willing to ask
for help and not have it together all the

781
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:35,801
time and being willing to be challenged
and fail to know that eventually you,

782
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,900
uh, what does it, uh,
Thomas Edison, you know,

783
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:42,710
we just learned a bunch of ways
not to make a light bulb, you know,

784
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:46,940
using all those failures as like,
wow though in one way not to do it,

785
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:49,820
I guess I should try again.
And you want to stay, you know,

786
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,360
snowboarding especially it's,

787
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:54,350
it's a high impact sport and you want to
stay within your ability level when you

788
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,770
take this and you want to be
realistic. And so, you know,

789
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:02,030
in document my coaches do you
think deserves a realistic
trick for me to work on

790
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:06,410
and what kind of steps am I going
to need to take to get there?

791
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,170
And not everything's instant.
Um,

792
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,840
and I think,
you know,

793
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:16,490
getting strong enough to take those risks,

794
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,930
especially as I got older in my
career was really helpful as well.

795
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,400
So I knew if it didn't go well,
most likely I would bounce.

796
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,820
Hopefully I would bounce.
I was kind of, my plan

797
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,970
was a good plan or not.

798
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,270
Was there a specific trick or anything
else that made you more nervous than

799
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:42,060
usual before run or an event?
Um,

800
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:46,430
typically your most difficult
run or you're your most
difficult trick is the one

801
00:51:46,431 --> 00:51:50,600
you think about, but it's kind
of a catch 22 because, um,

802
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,960
you really can only focus
on one thing at a time.

803
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:59,260
I remember we had a sports psychologist
come by our team one time and he gave us

804
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:00,410
two tennis balls.

805
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:05,600
One guy was supposed to throw it up and
down really quickly and the other one

806
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:10,220
was supposed to be thrown across the room
and we were told to keep track of how

807
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:13,940
many times each tennis ball was thrown.
After about 20 seconds, he said,

808
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:16,600
would you come up with, and we're like,
ah, we all lost count. And I said,

809
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:20,780
that's the point. And you can't focus
on two things at the same time. Um,

810
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,780
and my 10 80 was probably
my hardest trick.

811
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:29,410
But if I was thinking about doing a 10
80 on my third hit when I dropped in for

812
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:36,740
my first hit guarantee you I would
fall first, hit on a straighter.

813
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,430
So you know,
you want to anticipate those things,

814
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:44,420
but by the time you get to those events,
by the time you get to the Olympics,

815
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:48,380
like you should have it figured out.
Those are muscle memory things.

816
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:50,720
It's not something that
they can be intimidating,

817
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:54,050
but it's not going to be something
you're going to have to think your way

818
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:56,420
through.
Your body knows what to do by that time.

819
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:01,330
And it was really a battle to,
um,

820
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,720
really just stay on the task
at hand or in the moment.

821
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,470
Uh,
I remember I was hiking up,

822
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:13,130
one of my friends that I snowboard with,
I snowboarded with for a long time.

823
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:18,860
She had the same coach and she was
talking through her run with Ricky and my

824
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,340
coach. And it's, it's gonna look
like this. I've got to do this,

825
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:26,710
I've got to do this. And then I've
got to look here on this, on this. Uh,

826
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,570
I've got to be careful to keep my speed
and that, and I'm like, listen to her.

827
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:35,040
Like, Whoa, that's a lot. And Rick,
he looks at me and he says, Hey,

828
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:38,160
what are you going to do kid? I
said, I'm going to do a good drop in.

829
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,300
And they just looked at me and they
just laughed at like, seriously?

830
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:46,620
That's your plan. I'm like, totally,
everything else is, I know how to do it.

831
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,120
I just have to make sure I get in there.

832
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,280
And so it's a fine line between being
prepared and then in the moment,

833
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:56,730
actually letting your body know what it
knows how to do. Thanks so much Kelly.

834
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,810
Thank you very much guys.
Another round of applause. Maybe.
