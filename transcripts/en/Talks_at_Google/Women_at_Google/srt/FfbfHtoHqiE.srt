1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,740
You want to start by telling you
something about yourself that you may have

2
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:16,540
forgotten. Is that okay?
All right. So here it is.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,583
Ready?

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,030
You are wonderful.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,090
And now we'd like you to amplify that
by pointing to the person next to you.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,790
Make eye contact point to them with
your finger. This finger pointing. Okay.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,820
And we're gonna all do it at the same
time. All right, pick the partner,

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,610
look at them and I point and let's go.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,090
You are wonderful.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,270
And now point to yourself and say hi am
wonderful and now point to all of us and

11
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:50,880
say we are wonderful.
And that's the truth.

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,580
Say it.
That's the truth.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,350
And we do this exercise. It's
a great warmup exercise, right?

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,550
But it's also the truth that
when all of us were little,

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,630
we lived in a technicolor world and life
was wonderful and we had the capacity

16
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:12,200
for amazement, but something happened
and we lost that. And how I learn,

17
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:16,160
I believe that that what was
lost was the experience. So full,

18
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:19,850
a liveliness and the, that's what
we're looking for. We wanted again.

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,940
So our view is that we
live in an interconnecting,

20
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:27,440
interactive universe in which
everything there is in the universe has

21
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:30,290
connecting.
And that's the core word that we use.

22
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,000
And we've been studying for decades now.

23
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:38,090
How come people don't feel
connected and connecting?

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,340
And what we discovered is there's a
fundamental thing that happens that all

25
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:45,260
human beings,
we've picked us up in the,

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,910
in the clinic and we also find it's true
in all the ecosystems we've worked at.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,190
There is an objection to difference.

28
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,910
And the objection to difference
has something to do with
the fact that we're not

29
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:56,510
connecting.

30
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,770
So there's a paradox there and you
can't get to connecting by objecting to

31
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:05,270
difference so that you have
to do something else. So
objecting to difference,

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,920
um, producers or polarization and when,
what we would like to do is produce,

33
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,810
connecting. And Helen's
going to talk about, uh,

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,660
this in just a moment, but our
primary discovery was about talking.

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,130
We thought it was about helping people
solve problems. What we discovered,

36
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:25,910
it's about talking and the talking is
the most dangerous thing most people do

37
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,580
listening.
It's the scariest thing.

38
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,420
And the most infrequent because if you're
listening, you may hear something that,

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,330
uh, dissipate your own view
of how the universe works.

40
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,560
But most people can't talk about their
difference or about their needs without

41
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:40,820
going into polarization.

42
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,610
So we are excited to share with others
the fact that there's a new relational

43
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,630
science and new technology that has
never existed in the world before.

44
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,640
Marriage therapy has been
very murky in past. Uh,

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,100
and people have long to get along,

46
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:07,900
but they just don't know how
something breaks down. But,

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,660
um,
in this new relational science,

48
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:15,661
we emphasize that conflict isn't
a bad thing in the relationship.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,290
We phrase it conflict is
growth trying to happen.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,120
If you hold the conflict right,

51
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,570
you'll both discover something new and
transformative about each other and the

52
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,660
relationship.
Um,

53
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,730
and the problem with conflict
is that people wait too long.

54
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,580
John Gottman,
anyone heard of him?

55
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,790
Top marriage researcher in the country.

56
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,040
A lot of you raised your hands.

57
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,850
He says if you have a pain in your chest,

58
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,020
the average time it takes to pick up
the phone and call nine one one is four

59
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,854
hours.

60
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,690
If you have a pain in your
relationship and your heart's breaking,

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,150
the average time it takes up to pick up
the phone and call the doctor is seven

62
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:01,984
years.

63
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,120
People wait too long and some of that
reason and then the problem's so big,

64
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,030
it's harder to deal with the,
um,

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,500
the reason people wait probably is they
don't know that there was something that

66
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:18,400
can really help.
And now we're so glad to share that fact.

67
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,060
It's so good now that we work with someone
who says we could end all divorce on

68
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:26,610
the planet.
And um,

69
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,720
his thought is that boyfriend a
couple applies for a marriage license.

70
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,270
Shouldn't it be like a driver's license?
I mean,

71
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:39,271
shouldn't you have to like read a manual
and take a test and maybe show a little

72
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:43,750
proficiency before you get your license
and make the most important decision of

73
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:47,530
your life? So, and also
the, it's so simple.

74
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:52,120
This stuff can be taught in grade school
now and is beginning to be taught in

75
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:56,800
grade school and ref.
If we're raised learning this,

76
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,620
um,
this technology of relationship,

77
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,390
we would really have a
transformed, you know, family,

78
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,700
workplace, place, world.
So, um, basically,

79
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,110
um, Harville and I were dating and, um,

80
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,640
uh, I was divorced. He was
divorced and I said, Harvel,

81
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,640
if you could wave a magic wand,
what would you like to do with your life?

82
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:23,980
And he said, ah, I just,

83
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,960
I'm so curious,
why do couples fight?

84
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,780
And he began to share some
of his thoughts. I said,

85
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,700
tell me what are your thoughts,
but are they,

86
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,700
as they came out after dating for awhile,

87
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,280
I proposed and he agreed to marry me.

88
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,400
And this book got written and
when it came out in the first,

89
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,880
um, two months when it
came out, I thought,

90
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:55,570
who's going to buy a book
by a man named horrible?

91
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,900
I was really worried about that.
But apparently Oprah read it.

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,540
And then she, they, a
studio called and said, um,

93
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,840
we liked him on the show.

94
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,320
So she took his show and submitted
it to the emic committee and that,

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,080
oh, that show one, Oprah, her
first Emmy. So she had him on,

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,333
um,

97
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,120
about 15 times and pretty soon
the book was in 60 languages.

98
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,680
And, uh, it's a system, a
therapy system called a Margo.

99
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,720
And there are 2,500 a Maga therapist
who've gotten training in 37 countries.

100
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,880
So we know this stuff
works. Uh, we just, um,

101
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,410
we're talking with some of the other
relationships scientist and we co,

102
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,050
cause we were all saying this stuff is
you shouldn't have to pay for therapy.

103
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:51,120
It's gotten so simple. So we, uh,

104
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,150
we'll tell you a little bit
later about the fact that, uh,

105
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,960
these therapists had tried to do
this in one city and we're doing, um,

106
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,300
we're disseminating this information
in Dallas and if it works in Dallas,

107
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:05,150
it's going to go global.
So it'll tell you about that in a minute.

108
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,790
But we're now going to ask,

109
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,790
we're going to show you the technology
of safe conversation and then we're gonna

110
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,270
ask you to sit next to someone
and do what we do and learn.

111
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,280
Learn this,
practice

112
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,030
Europe with the person with whom
you exchanged. Wonder. So, um,

113
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,560
when Helen and I were dating,

114
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:31,000
she mentioned that early
in our relationship we
discovered that we were both

115
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:35,260
very intense people,
positively and negatively.

116
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,240
And one day we're having a,
uh,

117
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,490
one of our negative intensities
in her living room and Helen said,

118
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,800
uh, stop this one of us talk
and the other one listen.

119
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,500
And so that was sort of
broke the cycle and we did.

120
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,150
And one of the other illicit.

121
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,500
And we found that it regulated
us in a way that was surprising.

122
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,680
And I was in the clinic at that time
and began to couples learn to talk in a

123
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,000
different way,
um,

124
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,140
and sort of as a result of that and began
to study talking and that most people

125
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:15,150
talk in monologues or parallel monologues.
I talked, I talked to you talk,

126
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,640
I talked to you and talk. We, we
don't talk, we don't interface.

127
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,570
And what we wanted to do is change.

128
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:27,070
That's a vertical way of talking wound
to change that vertical to a lateral.

129
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,210
And we developed this
process called a dialogue,

130
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,230
which we rebrand and Dallas
called safe conversation.

131
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,690
We want to show you briefly,
uh,

132
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,810
what the structure of that looks like and
to see that what we discovered is that

133
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:48,040
conversations that have a structure and
a process tend to produce safety and

134
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:53,041
connecting conversations that are
random and don't have a process tend to

135
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:57,780
sometimes produce safety and connecting
generally produce polarization in chaos.

136
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,400
So there's a simple,

137
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,730
some simple processes can
transform conversations and
we can get back a sense of

138
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:09,900
connecting, which we think is
so in indigenous to our nature,

139
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,250
that's what we really want.

140
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,450
So safe conversation is the foundational
tool and it's guests got a steers.

141
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,530
The structure I was talking about
fundamentally is to learn the practice of

142
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,320
mirroring. And let me see
if I got it. As you can see,

143
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,530
we put in some sentence stems.
Let me see if I got what you said.

144
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,980
Then the second thing that's important
is accuracy, accuracy, check. Uh,

145
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:36,290
in research on listening,
there's a seven,

146
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,600
a 13% accuracy rate than
what most people here,

147
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,670
87% distortion rate.

148
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,870
So it's really important that you
say to somebody who's talking to you.

149
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,610
Let me mirror that back. Let me see if
I got that. Did I get it? And then, uh,

150
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,880
the other thing that most people don't
do is say, is there more about that?

151
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:57,660
They usually say, well, you'd
done and now it's my turn to talk.

152
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,550
Then we go through validation,

153
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,530
which is to see the sense that they're
making and to empathy to reflect back the

154
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:08,550
feelings. Now that's a
structured conversation. You
can do it with just a mirror.

155
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:12,920
Wayne, you can do validation or
empathy. Helen and I want to, uh,

156
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:14,971
we're going to do a,

157
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:17,940
like a five minute demo of that and
then we're going to ask you to do that.

158
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,420
One of the things that we discovered in
great conversations is nuance that it

159
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,210
has very little to do with what
is big but has to do with small.

160
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,500
And one of those is icontact.
Um,

161
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,750
many people walk around with hard eyeballs
and their pupils are small and that's

162
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:40,160
what we call the glare. And you remember,
have you seen glares around? Uh,

163
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,730
you can look at somebody's face and you,
cause that person has clothes,

164
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,500
pupils are small.
You can read that.

165
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,540
So what we help people do is identify
the hardness of the and the smallness of

166
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:55,080
the pupil hardness of the eyes
and switch it to the gaze.

167
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,610
This is the kind of face you want to look
at while you're talking where there's

168
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:00,450
receptivity,

169
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,080
where the pupils are large and you
know that what you're saying is being

170
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,400
received. And so we also help
people regulate the flow.

171
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,750
That is somebody who's talking to you and
you stop listening and you know you're

172
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:15,360
being flooded to how to sing. He's
just raise your hands. Say God,

173
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,000
can you hold on a minute, let me
mirror back what I'm hearing so far.

174
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,530
Just regulate your own input instead
of getting over flooded and saying,

175
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,720
I can't listen to anymore,
are reacting to it.

176
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,100
So here's what the bureau
of an appreciation and
looks like as a conversation

177
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,340
and this is what Helen,
I are going to do. So

178
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,450
now we are,

179
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,980
we've decided that we're guests going to
do a one way because of the constraints

180
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:47,250
on time here. And the one way, um,

181
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,290
we'll be that Helen is going to send
me some information and I'm going to

182
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,980
respond on the receiver side. She'll
be the sender and I'm going to be, uh,

183
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,873
the receiver

184
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,880
and we're teaching the
technology, uh, that, uh,

185
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,020
my expressing an appreciation. But
uh, this is the technology can you,

186
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,050
you can use when you have a frustration
with someone yup. And you can, uh,

187
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,370
then it will make any
conversation go better. So, um,

188
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,370
yeah. And one other thing is we think
of it as a vehicle, like a truck.

189
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,200
It's like thinking of it as a drug.
And this is the way the truck works.

190
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,290
You can put any cargo on the trunk
and it will go to any market.

191
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,260
If the truck doesn't work,
you can't get the car go to market.

192
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,610
So this is the truck

193
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,420
and you've got the sentence
stems in your seat.

194
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,130
So you'll be using this
patient can do it with darn,

195
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,960
or if you want to turn in
your ma in your handout,

196
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,230
you can see a mirroring and appreciation
is the title of the extra credit that's

197
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,240
up on the slide. So dope. So horrible.

198
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,010
Is this a good time when I could give you
an appreciation? Yes. Now's a good time.

199
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,040
Thank you. Well, um,

200
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,260
when we practice this
in the taxi coming over,

201
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,070
w what popped out in my mind was your tie.

202
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,490
I just loved that you've
ordered that tie this morning.

203
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:08,850
I haven't seen it for years.
And um,

204
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,180
I just really thought that
was a cool tie to wear.

205
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,920
So if I'm getting this,

206
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,110
the appreciation you have is the
tie I'm wearing that you, uh,

207
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,110
you looked at it and you
hadn't seen it in years and uh,

208
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,900
and you're really appreciating the time.
Did I get that? Yes, I've got that.

209
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,460
So is there more about it?

210
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,990
Um, well that, that tie just in the taxi,

211
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:35,370
it just made me feel exuberant
and joyful for Nice thought.

212
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,680
So the tie made you feel exuberant and
joyful? Am I getting that? Yeah, yeah.

213
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,880
So is there more about that,

214
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,980
about the failing? Um, uh,

215
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,170
well I that point I feel that way.

216
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:54,171
It did remind me of my uncle
Jimmy because uncle chimney,

217
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,720
my favorite uncle would always wear
shirts that were real lively and sort of

218
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,380
head little critters from the
farm on them. He would, he'd be,

219
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,370
he lives in Idabel,

220
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:10,371
Oklahoma and it was like fun
trees and flowers and um,

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,070
so it sort of warmed my heart.
Sing that.

222
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,010
So when you had that feeling, it
reminded you of uncle Jimmy on the farm.

223
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,020
You've got all these critters and who
was fun? Uh, did we read that around?

224
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:27,440
So you were a manager of a very warm
experience and very pleasant experience.

225
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:30,950
So by getting that, they get it. They get
all of that. So is there more about that?

226
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,830
Well, yeah, and uncle Jimmy would
play with us. They may go visit. Okay.

227
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,390
But my father,

228
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,420
it was a real contrast and my father who
always wore the business suit and never

229
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,970
played with me or any of the kids.

230
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,150
So it reminded you that,
um, of your father,

231
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,700
his son is very different. He didn't
play with Dewey wore business suits,

232
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,280
more severe clothing and didn't play.

233
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:02,390
And you don't have those warm memories
with him. Am I, am I getting that right?

234
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,220
So is there more about that?
So let me see if I've got all of it.

235
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,790
Um,
if I could summarize it.

236
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,120
You want to give me an appreciation
and the appreciation is of my tie,

237
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,870
which you notice this morning
and when you saw my Thai,

238
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:25,871
you had a strong feeling of exuberance
and joy and when you had that feeling it

239
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,350
triggered a memory of your uncle Jimmy,
uh,

240
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,230
with who had colorful clothes and had
all these animals and looked on her farm

241
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,360
and you know,
really warm memories of him.

242
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,690
And you don't have those
memories of your father who was,

243
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,900
didn't play in which ward more severe
clothing. Did I get all of that? Yes.

244
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,300
Well thank you for sharing that. Thank
you for listening. They're welcome.

245
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,830
And we also make some sort of
physical contact and couples hug

246
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,060
usually for a minute. If
you're not a couple, we have

247
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,810
some sort of physical contact because
the neurochemistry and neurochemical is

248
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,810
released. When you make physical
contact with somebody you're talking to,

249
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,870
it could be either cortisol or endorphins,

250
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,170
but you want to be sure it's correct
that it's endorphins instead of cortisol.

251
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,330
So you'll notice that it starts with an
appointment. Does now good time to talk.

252
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,920
That's what the center does.
People's boundaries.

253
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,380
And just because someone's ready to talk
doesn't mean you're ready to listen.

254
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,180
And when you don't cross a boundary,
you're being, you ask if you can,

255
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,300
uh Oh,
somebody can open themselves,

256
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,980
then you regulate and create more safety,
then you make eye contact.

257
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,000
And eye contact is a really
very important thing to do.

258
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:51,240
When you start a conversation, then you
start sending the message, mirroring it,

259
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,730
and then summarizing it.

260
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:57,731
So what we'd like to do now is ask you
if we could turn on a little light so we,

261
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:01,010
you all can see each
other and we can see you.

262
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,110
If you would practice this and pick
a person that's sitting next to you,

263
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,400
um, and a desk, just do it
quickly. The two and then two,

264
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:15,270
and to all of you all are already
paired over there. There's two,

265
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,060
four,
six people here to four is that two,

266
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,340
four,
six.

267
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:27,341
And maybe you could pair with the one on
the end there and then to four and you

268
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:32,210
pair with the first one on the end over
there. And uh, are you all want to be,

269
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,730
why don't y'all figure it
out? You're smart. You're it,

270
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,220
you're a Google pair up with
somebody awkward. It's like,

271
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,210
could you learn to ski slope or
a little bit, but then if you,

272
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,300
it's a very powerful tool to use
this and all your relationships.

273
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:54,921
So pretty soon you can go down the double
black diamonds swishing and then if

274
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:58,830
you can, uh, as going to be hard, I
think in turn the chairs all the way.

275
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:01,200
Usually we have people
face to face to face,

276
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:05,250
but turn as much toward the person
you're working with as possible.

277
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,770
Also decide who's going to start first.

278
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:12,771
And we want this years to go both ways
and we're going to get you started.

279
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,790
Okay? If you don't have a partner, okay,

280
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,670
here's someone without a partner.
Okay.

281
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,480
Is there any other person in the
room without a partner? Yeah. Okay.

282
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,060
So you're going to partner with you.
All right.

283
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,760
So now, now we're all
part good. So we'd like,

284
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:32,790
I like to get you
started at the same time.

285
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,690
So turn and look at the person
and you all decide quickly, uh,

286
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,850
who's gonna go first?
And I'll,

287
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:43,851
let me just make that easier by saying
the one on the left goes first and you

288
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,810
usually, it's a different thing. If
you're a couple's, it'd be who does,

289
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,020
who talks a lease. And they go first
and who talks the most? They go second.

290
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,280
Decide who's gonna go first
and then make eye contact.

291
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,680
So he got got, who's going first? Okay,
I'm sorry, I don't make eye contact.

292
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:04,080
Make the appointment is now a good time.

293
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,070
So say to that birth is now a good time
to share and appreciation with you?

294
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,550
And you'll be looking at this person
and you'll pick out something about that

295
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:16,110
person. You appreciate it. Now a good
time and you'll say, oh, of course.

296
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:16,944
Yes.

297
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,130
Then make eye contact. Just
pause, just make a pause

298
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,930
and then go into and follow the follow
either the screen or the thing in your

299
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:36,090
lap on mirroring out appreciation.
All right. Get started. Go.

300
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,350
And we're going to give you
five minutes each to do this.

301
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,860
Okay, great. Okay. And keep
going if you're finishing up,

302
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:50,000
but we're just going to have two or
three of you if you'd like to just share

303
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:53,180
what that was like. Yeah. Anything about

304
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,570
just your, what, what happened during
while I was doing this, not a question,

305
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:03,100
but a comment.
Any sensations that you had or thoughts?

306
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,540
Yeah, so even though, what's that?

307
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,610
Oh Gosh. Hello. Um, as you said, it
was a little awkward and structured,

308
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:16,090
but at the same time I did feel extremely
connected to my partner when we were

309
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,470
having the conversations.

310
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,000
Great.
Thank you.

311
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,630
So it felt a little awkward
because of all the structure,

312
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:27,430
but the result was you felt really
connected using that. Thank you.

313
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,700
Anyone else want it anymore?
Yeah,

314
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,990
we ended up going farther off script,

315
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:38,610
but it led very naturally into stories
about where we came from and and these

316
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:42,810
little prompts ended up becoming a
a whole very natural conversation.

317
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,330
Yes. So, um,

318
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:48,370
you went off script a
little and shared stories,

319
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:52,780
but then it became a real
wonderful conversation.

320
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,920
Great, thank you. Yeah.

321
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,880
Normally when I'm having a conversation
with someone when they're talking,

322
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:03,730
I'm not necessarily thinking I'm thinking
of my next response or then you go

323
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:06,730
along with it. But in this thing,
and this, in this scenario,

324
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:09,190
all I was thinking was how am I going
to repeat back what they said and make

325
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:13,030
sure I absolutely understood it.
I'm thinking Alex.

326
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,831
Okay,
Alex.

327
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:17,070
And then there's one more hand and that'll
be it for now because there's time at

328
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:18,600
the end.
But Alex,

329
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,630
thank you for being really vulnerable
that you noticed that you were going to

330
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:27,870
have to mirror,
but then when your partner was talking,

331
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,820
you were aware that instead of marrying,

332
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:36,780
you'd really like to also tell him what
you think or edited or like you were

333
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:41,781
ready to engage with your thoughts
instead of taking the time to mirror.

334
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,840
And so that, that was a real deliberate
thing you had to do. Did I get that?

335
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,790
Thank you. Identical observational.
Pardon me? Same observation. Same.

336
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,520
Same. Uh, so Harvard said statistic,

337
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:57,600
he read about listening
that we get 17% accuracy,

338
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,340
accuracy,
accuracy of listening.

339
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,020
We think we hear and that's why it's
really important to mirror and say,

340
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,960
is that what you said?
Because um,

341
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,340
we do this for CEOs of corporations all
the time that they don't know how to

342
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,760
mirror or here,
but the other people were saying too

343
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,250
and so interesting to see the,
Oh my God,

344
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,720
I got 13% or what usually is that?

345
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,920
The other thing we want to say
is that the structure is awkward,

346
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,080
but it moves into
interacting with your cortex.

347
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:38,340
And so that you actually integrate your
brain from feeling when you go into

348
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:41,520
memories, you go into feelings
and thoughts, feelings,
thoughts, feelings, thoughts.

349
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,780
So that when you engage in a structured
conversation that moves back and forth

350
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,790
between information,
that emotion,

351
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,410
you strengthened the neural pathways
in the brain toward non reactivity and

352
00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:55,260
cohesion.
So it's an interesting structure.

353
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,910
So Helen's going to talk more about that.

354
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,330
So the other thing we said
in the taxi this morning,

355
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,450
we're going to look up the definition
of relationship because um,

356
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,000
cause I think most people think,

357
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,750
and so it would be more official that
the definition of a relationship is two

358
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,520
people and horrible.

359
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:15,260
And I say the definition of a relationship
is two people and the space between

360
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:20,261
them and the focus of the relationship
should not be on either person,

361
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,510
but on the space between
and how successful you are
in your relationships all

362
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:31,010
depend on how safe this space between is.
And so,

363
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,900
um, um, sorry.

364
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,790
So there you are. This is, this
is really the important thing.

365
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,310
Um, and so we, um,

366
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,690
prescribed for people call
a zero negativity process.

367
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,090
It's really hard not to end up negative
around people around you. Just, you know,

368
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,490
just to look in your eye
or the tone of your voice,

369
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,860
much less what you say is often making
someone next to you feeling uncomfortable.

370
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,050
Um, and we emphasized with the zero
negativity process, it's not what you say,

371
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:10,460
it's how you say it. You
can talk about anything, uh,

372
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,440
with Pr, you know, with people. But
if you make an appointment, you may I,

373
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:18,260
and yeah,
I'd like to share this is now a good time.

374
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,080
And then there's a way
to talk about anything,

375
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,060
but it does in a way that isn't received
so negatively because if it's received

376
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:29,240
negatively by that person,
they're not going to want to do it.

377
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,280
So this is a way to get you what you want.
Also taking the time to affirm,

378
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,640
uh, being positive energy
into the space between.

379
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:42,350
So we think that mental health is focused
on the physics of the within. And,

380
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,070
um,

381
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,960
I love being the number two to Harvel
the number one physicist who is really

382
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:51,800
mapping out the science of relationship
in the physics of the between.

383
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,750
So all of this horrible also
woke up one day and said to me,

384
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,890
the couple is the upstream prevention
that can prevent all the down river

385
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:04,400
cleanup.
If we clean up the relationship at home,

386
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,140
then the kids don't get teen pregnancy,
chemical dependency,

387
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,470
street gangs, and, and then
they do better in school.

388
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:16,100
And then there isn't the breakdown of
the economics in the families and in the

389
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:20,390
community. So if we can just bring
this technology really anywhere,

390
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,740
all of this as we're wanting to unleash
it, is going to help we believe,

391
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,340
create a more relational culture.
We have a culture that just,

392
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,490
I think you all are so rewarded.
And me too and horrible.

393
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,600
If we got the best grade in the class,
if we won,

394
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,140
if we'd got to the top of the ladder,
that's how we're rewarded.

395
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:44,120
Our parents just love us when we do
that. Uh, the job, our bosses love us.

396
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:45,980
They give us a reward if we're the best.

397
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,850
And we have a world that's
all about competition,

398
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:55,330
that that can lead to domination to winner
take all to all sorts of things that

399
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:59,240
really aren't healthy for the world,
the human family.

400
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,610
And so we think sharing this relational
technology is really going to help teach

401
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,150
something we all want, which
is collaboration, cooperation,

402
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,580
the creating of win-wins. So, um,

403
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,680
we're really sort of about
a relationship revolution.

404
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,023
Oh,

405
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,410
the thing that we're focusing on is to
discover the problem in working with

406
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:23,700
couples as conversation.

407
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,440
So we had to help them learn how to
talk and then when they learn to talk,

408
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,390
uh,
they did not have many problems.

409
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,350
In fact, the problems were because they
couldn't talk. Does that make sense?

410
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,700
It's kind of a paradox.
And so given that that worked,

411
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:45,540
we knew that then that a human problem,
not just a couple of problems.

412
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,550
And so we want to, uh, decided that
we would spend the rest of our lives,

413
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,440
uh, taking a very small thing called safe
conversation, which you just practice,

414
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,960
uh, in multiple forms and distribute
safe conversations globally.

415
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:05,040
And we started with Dallas and we are
working on a citywide project in Dallas.

416
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:10,041
We have probably impacted now about
5,000 families and on Google a youtube.

417
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,150
Uh, last year we did a global,
uh, but did a big project and,

418
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,570
and um,
I did a multimedia in about 40,000 people,

419
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,880
watched the workshop on Google,

420
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,700
15,000 at any time on Facebook.

421
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,700
And we had about a 20 million
numbers for our media footprint.

422
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,750
So started with Dallas.
But we now see it going globally.

423
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,870
And what we see ourselves doing is doing
something that has not been done much

424
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,170
in our culture. That culture is
focused on individual competency,

425
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,620
on being the best you can be,
own all and winning.

426
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,280
And we're shifting the focus
to relational competency,

427
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,500
which we think paradoxically again, that
when you're into relational competency,

428
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,650
you actually function better as an
individual because neurochemical things

429
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:01,070
happen,

430
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,100
muscular things happen and your immune
system works differently when you feel

431
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:10,101
safe in context and rather than a
feeling challenged and dangerous.

432
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,720
So here's basically what this does
and this is the first piece of it.

433
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,060
We don't have time to do validation.
And empathy,

434
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,540
but fundamentally we want to move
from having a safe conversation,

435
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,840
which is fine.

436
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,610
Anytime anybody wants to talk and needs
to talk for 215 or 20 minutes about a

437
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:30,444
topic,

438
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,750
but to take the things that make
that structured conversation were and

439
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,430
distributed into all conversations
so that we move from making,

440
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,650
having a safe conversation to
making all conversations safe.

441
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,220
Then what we do is regulate, uh, anxiety.

442
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:52,221
We create safety and we optimize then
the human family and re-experience our

443
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:52,951
true nature,

444
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:57,600
which we think is the felt experience
of connecting and the full of liveliness

445
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:02,550
that comes with that and the wonder of
full of likeness. So honoring boundaries,

446
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:05,400
very important.
Anytime we encourage,

447
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:08,910
anytime you talk to is now a good time
to talk about that instead of just

448
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:11,820
walking in and taking over
their cognitive space,

449
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,480
it's not a good time to talk about it.
Then the mirror says, well, let's see it.

450
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:17,280
They said, yes. Well
let me see if I got it.

451
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,950
The new mirror accurately,
you don't interpret change are in,

452
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:27,720
in any way modify the sin.
Accuracy check. Very important.

453
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,160
Did I get that? I get with just
that. And if you did then say, well,

454
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,060
is there more about it?

455
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,830
So to move to curiosity
rather than usually at that
point we replaced the other

456
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:42,460
person with ourselves. We say,
you know, uh, so did I get that?

457
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,390
Well let me, let me tell you what
I think. No, go to the next step,

458
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:49,990
take a pause and say,
is there more about that?

459
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,890
And what you'll find is that it's so
unusual for that question to be asked that

460
00:29:57,071 --> 00:30:00,910
many people will say, well, no, uh,
but if you sit with that then took one,

461
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:05,530
just check in and see new things will
bubble up and then the really rich things

462
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:06,400
will start happening.

463
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,240
I think people put things into words
that before had just been feelings or

464
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,630
thoughts. And then how were they
getting through? Do a quick summary.

465
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:17,120
So it was if I got all that. So you
said, hey, and then you, yeah, it was,

466
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,890
you appreciated this and you felt about
that and that reminds you of something.

467
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,390
And what we found is that whether it's
a negative or positive interaction,

468
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,310
there's always a memory connected to it.

469
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,660
That somehow our past is
always present in our present.

470
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,260
And whether it's a pleasant
thing or an unpleasant thing,

471
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,030
there's a memory that that experience
gets attached to. And if you know that,

472
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,070
then your life makes sense.
If you don't know that,

473
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:43,960
then you wonder why the hell
are you behaving that way?

474
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,590
It's because something in the past
is intruding into the president.

475
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,730
So that's basically what we wanted to say.

476
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:56,320
And we now turn it over to you to see
what you want to say back to us in terms

477
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,110
of thoughts, expressions, questions,

478
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,960
and if you have any questions
we'll make up an answer.

479
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,503
Yeah.

480
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,680
And I think we have now,
how long? About 15 minutes.

481
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,933
Okay.

482
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,230
So this works for appreciations.
What if you have a complex,

483
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:21,850
is the conversation structure the
same? It's a, it's structured.

484
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,530
Oh. And the content becomes a, this
frustration I have with you is,

485
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,920
and then you have to mirror that back and
then there's, they're more about that.

486
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,250
And then, uh, check with the
feeling about the frustration.

487
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,020
I feel real like I want to kill you.
You know,

488
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,090
you're a terrible person and I
feel angry and hurt and so forth.

489
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,330
So you mirror back the feeling and
then, um, then you say, and you know,

490
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,480
at this frustration, all frustrations
are also rooted in memory.

491
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,100
And this reminds me of my father
who did extra, my mother who did.

492
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:58,930
Why there's still the person mirrors
that back and there's a more complicated

493
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,930
thing. If a behavior
actually needs to be changed,

494
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,590
there's a that that would
take a little longer to teach.

495
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,510
But there is a process of identifying
what new do you need from me that would

496
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:15,050
regulate that frustration for you.
So what we encourage people, Helen,

497
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,560
Helen is very good at this saying,
astro what you want.

498
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,090
Every frustration is a wish in disguise.

499
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,970
And most of us don't pay
attention to the wish.

500
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:28,360
We pay attention to the frustration.
Like you were late. You never do that.

501
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:29,260
You've always done that.

502
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,360
And if you ever hear or frustration and
just listen to it, you'll hear the wish.

503
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,680
I wish you were doing on time. I wish you
would call me, you know, before seven,

504
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,500
I wish there's a desire.
So we could say, Oh boy,

505
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:46,280
I've got this thing going on. I want
to really, I'm really frustrated.

506
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,540
What do I want?

507
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:52,670
And then extract from that and go bring
that to the person instead of what you

508
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:57,110
don't like. Then that creates more
safety, more cohesion and more connecting.

509
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,430
So and so,
but that's a long process.

510
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,430
It's just the dialogue that we
did can address a frustration,

511
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:07,960
but sometimes there is another more
structured conversation around,

512
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,820
uh, it's called a behavior
change request. Is there more?

513
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,870
Well, yeah, I guess that
was, that was the question.

514
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:22,390
Like it doesn't necessarily have to
be something someone's doing wrong.

515
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:26,620
Maybe you're picking like the color of
your wall, just one person wants. Right?

516
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:27,560
And One person wants blue.

517
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,580
So you ask someone to explain
their feelings for red and you say,

518
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,150
okay, well I understand your feelings
for red. Right? But that what,

519
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:42,300
so what happens when you do
the relational, something
like safe conversations.

520
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,740
If you're in your lower brain,
the reptilian brain. Do,

521
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,320
have you studied any brain
science? No. No, no. Okay.

522
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,540
Three parts of Reptilian rule.

523
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,970
We can even say there's
a reptilian brain and um,

524
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,910
the near Cortex and the reptilian
brain is fight or flight or freeze.

525
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,280
But the NEOCORTEX kick create,
win wins and just using,

526
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,260
um, you know, I really liked the bedroom
to be blue because I, that is the,

527
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:18,290
that's what I'll really sleep well in
and what I really want red because I want

528
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:20,000
to wake up and feel that.

529
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,820
And if you just go at it without
a structured conversation,

530
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:28,821
you're going to end up in your lower
brain and just saying the sentence stems,

531
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,930
uh, put you in the upper
brain, like in a mirror wing.

532
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:38,070
It puts you up here instead of your,
and you know,

533
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:43,220
the intense down here and you can
better solve a problem around purple.

534
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,380
Yes. That's got a little blue.
It's got a letter read. Yes.

535
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,560
Yeah. It'll be more easy to
find that kind of compromise.

536
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,921
And what,

537
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:58,921
what we discovered happens is if you
hear me and listened to me and can get,

538
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:04,420
my view is that I like
blue and you really get it.

539
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:07,810
So would it make sense that you're like
blue, I don't have to have blue anymore,

540
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:13,090
but if you say bluets sucks,
I have to tell blue. And I,

541
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:15,400
we learned this, uh, actually, uh,

542
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,030
there's a story about we didn't know when
we have six children, so one of them,

543
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:23,500
we were walking to school one morning
and, um, no, no, it was about bedtime.

544
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,190
I don't want to go to bed. I couldn't
go to bed. So we just mirror.

545
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,530
So you really don't want to go to bed.
You don't want to go back. Say it.

546
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:30,364
Say more about that.

547
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,920
I don't want to go bad because they're
always putting me to bed and just

548
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:36,280
mirrored everything and took him by his
hand and walked him down the hallway to

549
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:39,900
his bedroom and sat down and hugged
him and said, good night. He said,

550
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:42,270
thank you dad for listening
and went to sleep.

551
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,800
So I'm here with him and his
objection, uh, dissolved.

552
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,290
He just simply wanted to be heard.

553
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,060
And we find that's basically what's true.
Once we heard,

554
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,840
then we can collaborate and cooperate. If
we're not hurt, will polarize. Alright.

555
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,070
Thank you. And God made us
that way. I don't blame me.

556
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,070
Thanks for laughing at my jokes.

557
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:08,310
And you didn't like the guy when I
have to point them out everywhere.

558
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,600
Anything else we've got it
looks like 10 more minutes.

559
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,003
Yes.

560
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,740
So,
um,

561
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,950
it's easy to imagine that you guys have
this like really perfect relationship

562
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:21,490
because you're experts in
communication and most of us aren't.

563
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:26,200
I'm just curious if there's, we do save
that. Let me see. We do mirror that back.

564
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:31,410
What I hear you say is you expect that
we can talk about communication real

565
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:36,130
comfortably because we're real compatible
and we have a good relationship to,

566
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:39,370
we can put it out there. Did I get there?
Yeah. And I, and I'm very [inaudible],

567
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:43,110
I'm curious to know if there's still
issues these guys are still working on and

568
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,450
what does that look like? Right? So if
you have issues, what does it look like?

569
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,460
Well. Um, we actually were
condensing an an 18 hour workshop,

570
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,300
$850. If any of you want to
come to our workshop. No,

571
00:36:56,301 --> 00:37:00,570
we'll competent to interview at Google
the justice route. We're not going to do

572
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,250
anyway.
And at that workshop,

573
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:09,490
Harvell has given me the permission to
tell the story that I'm about 20 years

574
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:14,840
ago. Yeah. Almost 20 years
ago, our marriage was so bad.

575
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,640
We both had so wanted the
book to get promoted and, and,

576
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,190
but we forgot to do it and we were,

577
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,120
it was so horrible and horrible would
come home when I lift up the book cover.

578
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,260
Hello mister marriage.
And so we find it,

579
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,840
I finally got him to go to a therapist.
Thank goodness,

580
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:34,580
aren't you great therapists in New York?

581
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,090
Well we kept firing our
therapist and they'll end,

582
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:41,360
the last therapist fired us and
called us the couple from hell.

583
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,670
So we went to the doors lawyer and we
told our kids we were getting a divorce

584
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:49,640
and we told all of these and Margaret
therapists were getting a divorce.

585
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,160
So it was really horrible.
And,

586
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,830
and that's when we brought
in zero negativity.

587
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,840
And every night before we go to bed,

588
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,530
we have a calendar now that we
sell to others or give to others.

589
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:05,120
And did I do anything negative? And
he will point. And I did. I did.

590
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,210
And so we do it next year and the kids
to be checked and we've transformed our

591
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:12,590
relationship with them.
So yeah, we're if, if we,

592
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:16,100
if we could do what you any
relationship and turn it around.

593
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,300
So I think it,

594
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,300
I think we need to give the formula
for a great relationship and you will,

595
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:23,901
and,
and a,

596
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,290
and a winner proceeded with the fact
that the relationship has a process.

597
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,440
It's not,
it is not a destination.

598
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:35,441
It's a journey is what matters is how
do you take the journey and how you help

599
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,340
each other along the,
we are partners in the project,

600
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:41,680
not opponents in the project,
in our marriage.

601
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,170
Same thing would happen in any ecosystem.

602
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,560
But here's the kind of of three pieces
that we find indispensable for safe,

603
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,770
thriving relationships where there's
a couple of families, corporations,

604
00:38:56,771 --> 00:39:01,771
congregations of schools you
have to talk without polarizing.

605
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:08,250
And so the structure that we have
developed and took us about 20 years too,

606
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,460
it may look simple but took about 20 years
to put together the pieces that would

607
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:16,640
actually work. Of those of
you who are engineers, no,

608
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,170
it doesn't fall in place.
You have to mess with it for awhile.

609
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,570
So the structured conversation that
we demoed, and there's more than that,

610
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:29,440
two more pieces to that and Helen
just mentioned zero negativity.

611
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,510
What we discovered is you really have
to pay attention to the tendency we have

612
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:38,890
to do put downs and that's what
we call negativities. Like what?

613
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,700
Where'd you get a stupid idea like that?
Where did that come from?

614
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:44,020
I can't believe you would say that.

615
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,900
Nobody in their right mind would
ever say anything like that.

616
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:52,470
You all heard those probably all your
life and none of you have ever engaged in

617
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:57,070
anything like that. I'm sure the Google
is too enlightening to engage in that.

618
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,150
But that's what most of us do. Those
are called put downs, put downs,

619
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,480
trigger a rupture connection.

620
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,380
The trigger anxiety activates cortisol,
no endorphins there.

621
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:10,120
So now you go into your defenses.

622
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,360
Then the only thing you can do
is strategic and be tactical.

623
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,470
So if you were just decide,

624
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,050
no put downs and have a culture,

625
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,770
wouldn't it be great if Google had a
culture of zero negativity culture here at

626
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,130
Google? You may have one and
people are working on that.

627
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,760
And then the thing other thing Helen said,
just to emphasize,

628
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,600
it is affirming of the
person you're talking with.

629
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:38,460
Like thank you very much enjoyed
being with you today. Uh,

630
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:41,620
I really liked being your partner.
It was great to have this time with you.

631
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:43,900
I just can't believe I'm
working with somebody. So smart.

632
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,870
Just sentences like that.

633
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,430
And remember you're creating
safety and if you do negative,

634
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:54,580
you create polarization.
One, it creates safety.

635
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,140
Then you have integration and then you
have creativity that doesn't have a

636
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:00,580
defense built into it.

637
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,770
Then that experience produces connecting
and that produces full of likeness and

638
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:08,650
that's what you want and you
can have it with your partner,

639
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:10,150
you can have it in the workplace,

640
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,650
you can have it with anybody with whom
you have a reliably safe and predictable

641
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,340
relationship through a
conversational process.

642
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,670
So that's all I in any,
any other questions?

643
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,100
I know we have look at
go few more minutes.

644
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,590
Did you want to add anything to add?
Just

645
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,130
a quick question question you have.
I wrote about

646
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,430
um, different attachment styles and you
have like the anxious and the avoidant.

647
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:40,460
I'm curious if you have like an
anxious and avoidant, right? Um,

648
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,950
and the first question is,
is now a good time to talk?

649
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,850
And the person keeps saying,
no, it's never a good time.
There's too much going on.

650
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,660
And obviously the anxious attachments,
I was like, I want this resolved now.

651
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:55,760
Like right now or I can't do
anything else. Um, not that
I speak from experience,

652
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,860
but I'm curious,

653
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,290
I'm curious how,
how do you put this into practice?

654
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,120
Yeah, we've rushed
through the process. Um,

655
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:12,850
are you available now for an appreciation?
Horrible. Could've said, actually,

656
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,380
I'm in the middle of something,

657
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:19,420
but if he says that he has to save weird,
he is available.

658
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:24,520
And then at that time come and get me.
So we,

659
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,593
yes.

660
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,030
So it becomes a culture of
agreement that in this culture,

661
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,710
in this marriage and this
corporate culture, uh, we can,

662
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,490
uh, we can, you can say
no, but if you'll say no,

663
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:44,090
you have to save when and when you say,
when you have to show up then,

664
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,190
because if you don't,

665
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:51,110
you reactivate childhood wounds that
are suddenly done by all families,

666
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,820
which is mommy, mommy, Mommy,

667
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:55,910
let me tell you about the elephant
walking down the street. Mommy says,

668
00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,320
I can't do that right now.
Later and later never comes.

669
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,480
So the kid comes back, mommy
and Mama can't talk to you. Now.

670
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,810
Later after a while, the kid will go
away and not, and not asking anymore.

671
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,710
Or The kid will escalate
until mommy has to talk.

672
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:18,320
And whichever one she responds to,
the kid will habituate as,

673
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,570
that's what you have to do
to get attention around here.

674
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,550
So in order to change it,

675
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:26,150
they have to be agreements that we are
all partners in the project of being

676
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:30,710
together. And therefore if now's not
a good time to talk, that's fine.

677
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,110
And tell me what, because I need
predictability. If you're telling me when,

678
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:41,090
then I'll say fine tomorrow, that's
great. I just know we will talk tomorrow,

679
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,070
tomorrow at 10 o'clock. You show up. I
don't have to come get you. You show up.

680
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,550
So you promise you're
predictable and reliable.

681
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,890
So it has to become a cultural process.

682
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:54,110
So in couplehood where
there's committed partnership,

683
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,670
we invite people to consciously,
uh,

684
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,420
commit to a conscious relationship and
you can also do that in a non intimate

685
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,780
settings.
Am I answering your question?

686
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:06,803
Thank you.

687
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,230
Any, is there more? Is there
any last comment or two?

688
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,670
Does that Oh man mean we're done.

689
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,210
Oh, do you know flat? Uh,
I will say then in closing,

690
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:27,270
we were talking to a room full of
people in Dallas and they said,

691
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:33,000
uh, uh, who, who are quote,
it's an advocate's committee.

692
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,740
It was our first meeting
of the advocates committee.

693
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:35,970
And one guy stood up and he said,

694
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:40,680
you all need to find a really
big tech company because, uh,

695
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,360
and he's in this business world,

696
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:47,361
but he said tech companies promised
that this technology would strengthen

697
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:48,810
relationships.

698
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:53,490
And in many cases the opposite has
happened and you all should partner with a

699
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,410
tech company and get and say,

700
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,700
I'm the tech company that's going to
fulfill the promise that we're going to

701
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:02,010
really strengthen
relationships in the world.

702
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:05,730
So if y'all know of a tech company that
might be interested in talking to us,

703
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,250
let us know. I thought that was,
wasn't that a good idea? Yeah.

704
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,670
If we're wanting to get it out.
Isn't that smart?

705
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,020
Okay. So if I got that
you're saying, yeah.

706
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,310
Anyway,
so

707
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,310
could I give you an appreciation?
Okay.

708
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:27,300
I just want to appreciate what a stunning
appearance you have today and what

709
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:32,070
clarity of thought in this presentation.
Thank you. I've had a good coach.

710
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,350
You've had a good conversation.

711
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,010
I appreciate working with
you because you make me

712
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:43,810
Oh look good. And now we're going
to close up with who are we?

713
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:48,070
We are wonderful.

714
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,120
I am wonderful point.
To the person.

715
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,830
You are wonderful.
And that is the truth.

716
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,490
I the wait.

717
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,660
That changed your neurochemistry the
first five minutes you were in the room,

00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:06,860
sir. That puts you into another part
of your brain. And as Helen Fisher fit,

719
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,720
you listened to her.

720
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,530
A whole other set of
neurochemicals started flooding
through your system instead

721
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:15,550
of cortisol. You had norepinephrine,
all sorts of other goodies.

722
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,780
So thank you for

723
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,930
you are an amazing thank you very much.
