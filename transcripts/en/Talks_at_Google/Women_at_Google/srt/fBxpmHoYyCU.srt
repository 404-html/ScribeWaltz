1
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,103
Thank you so much.

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,310
It's funny that like nobody sat in the
front row but then you guys just became

3
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:20,720
the front row because your
one back we had isn't it?

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,820
I mean, no, I really white weird room.

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,560
I feel like I'm a unlike lights.
I wouldn't say cozy,

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,700
but I would say thank you so much for
giving up your time and coming to hear us

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,870
chatting. We would do well to have
like a little fireplace here or yes,

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,920
a comedically oversized
fish tank and maybe drinks.

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,610
Yeah, well yeah that happened.
Um, okay. Great. Thanks so
much for joining us today.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,440
Of course your book is amazing. Everybody
should read it. It's fantastic. Yeah.

11
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:57,890
But I want to talk with you a little bit
about your home life and where you came

12
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,180
from,
I'm sure.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,920
So you've made the rounds from a
comedian to an actress to a writer

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,640
and you write a lot. Like if something
doesn't work out then I just,

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,570
you write a lot in your book about
your home life and cove and how that's,

16
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,540
so can you tell the audience a little
bit about where you come from and what

17
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:21,370
your family's like? Yeah. So I'm from
a place in Ireland called cove. I,

18
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:25,430
is there any other Irish people here
today? Oh you. Oh my God, that's cool.

19
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:28,500
So you Nicole. So it's like down, uh,

20
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:32,850
down south and it's um,
it's actually big emigration town,

21
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:36,540
which I've been thinking about recently
cause it like relates to my work here

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,800
because I grew up from where ane where
everybody left from like a million people

23
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,040
left from cove. This is a long time
ago. It's like during the famine,

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,630
which is now over.
Obviously we're fine. Um,

25
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,070
I'm actually really full.
Um, but I grew up there.

26
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:57,240
I'm one of eight children, which is
maybe a little bit more than the norm.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,910
I would say. Like, we still
have big families in Ireland,

28
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:04,530
but age is the last and very
happy childhood. And uh,

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,700
but I do think that's where like my
obsession with immigration started because

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,770
we learned about it as
in school all the time,

31
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:14,190
even to like inappropriate levels where
like I remember learning about like

32
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:18,030
maritime tragedies of like the
boats leaving cove and crashing.

33
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:21,630
And then there's the one local
historian came into us and said, um,

34
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,750
the people will be clinging onto the
side of the boats and the other people

35
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,780
we'll be chopping their hands off.
And I was like,

36
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,970
maybe seven and I don't know
that that's ever been verified.

37
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,990
Like anyway, so always in
my mind it was like, oh,

38
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,570
I'm from this place where
people leave from. Um,

39
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,680
and so I write a bit about that
and the raised bed, Annie Moore,

40
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,360
who has been thinking about these
days so much because she's the first

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,360
immigrants through the
gates of Ellis Island.

42
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,730
She left from my hometown
of cove in like 1890.

43
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,810
It was like the hundred and 50th
anniversary. I can't really do the,

44
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,630
it was like 18 eight or something.
I think is that right?

45
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,250
150 and I don't know.
Anyway,

46
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,530
it was like 150 years ago and
she was an unaccompanied minor.

47
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,190
She was 17 years old.
She left with her two baby brothers.

48
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,580
So three unaccompanied kids coming across,
no documents, no passport, no visa,

49
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,370
nothing.

50
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,260
And they were welcomed in and they were
reunited with their parents who have

51
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:27,610
come here years earlier to like make,
you know,

52
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,860
get an apartment and like
start to make a living.

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,590
They lived on the lower east
side's for the rest of their lives.

54
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:36,280
And like I just think how different it
was for them compared to what's happening

55
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:39,920
to kids today and just all the various,
you know,

56
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,560
issues of race and stuff
around that. Yeah. You also
lived in Zimbabwe as a child.

57
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,580
I did live in Zimbabwe. Yeah.
So Annie Zimbabweans here? No.

58
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,990
What are you nodding your head?

59
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,590
Okay.

60
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,650
Like you're, you are. Oh,

61
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,140
you're like as if there'd
be Zimbabweans here.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,880
Right. True. Very true.

63
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,690
So much easier for white immigrants
from me or I have to get here than it is

64
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:13,920
from black immigrants from
Zimbabwe. In fact, I, uh, yeah,

65
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,120
I have a friend at the moment who's
trying to get the old one visa,

66
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:20,080
which is the one I'm on, which is the
alien of extraordinary ability. He,

67
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,780
he's like a one,
this big film festival in Zimbabwe.

68
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,110
Two years ago I was on a hidden camera
show in Ireland. Like, so anyway,

69
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,890
he technically is probably
more extraordinary than I am.

70
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,690
I'm bullish. It's proving a lot
more difficult. And uh, so anyway,

71
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,050
we lived in [inaudible] bad way.

72
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:40,350
The whole family went and lived there for
two years. My Dad was in construction,

73
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:42,970
he was building a hotel over there and,

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,230
and I think that was a really valuable

75
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,170
experience for me just from,
if any of you have kids.

76
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,890
I don't have any kids, but I know
of, it's like a terrible dope. Um,

77
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,470
she's shaking her head.

78
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,600
You're like a Google executive
would never say it that you,

79
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,490
Kelly and I were talking earlier and
she normally has to interview Google

80
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:10,480
executive or not Google executives,
executives center lane.

81
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,730
Um, none of who am I hope watch this. No.

82
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:18,190
But I mean, they're great, but I mean,
they wouldn't make terrible jokes.

83
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:21,610
They're better. It's better. They wouldn't
be like, oh no, I'm a good speller.

84
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,600
Nor in like that dumb voice.
I think that's lovely.

85
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,490
But anyway, what I was going to
say, it's like if you do have kids,

86
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,610
I really think it's cool too,
like if you can at all.

87
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,810
And it's a hugely privileged thing
to be able to do, to move country,

88
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,740
have them live somewhere else when
they're small so that they can understand

89
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,490
they're not the center of the world's
them and everyone who looks like them.

90
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:48,880
Because in Ireland everyone is
very, um, I mean like, look,

91
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,420
you can make a few sisters.
And so it's really,

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,210
it was a great thing for me to go
away and see like, oh, here's this,

93
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,190
all these other ways of living basically.

94
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,070
Yeah. And you write about growing up in
a family where humor was prized above all

95
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:08,010
else. Um, so how did that
affect you as a child?

96
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:09,940
Can you tell the audience
about your family and,

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,740
yeah,
I mean I think,

98
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,500
I don't know if it's like a big
family thing if it's an Irish thing,

99
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:18,280
but certainly being funny
in my family was, you know,

100
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Norman carriage if you're athletic or
clever or being funny was like the thing

101
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,290
that that was, you know, um, and it
wasn't just like Nice, funny, you know,

102
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,830
often there's like an edge to humor and
that's definitely the way my family is

103
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,690
where you kind of sit around the table
and you're going a little bit scared and

104
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:42,610
then it like starts and um,
it's tough,

105
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,560
but it's like you show your affection
for people by like bullying them.

106
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,690
I grew up in the same kind of family and
I'm curious if that's the experience of

107
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,640
a lot of other Irish
people in the audience.

108
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:55,861
I mean,

109
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:58,840
everyone's too nervous to put their
hands up because they've been bullied.

110
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,313
Amazing.

111
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,240
How many are in your family?
Oh, it's small just to, but
I've got loads of cousins,

112
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,010
like, yes. Yeah,

113
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:12,820
I would definitely kind of cousins and
even our ads and my aunts still gives me

114
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:17,260
a really hard time and yeah,
it's just never ending.

115
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,530
But I mean I think that's good if you
end up working as the comedian the way I

116
00:07:20,531 --> 00:07:21,190
did,

117
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,780
but also I would say at least two of
my six sisters are funnier than I am.

118
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,170
Like Rosie, my sister who still
lives in [inaudible] four,

119
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:34,170
we grew up and she's a beautician
and Kohl's and she is like festivals,

120
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,010
who knows all the 10 secrets because
she does all their waxing and you know,

121
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,700
and then and eyebrows and everything.
And then she's really good.

122
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:46,570
Impressiveness and she's
just like so sharp and funny,

123
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,100
but she doesn't have like a compulsion
to show off about us like some of us do.

124
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,510
When did you realize that being
funny was your superpower? Oh, well,

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,160
I'm not being self deprecating when
I say I'm not good at anything else.

126
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,120
Like I'm good at racing and I'm good at
being funny and doing those two things

127
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:04,954
together.

128
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,430
But I didn't realize the writing
thing until about like five years ago.

129
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,260
Um, and I still need
a lot of outsides. Um,

130
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,050
you know what, like
proof of that. Like, no,

131
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:24,250
I'm like I write for the New York Times
that has to be mean something, you know,

132
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,510
validation. But with being funny,
I was always like, I'm funny,

133
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,420
even though in school and
everything I was quiet,

134
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,020
but like I was like the kind of
a judgmental outside everyone.

135
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,640
And also I think being female
it's harder to be overtly,

136
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:44,310
like I'm the funniest one in the
room. You're more sly about us. Um,

137
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,820
so that's, that's kind of what
I always have known. Yeah,

138
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:49,900
well it's used to great effect. So, um,

139
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,710
thank your writing has been compared
to if David Sedaris and Tina Fey had a

140
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:57,060
daughter, which I think is, I mean
that's what's on the cover of the book.

141
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,170
You know,
it's not beautiful,

142
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,350
but it's also don't you think it's kind
of grotesque because Tina Fey and David

143
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,940
Sedaris wouldn't have a daughter also.

144
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:10,530
Like obviously David Sedaris
is a gay man and wouldn't have,

145
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,270
you know,

146
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:15,990
a change with a straight woman and
she is not that much older than me.

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,310
If you could update it to the fan fiction
who you would like to have a daughter?

148
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,130
No, I'd love them to be my parents
or, but I just think in, in,

149
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,920
in the natural order of things,

150
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:31,921
it would be highly unusual to have a 13
year old mother and a kind of an older

151
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,650
gay man be my be my parents, I guess.
I see where you're coming from.

152
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,600
Do you know what I mean?
But it's, you know,

153
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,930
Glamour magazine said it and then we
were all really happy because it's like

154
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,230
hard to get good quotes. So we
were like, yeah, put it up there.

155
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,790
So who do you look to for
writing inspiration for
writing inspiration? I mean,

156
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,380
I definitely, I tend to read lots
of nonfiction books about war.

157
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,850
Um, so, but for funny writing,

158
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,800
mmm.

159
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,740
I do love David Sedaris,
actually daddy and

160
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,540
um,
uh,

161
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,010
God, well, I'm interested in
hearing about the war bucks as well.

162
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,180
Do they influence? Yeah, I don't know that
they did it. They influence my writing.

163
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,820
I mean,
like I certainly,

164
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,090
I write here about what they went to
Iraq and I did a workshop in Iraq and I

165
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:35,120
definitely didn't want to be one of those
people who come from the west and like

166
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,230
land there and spend a few weeks
there and you know, go on about like,

167
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,000
oh, the sound of the mosque, you know,
in the early morning or you know,

168
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,770
the usual crap that like,

169
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,420
I feel like white western people right
when they go anywhere there, you know,

170
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,350
or they're like, actually the people
were friendly, you know, this is kind of,

171
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:59,830
I hate that. Yeah. So maybe it was
helpful to me that I do read it,

172
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,180
you know? Um, there's a really,

173
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,590
I think like my favorite book of the
last year, it's called like, uh, no,

174
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,420
what's it called again?
I told you I'm so doorsy today.

175
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,560
It's a book about Afghanistan and it's
like an American who went to live in

176
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:20,880
Afghanistan and uh,
and Nan's got pal is the writer's name.

177
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,841
It's called like,

178
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:26,841
no country for like no good country
for the living or something.

179
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,080
Can you Google it? Can, can you Google it?

180
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,070
It's like everybody makes that joke.
Uh,

181
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,730
no good place for the no good country
for living or something like that.

182
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,390
Sorry. No reception. Um,

183
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,760
anyway, it's a really cool book
because basically he was, he's a,

184
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:55,000
I think he was like a
neuroscientist, young, you know,
just studying neuroscience.

185
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,380
And then he was downtown when the World
Trade Center attacks happened and he was

186
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:01,000
like stuck under a car all day.

187
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,960
And like that made him think suddenly
a bit like America's place in the world

188
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,120
and the by geopolitics and
the way that he hadn't before.

189
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,020
And then he just decided to
move to Afghanistan and he
lived there and you know,

190
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,620
and he learned the language and he like
got a motorbike and traveled around and

191
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,040
had access to like even
one member of the Taliban.

192
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,810
And so he just learned so much and then
he wrote about it in a way that was, um,

193
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,890
so informative, but like what really
happened there and what the American,

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,230
you know, why it's such a mess. And he
also has these really great human stories.

195
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,380
He traces like three people want to,
Taliban commander,

196
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:39,610
one is a widow who ended up in
parliament and then he just the,

197
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,960
the combination of, um,
you know, a new story,

198
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:48,961
deeply researched and like on
the ground and also the human,

199
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,043
um,

200
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,380
both the human costs and human opportunity
because both of those things happen

201
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,320
in war obviously.
Um,

202
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,620
so I loved his rating and I would say
then when I am writing about Iraq or I

203
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:00,550
also went to Iran,

204
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,230
then I try and think there's
only so much you can,

205
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,900
you know,
be aware of your own biases or whatever.

206
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:09,010
But I'm always trying to think like,

207
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,980
what if I didn't grow up in Ireland
and didn't live in America? Like,

208
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:15,430
what would I really be thinking? Or like
what's really happening. That's helpful.

209
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,130
I certainly see a lot of ties
to that in your journalism.

210
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,080
So your podcast and the articles that
you write for the New York Times.

211
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,060
That makes total sense.

212
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:26,560
Where do you find you're
reading recommendations around
those issues? Um, I mean,

213
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,190
I,

214
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,190
I definitely have a lot of like immigrant
journalists that I follow and that

215
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:36,940
they're, you know, it's
not hard to find, you know,

216
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,680
it's not hard to find good,

217
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,980
interesting work written by like,

218
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,320
if I'm going to read about
the Mexican American border,

219
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:47,890
I want to read it from a Mexican
point of view too. Like very simple.

220
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,570
There's very simple ways to,
I think, inform yourself,

221
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,660
unlike,
it is kind of amazing.

222
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,000
It is kind of amazing when you
realize like, oh, the different,

223
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,750
the points of view that I'm getting there.
You know,

224
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,190
you just need to scratch the surface
a bit and look a bit deeper. Um,

225
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,290
I bet a lot of the audience hasn't had
a chance to read the book yet and I'd

226
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,740
love to give them an insight into what
you did in Iraq, if you could tell them.

227
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,040
Oh, sure. So I did a comedy workshop.
I'm talking all about warrants.

228
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,400
What I use it a comedy works off. And, uh,

229
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,820
I went there in 2016 and there
was an herbal, which is, you know,

230
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,070
um, up in Kurdistan and, uh,
it's like a very safe place.

231
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:33,610
But I did tell my parents
that I was going to Kurdistan,

232
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:37,240
I didn't specify like Iraq.
And then I,

233
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,100
you know, I got two other comics
to come with me. We're, one is,

234
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,120
he's a TV writer, um, Joe
Randazzo whose name is, and uh,

235
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,390
he used to race for the onion and that,

236
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,120
and then he wrote for at midnight and a
few different and then more Amur who's,

237
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,090
um, uh, techs and comedians
who tour as a Dave Chappelle,

238
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,430
but he's texting by way of like,

239
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,460
his family are Palestinian
and he's Arabic speaking.

240
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:05,720
So the three of us went it there and
we did a workshop with 40 of our Iraqi

241
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:09,650
peers and they, um, you know,

242
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:13,910
I was obviously like a bit hesitant about
like coming from America to like teach,

243
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,650
like the history of American involvement
interact has never been good.

244
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,290
And then also to be like,
hey, we're good. Like,

245
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,800
don't you think jokes are
so important, you know? Um,

246
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,390
and to teach like comedy
or whatever. But, uh,

247
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,730
I did my research. I also like coming
from Ireland as you know, we, you know,

248
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,350
we were a conflict ridden country
for a long time and I was definitely,

249
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:42,230
I'm definitely too young to
clean that story is my own boss.

250
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,560
Certainly when I used to do gigs
in Belfast, I remember the, um,

251
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,340
owner of the empire,
that comedy club up there,

252
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:51,740
he said that whenever there
was a very bad atrocity,

253
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,350
that that's Sunday night
for the comedy show.

254
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:59,351
There will be like lions around the block
and the people really used comedy as a

255
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:03,920
way to come together and as kind of
a form of relief and an a way to like

256
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,640
connect with each other. And, um,

257
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,520
I always found that really interesting.
Plus like in Northern Ireland,

258
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,550
I think it's fair to say they have like
a slightly darker hue to their humor. Um,

259
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,630
and so going into Iraq,
I kind of thought in my mind too,

260
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:24,320
they also wanted to talk
about, you know, the, the, um,

261
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,990
power of creativity when you're in,
in,

262
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,150
you know,
going through dark stuff,

263
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:37,220
whether that's just yourself or it's
your family or it could be your community

264
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:41,570
or country. Um, but that's all very lofty.

265
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:42,590
I was really nervous.

266
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:47,591
And then I got there and of course it was
like doing a comedy workshop anywhere.

267
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,600
Like there was, you know, for
women and 36 men and like,

268
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,080
um, there was, you know, like Goofy,

269
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:01,940
loud guys who were just wanting to do
comedy to meet women. And then there was,

270
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,500
uh, like older, like earnest
men who kind of were,

271
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,040
had always wanted to express the site
to themselves, but they were, you know,

272
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,870
working or looking after family.
It was just like,

273
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,510
I could have named people's
equivalence like that.

274
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:19,040
I had met in New Zealand in Edinburgh
and Dublin do not domain. It was cool.

275
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,510
And like,
um,

276
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,100
there was cartoonists there and
people who made short videos and,

277
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,690
um, standup comedy is like
a younger kind of a craft,

278
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,050
uh, in Iraq. And it was a lot of,

279
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,470
there was a sketch group there and
stuff and we just had this workshop.

280
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:40,640
But it was, it was, it was really
good. Like it was really, um,

281
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,150
helpful I think for, it was
certainly helpful for me. Now.

282
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,970
I hope it was helpful for them too.
And I'm still in touch with a few people.

283
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,670
Took the workshop and what
was extraordinary was no,

284
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,800
we were just like Farsi miles from Mosul,

285
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:59,940
which was still Andres isis
control at the time. And um,

286
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,170
they making like funny videos about
Isis and like that was kind of the,

287
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,560
you know, isis are still goods
at a social media and that,

288
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,260
that, you know, making videos that travel.

289
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,190
And I think that for the
people at the workshop,

290
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,130
some of whose family they
were IDPs as their family,

291
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,890
we're still stuck on most of the,
um,

292
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,760
I think it was useful for them
to have a comeback and to use to,

293
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,750
you know, use their creativity to
oppose this kind of destruction,

294
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,810
that and this narrative of destruction.
Um,

295
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:37,980
so that's what they said and I think,
and I do believe them actually,

296
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,200
and I also, I also was like, God, I was
so stupid coming out here thinking, oh,

297
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:45,020
what's the point of this?
Cause I was like, well, if I,

298
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:48,570
he just happened to grow up here, I'd be
the one in the workshop. Like, you know,

299
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:52,590
I'd be one of those kind of like girls
being like, is this going to be good?

300
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,550
You know,

301
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,310
you mentioned the impulse
for self expression.

302
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:59,490
So if you were a cable of menu would
be the one who is writing on the walls.

303
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,790
Totally.
I'm constantly,

304
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,790
as you could see like trying to
say like trying to figure out what,

305
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,260
what I'm thinking and feeling and how
I understand things and trying to share

306
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:13,250
that. And it's just a,
I think it's very human.

307
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:15,890
Maybe it's like a bit stronger
in some of us than others,

308
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,830
but I think it's a very
human impulse to try and say,

309
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:23,660
like to just express yourself
and then to get heard is amazing.

310
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,530
Yeah. Well we all reap the benefits
of you expressing yourself.

311
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:31,480
So thank you for that outcome.
The teaching,

312
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:34,960
this comedy workshop opened up a lot of
questions about the shared space between

313
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:35,830
comedy and tragedy.

314
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:39,670
And I'm going to read a little excerpt
of a question that you pose, which is,

315
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,920
Oh God,
if comedy and creativity,

316
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:44,800
these nebulous things I've
devoted all these years too,

317
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,910
are in fact in the grand scheme of
things unhelpful or even pointless.

318
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,930
So how did your experience help to clarify
those questions and do you still have

319
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:53,860
our struggle with them?

320
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,670
Um, I think, you know,

321
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,280
a lot of times comedy,

322
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,510
like I think that we pat ourselves on the
back too much. Like, I think, you know,

323
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:06,730
if you're on the kind
of left side of things,

324
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,150
you like watch John Oliver
and you're like, yeah,

325
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:14,110
like get him like you said it
or Jon Stewart or whatever.

326
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,230
And ultimately I don't think it's really,

327
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:23,050
I don't think if your goal is to change
things, I don't think that's changing.

328
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:25,780
It's like you get a laugh
and you feel good, but,

329
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,950
and you'd definitely get that sense
like we're a tribe, but like that's,

330
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,320
I don't know how helpful that is. Um, so,

331
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,400
but for when I went and
spent that time in Iraq,

332
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,320
I do think that I could see the
value of it from a kind of a,

333
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,820
just to,
it's an part of being human.

334
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,960
And I think often when people
are serious all the time,

335
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,850
even if it's because they're sad or
because something bad is happening,

336
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,450
I think that's a disservice
to their own like humanity.

337
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,040
Because I think in all of us there's like
light and dark and there's levity and

338
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:10,600
there's depth and like,
unless you allow both of them to come out,

339
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,150
then it's like you're not being fair.

340
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,890
It's like if you were like giddy and uh,
upbeat all the time,

341
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:22,270
that's not a true representation of what,
you know,

342
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,200
really being a human. Yeah. So
that's why I think, you know,

343
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:30,460
a lot of narratives around,
you know,

344
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,330
of course like around war and
of course around immigration,

345
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:35,350
like forced immigration,

346
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:39,850
like what's happening to Syrians
are so tragic and so sad.

347
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,410
But within those stories,

348
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:45,010
which I found in my podcast when I
interviewed Syrian asylum seekers,

349
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,260
like there's, there's jokes,
there's love, there's humor,

350
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:50,800
you know,

351
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,190
there's all those things that like
people who aren't in a war and people who

352
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:58,630
don't, um, feel a great sadness,

353
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,900
like they still get to have, they
still get to have that levity. Yeah.

354
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,400
But I think it gets lost
in the telling sometimes.

355
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,950
What made you choose to do a podcast on
immigration? What I think it was, because,

356
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,010
you know, like I was saying,
where I came from was, you know,

357
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:16,750
I'd under such a country
that just pushes people.

358
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:21,040
I always all the time and we ended up
all over the world and then I became an

359
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,650
immigrant myself,
like moved here five years ago.

360
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,270
And I could definitely see the contrast
between my immigration experience and so

361
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:32,900
many other people's. And it was definitely
a question of like, hmm, like why me?

362
00:22:32,901 --> 00:22:37,060
And like why not them and why not, you
know, because America is such a fortress.

363
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,710
Really. Um, so and also so there was that,

364
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:45,460
there was just that central question
of like, what's really going on here,

365
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,840
but also immigration stories as you know,

366
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:52,360
if you're an immigrant yourself
or if you're knowing immigrants,

367
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,030
like there's always a
story there because it,

368
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,460
it literally means you've left one life
behind and you've come and stash it a

369
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,710
new life. And that is like from
a storytelling point of view,

370
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,120
there's has to be something there. Even
like the most boring immigration story.

371
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,170
There's a story,
there's a,

372
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,070
there's the beginning of the middle
and then what's happened now. Yeah,

373
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,520
the podcast is no longer in production,
but the back issues are amazing.

374
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,580
And if you haven't listened
to it, you really should.
It hits all the right notes.

375
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,430
Oh, thanks. To change hearts and
minds. Yeah, absolutely. Well,

376
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,800
I mean you say that it
changed hearts and minds,

377
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:27,790
but like it's interesting cause I
really thought like, so basically the,

378
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,110
the podcast is quite simple.

379
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:32,500
It's like me interviewing different
immigrants about their own stories.

380
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:36,400
It was like immigration stories told
by the people who've lived them.

381
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,040
And I really thought like, you know,
we went into production and you know,

382
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,620
2015 when I started the
idea working on too.

383
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,580
That's 15 that, but the way the
timing worked, well, you know,

384
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:54,581
the show only started airing like
right after Trump got elected.

385
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:00,310
And then I think he was inaugurated while
I was still taping and the west coast

386
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,220
anyway. And so obviously the, you know,

387
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:06,710
the immigration is always a
huge topic here in America,

388
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,500
but it had really heated up.
Um,

389
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,960
and I think I did naively probably think,

390
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,010
oh, but if anybody hears this,
like if they hear, you know,

391
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,850
as Azad, the Syrian asylum
seeker, if they talk,

392
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,050
if they hear him talking
about like how he read,

393
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:28,850
he needs to quit smoking because he has
this one year old now and his wife is

394
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:31,220
giving him a hard time and yeah,
he wants to quit smoking,

395
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:34,490
but he's afraid he's gonna put weights
on cause he's like a comfort Eser,

396
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,750
you know, like he, he reminded me of my
uncle and I was like, when they hear him,

397
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,880
they're not going to be
scared of Syrians and like,

398
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:45,881
they're not going to even consider
a Muslim ban or whatever Bush,

399
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,790
you know,

400
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,210
I don't know that a hearing stories
from immigrants directly does

401
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,320
change hearts and minds. I like to hope
that it does. I hope that it does too,

402
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:04,820
but I, I, it's hard to get that
qualitative, like does it actually, yeah.

403
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,080
I don't know. I, it's a really, I'm
still trying to figure out, yeah,

404
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,010
I think reaching the correct audience is
probably the hardest part of the battle.

405
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,690
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so
there's an innate tension, um,

406
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,430
in the whole book about the hope you
have for humanity, a society and, um,

407
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,740
the insecurity of the self that
everybody faces. Um, so can you, uh,

408
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,320
give us any words of wisdom for people
in the audience who might want to make a

409
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,240
difference in the world
and contribute to change,

410
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,370
but I need the courage to start.

411
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,950
Well,
I mean,

412
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,430
I could say what I am
doing like at the moment,

413
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:45,570
which is like kind of a small thing,
but it's actually like having me.

414
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,060
But so like,
um,

415
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,740
I started this other podcast this
year and it's about a climate justice,

416
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:55,980
which is something I never I knew about,

417
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:59,600
but I wasn't really like
paying attention anyway. I, uh,

418
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,620
we did this issue, we did this episode
about divestments, you know, like big,

419
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,300
big countries or corporations
or universities or whatever
divesting their money

420
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,290
from,
say like fossil fuels,

421
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,340
funding of fossil fuel operations to
putting it into something else like clean

422
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:20,370
energy or something that's kind of a,
you know,

423
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,810
whatever cleaner and better for the
environment and on better from a human

424
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:25,890
rights point of view.
And stuff.

425
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,570
And so then we did this whole episode
and I was kind of like, okay, cool.

426
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:34,650
Like you can petition your,
your government to divest which interests.

427
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,330
The great news is I at the
Irish government has recently
divested all of their

428
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,160
money, which is amazing. Um,

429
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,850
but then I was looked at chase bank,

430
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,390
which is just like where I bank for no
reason except that that's where I opened

431
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:52,770
up the bank account. And um,
and then I was like, well,

432
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:56,110
I'm going to move my money at the,

433
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,360
this is like last week I was
on the phone to them and it,

434
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,530
I owed them four grand.

435
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Like I had like zero on my current
count and minus a minus four grand in my

436
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,590
credit card. So I was like
taking a high morals to, I was,

437
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:11,550
I phoned them and I was like,

438
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:14,970
I think I'm gonna leave the bank because
I've been reading all this stuff and

439
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:19,380
like you use, you've been funding this
huge tar sands project and you know,

440
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,340
and the lady was like,
you can't leave like you owe us.

441
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,490
And I was like, no, I know. But
you know, I'm telling you like, um,

442
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,260
anyway then cause the day your
book gets published, published,

443
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:42,210
you get your check or whatever. So I got
my check on Tuesday was a sure. Yeah.

444
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,780
And then I was like, you
know, duty or Roberts kind of,

445
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:48,690
you know that moment where she goes
back into the shop and she's like,

446
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,093
big mistake,

447
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,710
but still the woman and chase
is like, fine, you can leave.

448
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:59,760
Like they were just like, what
is your problem? Anyway, so, uh,

449
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,580
and then like this other lady, cause
I was like, I should record this.

450
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,070
Like it's really funny.
And this other lady,

451
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,380
first of all I call chase and I was like,

452
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:10,230
now I have money and I'm paying off my
credit card and you're not getting the

453
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:11,064
rest of my money or whatever.

454
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,940
And then it's like a lady who works
in a call center in the Philippines,

455
00:28:14,941 --> 00:28:19,560
you know, and I wasn't about to
like go off on her, you know,

456
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,800
do you know what you're doing?
Like climate change is real problem.

457
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:27,200
She's in Philippines. Like
I think she knows. And, uh,

458
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,520
we had a really nice chat
actually and she was like, look,

459
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm going to do my homework
after this. And it was like, Hey,

460
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:34,110
sorry to keep you on the phone.
And um,

461
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,790
then I got put through to media relations
cause I was requiring or whatever and

462
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:43,020
she hung up on me, this lady and like
the Manhattan branch hung up on me.

463
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,550
So anyway, this is, I'm sorry,

464
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:49,551
this is really long winded way of saying
I'm personally taking responsibility

465
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,050
for like, this is like the best small
thing right? Where my money goes.

466
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,390
I also, um, you know, when
it comes to immigration,

467
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,910
I try and really look at my own status,

468
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,460
which like I said is I
have this o one visa,

469
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,350
which is a very privileged one to get.

470
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,770
And I try and help other people get
it and I just try and speak to and

471
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:18,660
understand other points of view.
It's very basic.

472
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,580
Like that's like I said,

473
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:23,970
when I started the podcast I was like
my responsibility as a storyteller.

474
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,530
It's changed the ash shoot
towards immigration in this
country. And it's like, no,

475
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,240
I can to that.
Like,

476
00:29:30,241 --> 00:29:35,190
what I can do personally really do
is like these small things. I can,

477
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,800
you know,
another thing which is more again,

478
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:41,160
climate justice related is like
check where my food comes from.

479
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,190
That's just like order
seamless all the time. Yeah.

480
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,260
Which is like a lot of packaging
and a lot of, you know, very.

481
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:50,860
So I'm doing very small things.
Yeah. That's like my latest approach.

482
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,331
Yes.

483
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:55,860
I'm hearing start small and speak to your
talents because you've leveraged your

484
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:59,260
talents and incredible
ways to effect change. Um,

485
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,940
I want to leave space for
audience questions. Please
don't be shy. If you want to,

486
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,180
uh, ask them thing and we've
got microphones and you
could ask me for a loan.

487
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,040
That was a good time.
Um,

488
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,330
but also, um, this book was a completed
about a year ago. Is that right?

489
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:15,781
Yeah.

490
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:19,890
I basically finished it last September
and that it's quite a long process with

491
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,430
publishing there. Takes away what's
changed in your life since then.

492
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,030
And I got a dog,

493
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,260
I got a dog.
I,

494
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:36,261
God made a columnist at the times and at
the garden and also at the progressive,

495
00:30:38,371 --> 00:30:43,290
another magazine. So suddenly now we
have a lot of writing work to do, um,

496
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:46,410
which is fine.
Um,

497
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,590
and I think that's kind of it.

498
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,100
Yeah,
that's big.

499
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,380
You have a really cute passage about
so many cute passages about dogs. Fuck,

500
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,483
what do you see?
Cause I

501
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,980
always walk, um, dogs from
Shawn Casey. It's like Eh,

502
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,320
rescue place and you can walk dogs
from there. Like you don't have to,

503
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,200
I mean really, you just go in
and give your email address.

504
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,630
I think they kind of want
you just to take them. Um,

505
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,530
and then you can take the
dog to the park or whatever.

506
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:17,020
And I used to always do that and I was
like, I kind of get a dog, you know,

507
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:20,920
like with money and like looking
at the time and everything,

508
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,140
but then I just kind of go, you
know, I don't know if you have a dog,

509
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:30,280
but like what happens is you
act like you're just going
to foster it for a while.

510
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:34,960
Anyway, I ended up getting this
dog full time now for almost

511
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,170
and uh, and it's great. Like, actually
when I got her, I was like, she's,

512
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,390
I guess she's like half border collie.
So I was like,

513
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:46,540
she's going to be real busy and energetic
and she's gonna make me start running.

514
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:50,260
I said, I used to run, I don't run
anymore. And then, um, I was like,

515
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:53,590
it's going to be so good for me and
my mental health and I go to like lose

516
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:57,340
weight and everything. She's also half
period anyway. She's like the laziest,

517
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:02,140
not lazy, but like she's a puppy
and she's just like, let's news.

518
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,070
So she, yeah. So that's what's happened to
me for a puppy. She's a big puppy. Yeah.

519
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:11,950
She's 60 pounds now cause she just
sleeps all the time. I'll do it. Yeah,

520
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,530
yeah.
Yeah.

521
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,830
Um,
so we covered your,

522
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:19,810
a trip to Iraq and mentoring Iraqi
comics and all the issues that come up.

523
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,270
My Dog, oh, we hit all the big ones

524
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,850
around the Berlin utility of comedy
and its relationship to tragedy.

525
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:33,250
There's this really
interesting juxtaposition in
the book about your hope for

526
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:38,030
all of these comics and how they can
affect change and um, being very, uh,

527
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,890
positive and optimistic about the
role of comedy in politics in Iraq,

528
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:48,140
but 80 saw a lot of, um,
insecurity bubbling up around
the podcast and it's, uh,

529
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,480
it's ability to affect
change in the same way.

530
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,020
I'm an imposter syndrome is something
that we talk about a lot at Google.

531
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:55,880
It's a big discussion point.
Um,

532
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:59,840
so do you have any words of wisdom about
kind of closing that gap between how

533
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:04,040
you perceive other people and how you
can bring your own self perception to the

534
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:04,874
same place?

535
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,990
Yeah,
I mean I this,

536
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,530
this newest product podcasts and I'm
working on is with Mary Robinson,

537
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:14,300
who's the former president of Ireland.

538
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:18,710
She's a first female president
and she's 73 years old now.

539
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,820
And so you can imagine what it was like
for her coming off as if she was a human

540
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:26,150
rights lawyer first. And
like this thick, I guess the,

541
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,950
I guess the 70s in Ireland,

542
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,640
which was a tough time for like women
and she was like human rights lawyers.

543
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:36,410
So anyway, I asked her about
that cause I think it's like a

544
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,230
real phenomenon with younger women.

545
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,120
Maybe men feel it to imposter syndrome.
I hear most from women,

546
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:47,860
but maybe men feeder too.
Um,

547
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,060
and I asked her about it and she was like,
I never had us,

548
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,790
she was so unhelpful.

549
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,710
Like I really thought that she should
have some kind of like w why is,

550
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:04,690
and she was just like,
no, I don't know. Um,

551
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,740
and someone else did,
I talked to about this,

552
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,690
she's a black woman and she was like,
I don't have time for like, she's like,

553
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,200
everyone does doubt me.
Everyone in her,

554
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,110
I guess she's means not,
not black people,

555
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,340
does doubt her and she does have
to prove yourself all of the time.

556
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,830
So if she also dives herself.

557
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,880
So that made me think this is just one
black woman. I don't know if that's,

558
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,800
you know, but that made me think like,
hmm. Like, I wonder if it's a bit of a

559
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,750
making a problem where there isn't one.
Um,

560
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,430
but I feel it, it's a real, you know,
and I know like feelings aren't facts,

561
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:50,720
but whatever. I do still feel it
a bit myself and I feel like what,

562
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,381
you know what too,

563
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:55,790
I think I'm doing here or if I'm doing
like a high status thing or whatever,

564
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:59,030
I'm like,
um,

565
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,600
I think it's helpful to,
uh,

566
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,550
remind yourself of past
like using logic helps me,

567
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,380
like I can say to myself,

568
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,740
but you did this other thing like two
weeks ago and that was on the same level

569
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:16,850
and you did fine. So like
using, using logic to say like,

570
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,890
I wasn't cut out then nobody kicked me
out then. So like I can do this again.

571
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,080
And then I used that for a lot of things
to trick my brain. Like I often think,

572
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,270
oh, I'm not going to be
able to write this piece.

573
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,600
Like it's too hard or it's too
long or it's whatever I don't sign.

574
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,360
But then I think, but you thought
that before, but you did it.

575
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:40,361
So just using evidence from your past as
amazing and a very data based company,

576
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,530
it should resonate for
us. Yeah. Yeah. Alright.

577
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,210
Well thank you so much for joining.
I said Google today.

578
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:52,380
I'm may even America essays
by a girlfriend somewhere
else's now available. Uh,

579
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,890

have copies in the back. Hopefully.

580
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,680

584
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,500

more complicated ways to spell my name,

590
00:36:36,581 --> 00:36:40,930
but luckily this was the, the ones my
parents gave me. I know another may have,
