1
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,513
Okay.

2
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,780
That was so cool. Thank you, Theresa.
Thanks for having me here. Thank you.

3
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,860
I just totally nerded out. So, so welcome.

4
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,190
Thank you for coming. Thank
you. It's lovely to be here. Um,

5
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,900
do you want to talk about
what you just played?

6
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,260
Oh yeah, sure. So the first
piece I played was very old.

7
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,430
It was by a German composer named
Bach. He had of many, many children,

8
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:17,450
so he was very prolific in
child making and music writing.

9
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,860
So that was probably one of his
most well known a cello pieces.

10
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,570
You guys probably have heard
it somewhere before, right?

11
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:27,230
Like Nike commercials and
basically anything with a
cello, it's like synonymous.

12
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,470
Oh, what's that? That's
the cello piece. Um,

13
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,960
and then after that I was actually the
main theme from the new wonder woman

14
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,670
series. Um, and I did do the
original with Hans Zimmer's, so

15
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,090
thank you. So, uh,

16
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,320
and it's very exciting that very soon
we're going to start working on wonder

17
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:49,220
woman to some music for that.
So I'm very excited about that.

18
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,990
And that was it.
Now I'm sitting here.

19
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,940
Thank you. Well, I am
a huge fan of Dina. Um,

20
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,180
I actually met her a couple of years ago.

21
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,130
I gave her my business card because
I was like, I need to meet you. Like,

22
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,160
it was a really creepy and stalkerish way.
Um, so I was like, Hey, let me interview.

23
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,690
Um, so, uh, so thank you for coming.
I actually seen her twice in concert.

24
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:15,100
[inaudible] she's amazing. So I wanted to
start with really background questions.

25
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:16,990
Like when did you start playing the cello?

26
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,770
What made you choose that particular
instrument? Was it Kinda like your choice?

27
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:23,680
What's it like forced upon you by your
parents? Like what, what was that?

28
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,150
Yes, so, uh, I was born in Shanghai,
China, so I was made in China. Um,

29
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,110
and my first instrument, like many,
many Chinese children was piano.

30
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,070
Uh, so I started when I was three years
old and then later I moved to the u s my

31
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:40,020
parents are actually
both classical musicians,

32
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:43,890
so there are classical music teachers
who live in San Diego and they,

33
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,850
so they popped me out and then they came
to us because they were able to, uh,

34
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,240
have an opportunity to go to school
in the u s for music at a scholarship.

35
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:54,960
And that was very, very rare. And like
post communist China like right after.

36
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,510
So they took the opportunity
and my grandparents,

37
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,570
my mom's parents actually raised me,
uh,

38
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,210
for a few years while they were here
studying. I got really, really large.

39
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,940
I weighed when I came to America.
I'm not kidding you.

40
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,840
I was like 82 pounds at five years
old. That is not normal. Right.

41
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,610
So I was like a little round ball. Oh,
I play the piano and then I moved here.

42
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,161
Uh,

43
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,210
and my parents thought that I should play
one of the instruments that they knew

44
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:20,880
how to play. Cause obviously that
would save money on music lessons.

45
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
So I started on the violin. I
was really bad. I played twinkle,

46
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,750
twinkle little star for, I'm again,
I'm not exaggerating like six months,

47
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,980
like I couldn't, I could not get past
twinkle, twinkle little star, like, well,

48
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,190
she's not talented. Right. So, um, then I
switched to the cello and for some reason,

49
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:39,130
even though it's like kind of similar, it
just came a lot more naturally. Um, and,

50
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,050
and I seem to like progress pretty
quickly. So my dad decided, okay,

51
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:46,290
this is what she's going to play.
And from there on out, I was,

52
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,910
I have to say forced to be honest,

53
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:51,570
I was forced to practice
eight hours a day every day,

54
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,560
which I'm grateful for now. Uh, I didn't
have much of a childhood, I have to admit.

55
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,830
And I was very, hence probably my love
for metal now. It was very like, oh,

56
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,920
I hate my life. And my
parents. I mean it was,

57
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,840
it was really extreme and
I've talked about it before,

58
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:08,570
so hopefully they'll forgive me
for like, you know, spilling the,

59
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,680
the family secrets.

60
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,740
But they would like lock me in my room
sometimes to practice and they're like,

61
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:16,760
let me out once in a while
ago. The bathroom, maybe eat
something if I was lucky.

62
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,410
Um, but I have to say that
type of like very regimented,

63
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:22,880
strict training.
Um,

64
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,510
really I have to say it did pay off in
the end cause like if you don't practice

65
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,080
for that many hours every day and we
know whether it's cello or swimming or

66
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,720
basketball, you don't build
that type of muscle memory.

67
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,370
So I was like more comfortable playing
the cello than really doing anything else.

68
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,390
Um, so yeah, to answer your question,
I was forced into the family trade,

69
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,980
but I'm happy to be here now.

70
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,480
I mean, yeah, that sounds that your,
your parents sound both terrifying,

71
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:48,880
but also thank you to your parents
for it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No

72
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,200
slightly terrifying. But, but also
at the same time, I mean, I don't,

73
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,970
I think it actually takes a lot of,
uh,

74
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,680
a courage and a lot of determination
and sacrifice on their part. You know,

75
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:01,020
cause I, when I have babies, I
don't have kids yet, but I'm like,

76
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,990
I don't know if I can spend
that many hours. Like, you know,

77
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,530
like yelling at my kids practice

78
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,690
dedication. Yeah. Cool.
Um, so, uh, you know,

79
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:14,740
whether it was growing up or
now, you know, uh, what do
you think where, you know,

80
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:17,860
other than your parents,
uh, music influences that,

81
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:22,570
that kind of affected you or that inspire
you to like keep playing and, and, uh,

82
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:25,450
you know, whether it's this
instrument or, or other type of music.

83
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:26,560
Cause you mentioned metal as well.

84
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,880
Yeah, definitely. So, um, again,

85
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:32,780
growing up because my parents were
ultra conservative and just very, very,

86
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,080
you know, classical music is good.
Anything else? It's a music of the devil.

87
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,570
You can't listen to it. So
I actually, and of course,

88
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:42,680
what happens when you don't allow people
to do something, they get very curious,

89
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:45,680
especially me because I'm really a
contrarion in many ways where I'm like,

90
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,900
Oh yeah, I'm going to. Um, so,

91
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,650
so the very first exposure
that I had to like,

92
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:55,790
I guess heavier music or the underground
alternative was a Marilyn Manson.

93
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,510
And how did this come about? So I was in
awe. I was in seventh grade, I suppose,

94
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,760
a little bit later in life. I
mean, that's not that late in life,

95
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,960
but seventh grade. Um, and I,

96
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:07,760
I remember I had this
crush on a kid named Luke.

97
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,980
He was like a combination of a goth and
a nerd. He was like a Nerdy Goth, right?

98
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:16,400
You've got these really thick coke bottle
glasses with like thick, black rooms.

99
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,200
Uh,
but he also had like long hair,

100
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,410
like down to the shoulders and like
black lipstick and my, Oh my God,

101
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,630
this is kitty. So weird.
I love it. And, and, um,

102
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,580
the neighborhood we grew up in was not
very alternative or like, you know,

103
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:32,900
so everybody was pretty much
the same. Very preppy. Uh,
like the weird one. You yes.

104
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:35,270
I'm like, he's weird. I'm gonna
follow him around at lunch, like,

105
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,410
like a little looser, like a stalker.
Right. And then, so one day he's like,

106
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,740
Hey Tina, have you heard of Marilyn
Manson? I'm like, who? She know,

107
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:47,240
I don't know what that is. So he let
me borrow his antichrist superstar CD,

108
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:50,270
because back in those days we
listened to cds. Good. So, yeah.

109
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,350
And I had a boombox in my room that we
got at a garage sale from the next door

110
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:56,820
neighbor, so nearby garage sale. Um,

111
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,820
and there's a CD player at the top and
I remember I would turn the volume all

112
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:02,790
the way down to like a little
bit pat like below one.

113
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,750
So like 0.9 volume and put my ear up
against the boombox is my parents.

114
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:10,050
I mean I wouldn't be here today,
I'd be dead if they heard that. So.

115
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,530
And I'd be like,
I'm so cool.

116
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,460
So that actually had a huge
impact on me because I,

117
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,110
I mean imagine coming from classical
music to, I guess that's like industrial,

118
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,680
it's not really metal but like
heavy industrial, dark music.

119
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,220
And I was just so off music and I was,
I was very fascinated by it.

120
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:32,490
I started like trying to like,
oh I found a clip. Sorry,

121
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,650
I'm going to go way off tangent
right now. Stop me. Okay.

122
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,100
So all these memories of pouring back.
So I found this clip on earrings,

123
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,740
like just like the clip, I'm part,
there was no actual earring, you know,

124
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:42,900
like the plastic part,
that kind of the metal plastic,

125
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,600
you know what I'm talking
about? Yeah. I'm like,

126
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,420
oh that would make a really cool nose
ring. Cause I want it to be cool,

127
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,690
but I didn't have any piercings.
So I would go to school,

128
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,890
I would run into the bathroom and clip
this like plastic clip on everything like

129
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:59,510
between like, like a bowl, you
know, on my nose. I'm so cool.

130
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,500
So anyway, so that Marilyn Manson and
then a few years later in high school,

131
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,940
my best friend, her name
is also Tina and she, uh,

132
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,350
she had a guns and roses tape.
Oh my gosh,

133
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,190
a cassette tape appetite for
destruction. So I heard that. Um,

134
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,390
and then the third musical
influence that I heard,

135
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,020
but I only heard the first two tracks
of their album was a daft punk CD that I

136
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,590
got at yet another garage sale. But it
was scratched up. So only the first,

137
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,870
it wasn't even first teacher at
first track and a half worked.

138
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,570
And so I would like listen to it for
like a track and a half and then it would

139
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:33,360
like skip and then stop working.
I rewind it and just keep listening to it.

140
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,720
And that was my musical influence
that in classical music.

141
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,070
So go and that actually makes sense.
It, if you follow Tina's career,

142
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:44,540
it makes sense because she's really all
over the place in a good way. You know,

143
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,620
she's not the typical cellist and
you know that you would go see, um,

144
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,550
at the Disney concert hall, you know,
like she does all of this school stuff.

145
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,290
Like I, one of the concerts
that I saw her at, um,

146
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,470
she ended up playing Super Mario brothers,
uh,

147
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,200
the theme and then all of a sudden went
into like a heavy metal version of it.

148
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,540
And I freaked out because I was like,
this is like,

149
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,480
it's like she's dedicating this to me.
Like I, it was, it was so big for you,

150
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:13,010
just for you. That's right. Uh,
and it was, and it was really
cool. So, you know, like,

151
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,150
uh, it, it's, it's, you have
these, she has albums out, right?

152
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:21,650
Like there's this one called game on
where you play a video game music.

153
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,420
So, how did that come about and, and,
and how do you as a musician, you know,

154
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:27,111
cause you,
do you,

155
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:31,040
do you do your own compositions and
arrangements for when you're doing a cover

156
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,840
and like, you know, putting
your own spin on it,

157
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:36,320
like how does that blend of
metal and classical come about?

158
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,150
Right, right. So this album
that she's talking about,

159
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:40,350
it was actually my first album.

160
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:45,351
I finally got signed to a major label
to Sony to almost two years ago.

161
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,560
So game on was the first label
released album that I did.

162
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:53,070
But actually previous to that I self
released nine albums. My myself,

163
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,900
I self funded it, I recorded it
myself, didn't know what I was doing,

164
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:59,290
but I figured it out along the way.
If you listen to like my oldest albums,

165
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,150
it's like, well that's
really bad, you know, and uh,

166
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,780
hopefully it gets a little bit better as
I'm figuring out what to do. Um, but I,

167
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:04,991
you know,

168
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,860
I released albums that
were fully classical and my
parents were happy about that.

169
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,780
And then I did some like super metal ones.

170
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:14,410
There's one called cello metal because
that's just how creative I am. Cello,

171
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,480
metal. Um, and then, uh,

172
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:21,460
so when I got signed to Sony was weird
timing because I had planned on doing a

173
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:25,900
music video, music video,
sorry, a gay music album.

174
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,760
And I've been,
since I moved to La,

175
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:31,200
I feel like everyone's in
the entertainment industry
in some way or another. Um,

176
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,680
so I started doing, when
I came to college, uh,

177
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,390
as like a side gate to make money
amongst other things, I try to sell Avon,

178
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,170
et cetera. Wasn't very good at that. Um,

179
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,120
but I started doing session work and
slowly I built that up and I s I ended up

180
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:46,900
playing on a lot of video game, like in
the actual soundtrack. So I had thought,

181
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,540
oh,
maybe I should do some versions of my own,

182
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,670
of the stuff that I've played on or
some of my favorite game music. Um,

183
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,190
and so when Sony sign me, they said, oh,

184
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,520
we were thinking that maybe you could
do like a video game music album. Like,

185
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:00,490
no way. Check out my spreadsheet
because I love Google spreadsheets.

186
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:03,400
So I already had a spreadsheet of all
the music I wanted to do, you know,

187
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:07,030
the tracks. Um, and so it was really one
of those situations where it was like,

188
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:08,770
perfect, perfect timing. Um,

189
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,880
and so I just kind of picked some of my
favorite music. Some of the games that I,

190
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:15,730
I did play a little bit and then some
just like epic music that I love,

191
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:19,170
like final fantasy seven. I mean
it's just like opulent music. Um,

192
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,620
so that's how that kind of came about.

193
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,160
So. Cool. Do you have
a favorite video game?

194
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Um, it doesn't count. I don't
know if it counts as a video game,

195
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:28,820
but like what I'm playing right now,
it's just really bad.

196
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:32,460
I don't know if you guys play
home scapes or garden scapes. No.

197
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,060
Do you like what's that?
It's like my mom plays a two.

198
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:37,100
That's when you know it's bad.
I was like telling my mom, oh,

199
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:38,630
I found this thing of like gardens scapes.

200
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,943
Well me too.

201
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,730
I'm like, oh no, I'm like playing
the same games as my mom. Um,

202
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,710
it's kind of like little matching games
and then you can like win points and

203
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:49,440
like upgrade your garden.
I know.

204
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,363
Okay.
Not Men.

205
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,250
I would play it on iPad and your
iPhone and stuff. Oh, there you go.

206
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,400
We know we have to check it out or
promoting current scale now.

207
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,500
Um, so yeah, you mentioned you're a album,

208
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:07,501
cello medal and I mean you have songs
by like black Sabbath and Metallica

209
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:13,540
slayer. Like it's so, so good. It's these
are, these are not just covers, right?

210
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,290
Like there's like arrangements I'd go
into this that like did you end up,

211
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,460
you know, really getting into metal
and then it seems like sometimes,

212
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,480
correct me if I'm wrong,

213
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:26,820
but like when you're playing the
metal versions of songs like you,

214
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:29,260
you kind of treat the cello like a guitar.

215
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,590
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So when I was
listening to that, guns and roses,

216
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,870
appetite for destruction, you
know, slash I was like, oh my God,

217
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,760
I want to be slashed. How
do I become slash so, um,

218
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,110
I think basically what I did with the
electric cello is just try to experiment

219
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:44,620
with it. I use, you know, guitar
effects. This is a pedal board metaphor,

220
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,200
a guitar player. But I thought
that's close enough. You know,

221
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:51,070
it's kind of in the same
range. And so, um, yeah, that's
exactly what I tried to do.

222
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,870
And even with the wonder woman
main theme, I sometimes, you know,

223
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:57,710
I would go on youtube and look at the
people just upload like the track and

224
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,500
there's some comments like, oh, the guitar
is cool. I'm like, it's not a guitar,

225
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,700
it's cello.
But,

226
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,880
but at the same time it's good because
I want it to sound like a guitar player.

227
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:06,680
So the fact that it's
a little bit confusing,

228
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,750
it's like both a good and a bad thing,
you know?

229
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,140
Yeah, no, then that's true. It's
actually, I, because I'm a Nerd, uh,

230
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,450
I've also corrected people
because there'll be like, oh yeah,

231
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:17,850
I love that little like Guitar
Solo in one room. And I'm like,

232
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:22,320
that is a challenge. What are
you talking about? Um, so, uh,

233
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,980
speaking of wonder woman,
um, that is such a cool,

234
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,850
that must be such a cool experience,
you know? Uh, tell us about that. Like,

235
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:33,150
what was it like to, to get involved,
first of all, with, uh, you know,

236
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:36,930
one of my favorite composers of all time,
which is Hans Zimmer, you know, and uh,

237
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:41,470
and then junkie XL that, that they made
this really cool iconic theme. Well,

238
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,670
you know, what was it like and how
did that process come about, uh,

239
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,070
to get involved, to be involved
in such an iconic movie? Okay.

240
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,660
Right. So, um, I think to, to backtrack,

241
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,370
the way that I met Hans was actually
through youtube. Um, and because my,

242
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,240
so my very, very first music
video I released it, oh my
gosh. Like 10 years ago,

243
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:02,810
I think. Yeah. I'm old. So 10, no, I'm
not that old, but 10 years ago, um,

244
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,810
it's called Queen Bee and it was my like,

245
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:07,660
metal version of flight of the Bumblebee.
I know it's been done before,

246
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:10,740
but you know, I was just starting, I was
not very original. But anyway, so, um,

247
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,620
I did a metal cover and he actually saw
the music video because he spends a lot

248
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:17,410
of time watching youtube videos,
like looking at musicians. Um,

249
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:21,400
and his office actually contacted
me. Um, and at the time I wasn't my,

250
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:23,420
I was trying to become
like a metal cellist might.

251
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,860
My life goal was to play with Rammstein
and like, that's what, and I thought like,

252
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,630
Oh,
if I like release this music video,

253
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,120
maybe like metal bands will see
the video and they'll be like, oh,

254
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:34,140
she should like, come play with us.
So that was my entire purpose. Um,

255
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,040
but instead that somehow accidentally
segues me into a career in soundtrack

256
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,330
work. So now, like the majority of my
work here in La, I work on, you know,

257
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,720
movie scores, TV scores, video game stuff.
Um, and so he saw the video called me.

258
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:50,800
I ended up, uh, the first movie that we
worked on together was Sherlock Holmes.

259
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,460
I'm the very first one. I remember I
walked in, I actually, I had this so bad.

260
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,250
If he watches us, please don't
get offended, Hon. Sorry. Um,

261
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,940
I actually didn't know who he was.
So when his assistant call,

262
00:16:59,941 --> 00:17:03,260
like I'm calling from Hans Zimmer's
office, I'm like, who, what? Um,

263
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,320
so I went in,

264
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:08,380
I still didn't know what I was expecting
to his office in Santa Monica and

265
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:08,921
they're like,
oh,

266
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:11,380
Han's is having lunch in the next
building cause there's like all these

267
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:14,440
buildings. So I went up there
and I did recognize Guy Ritchie.

268
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,150
They were really having a having lunch.

269
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,220
And so I sat down and there's
like all these like, you know,

270
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:22,150
Cole celebrity people. And then
like me, I'm like, Oh wow, okay.

271
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:25,750
I guess I'm in a good situation. And so
that's how we started working together.

272
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:29,560
And then we worked on a bunch of, of
inception, a lot of movies after that. Um,

273
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:30,311
and so this one,

274
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:33,190
I think they had actually
been experimenting originally
they were thinking it'd

275
00:17:33,191 --> 00:17:36,400
be a vocal, like a female vocal.
And for some reason, you know,

276
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:39,760
they tried different singers. Like it just
wasn't quite fitting. And the Han said,

277
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,280
oh, we should have Tina come in with
their electric cello and do some weird

278
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:47,080
shrieking sounds, you know,
like a screaming Amazon. Um,
and so I went in and that,

279
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,771
I mean,
it's a pretty,

280
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:51,210
it's like a simple melody that repeats
over and over and over. I must have,

281
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,631
I mean,

282
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:56,040
I literally played it like at least a
thousand times over and over and over,

283
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,700
but we finally figured it out. And the,
um, the theme is actually layered. It's,

284
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:02,040
it's not just one electric cello,

285
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,050
but it's like 30 layers of electric
cello to get that like really fat.

286
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:08,990
That's all you, yes. It's all me.
So yeah, lots of multi tracking. Um,

287
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,490
and actually junkie, I, I've
never even met him in person.

288
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,330
He wasn't actually there.

289
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:16,820
So it was just myself and Hans and then
all of Han's is people's entourage.

290
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was, but they both
compose the theme, right? I believe so.

291
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:22,620
Yeah.
There's a lot of times,

292
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:26,490
there's so many people working
on different components
of it, so, um, but yeah,

293
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,100
definitely.

294
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,880
That's so cool. I mean, I remember
the first time I heard that theme was,

295
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:34,570
I think it was Batman v Superman, the
movie. And there's that scene where, uh,

296
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,830
spoilers, a wonder woman basically saves
Batman because she actually has powers.

297
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,880
Um, no offense, Batman. I
love Batman too. Um, but um,

298
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,470
she basically does this and the music
comes on and you and I hear the cello and

299
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:50,530
I'm like, oh my God. Like this is
like my jam. I was so happy about it.

300
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:54,320
That's so cool. Yay. Um, and uh,

301
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,970
speaking of hands up, that's actually
one of the best concerts I've been to.

302
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,750
And I go to like 30 concerts
a year, like it's bad. Um,

303
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:05,680
and Tina was there and along with all
these other great studio musicians that,

304
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:09,590
that a Hans brought and they basically
just play his scores and that's,

305
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,520
that's was such a cool concert.
I mean it was,

306
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,360
they played everything from inception
to Sherlock Holmes. You guys played,

307
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,310
obviously you play wonder woman
parts of the Caribbean. Like,

308
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,890
what was that like and,
and what, you know,

309
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:23,170
was that kind of like a dream
of you to like, you know,

310
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,600
be on stage with the best musicians
in the world and like, you know, what,

311
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,370
what's that compared to
like, you know, what,

312
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,590
what you want to do in the
future or dreams of yours.

313
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,150
Right, right. So of course it was, I
don't know if you've guys have seen it.

314
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:38,150
It's on Netflix, like
the uh, live in Prague,

315
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:41,550
like our show that we did in prognosis
two tours ago, two years ago. Um,

316
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,040
but when Hans for said like,
oh,

317
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,800
we're thinking of maybe taking this on
the road instead of being locked up in a

318
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:48,830
dark room all day, you know,
writing music. And I thought,
great, because for me,

319
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:53,240
I love studio music, but while I'm still
young enough to prance around on stage,

320
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:56,620
I want to take the opportunity
to travel, to perform live. Um,

321
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,870
and so it was really, really
amazing. And we played mostly arenas,

322
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,720
which is crazy because we all thought
like, are, is anyone going to come?

323
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:04,280
Is it going to be like five people?
You know?

324
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:07,640
But it was amazing cause I mean Han's is
huge, so all over the world, you know,

325
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:10,370
the arenas are full. So it
was an amazing experience. Um,

326
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,420
and prior to that I actually in a past
life I was in the Cirque de Solei. Um,

327
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:18,200
and so it was weird to like
kind of revisit the same
arenas that we played. Um,

328
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,380
but with Hans this time and it was just,
yeah, I mean, I mean, what can I say?

329
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:25,710
It's really, really, really awesome
and there was good food I like,

330
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,230
I like free catering it. Okay. What,
wait, so you weren't certain display,

331
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,450
what would you do? I
well, I play the cello.

332
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:35,390
I was kind of like this weird like
you where like I look or bad. No,

333
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,700
I'm not that flexible.
No,

334
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,340
I was like a weird cello alien
and I was wearing this outfit.

335
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,090
I was skinnier then. I mean, I know
I'm not large now, but I had um,

336
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,570
they put me on a diet and they're like,
no,

337
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:47,820
I was the largest person in the
entire show. Like all these, like,

338
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,140
like acrobat girls with like eight packs
and wait to Jesus Christ. So I would,

339
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:53,620
I would actually paint on like fake abs.
So try to like blend in.

340
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,710
And I remember one time some,
some someone I think, uh,

341
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,530
waiting for us outside of the stage
shore and they saw me like, oh,

342
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:04,090
you're that jealous man, you are cut. I'm
like, it's makeup cause from far away,

343
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,080
like if you have really
bad like makeup on it,

344
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,340
it actually looks like you're super buff
and I have a one pack of like nothing,

345
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,410
you know, so, and the
acrobats are looking at me,

346
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:14,650
they were like working out all day and
I'm just eating in catering and I like

347
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:17,410
paint on my abs. Um, but yeah,
I was wearing this outfit,

348
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:20,560
it was all Swarovski crystal
and it was the Michael Jackson,

349
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,870
the immortal tour to slay.

350
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:25,120
So it was actually half owned
by the Jackson estate is,

351
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,850
well this was after Michael passed.
And so instead of,

352
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,020
obviously he couldn't do the tour,

353
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:34,021
so we had his vocals and then it was
combined with the circus late to add in

354
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:35,201
other elements.

355
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:39,220
And now they have the Michael Jackson
Jackson's show in Las Vegas and it's kind

356
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:40,210
of like the smaller version,

357
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:43,510
but the original one that opened
was also an arena tour. Um, so yeah,

358
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,760
I did that for two years.
I was a gypsy.

359
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,740
Crazy. You've done everything
and you're so young,

360
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,020
you would done everything
good for you. Um, so, uh,

361
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,130
you have a new album coming out this year
or you're working on this year right?

362
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,850
Fully. It'll come out this
year. I've only, we won't,

363
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,550
we're working on a song number two,
so we'll see how it progresses. Okay.

364
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,700
Can you tell us about, can you give us
a little bit of a preview for it or,

365
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,250
yeah, well I was like, I was
telling during an earlier,

366
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:10,040
like the idea for this album has
already changed like five times,

367
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,020
but that's part of the creative
process. You know, you,

368
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,810
you think you have a great idea and
then you do it and you're like, wow,

369
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:18,170
this is really horrible. And then
you erase it and you start again. Um,

370
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:22,040
so I think we have the general theme
down. Um, we're taking, it's not really,

371
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,950
I mean it's kind of a cover but
not really a cover cause we want,

372
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:26,420
I want it to do original material,

373
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:29,270
but being that I don't sing
and it's instrumental music,

374
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:32,720
it is difficult to have something that
grasp, you know, it's not radio friendly.

375
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,131
So we thought,

376
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:37,970
what if we took some classical pieces
but not an entire cover where you just

377
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:39,860
take a short segment like rappers,

378
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:43,160
they sample stuff that's recognizable
and then kind of like expand that,

379
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,170
explode that into something
original and different. Um,

380
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,840
so that's what we're working on.
So it's kind of,

381
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:51,740
I guess you would call it like
classically based cinematic mentally.

382
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:55,610
Of course they'll be some metal
elements. Yay. Just for you.

383
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,490
Um, and yeah, that's
what we're working on.

384
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:01,370
I'm hoping it'll come out around
the same time as wonder woman two.

385
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:04,010
That's like our hold a goal for,
for the timing.

386
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,490
Cool. Can you tell us anything about the
wonder woman music or no, no spoilers.

387
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,720
Contracts. I know. I got it.
I got it. Um, okay. So, um,

388
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,920
I wanted to ask about, um, you
know, you perform with Han's,

389
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:19,370
like are there collaborators that you
work with that just was, you know,

390
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,740
it was a very meaningful thing to you or,

391
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:24,230
or is there somebody that you dream of
working with in the future that you're

392
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:25,620
like, oh, I would die
if I work with, right,

393
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,710
yes.
So I remember how I said that,

394
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:31,610
that first music video that I made and
I spent every penny that I had on at the

395
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:35,330
time and I was like broke after,
um, uh, this metal music video.

396
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,740
I was hoping that Rammstein would see it.

397
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,790
I still really would love to work with
them. Um, but I don't want to read,

398
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,860
my thing is I don't want to, I never
reach out to people and say, Hey,

399
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:45,080
like I would've worked with you
because I tried to like, wait,

400
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,320
like manifest it and like,

401
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,430
hopefully eventually it'll somehow it'll
just come or we'll have like mutual

402
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:51,260
friends or something weird will happen.
Um,

403
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:55,030
so my dream is that one day I'll
be able to play with Rammstein, um,

404
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,210
hello rom sign,

405
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,150
but we'll send this to
him. Um, and then, um,

406
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,830
you were just a nom recently. Yes. Um,
and for those of you that don't know you,

407
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,670
if you could explain what that is,
but also, um, did you have, um,

408
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,820
Tina actually has an instrument line,
like, cause she does everything.

409
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:14,680
So can you talk a little
bit about that as well?

410
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,990
Yes. So in addition to music, uh,

411
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:20,650
I very actually very passionate about
entrepreneurship and investing in,

412
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:24,010
but that's a whole other thing that
we won't go into today. But one of my,

413
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:27,980
I guess it's side businesses,
uh, is a line of instruments, uh,

414
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,580
Bose and pickups for acoustic
string instruments. Um, so I,

415
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:36,160
I have a couple of different cello
models, classical cello models. Um,

416
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:40,720
we offer a Bose and both wood and
carbon fiber and like custom colors. Uh,

417
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:43,510
you could even get like the hair here.
This is actually horse hair,

418
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:46,930
but don't worry, no horses were harmed
in the making of any of these bows.

419
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,840
And we dye them like all
kinds of different colors. Um,

420
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:52,000
and so that's just something
that I also do on the side.

421
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,920
What's the difference between,
you know,

422
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,190
horsehair and other things that are other
types of hair that are used for both?

423
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,313
Usually yes.

424
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,560
On the Bose that I played
with the electric cello.

425
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:05,280
I actually try not to go too crazy
today because it's noon and a Monday,

426
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:07,470
so I don't want to be too extra.
But if I play really,

427
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:09,210
really hard and I use a normal bau,

428
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:12,630
I'll literally destroy like
one bow every 15 minutes maybe.

429
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,670
Because if you hit it really hard,
all the hairs will break.

430
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,730
And so for actually that cello,
when I play,

431
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:20,640
I usually use fishing wire because it's,
it's like plastic,

432
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:24,300
so it doesn't sound as good. But um,
it's, it lasts a lot longer again,

433
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:27,990
since the cost, like $80, usually
about 80 per rehire hair. Uh,

434
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:31,710
but for the classical cello, I do use
the traditional horse hair on the Bose.

435
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,140
Yeah.

436
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,250
And, um, I want to talk about the
difference between when, you know,

437
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:40,050
cause I actually grew up playing
the cello, this one, how, you know,

438
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,260
how did you transition to doing electric
and, and what do you think is, you know,

439
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,960
what were the challenges or what are
the difference or what's better or worse

440
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:48,400
between,
between both instruments?

441
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,310
Right, right. Um, I always
tell people the, um,

442
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,660
if you compare it to a classical
guitar and electric guitar, it's,

443
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,220
that's exactly the same. So yeah, I mean
you're, the frets are in the same place.

444
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,770
Uh, but as far as, obviously
when I play this cello,

445
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm sitting and when I play
that at standing and it's
actually more difficult to

446
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:09,060
play the electric cello in tune because
your whole body, as you can see,

447
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:10,080
it's just one end pin.

448
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,470
So it's kind of like a tripod situation
where my legs are like this, right.

449
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,220
And that, and you're kind of like trying
to move with it so it doesn't fall over.

450
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,280
Because when I started it took me about
two years to figure out how to play it

451
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:23,430
without looking super awkward. I'm
sure. I still look awkward, but um,

452
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,470
cause there's not, there's,
there's some people,

453
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:27,150
there's a lot of people
who play electric violin.

454
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,680
There's some people who
play electric cello,

455
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:32,670
but it's still not a super
popular thing I guess.

456
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:36,240
So I was really trying to figure
out how to, how to do it, you know,

457
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:38,820
and to be able to stand so he can be a
little bit more mobile instead of just

458
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:39,654
sitting all the time.

459
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,250
If you're trying to hit the right notes
and you're playing like, you know,

460
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,190
and you're moving around

461
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,320
like how'd, yeah. And there's the
right now. Right, right, right.

462
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:49,140
And there's no frets. It's
muscle memory. So it genuinely,

463
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,230
it took me like two years of
nonstop practice on that one,

464
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,920
just to not sound
horrible. Yeah. So awesome.

465
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,750
Um, and so I mentioned I grew up playing
the cello. I haven't played in years.

466
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,290
So for somebody like
me, no, definitely not,

467
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,960
especially after she played. Um, so, uh,

468
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,100
for somebody like me
that is you or you know,

469
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:13,610
somebody that's a beginner that's hoping
to play or, you know, it like, for me,

470
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:16,760
it seems very daunting to get back
into this just because as you mentioned

471
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:19,550
earlier, there's like, you know, it
takes discipline and, and you know, what,

472
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:20,030
what would,

473
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,190
what advice would you give people like
me and beginner musicians that, or what,

474
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,730
what, you know, tips or what do you do
to not get uninspired and keep playing?

475
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,653
Right.
I think

476
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,690
everything's just about consistency.
And I'm not gonna lie and say, you know,

477
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,510
you're always going to want to practice.
I don't even want to practice sometimes,

478
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:39,230
you know, but I have like the
internal Asian tiger parents,

479
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,920
like already in my brain. So
even if I don't want to, I'm
like, I have to, you know,

480
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:48,210
like I have to. So, um, if you just
force yourself to be a consistent,

481
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:50,460
and I'm not saying eight hours a day,
cause we all have lives, you know,

482
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,300
and I don't do eight hours a day anymore.
Um,

483
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,240
but even if it's like a good 30 minutes,

484
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:57,310
like really focus 30 minutes
every day or an hour, um,

485
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,780
whether you're learning cello or anything
else, it does come pretty quickly,

486
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:02,310
but it's mostly about consistency,

487
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,330
you know. Yeah. Okay. We'll
suit, but thank you. Okay.

488
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,120
Um, so, um, we actually only have time
for one more question unfortunately.

489
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,130
Uh, but um, and then Tina is going
to perform one more song and uh,

490
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:19,020
and then I think of some good questions
cause we'll open up the floor to

491
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:23,260
audience questions. Um, so, uh,
I wanted to also ask about, um,

492
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,420
you had a lot of partnerships with
brands and that's interesting, you know,

493
00:28:27,421 --> 00:28:30,060
for a musician like a, can you, can
you tell us about that? I think a,

494
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,670
you work with Bentley last year,
you're working with Ritz Carlton,

495
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,580
like what's that like and how do those
things happen? Like that's so cool.

496
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,970
Great. Thank you. Uh, definitely very
grateful for that. Um, and again, I don't,

497
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,240
I don't actually have, I don't reach
out. Usually. Not usually. I never,

498
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:46,540
I don't reach out to, to brands, you know,
I don't have someone pursuing it for me,

499
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,220
but,
so these happen organically,

500
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:50,690
which I think is the best
way for things to happen. Um,

501
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,130
and so the Bentley Partnership,
actually the marketing director,

502
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:56,800
Mike Sayer of Bentley in the UK,

503
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,880
he came to one of my shows and then for
some reason he liked Instagram messaged

504
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:02,590
me. But you know what, Instagram,
if we don't follow them,

505
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:06,220
it goes to your archived messages. So I
like didn't see his messages for months.

506
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,860
Right. And I think finally
he emailed me, he's like, oh,

507
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:10,780
like I tried to message you
but you ignored me. You know,

508
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:14,140
I'm a messaging you do the wrong way.
You should have given you a business card.

509
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,400
Like I did. No, he came to the show,
but then he didn't come like in person,

510
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:22,860
you know, he didn't leave a
card like, like she did. Um,
so anyway, we connected. Uh,

511
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,470
and then last year I did four
performances for Bentley.

512
00:29:26,471 --> 00:29:29,590
I actually wrote the music, I scored
a commercial for them for the new Ben,

513
00:29:29,591 --> 00:29:34,090
take a hybrid, which was their SUV hybrid
SUV, um, which works with idea of like,

514
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:36,120
you know, taking something
old and, uh, you know,

515
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:39,370
the Bentleys turning a hundred years old
this year. So it's a very old company.

516
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,240
So taking something that's old, like this
cello made an 1880 in Paris, France. Um,

517
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,700
and transforming it and
making it something modern
electric with the, you know,

518
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:50,240
with the hybrid SUV.
Um,

519
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,190
so we did that and that was
a great partnership for a
year. And then this year,

520
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,620
uh, I am a brand partner
with the Ritz Carlton. Um,

521
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,390
so I'll be visiting some of their
different resorts. I know, awful job, uh,

522
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,620
visiting the resorts and getting inspired
by, you know, the locations, experiences,

523
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:07,190
the food that we'll have there,
um,

524
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,690
and taking that and composing
like a kind of a soundtrack,

525
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,430
a theme song for each location. Um, and
so, yeah, and then playing a little bit,

526
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,060
a playing like a very short show
at each one. So I don't know,

527
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:22,180
I'm super excited about it. We have
a meeting on Wednesday, you know, to,

528
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,090
to plan the schedule for
this year. Cool. Man,

529
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,900
that sounds like a nice part of the job.
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I love to travel.

530
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:31,870
I love to eat. I love to play
music. So cool. Oh, am I fancy?

531
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,110
Rambo gets to come to yeah, yeah, yeah.

532
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,620
Hopefully he doesn't get
in trouble at work though.

533
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:40,150
He's supposed to be at work
right now. Okay. Hi. Hi. Hi.

534
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,690
So first of all, thanks for coming out
and you know, thanks for having us. Oh,

535
00:30:44,691 --> 00:30:47,380
of course. Thank you. That
was wonderful. Um, yeah,

536
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,070
I saw you're playing not just the cello,
but also the air. Whew. Yes. Uh Huh.

537
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,950
And I was just wondering if you had
some thoughts like how they compare and

538
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:56,810
contrast the spirit of the instrument.

539
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,180
Right. So the era, who was that? Um, you
know, the tall, thin, Chinese thing, um,

540
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,560
and it's made out of a
rosewood and snake skin. Um,

541
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,930
and I don't really know. I mean, there's
a, there's a fingerboard if you know,

542
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:11,650
so it's kind of similar to the cello,

543
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,130
but the strings are actually
suspended in the air.

544
00:31:14,131 --> 00:31:16,380
I wish I brought one to show you guys.
So there's actually,

545
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:21,030
you're not actually pressing
against anything, so it's
just a string. Um, and it's,

546
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,880
I don't know. I don't really, I don't
know even know if I play it properly.

547
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:27,600
I'm self taught. So I, I, I
bought one. Um, actually, wait,

548
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:30,150
do we have time if I tell a really quick
story about how I learned to play the

549
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:31,280
air? Who, yes.

550
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,730
I was doing this concert with the Golden
State pops orchestra and they were

551
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,350
doing a video game, music concert
and I was already playing a g,

552
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,510
I don't know if you guys played
journey the no. Yeah. So I, yeah,

553
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:44,450
I asked him injury. So
I did the original, uh,

554
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,060
I play the Cello Solos for that game. And
so we were playing journey. It's like,

555
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,830
oh, Tina, since you're
playing in the concert,

556
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:53,040
you're going to be there
already and you're Chinese.
Do you play the Chinese air?

557
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:57,180
Who, you know, cause all Chinese people
played there. Who? Um, but I thought, oh,

558
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,000
like what is it? They're like, yeah, we
have this game and a features the air who,

559
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:03,810
and I thought, wow, another opportunity
to be featured on stage. Yeah,

560
00:32:03,811 --> 00:32:06,750
I want to do that. I could wear
something Chinese. That'll be really fun.

561
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,610
But I had, I never played the
air who before? So I lied. I
lied. I lied. I said, yeah,

562
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:12,650
I could play the air.
Who is just,

563
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,720
if you could just send me the
music ahead of time. So I get,

564
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:18,240
and there was still like two weeks till
the concert, which is not that much time.

565
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,400
Um, and so I got off the
phone, got on Craig's list. So
searching air, who ere, who?

566
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:28,260
Nobody. There was no air hose for sale.
So I finally found a store in Texas,

567
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,830
in Austin, Texas. I had air who's
with like overnight shipping,

568
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,330
so I pay like $100 extra for shipping.
It arrived. I practiced every night.

569
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,940
I didn't sleep. I was like trying to
learn. I was watching youtube videos,

570
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:42,740
like how to play the air, who, um,
and I, I think I kind of did. Okay.

571
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:47,090
We use a lot of reverb, um, and the
concert and it was, it was pretty simple.

572
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:50,030
It wasn't a super complicated
part thing, thankfully. Um,

573
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:52,430
so that's how I play the air. Who,
so when you asked me about the air,

574
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:56,180
who I really am not educated on actually
what it's supposed to sound like. I'm,

575
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,320
it sounds very ethnic I guess cause
the tonality is different. Um,

576
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,440
but it's still like continuous
pitch and everything.

577
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:05,650
So I guess you had faith in yourself
because you knew like the principals

578
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,450
yes. The principles and you just
kind of slide around. If you miss it.

579
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:11,840
It's like I meant to do that as part of
the, it's part of the Chinese ness of it,

580
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:14,450
you know, it's like wow.
Right. Um, and it's, it is,

581
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,180
it is very forgiving them that
way. Yeah. Cool. Next question.

582
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,410
Um, do you have anything
else you can say about, uh,

583
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:28,310
working on journey with Austin? Like,
um, you know, what you think about, uh,

584
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,690
having such like,

585
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,570
evocative visuals to go with your
music and those kinds of things?

586
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,040
Yeah. So when we started working on
journey, I mean, it was so many years ago,

587
00:33:36,041 --> 00:33:39,850
I met Austin through
USC, uh, at school. Um,

588
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,270
and we had no idea it was gonna turn
out to be such a success. You know,

589
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,900
it was the first video game every ever
nominated for best soundtrack for a

590
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,440
grammy. Um, but when we did it,
like he was still in his old studio,

591
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,900
which was literally, it was just
like a room and like, you know,

592
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:55,060
we were both just slumming it and
like trying to figure out what to do.

593
00:33:55,061 --> 00:33:59,230
And so I had, we both had no idea that
would turn out to be such a big, um,

594
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,560
I guess a successful game. Um, and yeah,

595
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:05,350
I remember I just went to a studio
a few times. We will lay trial,

596
00:34:05,351 --> 00:34:09,460
different ideas again, lots of reverb
and I saw some of the early visuals,

597
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:12,520
but it wasn't, it was much later that
it was actually placed into the game.

598
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,960
So yeah, it was fun. It was
great. And I still work with
Austin, so it's good. Yeah,

599
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:19,990
he just wrote to me a Instagram
messaged me right before I got up here.

600
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,980
So you don't have him blocked? Fortunately
we don't have him blocked. I don't,

601
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,390
I don't have him black. No, no. Isn't it?

602
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,260
Okay.

603
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,720
Oh, right here. Cheery.

604
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,780
Okay.

605
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,410
Thanks. Uh, the effects of the wonder
woman soundtrack. I mean, I love that. Oh.

606
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,180
Um, made me think a little bit of
like Les Claypool or Tom Real, like,

607
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,150
I'm curious what it,

608
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,140
what it's like to learn the classical
style versus kind of try to push the

609
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:53,500
envelope of what an
instrument is capable of.

610
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:57,130
Like is there any overlap with some of
those artists or are you just out there

611
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:57,964
on your own?

612
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:03,030
Yeah, definitely. I mean, when I started
a, again, I, youtube was like my teachers.

613
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:06,070
So when I first got my electric
cello, I think it was about, yeah,

614
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:09,250
about 11 years ago when I was in college,
um,

615
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,750
I bought an electric cello with a
credit card, you know, from Yamaha. Uh,

616
00:35:12,751 --> 00:35:15,040
and then I was like, okay,
how, what do I do with this?

617
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:18,700
So I would just go on Youtube and
watch guitar tutorials and try to like,

618
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,560
cause the tone,
the tonality again is very,

619
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:22,640
very different from a
classical instrument. Um,

620
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,220
and then also being able to
improvise because most of
us classical musicians, um,

621
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,790
are not taught to improvise.

622
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,250
You play exactly what you're told to
play and you play it the same way every

623
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:31,900
time. Right? So it's a, it was,

624
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,410
it was more of like a mental thing even
rather than a physical cause once you

625
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:38,010
wrap your head around, you
can do you want, you know,

626
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,450
you can express yourself to the music.

627
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,540
And then just learning some different
scale pat like scalar patterns and

628
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:46,130
passages, um, that you can use in
like your solos or whatnot. Uh,

629
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:49,110
and then just playing around with pedals.
I actually went full digital very,

630
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:52,140
very recently. This is from
a line six, but I used to,

631
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:55,560
I was like a big collector of
pedal, so like analog pedals. Um,

632
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,590
and I used to love those. But after
a while there's some feedback issues,

633
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,940
you know, and now with new technology,
um, this unit right here, uh, it's,

634
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:06,930
it's both the APP modeler. So instead of
having like a giant amplifier, you know,

635
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,670
being carried in here, um, I just,

636
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:11,910
everything is processed through this
little pedal board. So all the effects,

637
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:14,980
all this amp sounds, everything is in
there. So it's really, really convenient.

638
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:15,690
Yeah.

639
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,523
Yeah.

640
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,150
Uh, going off of that, uh,

641
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,290
is that basically you're like piece of
equipment you can't live without or do

642
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:26,100
you have something that you really, really
love that you take everyday? This is,

643
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,430
this is it now. Like before when I did
shows, oh my gosh, I had to hire like a,

644
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,530
you know,
a company cause these amps are so heavy.

645
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,500
And of course I like to be melodramatic.
I have lots of like different amps.

646
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:37,260
So they come in like with a big truck,
unload everything,

647
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,080
and then all my pedals and this or that.
And now this little thing on the floor,

648
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,600
you just put it in a backpack.
Uh, you know, I don't carry it.

649
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:45,320
My Fiance Rambo carries it, but still
it's easier. It's easier for me.

650
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:50,050
It's easier for him and he
likes it too. Right. Okay.

651
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,570
Good answer. Next question. Hi,
thanks very much for coming.

652
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,280
You're music is amazing. Thank you. Um,

653
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,970
I what you're talking about with what
you've been doing with the electric cello

654
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,600
reminds me a lot of, um, have
you ever heard of Ronald Yankees?

655
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,680
He's a keyboardist. Um, I've seen
some of his videos on youtube. Um,

656
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:14,730
but he has this one song that's called
guitar sounds that he's using a keyboard.

657
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:18,040
I actually thought the first time I heard
it that it was just entirely electric

658
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:18,920
guitar.
Right.

659
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,150
And I was so surprised when I learned
that it was actually a keyboard.

660
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:26,050
So it might be something interesting
for you to look into because he's doing

661
00:37:26,051 --> 00:37:30,580
something similar. Is it with a keyboard
that you do with the electric cello and,

662
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,360
yeah, definitely. Yeah. We'll run.
We'll junkies. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

663
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,600
Maybe you can play with him and Ramstein
one day. Yeah, that'd be really cool.

664
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,940
Signs mine. I'm not sure how amazing
concert opportunity, but I don't, I mean,

665
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:47,950
you don't reach out to him, so
he would have to find, you. No,

666
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,960
know I check other artists out and stuff,

667
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:52,270
but it's usually for like people
that like, you know, I don't know.

668
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:56,530
I don't know what it is. I just feel like
energetically is that, is that wrong?

669
00:37:56,531 --> 00:37:59,230
Should I be like, I just don't want
to be one of those people like, oh,

670
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:03,360
work with me please. I'll play cello for
you. Balance. There's a balance. You know,

671
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,310
I try to,
it's more of like dangling the carrot.

672
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:08,250
Like you could reach out to Ramstein
is all I'm saying. Hmm. Yeah.

673
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:11,850
But I'd be like heart, so embarrassing.
Heartbroken if they said no, thank you.

674
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,360
But then nine, but then they're
not cool. Okay. That's fine.

675
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,510
I'll give it five more years and then,
okay, next question. So, uh, speaking of,

676
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:23,880
um, metal, uh, what are
you listening to? Recently?

677
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,560
Not a lot of metal recently.
I have to be honest. So, uh,

678
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,820
recently I've been obsessed with
financial, a youtube videos.

679
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:36,400
I have them on a playlist and I listened
to them every, if I'm putting on makeup.

680
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:40,480
Uh, but as far as like metal, obviously
rom sign is like my big, uh, obsession,

681
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:41,314
obsession.
And I'm,

682
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,530
I'm more into like when you mentioned
earlier about my cello metal album,

683
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:48,610
more of the classic, uh, old school
metal. Like now I'm honestly,

684
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,170
I haven't heard a lot of like new, new
bands that I'm really, really into.

685
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,250
Huh? White Chapel. Yeah, the
white chapel is cool, you know,

686
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:01,240
but I'm like old school stuff, black
sabbath, Metallica and whatnot, but more,

687
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,830
more industrial metal for sure. Yeah,
it'd be so cool. Have you played with the,

688
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,500
like there's these newer bands, I don't
know if you were thinking about these,

689
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:12,670
but like behemoth and like, like a, you
know, sleep, like there's just like more,

690
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,590
you know,
newer bands that I think would love,

691
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,350
I'm going to hook you guys up with them.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's going to happen

692
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,903
next.

693
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,700
Hi. Hello. So I'm a
pianist and a huge gamer.

694
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:30,660
And I remember reading on the Bio intro
that you also worked with League of

695
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,250
legends.
I'm kind of curious how that went.

696
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,210
Oh yeah. So I play, oh my
gosh, I forgot what year was,

697
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:38,840
I think it was three championships ago
when it was in la at the staple center.

698
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,600
Do you remember? I think
it was a few years ago. Um,

699
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:44,870
they just reached out and said,
uh, would you want to play for the,

700
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,780
for the championship? So we
opened it, uh, it was myself,

701
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:49,860
West Berlin from limp Bizkit.
Um,

702
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:54,910
and then the drummer from a combat
Christ who just left the band and then

703
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:59,030
crystal, crystal method and an
orchestra. So it was like this big,

704
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:03,830
like not a mess. So it was like
organized mess of just stuff. Um,

705
00:40:03,831 --> 00:40:05,270
and yeah,
it was a lot of fun.

706
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,450
Okay.

707
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,800
And my brother was really,
my little brother,

708
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:09,930
he's a huge league of legends player,
Him and his wife.

709
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:12,210
So they were like totally geeking out.
And they,

710
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:15,780
I remember they gave us a gift bag and
there's just like stuffed animal thing

711
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:18,180
from, and then they're like, oh my
God, can I have it? I'm like, sure,

712
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,070
you can have it.
So they were happy about it.

713
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,270
I think they were more excited than I was.
You know,

714
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,940
you also have a god of war
music video coming out, right?
Actually, yeah. It just,

715
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:30,510
it came out I believe last month. Um,
so yeah, I did a cover of the God,

716
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,560
a god of war. I tried to play the game.
I'm not very good at it, but it's good.

717
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:37,150
But it's hard. Really hard.
Oh my goodness. But yes, the,

718
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,230

720
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,100
But time for one more question.

721
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,150
