1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,120
This is Katie can trial with factory
farming awareness coalition. She,

2
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:14,110
she's here to speak today about the
impacts of an animal agriculture on the

3
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:18,520
environment. Um, and so I hope
everybody enjoys the presentation.

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,840
Okay,
so he was kidding.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,520
Thank you so much and thank you
everyone for coming. So again,

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,590
my name is Katie [inaudible].

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,450
I'm the founder and executive director
of the factory farming awareness

8
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:31,230
coalition or a local nonprofit based
in the bay area dedicated to talking to

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,330
people about the impacts
of our food choices.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,720
Here's an outline of what
we'll be discussing today,

11
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:39,120
the basics of factory farming,
what that term means,

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,040
an overview of the environmental impacts
and we'll conclude by talking about

13
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,920
potential solutions.
So you know,

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,240
while some of this information
is disturbing and depressing,

15
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,600
I promised that we will end on an upbeat
note and there'll be little cuteness

16
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:56,460
interludes in between each section to
give you a chance to ask questions. Now,

17
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:58,490
how many of you are saying
all Mcdonald's when your kids,

18
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,030
or maybe you're singing
it with your own children?

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,590
So when we walk into the supermarket
and look around a picture,

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,820
pictures on products, it looks like old
MacDonald's farm is still around today.

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,610
We see all these rolling green
hills sides, all those happy cows.

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,990
But unfortunately,

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,020
this is not what farming is like anymore
in the United States rather than old

24
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:16,890
Mcdonald.
This is what we have today.

25
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,300
Factory farms are technically known as
concentrated animal feeding operations or

26
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:26,280
k foes. It's a practice of keeping
thousands, tens of thousands,

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,220
hundreds of thousands of animals in
confinement for their entire lives.

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,550
This has done to produce the
most product for the most profit.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,850
Before we go any further,

30
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:39,450
does anyone want to guess how many
animals are Brad and killed for food every

31
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:42,150
year in the United States?
You don't already know the answer.

32
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:47,010
Anyone want to take a guess?
Okay, so pretty close.

33
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,260
So yeah,
there's actually 9 billion there.

34
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:53,730
Between nine and 10 billion animals raised
and killed for food every single year

35
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:57,390
in the United States alone. This is just
land animals, not even counting fish.

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,470
So there are more farmed animals in the
United States than there are people on

37
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:05,340
the entire planet. Now. Of
these 9 billion animals,

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,640
what percentage of them do you think are
raised on factory farms rather than on

39
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:10,810
this nice small old Mcdonald type farms?

40
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,880
80% but 99% some 99% of meat that
you see nowadays in restaurants or

41
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:21,720
supermarkets is going to be
coming from these factory farms.

42
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,600
Now if we've heard the
term factory farming,

43
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,870
it's usually in the context of animal
welfare and that's not what we'll be

44
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,770
focusing on today.

45
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,730
But I do briefly want to discuss what
conditions look like on factory farms

46
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:36,270
because that's also what contributes to
most of the environmental problems as

47
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,990
well. And I think it helps to understand
the mindset of factory farming,

48
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,020
which is really summed up best
by national hog farmer magazine.

49
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,660
They said the breeding sow,
which is a mother pig,

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,010
should be thought of and treated as a
valuable piece of machinery whose function

51
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,680
is to pump out baby pigs
like a sausage machine.

52
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,510
So these are no longer thought of as
living and creatures they're thought of as

53
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,530
units of production.

54
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,160
It is this mindset that allows us to
treat farmed animals in ways that we would

55
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:06,190
never dream of treating our dogs or cats.
So again,

56
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:10,300
the hallmark of factory farming is this
intensive confinement the animal spend

57
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:15,220
their entire lives sometimes can find in
Kate's or courageous CZ cages or crates

58
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,150
so small that they cannot even turn
around other industries like the Turkey

59
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:22,870
industry, they're kept by the
thousands inside of these sheds.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,670
So this obviously causes extreme
problems for animal offer.

61
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:30,370
They can't engage in even the
most basic of natural behaviors,

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,300
but it is also this overcrowding that
causes the environmental issues as well.

63
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,830
So for the rest of the presentation,

64
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,370
you have to keep in mind that these are
what conditions look like on factory

65
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:44,010
farms where 99% in meat is coming from.
Now.

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,520
One question that frequently comes up
is what about the labels that we see on

67
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:49,980
products that seemed to indicate
they're coming from better places?

68
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:53,700
So I want to quickly go through what
those mean. I'll start with cage free.

69
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,240
This is a picture of a cage free egg farm.
Now it's true.

70
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:58,680
These hands aren't in cages,

71
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:01,860
but it's not exactly what we imagine
when we see the term cage free.

72
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,320
He says happy looking chickens
on the front of the carton,

73
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,960
so it really means just
that they're not in cages,

74
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:10,290
but they're still kept by the tens of
thousands inside of these industrial sheds

75
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,860
for their entire lives.
Unfortunately,

76
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:16,020
conditions on free range
farms are very similar,

77
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,590
so technically it means the animals
must have access to the outdoors,

78
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,610
but there are no real enforced
specifications for what that means,

79
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,240
and there are a lot of loopholes as well
that lot farms get away with keeping

80
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:30,450
their animals can find by the tens
of thousands inside of these sheds.

81
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,950
But if there's access to the outdoors
like a tiny little door that opens onto a

82
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:35,784
dirt patch,

83
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,330
it can technically count as free range
even if not a single animal ever actually

84
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:44,070
steps foot outside.
Now to give you a real world example,

85
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,890
the wording on the left is
from a package of Judy's eggs,

86
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:50,820
which is a popular organic free range
brand from right here in northern

87
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:51,510
California.

88
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,840
It says these hands are raised in wide
open spaces and Sonoma valley where they

89
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:56,910
are free to roam,
scratch and play.

90
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,600
While on the right you can see an aerial
photo of what Judy's farm actually

91
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,840
looks like. Those are those industrial
sheds with tens of thousands of chickens.

92
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,900
There aren't any birds outside and
the purple that you see in front,

93
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:10,830
there is a manure pit, which we will be
talking about much more in a few minutes.

94
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,540
Now, Judy is actually settled a lawsuit
with the Animal Legal Defense Fund for

95
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:18,120
misleading consumers with the
claims on their packaging.

96
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,980
So they have changed the wording,

97
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,480
but there are still certified free range
and organic and in fact they rebrand

98
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:25,860
under several different brand names,

99
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:28,920
which is a very common practice to make
consumers think they're coming from

100
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:32,550
these nice little individual family
farms when they're coming from the same

101
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,950
source,
these factory farms,

102
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:37,770
so they sell under Judy's Uncle
Daddy's rock island gold circle.

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,930
There are also a leading
supplier for whole foods,

104
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,970
three 65 brand and organic valley.

105
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,320
So unfortunately even some of the most
respected organic free range brands are

106
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:48,300
in fact sourcing from factory farms.

107
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,300
The final term that you might see is
humane and this has no legal meaning

108
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:56,270
whatsoever. The USDA does
not regulate the term humane,

109
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,500
nor do they the term natural, so any
company can put these on any product.

110
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:04,070
It's really just a marketing gimmick
and it's unfortunate because these

111
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,580
companies are taking advantage of
consumers desire to buy products that are

112
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,340
coming from a better place.
We don't want animals to be mistreated.

113
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,760
We don't want to impact the
environment and negative ways.

114
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,560
But unfortunately this is usually just
used as a mechanism to increase the price

115
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,750
when they are,
they're still coming from factory farms.

116
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,550
Animal Agriculture is one of the single
most destructive industries on the

117
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,384
planet.

118
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,960
I know this can seem a little bizarre
for still imagining old MacDonald's farm.

119
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:32,000
What could be so bad about,
oh, Mcdonald's, right?

120
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,450
So I'm going to walk you through it.
So again,

121
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:39,680
keep in mind that there are 9 billion
animals raised and killed for food every

122
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,470
year. And this is where most of the
environmental problems stem from.

123
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:47,270
It's the sheer number of animals that
are required to make enough meat for 300

124
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,900
million plus Americans to eat meat
every single day. Often with every meal.

125
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,190
And the problems come from the fact that
these are 9 billion living, breathing,

126
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,630
eating, pooping animals. Now they're
eating primarily corn and soy.

127
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,860
And we imagine farmers and farm land
in the U S we, I think, imagine, um,

128
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,860
we imagine growing crops to feed to
people, right? But in the United States,

129
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:14,090
over half of all farmland is planted with
corn and soy and most of that is going

130
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:17,150
to feed not people,
but two animals on factory farms.

131
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,640
This is a problem for
several different reasons.

132
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,950
One is that animals are actually
a very inefficient source of food.

133
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,710
So imagine that you are raising an animal
for food from the day that that animal

134
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:32,780
is born until the day that you
slaughter it, you have to feed it right.

135
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,310
So that's days, weeks, months,

136
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:38,030
potentially even years that you're
giving this animal food every single day.

137
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,780
So if you add up all of the food that you
give to that animal over the course of

138
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:42,614
its lifetime,

139
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,210
it ends up being anywhere from two to 15
times more food than the amount of food

140
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:49,250
that you get from eating
that animal's flesh.

141
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,420
The latest studies have found that if
we cut global meat consumption in half,

142
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:56,780
and we used all of that farmland to grow
fruits and veggies for people to eat

143
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:57,614
directly,

144
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,800
rather than growing that corn and soy
to feed to animals on factory farms,

145
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,960
we could feed every single
person on earth. Today plus
an extra 2 billion people.

146
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,560
So we hear a lot of talk about how are
we going to feed the growing global

147
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:10,394
population.

148
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,180
And in fact we could do it easily if we
were using our land more efficiently,

149
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,770
but eating lower on the food chain,

150
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,330
this land use is a huge
problem globally as well.

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,500
Me Production is actually the leading
cause of the Amazon rain forest being cut

152
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:28,430
down. We can see that here in this
infographic from the center for biological

153
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,264
diversity.

154
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,620
Every minute there are two acres of
rainforest clear cut to make grazing land

155
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:38,090
for beef cattle or land to grow corn and
soy to feed to animals on factory farms.

156
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,140
This is also a problem in
the United States as well.

157
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,560
Oftentimes people think I don't want to
support factory farms so I'm going to

158
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:48,920
buy free range beef. Now there are a
couple of different problems with this.

159
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,230
One is that actually most beef cattle
or free range for the first eight to 10

160
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:58,650
months of their lives. So if you drive,
you know, especially in Moran Petaluma,

161
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,920
that area you might see these bucolic
looking cattle grazing on hillsides.

162
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:02,850
And it looks very nice,

163
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:06,540
but most of those cattle are then shipped
to industrial feedlots where they're

164
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,740
fed corn and soy intensively for the
last few months of their lives to fatten

165
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:11,940
them up to reach market weight.

166
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,010
The other big problem is that while there
are certain ecosystems that do benefit

167
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:19,020
from having grazing ruminant animals,

168
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,290
there is a limit to how many
animals that land can sustain.

169
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,470
It's called the carrying capacity.
And when you exceed that,

170
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,290
you start to have these very
serious ecological problems.

171
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:32,850
And that's what we're seeing across the
west now. So cattle are being grazed on,

172
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,100
uh, on public lands. So the government
is basically subsidizing these,

173
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,430
this grass in order to
Gracie's free range cattle.

174
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,750
But the bureau of land management,

175
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:47,340
which manages this land is not insuring
that it's being managed properly to

176
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,240
prevent these environmental problems.
So you have too many cattle on this land,

177
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,490
so they're eating everything
that comes up out of the ground.

178
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,020
They're eating what would grow into
shrubs and trees to provide habitat for

179
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:01,980
native animals. This also causes
soil erosion and impacts waterways.

180
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,640
So a lot of different devastating
impacts of overgrazing.

181
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,460
And to make matters worse,

182
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,450
there's a very secretive government
agency called wildlife services.

183
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:13,850
They're a part of the USTA,

184
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,580
and in 2015 they killed
over 3 million animals,

185
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:22,470
mostly at the request of ranchers. So
they're killing off predators like wolves,

186
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:26,070
bears, coyotes. Fox is mountain
lions that could kill the livestock.

187
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,330
They're killing off prairie dogs and
ground squirrels can dig holes that the

188
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,770
cattle could fall into even
rounding up and killing Buffalo.

189
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,320
So native ruminate animals because they're
competing with the cattle for feed.

190
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,400
So we're destroying these entire
native ecosystems in order to make them

191
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:43,290
suitable for free range cattle.

192
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,780
Now another big problem with all of these
animals and all of these crops is that

193
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,260
they're very water intensive. Now when
we think about ways to save water,

194
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,870
what are some things that come to mind?
What are ways we're told?

195
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:59,790
Just to say we can help save water.
Yeah, take shorter showers, right?

196
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:03,540
That's a classic one. Turn off the
tap when you brush your teeth, right?

197
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,440
Water your lawn less.

198
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:07,890
So all of these suggestions
focus on our direct water usage.

199
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,580
In this next video clip
from the movie Casper, see,

200
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,950
we'll see how this compares to the
water impact of our food choices.

201
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I found out that one quarter
pound hamburger requires
over 660 gallons of water

202
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:22,970
to produce. Here. I've been
taking these short showers,

203
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:26,900
trying to save water and to find out just
eating one hamburger is the equivalent

204
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:29,180
of showering two entire months.

205
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,620
So much attention is given to
lowering our home water use.

206
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Yet domestic water use is only 5% of what
is consumed in the u s versus 55% for

207
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:38,800
animal agriculture.

208
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,060
That's because it takes upwards of 2,500
gallons of water to produce one pound

209
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:43,894
of beef.

210
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,980
The single best way that we can help say
water on a daily basis is through our

211
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:51,070
food choices, so the numbers they
used, they're on the high end,

212
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:54,490
but even the more conservative estimates
show switching from my hamburger to

213
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:57,640
Veggie Burger, just one single
time opting for a Veggie Burger.

214
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,690
Instead of a hamburger,

215
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,560
you save as much water as not
showering for one entire month.

216
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,080
So all that water, all of
this, um, corn and soy.

217
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,360
Also a lot of hormones,
pesticides,

218
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:14,980
antibiotics are fed to these 9 billion
animals. It goes through their system.

219
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,420
And then what happens to food after
we digest it? It comes out as poop.

220
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,580
Farm animals in the United States produce
130 times as much proof as the entire

221
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:25,840
us human population,

222
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,860
and there's very little waste
infrastructure for factory farms.

223
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,480
One of America's biggest secrets is that
farms practically don't exist anymore.

224
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,140
The animals we eat are grown
inside giant hidden factories.

225
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,020
Since 2012 I've been secretly planning
a project to expose these factory farms

226
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,500
using the highest texts,
spy equipment available

227
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,403
drones.

228
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,750
This video provides just a sample of
what I saw during only a few days of

229
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:02,584
filming.

230
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,450
You're looking at a lake of toxic 80
CC's and urine the size of four football

231
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,040
fields.

232
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,750
That's because thousands upon thousands
of pigs are inside of these buildings.

233
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Their waste falls through slats in the
concrete floor and it sloshed it directly

234
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,050
into this giant open air cesspool.

235
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,640
How many of these kinds of factories
are there in North Carolina alone?

236
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,620
There are over 2000 and the
consequences are disastrous.

237
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,900
The waste false through through
the floors it's flushed out.

238
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,620
And to have an open pit assess Paul,

239
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,930
it's easy for a big hog operation to
have as much waste as a medium size city.

240
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,010
Of course the pit will fill up so it
has to be empty and they're empty by

241
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:04,370
spraying the liquid waste.
Yes. You heard that right? Yep.

242
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,010
If you're familiar with a garden sprayer,
they're gigantic versions of that.

243
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:14,011
So they're making droplets fine mists
out of this liquid waste and that can

244
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:21,160
drift down wind into the
neighboring communities. Uh,

245
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,130
shut my hog operation down
and I got out of it and uh, I,

246
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,153
I couldn't,

247
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,440
I just couldn't do another person
that way to make them smell bad.

248
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,820
It is a safe food. If you put
please season, you're urinary,

249
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,940
a hole in the ground that
you dump a toxic waste.

250
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,220
And I've seen dead hogs and
stuff like that. People can't

251
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,940
open their windows. They can't
go outside. I've seen it.

252
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,500
I've talked to the people. I've seen the
little children. They say mama data. Wow,

253
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,280
we got to smell

254
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,470
this.

255
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,530
Did you get stories like I
can't hang my clothes out. Pc.

256
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,290
Oda Combine attacking itself to your
clothes and then people are saying we're

257
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,910
spirited by neighbors. It can. I
think we're very correctly, right?

258
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Be called environmental racism
or environmental injustice
that people of color,

259
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,530
low income people bear the
brunt of these practices,

260
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,560
so this is where they spray
around our waist on us.

261
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,510
This is about eight feet
from my mother's house.

262
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,420
What is it like when the mist that snacks,
you think it's raining

263
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,620
really? You think it's raining? We
don't open the doors, the windows,

264
00:15:29,621 --> 00:15:33,550
but the oldest still comes in. It takes
your breath away. Then you start gagging,

265
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:34,200
you get headaches.

266
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,700
Is there a number of studies
of asthma and asthma symptoms,

267
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,950
particularly in children near
these facilities? Among adults,

268
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,900
there are reports of several types
of upper respiratory symptoms.

269
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,500
These pollutants are affecting
people's blood pressure.

270
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,790
Who's responsible for all
this Smithfield suits,

271
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,490
specifically the subdivision Murphy Brown,

272
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,350
which controls the factory farms shown in
all of the drone footage in this video.

273
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,150
Smithfield is by far the largest
pork producer in the entire world.

274
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,140
And inside these buildings there
is something else entirely.

275
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,990
Pigs are really intelligent animals.
They are more intelligent than dogs.

276
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:18,110
They are more intelligent than cats.
In the average pig barn,

277
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,190
there could be hundreds,

278
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:24,191
if not thousands of pigs crammed
into this one sprawling indoor space.

279
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,290
Their entire life has been
standing on concrete floors.

280
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:31,520
Mother pigs are locked in metal cages
so small that they literally cannot even

281
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,080
turn around for months at a time.

282
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,760
This is not a partisan issue.

283
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,860
We are all opposed to children being
made sick to animals being abused and to

284
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:44,790
everyday people's lives being ruined
by the stench of cesspools in their

285
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,630
backyards.

286
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,930
These thousands of lakes of toxic waste
must be among the most bizarre and

287
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:54,780
disturbing environmental phenomenon
that has ever confronted America.

288
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,240
And Dave had been kept well hidden
from the public for long enough.

289
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,740
So you've just seen what happens to all
of this waste. It's fairly shocking,

290
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:24,310
right? And for urban consumers
meet starts at the supermarket.

291
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,300
It starts at a restaurant.

292
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:29,140
We don't ever have to see or
experience the real impacts of it,

293
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:32,830
so it's usually these rural low income
communities, often communities of color,

294
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,560
the bear the brunt of the
rest of our meat consumption.

295
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,320
They're the ones who have to be exposed
to this environmental pollution on a

296
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,154
daily basis.

297
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,990
The other huge problem with all of
these animals and all of this waste is

298
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,980
climate change.

299
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,150
I report from the United Nations
found that animal agriculture creates

300
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,230
greenhouse gas emissions
than all the planes,

301
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:55,860
trains and cars in the entire
world all added up together.

302
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,470
Part of the reason for this is it
ruminant animals like cows and sheep lambs

303
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,970
actually burp methane,

304
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:06,390
which is 20 times worse for
climate change and carbon dioxide.

305
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,110
The poop from all of these different
types of animals, chickens, pigs,

306
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,050
all the ones that we've
seen releases nitrous oxide,

307
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,160
which is 300 times worse for
climate change than carbon dioxide.

308
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,440
And they're also all
of the impacts of that.

309
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:22,440
Deforestation when you consider the
whole life cycle of everything that's

310
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:23,700
required to produce the meat.

311
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,180
The deforestation also plays a large
role because they're cutting down forest

312
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:28,740
that would otherwise be absorbing CO2.

313
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,520
So when you factor in all
of these things together,

314
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:36,810
you see that our food choices are also
the single best way that we can help

315
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:39,750
shrink our carbon footprint on a daily
basis. Just like our water footprint.

316
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,440
So one study found that not
eating meat just one day a week,

317
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:47,820
say some more greenhouse gas emissions
and buying local food 100% of the time.

318
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,550
Okay.

319
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,510
A different study found that if everyone
in the United States ate no meat or

320
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,250
cheese,
just one day a week,

321
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,430
it would be like not driving 91 billion
miles are taking 7.6 million cars off

322
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:01,994
the road.

323
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,510
So we can think about what are the
chances that we're going to convince 7

324
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,700
million people to sell their
cars and never drive again?

325
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,830
Probably not going to happen,
right?

326
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,430
Whereas getting people to not eat
meat just one day a week, you know,

327
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,250
choose a PB and j instead
of a Turkey Sandwich.

328
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:18,200
And a Veggie burrito
instead of a beef burrito.

329
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,010
It's one of the easiest and most effective
ways that we can help stop climate

330
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:22,844
change.

331
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:24,580
Okay.

332
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,580
And in fact there's more and more
scientific evidence showing that we cannot

333
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,960
keep climate change to a level that's
conducive to human civilization without

334
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:37,090
addressing the carbon
footprint of agriculture.

335
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,650
So this study found that the
agriculture related emissions alone,

336
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:43,990
if we continue our current practices,

337
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:47,560
especially as a global population grows
and demand for meat goes up worldwide

338
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,010
than agriculture alone will take up
almost all of the global carbon budget by

339
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:58,381
2050 so this means that even if we got
every other industry down to carbon

340
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:00,880
neutral,
but we left agriculture the same,

341
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,970
we would still be hitting
that two degree target.

342
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,340
So the only scenario that would reduce
emissions in 2050 compared to 2009 levels

343
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,960
is what they call the
healthy diets scenario,

344
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,170
which is switching to significantly
more plant based protein

345
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,380
and as an added benefit,

346
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,870
eating more plant based protein also
has positive impacts on the health of

347
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:24,940
citizens and on health care costs.

348
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,690
So if American's transitioned
to a plant by plant based diet,

349
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,160
not only would it reduce food related
greenhouse gas emissions by 79% we could

350
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:38,161
also avoid 460,000 deaths and save $289
billion in healthcare costs and climate

351
00:20:39,731 --> 00:20:40,564
change costs.

352
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,310
So one of the reasons that people eat
so much meat is that it seems cheap,

353
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,340
but that's because the
true of it or externalize.

354
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:51,040
So we don't have to see
the environmental costs,

355
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,220
the healthcare costs when we go to the
store, when we go to the restaurant.

356
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,430
But as taxpayers we are
actually paying the true cost.

357
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,930
And the most effective way to reverse
that is to transition to a more plant

358
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:05,800
based diet.
The basic solution is very simple.

359
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,590
We have to eat less meat.
That's really what it boils down to.

360
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,310
And different organizations,

361
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,160
world leaders are starting to catch on
to this and starting to encourage people

362
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,570
to switch to plant based protein.

363
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:20,320
So the United Nations Environmental
Program has urged first world citizens to

364
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,380
cut our meat consumption,
half become what they call dematerial.

365
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,980
The Stockholm International Water
Institute has gone even further.

366
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,940
And said that we need to limit animal
based foods to just 5% of our total daily

367
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:34,810
calories. Right now the make up about
30% of the standard American diet,

368
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:39,280
so they said we need to eat just one
sixth as much meat as we currently are,

369
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,470
and they've warned that
if we do not do this,

370
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,310
then we will be faced with food and water
shortages worldwide that could lead to

371
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:48,460
civil war. So the stakes are
about as high as they get.

372
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:51,610
When we're talking about things
like climate change, global famine,

373
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,020
and all of this can be impacted
directly through our food choices.

374
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:01,210
Now a big challenge is how do you get
people interested in eating less meat?

375
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,410
There are a lot of reasons that people
eat meat. It tastes good, it's cheap,

376
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,840
it's convenient, it's part of our
culture, it's part of our habit.

377
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:11,350
And so now different organizations
and nonprofits as well as money,

378
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:12,730
different food startups,

379
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,660
especially in the bay area are working
on ways to get people excited about

380
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:17,980
eating more plant based protein.

381
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,030
One initiative that's been very
successful as meatless Mondays.

382
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,510
This was actually started by Johns
Hopkins University as a public health

383
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,850
initiative as we saw a few slides ago.

384
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,870
Healthcare costs are hugely impacted
by the amount of animal protein than

385
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:35,320
Americans currently consume. Many of
the leading causes of death, cancer,

386
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,480
heart disease, diabetes, stroke,

387
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,360
are directly related to eating
too much animal protein,

388
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,680
so they figured if people
eat even a seventh less meat,

389
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:46,510
if people are not eating
meat one day a week,

390
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,960
then it will really help people's
health and many other organizations have

391
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:52,960
jumped on board and said it's a great way
to help the environment and animals as

392
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:57,040
well and even for die hard meat lovers.
The idea of not eating meat meat,

393
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:01,480
just one day a week is something that
seems very doable and currently a third of

394
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,340
Americans report trying to participate.

395
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,850
Green Monday is also another
really successful program,

396
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:09,460
but it's similar to meatless Monday,

397
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:11,920
but really focused on those
environmental impacts,

398
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,690
emphasizing the fact that the best way
to go green is by eating more plant based

399
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:17,350
protein.

400
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,520
It's actually based in Hong Kong and
they've had tremendous success in shifting

401
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,180
the entire cities eating habits by having
a really positive empowering campaign.

402
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,110
Emphasizing that eating green choosing
veggie options is a very effective step

403
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:36,640
to take. And Green Monday emphasizes that,
you know, it's not a one size fits all.

404
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:41,170
So oftentimes people are deterred from
taking a step because they think that

405
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:45,890
they won't be able to be perfectly 100%
vegetarian or Vegan and so get dissuaded

406
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,320
and they give up.
But as a green Monday shows,

407
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,840
there are a number of different
ways that we can go about this.

408
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,690
So whether that's routine based,
one day a week,

409
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:57,080
so green Monday or meatless Monday,
you can do every day for lunch,

410
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,490
eat a vegetarian or Vegan lunch
it, you know, just one meal a day.

411
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,710
It's pretty doable for most people.
But if you do that,

412
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:07,490
then a third of the time you'll be eating
fudge. It can also be portioned based.

413
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:09,980
So decreasing the amount
of meat theory are eating,

414
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,020
increasing the amount
of plant based protein,

415
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,090
vegetarian foods on your plate,
or it can be impact based.

416
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:20,870
So pledging to only order Veggie burgers
instead of hamburgers from now on.

417
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:25,310
There are many different ways that we
can play around with our food choices and

418
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:28,640
increase the amount of plant based
foods that we're eating. And again,

419
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:32,090
as one of the single most
effective actions that we can take.

420
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,790
There are also some very exciting tech
solutions that are in the works right now,

421
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:38,750
namely clean meat.

422
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,790
So clean meat involves extracting
stem cells from animal tissue,

423
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,150
culturing those and then basically
growing meat tissue in the lab and then

424
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:53,630
layering that to produce hamburgers,
chicken nuggets. So it is actually meet,

425
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:57,710
I mean it is animal tissue and it's
based on medical technology used to grow

426
00:24:57,711 --> 00:24:59,990
human skin cells to
graft onto burn victims,

427
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:04,490
but they're actually growing
meat and this is successful.

428
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,000
Memphis meats has produced just um,

429
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,210
I think about a month ago they had the
first tastings of clean chicken and duck

430
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:14,120
meat. And there are a few other companies
that are working on beef as well.

431
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,890
And this is extremely more
efficient than factory farming.

432
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:22,010
So clean meat uses 99% less land.

433
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,220
96 produces 96% less greenhouse gas
emissions and uses 96% less water.

434
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,430
And there's a really great organization
called the Good Food Institute that is

435
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:36,380
working to help encourage the science
behind clean meat and policy around clean

436
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:38,930
meat as well.
So according to the latest estimates,

437
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:41,540
it should be on the market within
about four to five years. Again,

438
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,440
the technology is there,

439
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:46,280
it's just a matter of scaling it so that
it's cost competitive with factory farm

440
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,190
meat. But I think this is one
of the most hopeful development.

441
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:52,550
So if we can replace fast food,
meet with clean meat,

442
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,240
then we will see drastic
impacts on the environment.

443
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:58,310
And obviously it's for animals as well.

444
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,200
But the good news is that you don't have
to wait four or five years to make a

445
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:03,621
difference.

446
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:08,510
There are a number of other startups
all based right around here that are

447
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:11,990
working on creating foods that have
the same case in textures that we love,

448
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,470
but they are made from more
sustainable plant based sources.

449
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:19,430
So as Biz stone said, these guys are
coming at the meat analog industry,

450
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:21,950
not as a novelty. They're coming
at it from the big science angle.

451
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:26,720
So they're really, these products are
not made for vegetarian markets anymore.

452
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:29,510
They're not made for niche market.
They're getting the top chefs,

453
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:34,070
top food scientists to create products
that are really delicious and satisfying

454
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,450
for diehard meat lovers.

455
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:38,900
So you have companies like
beyond meat and impossible foods,

456
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:40,070
which makes the Burger,

457
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,230
the burger that bleeds as it's been
getting a lot of attention in the press.

458
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:45,780
Hampton creek foods,
which makes just male, um,

459
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:49,290
cookie salad dressings and all of
these products. You can read articles,

460
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,340
see interviews online,

461
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,000
they do blind taste tests and people
can't tell the difference. So,

462
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,140
okay,

463
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,110
if the main reason that we're eating
meat is because it tastes good,

464
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,470
it's fantastic news that there are now
products available that have that same

465
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:04,500
taste, the same texture, but they're
better for us, better for animals,

466
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,420
better for the environment.
So it's really a win win.

467
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,070
And this is a top growing trend.

468
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:14,090
This is really the direction that the
market is moving. So food navigator,

469
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:18,560
magazine, mental, um, business,
uh, the nutrition business journal,

470
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,520
I mean they've all documented that
Americans are eating more and more plant

471
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:24,890
based foods. They're interested
in it from a health angle,

472
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:26,120
from an environmental angle.

473
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,200
And this is consistently one of the
fastest growing sectors of the food system

474
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,490
as a result.

475
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,300
And even more exciting trend is that
meat and dairy companies are actually

476
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:39,440
starting to jump on board. So
even Tyson chicken, their CEO,

477
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,400
the CEO of Tyson chicken said that plant
based protein is the way of the future.

478
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,110
And dairy companies are also investing
in plant based dairy. So Dannon Yogurt,

479
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,040
the parent company that makes Dannon
bought white wave, which makes silk,

480
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:55,070
so I'm milk and almond milk and they're
shifting a lot of their marketing budget

481
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:58,730
away from marketing dairy foods
towards marketing plant based foods.

482
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:03,800
So we see this very positive feedback
cycle where the more that we vote with our

483
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,480
dollars and we buy these products,

484
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,920
the more appealing that food sector
becomes to businesses. They invest in it,

485
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,160
then those products are more
widely available, they're cheaper,

486
00:28:13,161 --> 00:28:15,800
they're more accessible. And so more
and more people start buying them.

487
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,190
And as we've seen,
especially with products like almond milk,

488
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,940
then they start to take up a larger and
larger market share. And as a result,

489
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,760
there are fewer animals bred
and killed for food every year.

490
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,760
And so oftentimes people say,
but I'm just one person.

491
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,890
What difference do my
food traces really make?

492
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,730
But we really can't have a very
direct impact on this industry.

493
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,800
And especially at a time when federal
policy is increasingly frustrating and

494
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,870
alarming.
You know,

495
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,050
there's zero chance of federal action
on climate change within these next few

496
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:45,350
years.

497
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,030
So this is even more important that we
can really directly impact this industry,

498
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,480
have a real impact on climate change
through our daily food choices.

499
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,410
And it's really never been easier or
tastier to eat these plant based foods.

500
00:28:59,411 --> 00:29:03,060
So I'm guardian products are probably
my favorite. They have these great guy,

501
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,130
I'm crispy tenders and they're actually
owned by the company that makes hungry

502
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:07,090
man dinners.
So again,

503
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:10,220
we see these meat companies starting
to invest in plant based products. Um,

504
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,520
almond milk is available
every supermarket.

505
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,570
Ben and Jerry's now has seven flavors
of almond milk based ice cream.

506
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,600
So we see, again, it's,
it's a growing trend,

507
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:24,460
which is great for all of us because
it makes it so easy to do. And again,

508
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:24,941
you know,

509
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:29,410
you don't have to be 100% vegetarian to
order a veggie burger or Veggie burrito.

510
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:32,440
You don't have to be totally Vegan all
the time to put almond milk in your

511
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:36,280
cereal instead of cow milk. It's not
about being all or nothing, you know,

512
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:37,360
a hundred percent perfect.

513
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:41,380
It's about looking at the impacts of our
food choices and deciding what we our

514
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:42,214
money to support.

515
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,270
And the other good news is that again,
this really has a direct impact.

516
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:51,950
So supply and demand applies.

517
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,980
Demand has been going down since 2007
demand has dropped and as a result there

518
00:29:57,081 --> 00:30:00,490
are 400 million fewer animals bred and
killed for food now than there were back

519
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:04,720
in 2007 as a direct result of people like
you and me deciding to eat less meat.

520
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,810
So remember that every time you
decide not to eat an animal product,

521
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:12,370
you are taking action against one of
the most destructive industries on the

522
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:13,204
planet.

523
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,390
Yeah,

524
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,370
we'd love to get your
feedback on the presentation.

525
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,880
So just a quick survey and if you'd
like to sign up for our mailing list,

526
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:22,880
we send out just once a month
newsletter with recipes,

527
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:25,940
national news about factory farming,
petitions to sign, things like that.

528
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,510
And we'll also send you some
recipes and some further resources,

529
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:33,950
but you can also fill this
out anonymously. Oh, so the,
is there, the question was,

530
00:30:33,951 --> 00:30:37,750
is there a good place to find the sources
for the studies that I've cited or

531
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:38,750
more information?
Yeah,

532
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:42,440
so we have all of the citations for our
presentation available on our website

533
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,500
and we actually have a, um, a fortune,
I don't have any with me today,

534
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:49,400
but we have a new leaflet that's
focused on the environmental impacts and

535
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:53,630
there's a page with citations for
that also available on our website.

536
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:56,590
So those have all of the
original studies that were,

537
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,490
we're setting from the movie.

538
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:01,970
Cowspiracy is also a good resource
and they have a website with a lot of

539
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:02,960
information as well,

540
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,580
specifically about the environmental
studies for more information about food

541
00:31:07,581 --> 00:31:10,130
sources and you know what to
eat, nutrition, all of that.

542
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:14,150
Choose vege.com is a really fantastic
resource. They've got meal plans,

543
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:16,490
tips for eating out all the
nutritional info that you need.

544
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

545
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,460
So the question is what's the relationship
between the animal products consumed

546
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:26,590
in the u s and what is
consumed around the world?

547
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:31,060
So I mean it's a pretty complicated
relationship. It depends on the industry,

548
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:35,200
but roughly 15% of products here exported.

549
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,770
So Americans do have no,

550
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:41,220
we have the second highest
meat consumption in the
world. We are actually, um,

551
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,160
pass by Australia,
but we do eat most of those products here.

552
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:46,840
Some of it is exported.
Um,

553
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:50,860
we do import some products as well
and a lot of these companies are now,

554
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:54,220
they started in the United States, but
they're now multinational corporations.

555
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,440
And actually Smithfield, which is
the largest pork producer, was um,

556
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,170
bought. Basically a majority stake
was bought by a Chinese company.

557
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,240
And so now we are starting to see an
increase in pork exports to China.

558
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:10,990
So now Americans are having to
deal with these environmental,

559
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,780
the environmental pollution and
these products are exported.

560
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,900
Another huge issue is Alfalfa feed.

561
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,110
Alfalfa is the most intensive crop in
terms of water and Saudi Arabia and other

562
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:26,980
countries are now, um, they're importing
Alfalfa from the United States.

563
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,260
So they're basically important water.
So,

564
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,460
and this is a huge problem because a
lot of that Alfalfa is grown in southern

565
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:37,300
California and Arizona and parts of the
country that are facing these droughts

566
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:41,990
and our water is actually being exported
to support the dairy industry in the

567
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,290
Middle East. And the US
is also, you know, we've,

568
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,220
we have set this example that
if you're well off, you know,

569
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:50,630
the lifestyle that we've,

570
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,250
that other people want to emulate as
their income grows is that, you know,

571
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:57,020
meat is an integral part of living well,

572
00:32:57,021 --> 00:33:01,520
eating meat every day shows that you
are middle class or upper upper class.

573
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,680
And so there's a cultural impact as well.
Um,

574
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,430
and I'm hopeful that we can change that.
You know,

575
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:08,900
if we can show that the United States,

576
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:11,060
the saying actually now plant
based protein is the way to go.

577
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:12,740
This is a really exciting
way of the future.

578
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,250
Then hopefully countries that are starting
to ramp up their meat production will

579
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:18,980
shift to plant based protein as well.
Um,

580
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,410
I also have some resources here
for you that we can pass out.

581
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:24,410
So this is the guide to cruelty for
eating. It's got some great recipes,

582
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:26,960
nutritional info, and then if we
have any athletes in the room,

583
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,100
this is a compassionate athlete.
So there's this idea that um,

584
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,010
eating vegges feminine or it's
hard to get enough protein,

585
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,920
but this is a David Carter.
They call them the 300 pound Vegan.

586
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:40,460
He was an NFL player, actually played
for the Raiders and he's totally Vegan.

587
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:42,470
So good info in there as well.
Again,

588
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:44,270
where the factory farming
awareness coalition,

589
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,130
this is our website and we give
presentations. This is really what we do.

590
00:33:48,131 --> 00:33:52,640
We're focused on grassroots education.
So if you know of any other, um, schools,

591
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:53,960
community groups,
businesses,

592
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:56,780
faith communities that might be interested
in learning more about this issue,

593
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,740
we're always happy to come out and
speak for free. All right. Thank you.

594
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,910
Thanks everybody for.
