Justice League. Liz, thank you for
joining us for having me. I'm so,

5
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:31,300
I had made a note to myself when I was
coming up with what to talk about before

6
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:34,600
we dive into everything. I'll just
ask, look, a nice opening question,

7
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,720
maybe something based on the news
of the day. And then I was like,

8
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:41,740
that's a terrible idea. That doesn't
sound like a pleasant way to, well,

9
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,710
the news of the day.
It's like the news of the moment.

10
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,080
So I don't know when this goes up.
Yeah.

11
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:51,660
I haven't looked at other things
that we'll be tackling. Matt.

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,500
Yeah. Basically just say garbage,
fire and Lavonne. Yeah. All right.

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,810
So with that out of the way,
garbage, fire, garbage partner now,

14
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,850
um, what is lady parts?
Justice League? Well, uh,

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,090
it is, we're a, we're a nonprofit,

16
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,050
but that is made up of Comedians,
writers,

17
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:16,300
graphic designers, shooters, editors,

18
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,330
and it's a bunch of people that decided
there's so much horrible news happening

19
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,840
in the landscape of
reproductive rights and justice.

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,920
And when you turn on your television or
you talk to other friends who care about

21
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:33,590
this, oftentimes they think they
know and they don't know, uh,

22
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,980
they know about one third of
what's actually happening.

23
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,290
And so we wanted to do two things.

24
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:43,291
We wanted to make videos that expose the
politicians and the laws and just the

25
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:47,800
Cretins in general who are assaulting
the access to reproductive healthcare.

26
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,530
And then the other cool thing we do,

27
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:54,130
which is sort of my favorite
thing that we do, is we are a Bam.

28
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:56,560
That is a combination of kind of like,

29
00:01:56,561 --> 00:02:01,090
let's call it a USO show
and habitats for humanity.

30
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:04,000
So actually today we are launching,

31
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,760
we're doing a 16 week tour that
we're just announcing today. Um,

32
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,810
we're going to eight for eight weeks.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,960
We're going to 16 cities starting June
2nd in the deep south and the Midwest.

34
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,800
We'll do it.

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,220
We'll do a comedy music show and then
we're going to do outreach to clinics.

36
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,670
We're going to like help build
fences, um, do gardening for them,

37
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,260
bring them like food,

38
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:27,220
take them up or drinks anything to sort
of normalize their work and to sort of

39
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:32,200
do a emotional reset on what it means
to be a provider. Because I think I had,

40
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,680
I started this,
um,

41
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,090
in 2012 I just did my own little comedy
tour of clinics and when I talked to

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,160
providers and maybe the
receptionist or even like a nurse,

43
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,120
they would say to me, thank you
for coming here. No one ever comes.

44
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,500
And that just struck a chord with
me so profoundly than I thought.

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,050
I don't really have to
adjust my life at all.

46
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm basically just still
doing shows making,

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,610
but I'm horning in on a subject that
I care deeply about that I feel like

48
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,390
doesn't get enough attention. So
that's what it is. It's what we do.

49
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,430
That's pretty awesome. Thanks. One of
the things you mentioned is gardening,

50
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,380
and I actually hadn't
heard about this before.

51
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,880
Can you talk a little bit about like,

52
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,210
we know what a fence at an
abortion clinic would help. Do you,

53
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:22,830
can you talk about your daughter when a
garden at an abortion clinic does? Well,

54
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,900
let me tell you, because it does
many things and it's more than that.

55
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,060
I don't bury the fetuses.

56
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,070
They are contrary to the news from
Breitbart and alternative facts.

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,550
Um,
so a lot of times when we,

58
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,340
cause we contact the clinics in advance
to see what they need and they always

59
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:43,840
say things like, it's like an orphanage.
Sometimes it's like just, you know,

60
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,980
if you had cupcakes or if he
could just come by, you know,
it's like, no, seriously.

61
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,610
So we bring cupcakes or lunch and then
we sort of assessed what's happening.

62
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:56,370
And so a good example of what we do
is we went to North Carolina, um,

63
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,150
because there's an organization that was
called 40 days for life that was trying

64
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:03,730
to plan a sneak attack on this clinic.
Well,

65
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,150
we do some infiltrating of websites
and places and found out about this.

66
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,460
So we decided to go down there and
preempt this massive bus that came.

67
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,740
And so protestors,

68
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:19,270
oftentimes we'll stand on
property anywhere they can
and the clinic doesn't even

69
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,340
see like a whole that could be filled.

70
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:25,150
So we looked at where the protestors
were standing and realize, you know,

71
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:30,151
if we just planted a gigantic Holly Bush
and if you know anything about Holly,

72
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:32,680
it's really prickly that's tall enough,

73
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,300
that is just one space that a protest or
can't stand and scream into the clinic.

74
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,570
So we do that. Um, sometimes
it's like when you build a fence,

75
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,100
you just have to do some
gardening around it.

76
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:45,970
So it can be strategic planting
or it can be, you know what,

77
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:47,470
this is a place people go to the doctor.

78
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,540
It should look nice and
it should feel normal.

79
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,100
And so our big thing is to bust
stigma. You know, get rid of the shame.

80
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,610
Let doctors feel like they can live
in the light and have had to have the,

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,890
have the staff and people and p patients
that go feel like they're doing what

82
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:03,461
they are doing,

83
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:08,461
which is accessing one of a panoply of
medical services that somebody might need

84
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:13,330
in their lifetime. So making it
normal, making abortion. Great.

85
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:18,160
Again. What we do. Um,

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,970
let's, I'd love to back up and
just look at how you got here.

87
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,670
So we back all the way up.
Um,

88
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,220
it's my understanding that you grew
up in a Catholic home in the Midwest,

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,090
so everyone super psyched
about my choices in life. Yeah.

90
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,030
So I did you,

91
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,550
was there some like
grand feminist awakening?

92
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,680
There was a couple grand
feminist awakening.

93
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:43,681
One was that much to the luck of me,

94
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,660
I'm the youngest of five kids and my
family and my parents are Super Catholic.

95
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:49,010
Like not like this Pope Catholic like,

96
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,950
cause a couple pumps that go
catholic will popsicle Catholic.

97
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,860
This poll is sort of awesome,
right? I mean, he's kind of like,

98
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,960
I look at this pope and I
think he's kind of like, uh,

99
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,220
a guy who was in a crappy band,

100
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:08,210
but when I was having an amazing
solo career, so it's like,

101
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,930
and then when they play the old hits,
you're like, shut up with the old days.

102
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,550
It's ain't nobody got time for
your old heads. Um, so it was, uh,

103
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,960
it was one of those things where
there was a couple things. One,

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,130
I had never been in,

105
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:22,460
this is going to just sound horrible
in the context of what we talked about

106
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:26,450
already. I was never driven to have kids.
It's just never been my thing. Right.

107
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,920
And so even as a little kid,
like I am the person that loved Barbie.

108
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,440
And so it because Barbie had a boyfriend
and she had her own house and a car and

109
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:38,930
like I didn't care what the boobs
or even that she couldn't stand.

110
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,470
The fact of the matter is, she was
like independent, put her in the car.

111
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,980
There she goes, you know. So I
really liked that in a doll. And I,

112
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,850
and even my mom said, you know, you
never play with the things I give you.

113
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:50,901
And it was like,

114
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:54,890
well you gave me like a baby doll and
then you gave me an iron and then you gave

115
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,350
me an ironing board and
then he gave me a stove.

116
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,740
And it's like basically everything that
you saw at night over you gave to me as

117
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,180
like a toy. It's like, where's the
inflatable drunk? Have a husband toy cars,

118
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:07,760
why don't we just round
this whole life out? Um,

119
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,960
and so I needed to make money as a kid,
you know,

120
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,930
for candy and lip gloss or whatever we
were raising money for at that time.

121
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,490
And I saw all the boys being
ultra boys, right. And I was like,

122
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:20,600
well that's a way to make money.

123
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,410
They were like raking it in serving
at weddings and funerals, you know,

124
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:28,340
apparently you didn't get paid for
like the, the Sunday mass thing.

125
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,780
So when I went to the priest and I said,
I want to be an ultra boy,

126
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,330
the priest freaked out and said,
pulled out of his ass. Literally.

127
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:40,370
He goes, well, you can't
because, and I could see,

128
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:42,830
you know how adults going like this when
they're like done having to say like,

129
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:47,000
it was like doing that. And he was like,
well, you know, it's called alter boy.

130
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,220
So obviously I was like, well,
and I wasn't trying to be a jerk.

131
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,610
I was just trying to get to
make money at the weddings.

132
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,340
That's what I wanted to do.
So I said, well, you know,

133
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:02,300
you could call me an altar girl.
And then he was like, well, uh,

134
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,060
you know, you should, you should write the
archbishop just passing the buck. Right?

135
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,900
So I got a petition and
I wrote the archbishop.

136
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,890
And like not long after I wrote
the Archbishop, unfortunately, uh,

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,730
during length,

138
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,830
archbishop had too much to drink and
deploy out into the wall of a seven 11.

139
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,330
So the archbishop had his own problems
to deal with and wasn't concerned about

140
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,420
letting me be an ultra by.
But at that point I just was like,

141
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,520
I had this little case of like,
I don't get it.

142
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,450
I don't get why I'm a girl and I
can't be an altar boy. This is dumb.

143
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,750
And so there was just instances in,

144
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,050
in life in general where if there was
a clear explanation like don't climb a

145
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:47,780
tree barefoot cause that's
gonna cut your feet.

146
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,730
I'm like oh that seems like
good advice from an adult.

147
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,700
But if there was no real explanation,
I was just mad.

148
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,510
And because I was a curious kid and so
there was just a series of that shit that

149
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,690
started happening. And then
somebody said, you know,

150
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,420
I haven't got cynical and then
I would be a little snarky.

151
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,920
And then somebody said
he should try stand up.

152
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:07,320
When I was in college and I thought,

153
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,800
and this was a part that really got me
and I looked at the landscape of standups

154
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,960
and two,
there was women doing it.

155
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,810
There was like Joan Rivers and
there was like Phyllis Diller.

156
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,130
But I didn't see myself. I was
like a punk rock, 23 year old kid.

157
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:24,450
And I didn't see, I didn't see my
world coming out of anybody's mouths.

158
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,340
And then I saw George Carlin.

159
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,550
And so it took a dude to convince
me that I could do stand up,

160
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,660
which was a problem,
like the bag that I did not see myself.

161
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,110
And now it's so cool to see all of
these really amazing women doing it.

162
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,540
But yeah, so I started out, you know,
just doing it and I would do like,

163
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,560
I wasn't particularly political at the
time, you know, I would have jokes like,

164
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,600
um, if you ever play monopoly with
bald guys, they always pick the hat,

165
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,310
you know, stupid that took,

166
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,950
doesn't even deserve that much laughter.
But I'm not even kidding.

167
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:07,310
That was really nice of you to do that.
You know,

168
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:11,930
I saw and then I would talk about gender
and equity or you know, dating. But um,

169
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,530
he really wasn't, if I cared about
politics, I was very, I like,

170
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:19,520
I read about it and I knew about it,
but I didn't put, bring into stage. Um,

171
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:25,030
and then I guess if there
was like true comedy,

172
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,330
how did it change everything? It would
have to be, oh my God, I can swear here.

173
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,110
Right. And stuff. You have been, oh, I,
I should have asked my 10 minutes ago.

174
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,453
Um,

175
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:42,330
I had moved to New York in 1991 and
somebody sent me up on a blind date.

176
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,920
Um, do you remember those? There was,

177
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,670
it happened like they don't exist now
cause you just hook up with people you

178
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:53,650
regret later on your phone. Um, but
there was a thing and it was like,

179
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:57,040
it never was, I've got a person
for you. Actually you don't.

180
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,210
But I would go cause I'm from the
Midwest and when someone says, you know,

181
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,680
I have a person very, you're like, all
right, well that's nice. I'll go to that.

182
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,040
Cause you mean,
right.

183
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,170
So the guy shows up at my house and,

184
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,760
and you know, like what's
the plan? I'm like,

185
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:16,250
well maybe do you want
to go see La Dolce Vita?

186
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:20,110
I've never seen it on a big screen.
And he looks at me and he's like,

187
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:24,370
it was the Lou in black and
white, you know, like, oh man.

188
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,210
And if that wasn't bad enough,

189
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,420
he is wearing a Yankees hat
and a Yankee satin jacket.

190
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,660
And I have a theory about guys that were
more than one piece of sports clothing

191
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:43,210
at the same time. And that is
that they won't go down on you.

192
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,360
I believe this is a proven thing.

193
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,210
So I'm like,
this is like a double whammy of,

194
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:58,120
but I'm going to do it cause I'm
from the Midwest and I'm nice.

195
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,910
So we go to the movie and then the guy,
this is going somewhere, people the story,

196
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,700
I swear to God and I feel
like she is probably not. Um,

197
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,860
and the guy keeps falling asleep and
then the rubbing his satin jacket up and

198
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,060
down my arm and I'm just like eating my
popcorn and like getting more and more

199
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:18,430
rageful to the point where I was like,

200
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,040
like fighting internally. My like I'm
real nice and I fucking hate this guy.

201
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,450
So finally I just took my greasy hands
and I just like purposely hit his jacket

202
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,480
to wake him up.
And then I felt horribly.

203
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,200
I just felt horrible that I actually
wrecked his jacket on purpose. And then,

204
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,110
so I had to make up for it by saying,
wake up, let's go have a drink,

205
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:42,700
continuing this new.

206
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,640
So we go to a bar that he knew about
because he watched sports there.

207
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,510
Um,

208
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,200
but on this night there was no sports
on because it was the night of the first

209
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:57,910
Gulf War and if you'll remember you
won't cause you probably weren't born.

210
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,080
But um,

211
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,150
it was the first time that
America watched a war,

212
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,180
like unfold in their living rooms live
and they had replaced like the regular

213
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:14,440
anchors on CNN with like handsome people.

214
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:18,180
And there was that green light
and people were very long ball.

215
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,240
I'm Dirk sturdy on the roof and the bombs.
And it was like,

216
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,380
I just watched it and I wasn't
trying to wax philosophical.

217
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:30,280
I was just taking it in thinking are
they reporting on a war or trying to sell

218
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,114
me a war?

219
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,700
And about two minutes later the date
was like, this is really awesome.

220
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,580
And I was like,
this is a fucking problem.

221
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,920
And so I just sort of started from that
moment on like paying more attention to

222
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:51,190
the media, seeing the information
that like I was getting,

223
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,670
seeing what kind of like are they just
reporting the press releases from the

224
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,500
White House? Like what can I talk
about? What can I not, you know?

225
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,510
And so my comedy acts or to changing
dramatically. Talking a lot about, um,

226
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:06,310
not only America's role in the world,
politics in general,

227
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:09,640
but also the media's role
in how all that played out.

228
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:14,110
And when I realized as we started getting
ourselves into these big manipulative

229
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:19,050
wars that the media was as complicit
as any, I mean literally when,

230
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,080
when your network is reporting on
the news and doing reports about the

231
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:26,980
negotiations of whether or
not we're going to go to war.

232
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,630
And then when they go to commercial,

233
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,040
there's a giant graphic that says
countdown to the war. You're like, um,

234
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,770
I'm going to go shit. Or do you
know something? I don't know.

235
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:38,350
Because you are literally have a theme
song and a graphic that says we're

236
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:40,270
counting down to the war,
not work.

237
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:42,250
Negotiating to see if
we're going to go to war.

238
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,830
So I did a couple of one
woman shows and then, um,

239
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,770
I was like trying to figure out what
I was going to do next and will,

240
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,830
I worked on Jon Stewart's first talk
show as a producer and when that got

241
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,060
canceled,
um,

242
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,110
a small group of that team was asked
by our executives who had moved over to

243
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:08,090
comedy central if we wanted to launch
a show that responded to the world.

244
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,670
And I was like, oh my
God, are you kidding me?

245
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,700
I am like a person who can barely type
and I've never run any show and all I do

246
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:19,430
is spout off my mouth. But
yes, it's kind of my dream.

247
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,460
And so the daily show was born,
um,

248
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,270
and created by a whole bunch of
people who had a lot of passion for,

249
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,853
um,

250
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,840
exposing hypocrisy and being
funny and well, you know,

251
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,910
fair. It is. I'm here for
20 years. It did good.

252
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,023
Yeah.

253
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,080
Um,
some of the,

254
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:47,530
I'm curious about in your
work before the daily show,

255
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:51,640
the daily show and after it's,
you know, you said that they,

256
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:56,641
they wanted you guys to create a
show that was responding to the news,

257
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:01,690
the news. Yeah. And so you use comedy
to talk about politics and world events,

258
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,880
but in the daily show,
in your other work,

259
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,870
it's also using politics and world
events as the fodder for comedy.

260
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,870
Yeah. And also as a potter for
the media, you know, I can,

261
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,760
it can't be stressed enough how much the
media has played a role through all of

262
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:19,810
this. You know, how much cable news
and as it bloated out more, um,

263
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,830
has been complicit in
all of it. So yes. Um,

264
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,690
I think the problem that I faced is, you
know, after we launched the daily show,

265
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,913
um,

266
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,450
and then I left and I went on
to do some other smaller shows.

267
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:38,560
I did one on oxygen that was like
actually a really funny show that was six

268
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:43,550
episodes. That was like the daily
show meets cold bear mates. Um, Kathy,

269
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,770
Liam, who, whatever those women are living
here. It was like that kind of format.

270
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,880
Um, and then we launched Air
America radio. Yeah. And, um,

271
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,390
and even that,
as,

272
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,170
as I'm out there as it was,

273
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:01,420
or as much freedom as we had,
should I say,

274
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,860
it was still a part of an entity
that was a corporate entity. And,

275
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,880
and the bottom line is, and all of these
projects, I say this a lot, but it's true.

276
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,180
I felt a lot like an anger fluffer.

277
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,370
Like I've just got people riled up,

278
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,790
but it wasn't my job to have a call to
action so that can be funny and give

279
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,380
people information and they're like,
what do I do? Not? And I'm like, no,

280
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,080
I'm just a comedian.
I'm just the writer.

281
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,340
I wanted to be able to give people
a place to channel the energy.

282
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,200
And so that's why,
um,

283
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,030
I wrote a book and then
after I wrote the book, um,

284
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,090
I decided that I really wanted to take
all of the things I care about, comedy,

285
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,500
social justice,

286
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,280
making a difference through comedy and
actually then hitting the ground and

287
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:44,560
doing tangible work.
Um,

288
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,850
and the only way to do
that was to start a thing.

289
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,700
That's how I started this thing.

290
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,110
And so that brings us to this, this
thing is perfect thing here. Yeah.

291
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,390
Cause something I wonder about with the,
the lack of call to actions is, you know,

292
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,780
you'll see on Twitter and social media
nowadays, like people saying like,

293
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,290
look at this, this is happening. This
is not normal. Don't be complacent.

294
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:10,160
And I'm like, I'm not, what do
I, what do I do? So what sort of,

295
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:15,140
how are you moving from just raising
people's awareness of what's going on to

296
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:20,141
actually giving them tools or helping
them figure out what they can do?

297
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:20,751
Well,

298
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:25,751
I think one of the things that's
important for me is a figuring out how,

299
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,130
when, when you sign up to
volunteer for us, for example, uh,

300
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,210
we ask you how much time you have
to give, what your skill set is. Um,

301
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,500
and then we can make that work. Also.
Like for example, in the women's March,

302
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,420
it's, we had, we had an activist fair
that we sponsored where we had 15 tables.

303
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,740
It was right off the march path.
At a hotel called the UN hotel.

304
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:52,450
We did it here in New York cause I
thought like, I don't want to go to DC.

305
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,820
I want to stay here because a lot of
the policies that people are going to be

306
00:18:55,821 --> 00:18:59,750
affected by those people live here. You
know, we have strong immigrant population,

307
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,070
strong undocumented population,
women, you know, all of it. Um,

308
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:07,490
and so we had 15 different
organizations representing 15 different,

309
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,880
um,
ways that you could participate,

310
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:14,570
whether it was environmental and racial
justice, you know, whatever it was. Um,

311
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,340
and sort of our rule was your group has
to be able to let people like get in

312
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:22,790
there and do some work, you know, not
just sign up and not just give us money.

313
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,500
Like, because I think that's important.
And so what we, what we do is,

314
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,260
for example,
if you wanted to volunteer with us,

315
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,700
there's a myriad of things you
could do. You can, um, we signed,

316
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,670
we send postcards to clinics,
um, throughout the year.

317
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:38,840
And then we have four times a year.

318
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:43,190
We have orchestrated postcode programs
where I'm sending them love really makes

319
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:46,250
all the difference in the world. So, you
know, that's a simple thing we can do.

320
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,670
We help legislative do like everybody else
does where you can sign this petition.

321
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,390
Um, for example, a, this is crazy.

322
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,700
So we've worked with a clinic in Ohio.

323
00:19:55,701 --> 00:20:00,470
We went to Ohio to help out during
the Republican convention because um,

324
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,700
part of the activities for the RNC was to
go protest to clinic. They had, I mean,

325
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,990
insane. So this clinic that we
have befriended and now work with,

326
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,330
someone stole their fence.

327
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,340
A psychotic person had been like chipping
away at the fence and just stole their

328
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:20,980
fence. They came to work in their
fence was gone. So we were able to, um,

329
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,380
do a Facebook live event
where we went on and we said,

330
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,490
this clinic had their fence stolen.
They need $10,000 to do it.

331
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,180
Here's the origin story. We put the
origin story out, we tell the thing,

332
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,100
and the clinics said, you guys just
raised us to mine offense in five hours.

333
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,270
So, um, we're, when we pay attention to
the needs of each of these places, uh,

334
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,610
we can specifically tailor, uh,
if, if we need graphic design work,

335
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:49,750
if a clinic graphic design work
for something they're doing. Um,

336
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,530
if you want to help us with meals, I
mean, this tour that we're going on,

337
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,390
we're launching this tour today,
you know,

338
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,630
it's like weird launching a fundraiser
with it because we need a van.

339
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,870
We're taking 11 bodies to go and grow
community in 16 different cities where our

340
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:10,381
clinic is desperately needing support
that will last long after we show up.

341
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:12,130
So,
um,

342
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,250
one of the things that's really kind of
cool is we created a system where we'll

343
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:19,030
do a comedy music shown a town.

344
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,900
We have a talk back with the provider
and maybe somebody who runs an escort

345
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:26,530
program or somebody who runs that
abortion fund in that state. Um,

346
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,790
after they laugh and hear music,
they'll hear a Q and a that's like this.

347
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,140
They'll be the last questions and they
can sign up to help the clinic out.

348
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:39,550
So does that mean you bring
cupcakes four times a year?

349
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:42,910
Does that mean you help them with hot
breakfast on the Saturday morning when

350
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:46,210
there's a lot of clinics, does that
mean you sign up to escort yourself?

351
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,450
Does that mean that you get together
and then you can reach out to us?

352
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,960
Um, and say we're trying to figure out
a creative action. Can you help us?

353
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,040
And we're like, sure. You know,

354
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,330
we've helped people with like every
other hospital gowns and go sit here and

355
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:04,090
state legislatures office and just wait
for your pap smear and then just sit

356
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,980
there and wait and when they come out
and see what he's doing and we're like,

357
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:09,310
well we're her for pap smears since
you absolutely know how my body works,

358
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,980
I'd like you to actually give
me a pap smear. Um, and so,

359
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:15,251
you know,

360
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:20,251
helping people get creative with
their local actions is really great.

361
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,880
And so we are constantly
looking for, um, you know,

362
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,790
people who can fill our
creative pots so that, you know,

363
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,340
cause a lot of plates
are spinning at once.

364
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:32,350
So if we're trying to help out Indiana,
somebody says I'm creative and like,

365
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,790
great, there's a thing in Ohio, you know,

366
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,420
you can really help us do this
thing or whatever it is. So yeah.

367
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,480
Yeah. The, the specificity in the
concrete action there is amazing.

368
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,400
Before I move on to my next question,

369
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:46,950
we're going to be opening it up
for audience questions in a minute.

370
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:48,480
So if you want to ask a question,

371
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,220
just go line up behind one
of those microphones so
that we know that you have a

372
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:57,510
question. We'll get to that in
one second. Um, but, but first,

373
00:22:57,511 --> 00:23:02,430
in addition to these very specific
local on the ground efforts,

374
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,660
you're also doing a lot online
through social media, through video.

375
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:08,420
Can you talk a little bit about that?
Yeah.

376
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,670
And maybe we should show one of our
videos. So what a fantastic segue.

377
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,640
What a fantastic segway. So we, um,

378
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,530
one of the greatest joys is
to dispel myths in a way that

379
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,720
people really latch onto.

380
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,750
One of the greatest myths in
reproductive health care is that plan B,

381
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,630
an Iud or abortions.

382
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,250
There was a supreme court case called
Hobby Lobby where this Christian Craft

383
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:36,500
store, I don't even know
what that means. Um,

384
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,410
decided that um,

385
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,470
they didn't want to disperse birth
control if the birth control was promoting

386
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:48,890
abortion and they listed plan beyond
their list and it's like plan B does not

387
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:51,680
only does not perform or
more promote abortion,

388
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:57,010
it stops an egg from actually leaving
the egg holder scientific term,

389
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,460
um,
in the first place.

390
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,350
So in order to like lay the shit down ones
all, we were like, let's make a video.

391
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:09,380
So we decided to make a cartoon and we
got led to Loria from orange is the new

392
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:14,150
black to be the voice of Plan
B and we'll just roll the,

393
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,970
we'll roll the video,
you'll learn a little something.

394
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,090
Sorry man. I have to get another
cashier to sell you plan B.

395
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,550
Why? Because Plan B causes abortion and
I don't have to sell it to you because of

396
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,520
abortion goes against my
religious beliefs. Wait,

397
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,520
it's not an abortion and double wait.
A cashier can demand the birthday.

398
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,030
You are correct ma'am. That is
actually the law and I don't like it.

399
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,130
Listen Up,
Mr. Cashier,

400
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,070
just out of birth control pill,

401
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,990
no matter what they say on Capitol Hill,
well his wrong,

402
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:13,540
wrong stowaway then
strong,

403
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,250
strong lot do is blog where
I can see which day Liz,

404
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,530
what scientists say.
So at the end of the day you can chew,

405
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,680
drop some fans,

406
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,690
tale world hobble feel dosh
pill preventing unwanted
pregnancy seems so helpful.

407
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,590
How'd you get so many family?

408
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,000
Well a lot of folks like this fella got
together and decided that I caused some

409
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,470
portions but I don't.
I stopped population for happening.

410
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,150
Preventing verbalization
and pregnancy are nice.

411
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:49,750
Egg isn't a pregnancy APP
or an egg is fertilize.

412
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:54,510
It takes 72 whole hours for the egg to
make its way to the uterus and Plensa.

413
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,790
That is a pregnancy.

414
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,400
My job is to stop the aid for
ever traveling to below via town,

415
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,600
preventing that pregnancy.

416
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,340
So life doesn't begin at conception

417
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,000
when life begins.

418
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,680
Is it opinion when pregnancy
begins is a scientific back?

419
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,120
Are you getting it yet?

420
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,920
Well think of it like a football game.

421
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,600
The quarterback drops back and tosses
to the receiver at the 20 yard line,

422
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,240
happens a second to the receiver, catches
the ball. Now we all know the rules.

423
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,480
The fertilized eggs still needs to make
it an event before it's a touchdown

424
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,420
bought. If there is no ball
to catch, there can never be,

425
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,480
say, say pregnancy doesn't
happen until their touchdown.

426
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,170
So my job is the block back
such down rope happening.

427
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,700
Wow.

428
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,260
When be you're like the Deion
Sanders isn't preventing pregnancy.

429
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,470
Actually Deion Sanders wishes
he was the plan via football.

430
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,710
Well,
I hope that cleared things up,

431
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,470
but just in case it fits the bill.

432
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:17,020
A helpful birth control pill no matter
what their sale. Gamble a little hill.

433
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,000
So now you know my truth.
I'm all about prevention.

434
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:26,330
If you condoms break
Johnny,

435
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,240
take a stand a day.

436
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,970
Hope that you will drop
some fans the world bill.

437
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,730
Wow.
Science is fun.

438
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,640
You prevent more abortions
than anyone I know.

439
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,470
I'd be happy to sell you to customers.
That's right.

440
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,380
Prevention's My jab by now.

441
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,070
Wait pill I ever seen again.

442
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,160
Well let me put it to you this way,
kid.

443
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:57,280
I'm always here if you need
me and I'm really safe.

444
00:27:57,281 --> 00:28:01,930
So you don't even need a prescription,
even if you're a teenager. Yes.

445
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,830
Even if you're a teenager.
Oh, and just one more thing.

446
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,030
I know I'm awesome,
but please always use a condom.

447
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,750
Join me and take the stand

448
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,870
PJ on shuts down the big bats around
birth control and abortion every damn day.

449
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,240
Join us and not spread the truth.

450
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,960
Did you learn something?

451
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,500
It was really important
for us to make that video,

452
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,860
especially with Neil Gorsuch
who is as you know, um, uh,

453
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,740
in line to possibly be the next Supreme
Court justice and he's somebody who

454
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:55,600
ruled in the lower court, um, for hobby
lobby agreeing with the fake science that,

455
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,470
you know, so we put it out and it's
also for me really important, um,

456
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,160
the line about teenagers,
you know,

457
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:06,520
it's good to make videos sometimes that
kids can pass around to their friends

458
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:09,760
and they can know that I can
go get that if I'm a teen and,

459
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,010
and my condom broke that I, I
can, I can go test that out.

460
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:16,840
Cause I think a lot of times
we don't let our teens,

461
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:20,620
we deny sexuality of teens and
especially teen girls so much.

462
00:29:20,621 --> 00:29:22,960
And I think it's important to um,

463
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,800
be living in the world where there's
not abstinence and Unicorns in the one

464
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:30,250
where there's actually sex and
sometimes um, unintended pregnancy.

465
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,660
And so let's like be real and
help people out. So yeah. Yeah.

466
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,960
And I think one of the,

467
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,560
the great things about that video is
the football shooting as from the penis.

468
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,730
Really good.
One of the other great things in addition,

469
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:46,570
because there are many bids,

470
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:50,140
but that's actually my point that like
it has that information for teens where

471
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:52,510
it's like, hey teens, you can
go get this over the counter.

472
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,750
And it also has information for people
who are already thinking and arguing

473
00:29:58,901 --> 00:29:59,351
about this.

474
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:03,010
Like the something I haven't heard before
is the distinction between when does

475
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:07,990
life begin versus pregnancy
begin because anyone can say,

476
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:10,420
well, I think life starts here.
I think it starts there, right?

477
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,840
That's life. Is that a person? You know
what I mean? Like when, when life begins,

478
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:20,020
literally is this subjective
and life begins at conception.

479
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,200
That is not a scientific term. It's a Ma.
I mean that is, that's a religious term.

480
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,670
No fertilization is conception. And
so it still needs that, you know,

481
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,390
and as we show this video, if you
just figured that out now don't worry.

482
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,990
Most people are like, I had no idea. It's
like, it's okay. A lot of people didn't.

483
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,980
In fact we thought plan B stopped
an implantation from happening,

484
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:43,460
but it turns out that's not what it does.
So there's like misnomers around that,

485
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,631
um,
as well.

486
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:47,900
So we wanted to make sure that people
knew that it stops the egg from actually

487
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:50,750
leaving the Fallopian tube
in the first place. So, um,

488
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,360
it was approved because they thought
it might have stopped implantation.

489
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,090
And here's what's crazy. The website of
Plan B's says that and it's not right.

490
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,240
So we consulted with a team of physicians
to actually make sure it was right.

491
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:06,920
So I'm like, so the
football thing, is it cool?

492
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:09,560
It's like it gets shot out of the thing
and they're like, yeah, it's fine.

493
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,690
So it was having them write,
help us write it into plain,

494
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,310
into medical texts and then having
us translated into Fallopian tonal,

495
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,190
southern ship. Um, it was kinda fun.
Yeah. Well, cause in a lot of them

496
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,650
ways,

497
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:27,250
the antiabortion movement
has really controlled the
rhetoric of how we talk, talk

498
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,900
about 310% and that can
be incredibly damaging,

499
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,180
incredibly shaming.
And you know,

500
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:39,130
it's like things that are
very good friends we'll say
are sometimes like I'm in

501
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:42,160
the larger scale. It can make
people wonder when they say like,

502
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:45,520
well no one's for abortion. You know what,
except for people who need an abortion,

503
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,050
you know, like I say, often there aren't
a good abortions thrown about abortion.

504
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:51,550
So it's just the abortion that you need.

505
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,150
And I think that we need to bear that
in mind as somebody who's going through

506
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,870
that choice to, to, uh, to
terminate a pregnancy that, um,

507
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,840
lobbing judgment or saying things like,
um,

508
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,790
that I'm pro choice. I'm not pro
abortion. Um, well, you know,

509
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,630
why is it that you say that?
Um,

510
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,840
by saying that it sounds like abortion
is a dirty thing that has to happen when

511
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,270
if one in three women statistically will
have an abortion in her reproductive

512
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,104
lifetime.

513
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,820
It sounds to me like that's a piece of
medical care that a lot of people are

514
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:29,680
going to meet. And so for us to put
a caveat or a shaming space on that,

515
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,730
um,

516
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,710
based on the assault of
disinformation medically,

517
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,250
um, we need to examine that
as people are advocates for,

518
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,720
um,
you know,

519
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,560
full autonomy and if you believe that
women's rights are human rights, um,

520
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,670
one of the first rights that we should
all be defending is how and if and when,

521
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,890
um, you want to have kids and make sure
you have full autonomy over your body.

522
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,623
I believe

523
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,470
I just entirely lost my train of thought
because you're thinking about that

524
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:10,310
penis shooting off that football and
very distracting. I know. That's true.

525
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,253
Um,

526
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,310
one,
one question.

527
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,880
What's something that's been in the news
lately among all the many garbage fires?

528
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,190
Yeah. And especially in the aftermath of
the election is the question of whether

529
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,720
abortion rights and reproductive
freedom should be, um,

530
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,520
a non negotiable issue
in the Democratic Party.

531
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,480
The left if it's, if you can be, you know,

532
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,990
on the left and not

533
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,040
pro choice. I, I mean I'm going to
ask what are your thoughts on that?

534
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,790
I think I know what your thoughts,
I'd love to hear you talking about

535
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,120
wrote a massive piece. There was an
article in the New York Times, um,

536
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,213
uh,

537
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,760
that just was in the New York Times
where a woman wrote that there was Ailey,

538
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,490
it was alienating in the women's movement.

539
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,270
If you are not an
abortion rights advocate.

540
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,740
And what I say to that is
simple, uh, you can totally be,

541
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,100
uh, somebody who has personal
feelings about abortion.

542
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:17,230
The bottom line is we live in a secular
society where abortion is safer than

543
00:34:17,231 --> 00:34:18,130
having your teeth pulled.

544
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,520
And if you are going to advocate against
a procedure that is going to literally

545
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:27,040
clear a path for someone to
pursue their own destiny, the no,

546
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,640
that is problematic for me. And that is
problematic for a movement as a whole.

547
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:35,470
If you say you are a woman's right
advocate or personal, the uterus advocate,

548
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,860
that means that you have to actually
put your feelings aside because your

549
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:43,180
feelings are your personal feelings.

550
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:47,260
And when you search your
soul nor searching your
soul for yourself, I do not.

551
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:51,100
You need you to search your soul and
tell me you've come up with a solution

552
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:54,070
medically for what I need to do.
That is wrong.

553
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:56,590
And that is not being a feminist and
that's not part of the feminist moment.

554
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,560
This shouldn't be. Yeah. So
that's how I feel about. Do you,

555
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,620
do you think that you're
right in the comments now,

556
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,070
do you think that um,

557
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,550
opposition to abortion primarily comes
from a religious place or is there

558
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:15,380
something else cultural or psychological
because people will give politicians

559
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:19,400
and people who were antiabortion we'll
give lots of reasons. It's usually

560
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,800
religious, I think. Well,

561
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:25,850
I think when you hear things like
life begins at conception, um, again,

562
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:29,690
that's a religious thing. Yeah. I mean,
almost all the time it's religious.

563
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:30,920
And the thing that is,

564
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,040
is it goes back to what you said
of the people who are antiabortion,

565
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:42,180
who has driven the narrative
to places where, um,

566
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,300
we just let things go.
Junk science,

567
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,370
there's like abortion causes breast
cancer proven it doesn't by every medical

568
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:55,080
establishment that you can find that
it causes, um, mental illness, again,

569
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,170
not proven in any way, shape
or form. Um, sterility,

570
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,790
no people have multiple abortions,
therefore not true. So, um,

571
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,950
those things just lay there.
And on top of that,

572
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:09,000
we have states where Indiana prime
example, when Mike Pence was governor,

573
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,060
he defunded planned
parenthood on a state level.

574
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,470
Those planned parenthood's went under.

575
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:17,010
He gave that $4 million every year that
went to planned parenthood to something

576
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:19,740
called crisis pregnancy centers.
If you're not aware of what they are,

577
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:24,740
they're unregulated clinics opened
up by religious people who um,

578
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,490
anybody can wander in as somebody dressed
up in a lab coat who could probably

579
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:32,760
just work at the Macy's,
Lancome counter to, um,

580
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:39,060
gives people this information,
we'll give them an ultrasound that is,

581
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:42,930
um, they might fudge how long, how far
along they are. They may say, yeah,

582
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:46,200
we'll help you with diapers and cribs.
Just keep coming back.

583
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,110
And then when they're
past the age of being, uh,

584
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:52,590
the gestational age to have an abortion,
all of a sudden they disappear.

585
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,090
They won't give the person anything.
They're horrible. And so in the,

586
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:01,990
in the course of funding
those unregulated centers, um,

587
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,150
people are being denied care.
And also in the case of Indiana,

588
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,210
they had this outbreak of HIV,

589
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,270
87 cases of HIV in this county in Indiana.

590
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,830
And the planned parenthood clinic used
to be somebody that would treat sanction

591
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,620
sexually transmitted diseases,
how I'm help people with HIV.

592
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,970
And there was no planned parenthood.

593
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:25,800
So they actually had to do pop up clinics
when they had a system in place just

594
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:30,660
because of this. So, um, I think that
those things are, for the most part,

595
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:34,260
we see it's a religious
argument because the medical,

596
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,500
every single piece of medicine around
the issue of abortion bears out to it

597
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:41,100
being one of the safest things,

598
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:45,870
one of the [inaudible] not preventing
you from choosing to have a family in the

599
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,780
future.
So when they start placing these caveats,

600
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,140
especially when it's waiting
periods and things like that,

601
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,160
and they say it's all for the woman's,
um, you know, just to make sure, um,

602
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,710
when you start laying things down,
like we need women to wait, um,

603
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,380
because we're not sure she's
made the right decision.

604
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,770
When that becomes part of the norm in
our society that w if anybody's ever had

605
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:14,370
the fear of being pregnant and didn't
want to be, or actually ha has been,

606
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,910
you know, from the second you
might think that you're pregnant,

607
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,890
you're thinking about it constantly.

608
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:25,250
Everything about what that pregnancy
means to your life is thought through over

609
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,880
and over again.

610
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:32,030
So to require extra time is society saying
we're not really sure we trust women

611
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:39,421
would make decisions and that goes
out of the abortion rema and goes into

612
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,460
spring, really trust women
to run our company. You know,

613
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,160
should we really trust women
to be president? You know,

614
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:51,700
I mean, so I think those things
are really telling and um,

615
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,260
things that we should fight against.

616
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:57,310
While they might seem like it's for the
women, it's not, it's for the control.

617
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,440
Yeah. Um, last call for
questions from the audience,

618
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,820
but in,

619
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,470
in lieu of that, something
I want to ask is, um,

620
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,220
on the lady parts Justice League website,

621
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:14,870
you have a video page with a video
for every state in the country.

622
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,520
A little and lady parts justice page.
Not The league page.

623
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:23,480
We have two organizations.
One is political, political,
political. Yeah. Gotcha. Um,

624
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,150
it's sort of like planned parenthood
and planned parenthood action. Yes.

625
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,070
One deals with healthcare outreach,
education,

626
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,540
still swearing and being fun.
That pill video was outreach education.

627
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,820
And then we have lady parts justice,
which is yes.

628
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,740
Has a video for every state and you
can go there and learn about the Po.

629
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,760
We call up politicians by nature. Oh okay.
So that different things. Political yes.

630
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:49,330
One, yes. Informational.
Educational. Yes. Yes.

631
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:52,720
So our big tour is through the
Lady Parts Justice League. Gotcha.

632
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,530
Cause we can hit the road, do outreach,
roll up her sleeves, do it. Yeah.

633
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,450
Go to the lay purchased league
website. Yes. Donate to the tour.

634
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:02,740
It's awesome.

635
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,430
Let's see where we are. Come
visit us. We're at 16 cities.

636
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:06,264
You probably live in one of them.

637
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,840
Something I wanted to ask for the people
in the audience here who are in New

638
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,540
York, we usually think of in New
York we've got things pretty good,

639
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,250
nice blue state.

640
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,850
But what the challenge both,

641
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,830
what should people be aware of here
in New York state? Funnily enough,

642
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,993
we have not yet

643
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,340
changed our abortion laws since 1970.

644
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,270
We have pre Roe v Wade abortion laws in
our state and while it feels like it's

645
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:36,250
blue and it's great here and in the
city, um, abortion access is pretty,

646
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:41,050
uh, accessible. Uh, if you
live in another place around,

647
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:42,370
if you live in rural New York,

648
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:47,490
it's really hard for you to access
any kind of care. Um, it's uh,

649
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,330
abortion laws were set in the criminal
code. So if, uh, if you have an a,

650
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,710
if you have a fetal anomaly
that oftentimes when you
hear about those big scary,

651
00:40:56,711 --> 00:41:00,520
they try to scare you with like, um, late
term abortion and why people have them.

652
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:05,521
And in 99% of those are because things
don't happen gestationally in pregnancy,

653
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:10,720
sometimes until the final
trimester of that pregnancy.

654
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,850
And so really horrible life
threatening to the woman.

655
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:17,710
The fetus won't live outside of the
womb. A lot of bad stuff happens. And so,

656
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,630
um, sometimes you won't even know
those things, right? In New York,

657
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:27,010
if you hit 24 weeks and discover that,
um,

658
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:32,530
the fetus will, could cause
you, death could die itself. Um,

659
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,800
you can't an abortion.

660
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,640
There is no life of the mother life of
the fetus exception. After 24 weeks,

661
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:40,040
you have to leave the state.
So yeah.

662
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,110
So that's like a lot of the talent that's
in place now and they're fighting for,

663
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:49,210
they're fighting to change that
law right now. Um, but we have, uh,

664
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,450
a kind of conservative, um, you know,
a lot of conservatives in Albany,

665
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,060
some of them are Democrats
who were anti choice. Um,

666
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:59,150
so they won't update
these simple, simple, um,

667
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,970
laws that could be fixed and,
you know,

668
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,540
add logical exceptions so
people don't die. Seems smarter,

669
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:09,020
just not dying,
not dying.

670
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:12,650
Seems like living seems like
a good alternative to not
dying. I don't know. Um,

671
00:42:12,651 --> 00:42:17,090
for that part. Yeah. Yeah.
All right. Well, Liz,

672
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,410
thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.
It was really great. Thanks for having me.

673
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:21,980
Thank you.
