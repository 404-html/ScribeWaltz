1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,490
So I'm really excited to
have Lauren leadership,

2
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:15,750
a and Alicia Reiner here to talk to us
today about diversity and diversity in

3
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:20,400
all aspects of media and industry.
And,

4
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:21,150
um,

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,740
this is exciting for me because Lauren
used to be my boss and my old job before

6
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,690
Google. I know we don't talk
about life before Google,

7
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:29,980
but I did have a job before that and um,

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,270
she was my boss and so it's super exciting
to have her here to talk about this

9
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:38,070
book. Um, which has been something that
has been in discussion for a while.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,150
Um, so with that I'm going to welcome
Lauren leadership. Ayub thank you.

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,690
Thank you.

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,440
Hi everyone.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,790
Thank you so much for being here and hi
to everyone and other Google authorize,

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,310
uh, outside of New York. I do really
appreciate that you're here and uh,

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,460
it feels like a particularly important
time to be having this conversation.

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:02,950
Um,

17
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,950
I started working on the book crossing
the finish line well over a year ago and

18
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:13,450
when I started writing I did have
some sense that with the election,

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,351
uh,

20
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:19,180
we might have a somewhat
contentious election cycle.

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,970
You could sort of sense that there
was a stop brewing in the contrary,

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,310
but I had no idea that we
would be where we are. Um,

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,740
I can't say that it's the happiest place.
Uh,

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,820
it's been incredibly painful to watch.

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,600
I think it's been incredibly painful
for a lot of Americans to watch in the

26
00:01:37,601 --> 00:01:41,950
middle of this whole cycle as
things were beginning to, uh,

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,480
ratchet up in terms of the noise in
the country, um, about the election.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,740
But then also,
uh,

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,280
the emergence of the black lives matter
movement over the last few years.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,640
The sort of continuing a intensity around
complex around race and gender and the

31
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:01,660
sort of breakdown in a way
or the national conversation,

32
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,830
I thought down to try to write a
blog about how we can do better.

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,930
And I will say that having a book like
that come out right now is actually

34
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,660
really challenging because it's
not what people want to talk about.

35
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,400
And when you turn on the news, and I'm
sure if you had any channel on last night,

36
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,350
uh, you saw the kind of, um,

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,120
intensity and conflict that is just
dominating every minute of the new cycle.

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,300
And there's been very little conversation
about the role that we all can play in

39
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:34,144
doing better.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,750
So I'm going to backup for a second and
just give you a little bit about me and

41
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:40,960
about why I wrote this book. Um,
because I do think it's important,

42
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,180
especially because I am the,
you know,

43
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,370
white privileged woman that I am standing
up here to talk to a very diverse set

44
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:51,610
of Google employees and out there in
the world and talking to a very diverse

45
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:53,980
country about this topic.
And so I do think,

46
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,040
and I felt in writing the book that I
needed to stay a little bit about who I am

47
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:01,540
and how I got here. Um, so I, up
in Washington DC and Washington DC,

48
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,410
uh, has always been and remains one of
the most diverse cities in the nation.

49
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:09,680
In the 1980s when I was growing up,
it was over 90% African American. Uh,

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,860
and my experience of that childhood was,
I'm realizing now,

51
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,861
and I've come to realize pretty unique
because most Americans don't grow up in

52
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:23,890
communities that are anywhere near as
diverse as the one that I grew up in now.

53
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,160
My immediate neighborhood, the
block where my house was, um,

54
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,660
we're actually almost entirely white.

55
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,050
And Washington is actually segregated
in these very strange ways.

56
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:35,530
It's segregated by race, but it's also
even segregated by political party.

57
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,990
We didn't have any Republicans on
our block. I mean, it was like,

58
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,260
it was like all peace corps x Peace Corps
volunteers, right? Like, so, you know,

59
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,120
not the most diverse neighborhood,

60
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,190
but the city itself is so diverse that
all my schools, we're incredibly diverse.

61
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:51,070
I always had 30 to 40% of my classmates,
you know,

62
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:52,870
from kindergarten all the
way through high school.

63
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,960
And I write a lot about high school
in the book where at least, you know,

64
00:03:55,961 --> 00:04:00,961
30 to 40% diverse in some way because
the city is also the home of all of the

65
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:02,710
embassies for the United States.

66
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,470
And so there are families from
every corner of the world. You know,

67
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:09,580
in kindergarten I probably had
nine different nationalities
represented and that

68
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,470
left a big impact on me.

69
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,950
And I also had a lot of African
American friends as a child.

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,930
The thing that I came to learn though,
and I really was, I think like many kids,

71
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,220
you know, not especially conscious of
the things that divided us as a child,

72
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,550
but I was very lucky
because two things happen.

73
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,440
One is that in about the seventh grade,
and I write a lot about in this inbox,

74
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,820
in the seventh grade, I had this
really painful personal experience,

75
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
which is that I was the,

76
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:42,160
and this is like a very seventh grade
thing to put in context because you know,

77
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:46,150
we're all a little emotional and a little
awkward and sensitive in the seventh

78
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:47,740
grade.
But in seventh grade,

79
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:51,510
I went to this very exclusive girls'
school in suburban outside of DC and

80
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:56,430
suburban Potomac, Maryland, which was, you
know, very conservative in entirely wait,

81
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,050
by the way it stayed in the school. And
the two years, partially because of this,

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,670
and in the seventh grade,

83
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:04,030
someone in my class had a birthday party
and I was the only one in the class not

84
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:04,864
invited.

85
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,830
And it turns out that the reason that
I wasn't invited because the party was

86
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:13,780
being held at the Chevy Chase country
club, which in 1988 did not have a single,

87
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,700
uh, minority or Jewish member because
we were Jewish. I was not invited.

88
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,950
My mom, when she explained to me
why, uh, why I hadn't been invited,

89
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,160
used it as a sort of opportunity
to recount to me, you know,

90
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,710
all of the discrimination
that American Jews had faced.

91
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,790
And it turns out that my own
grandfather had changed his name, uh,

92
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,960
in the 1950s from Goldberg to Gilbert,
because in most of America,

93
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:40,660
he couldn't get a hotel room
with the last name Goldberg.

94
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,800
It's a piece of American history that
most of us don't even think about anymore.

95
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,820
But it was true.
Was it the biggest,

96
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:52,840
most transformational personal
experience in my life? Of course not.

97
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,930
Does it compare in any way to the kind
of exclusion and challenges that visible

98
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,380
minorities in this country?
Faith, of course not.

99
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,950
But something happened for
me at that point in my life,

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,400
which is that I was humiliated and
angry and hurt and I could not stand the

101
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,680
injustice of it. It made me
crazy. So to fast forward,

102
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:17,300
I was lucky enough to go.
I left,

103
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,570
I got out of that school as soon as I
could and I went to a school in Washington

104
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:21,710
called Georgetown Day school,

105
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,280
which was actually built to be the
first integrated school in Washington.

106
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:29,570
It was established in the 1940s at the
time when DC was a highly segregated city.

107
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,290
Uh, which many people don't
know the history of Washington
and how segregated it

108
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,600
really was. But it was, uh, you know,

109
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,430
in many ways a sort of microcosm of the
bias that was happening in the nation.

110
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,480
But GDS was set up as this place
for, uh, for, um, you know,

111
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:48,470
for diverse communities in Washington to
get educated. And so when I got there,

112
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,120
it also turned out to be a place where
people talked about race and different

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,630
all the time. And the school
did something really amazing,

114
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,160
which is that in my freshman year,

115
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,870
when a bunch of African American
senior girls were feeling angry and,

116
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,500
uh,

117
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,920
like second class citizens in the school
because they felt they were not being

118
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:10,640
treated fairly by some of the white
students, the school, to their credit,

119
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,720
they suspended classes for three days
in my freshman year of high school and

120
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:19,160
brought in one Williams who had not
long before written the book eyes on the

121
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:24,161
prize to facilitate a summit on race for
a bunch of high school kids with life

122
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:25,454
altering.

123
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,720
But the thing about that and the reason
why I tell that story is that part of

124
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:31,070
what made me,
um,

125
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,880
have made me able to relate
to and understand or at
least try to understand the

126
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:42,911
pain that these amazing African American
girls who were seniors at the time who

127
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,350
I worshiped and thought were like
the coolest girls in the whole world.

128
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,260
Part of why I cried for them,

129
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,590
it was because I had had some
experience of being an outsider,

130
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,520
that that experience of having been
excluded for something I couldn't control,

131
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,870
right. That I was Jewish helped me
understand something different about them.

132
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,790
So fast forward because I actually
happened to thank, first of all,

133
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:09,140
I've come to realize how lucky I am that
I had any of those experiences because

134
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:11,220
it has created. Um, and,

135
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,440
and I am in no way less bias
than anyone else in this country.

136
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,180
I am in no way.
Uh,

137
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,620
I don't understand it in any
greater detail than anybody else,

138
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:26,621
but it has made me want to try and it
made me commit a big part of my career to

139
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:31,070
trying to create the
context and the environment.

140
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:36,050
And the opportunities for us all to do
better. And that's what I committed to.

141
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,270
And writing this book, could we
find a way to do better? Well,

142
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,240
one thing that I think
is fundamental to that,

143
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:43,850
and you can look at what's
happened, uh, you know, the,

144
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,990
what's happened in North Carolina and
Oklahoma or any of the other places around

145
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:49,730
the country now where there are now,
you know,

146
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:54,710
these sort of endless stream of hashtags
that kind of in a couple of letters try

147
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:59,490
to the pain and the complexity of what's
happening in the country right now.

148
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,870
We need desperately for more Americans.

149
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,990
And I absolutely believe
that we especially need more
white Americans to have a

150
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:12,180
deeper appreciation for empathy,

151
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:17,181
for and understanding of the
experiences that a non majority,

152
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:21,360
although that even that is changing.
So we'll talk about that in a minute.

153
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,930
But the way how all Americans
or experience or in our country,

154
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,400
if we cannot get to a deeper level
of empathy and understanding,

155
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,730
we are doomed to continue to repeat
these same cycles over and over again.

156
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,600
I, um, do a lot of media and I've been
spending a lot of time on Fox News. Uh,

157
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,000
I've become the like sort of
progressive punching bag on Fox News.

158
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,940
They love having me as often as all come
that they so they can scream and yell

159
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,990
at me. Uh, but I was invited to speak, um,

160
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,090
after one of the major
incidents a few months ago.

161
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,810
I can't remember Dallas after Dallas
had been so many this year I lose track.

162
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,750
But after the Dallas shooting, I was
invited on Meghan Kelly's show to do, uh,

163
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,290
be part of this discussion on race.

164
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,910
And I was kind of optimistic about it
because I thought, all right, you know,

165
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,220
they're doing it. It's going
to be nationally televised.
Um, that's promising.

166
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:14,830
And I get to the green room and it's
actually a very diverse room and I'm kinda

167
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,710
like,
well done Fox News.

168
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm impressed with who you pulled into
this room to have this conversation.

169
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,600
And we go in and we sit
down in the chairs and they,

170
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,550
before the cameras come
on and the producer says,

171
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,180
we really need a thoughtful and
meaningful conversation about this.

172
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,950
This is the time where the
country is in crisis. Uh,

173
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,460
we want all of you to bring your best.
Please don't scream.

174
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,980
People will change the channel.
It's not good for ratings,

175
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,860
but it's also not good for
this conversation. So I'm
feeling great. I'm like, yeah,

176
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:40,260
we're going to have meaningful
conversation. Yay. Fox News.

177
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,310
I'm sure you can guess that
it didn't quite go that way.

178
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,410
So it opened with a one guest
who started with the following.

179
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,450
Black lives matter is
more racist than the KKK.

180
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,990
That was the opener. So you can imagine
where it went from there. Uh, by the way,

181
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,850
that it was an African
American person who said that.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,760
So I'm not really sure what
they found it. But anyway, uh,

183
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,330
and then the next conversation
with somebody else who said,

184
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,960
we should just disband the
entire American police force.

185
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,770
We don't need police anymore.
So, you know, very productive,

186
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,450
rational conversation that was happening.

187
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,420
And then in between it was just people
like literally screaming at the top of

188
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:21,330
their lives, like as loud as they
possibly Clyde and in between.

189
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,800
And this is the part that I think that
is so heartbreaking to me in between

190
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,030
Megan Kelly who I really do respect and
think is an incredibly smart and gifted

191
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:34,200
person. Megan Kelly was thrilled
and other commercial breaks.

192
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,890
She encouraged us to keep at it
because it makes for great rating.

193
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,350
So thinks about that. Like is that
really where we want to be as a country?

194
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,410
So in the context of all of this,

195
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,270
part of what I try to do in crossing the
finish line is paint a picture of what

196
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,820
we, not just what's at stake and,
and what did they cause enormous.

197
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,920
And we have a lot at stake economically.

198
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,950
We certainly have a lot at stake socially.
Um,

199
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,120
it is critically important to the future
of our country that we do better in

200
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:09,121
terms of inclusion and this sort of
overall approach that we take to the fact

201
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:14,650
that our nation will in less than a
generation, be a minority majority nation.

202
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,281
You know,

203
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:19,690
we are seeing the sort of anxiety and
the backlash against that really come to

204
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:23,670
the fore in this election. I think that
is actually probably one of the most uh,

205
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,660
sort of salient pieces of what's happening
today is this sort of discomfort that

206
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:32,350
many especially white Americans have
with the changing face of our nation.

207
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,410
I don't think you can deny that that
is a significant undercurrent here,

208
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,200
but what it takes to do better,
I think,

209
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,450
and we're going to talk about one
small piece of it today. You know, the,

210
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:43,760
the media in Hollywood piece of it,
which you know,

211
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,530
might seem like the least important but
actually has a role to play in the book.

212
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:50,050
I try to make the case that it's
actually a whole bunch of things.

213
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,730
It's not just about how do we,

214
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,880
how much better do we do on
diversity at a company like Google,

215
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,260
where at any American company,

216
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:58,570
which is mostly where we're
talking about diversity today,

217
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,120
we are mostly talking about it
in the corporate context, right?

218
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,030
How'd he got more women and
people of color to go into stem?

219
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,710
You know how our businesses can do better,

220
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:09,310
how to have more women and people of
Color on corporate boards and in the suite

221
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,450
that matters. But there's a
whole kind of panoply of factors.

222
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,690
One of them is what's
happening in education,

223
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,030
and I talked about my
own formative experience.

224
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,210
Unfortunately the trends in the
country are not going in the right way.

225
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,960
If you look at the charts of what's
happened to school integration since Brown

226
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,920
vs board of Education, it is a bell
curve and the trend is reversing.

227
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,870
So American public schools
are now becoming less diverse
and it is actually the

228
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:38,680
private school in many ways.
So for the folks who can afford it,

229
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,210
who get to send their
kids to private schools,

230
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:42,940
the private schools are working overtime
to try to make sure they're diverse.

231
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,150
But our public school system is
becoming more segregated than ever.

232
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,930
And I talk a lot about that
in the book. So we, we're,

233
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,450
we're maybe preparing the next generation
to potentially reverse some of the

234
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:55,510
gains that have been made with Gen y and
Gen z and some of the younger Americans.

235
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:55,961
I don't know.

236
00:13:55,961 --> 00:14:00,040
It's a question we have a three of
challenge around mass incarceration,

237
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,700
which you absolutely cannot separate it
from the larger question of how are we

238
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:05,110
doing on diversity in this country?

239
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,430
We are locking up an entire
generation of minority Americans.

240
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,780
And if we don't address that and see
that as part of the overall picture of

241
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:18,110
diversity in the country, we are missing
a very important and significant teeth.

242
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,610
Obviously the business piece is important.
Immigration continues to be, uh,

243
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,730
especially in this election cycle.
A really intense topic of,

244
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,290
of dispute and debate. But of
course, and I know you all know this,

245
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:33,940
when a company like Google immigrants
to this country, including by the way,

246
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,020
those who are here who are undocumented
contributing enormously to the American

247
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:39,220
economy,
undocumented,

248
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:42,610
they were going to pay billions
of dollars in taxes every year,

249
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,860
which is sort of an extraordinary
piece of the picture,

250
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:46,540
which doesn't get much attention.

251
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,350
And then what I want to invite Alicia to
talk about with me in a minute is this

252
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:51,980
sort of entertainment and media piece,

253
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,660
which seems kind of Billy and the
context of talking about, you know,

254
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,630
some of the big issues we have around
criminal justice reform and education and

255
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,250
some of the an immigration right.

256
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,710
But part of what I argue in the block
is that what we see and what we see

257
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,300
intensely all the time now because of
the sort of limitless that, you know,

258
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,960
the boundary list,
uh,

259
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,400
sources of information that come
out at what we see in the media,

260
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,640
in Hollywood, on television,
maybe matters more than ever.

261
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,920
And the challenges is that we have not
made the kind of progress in ensuring

262
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:28,340
that the images and the stories that
we see actually represent our country.

263
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,910
So I'm going to invite up Alicia Reiner,
my dear friend,

264
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:34,230
who I'll also introduce
to come up and join me.

265
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,330
We'll have a bit of a conversation.

266
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:37,940
We really want to encourage
you to participate in this. Um,

267
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,200
this is not just about me
and fundamentally for us to
make progress as a country.

268
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:45,730
It takes a lot of
conversation. Um, so the,

269
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,500
and then the last thing I'll just
say about this is that I do think,

270
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,540
and I write a lot about this in the book,

271
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,630
I do believe that White America has an
outsized responsibility and white male

272
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:02,210
America in many instances has an
outsized responsibility in solving these

273
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,640
issues.
And in finding a way to understand,

274
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,800
the one point I managed to make on Meghan
Kelly's crazy show that day is that in

275
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:10,251
the end,

276
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:15,251
it doesn't matter whether or not I can
understand in a personal or a deep way

277
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:20,330
the experience of what it's like
to drive, uh, around the country.

278
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:24,140
As an African American, I will never
understand that I'm, I'm awake person.

279
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:26,360
I can never fully appreciate
what that feels like,

280
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,880
but I have a responsibility and I
believe we all do that. If any American,

281
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,070
if any American feels that they do not
have full access to the American dream or

282
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:39,890
that they are in any way less than a full,

283
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,120
let have less than the full rights and
privileges and equality of all other

284
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:48,230
Americans, then we all have a
responsibility to try to make it better.

285
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,230
Whether we agree with it
or relate to it or not.

286
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,590
And so all the conversations we're having
today about, I believe it's racist,

287
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:56,990
they don't believe it's racist.
I think the cops are racist.

288
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:00,080
They don't think the cops or it
doesn't matter. None of it matters.

289
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,720
Because if any Americans feel,

290
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,310
if any Americans feel that our
country is not a full meritocracy,

291
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:08,900
is not fully accessible,

292
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,720
but the American dream is not
accessible to all Americans,

293
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,470
then we all have work to do. So with
that, I want to invite up to Reiner.

294
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,660
I'm the amazing and talented. I know many
of you know her. Um, I'm very lucky that,

295
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,870
uh, Alicia and I had been very
dear friends for a long time.

296
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,890
We're actually neighbors. We both live
in Harlem and was there for a long time.

297
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:30,320
Our little girls are the same age.
Uh,

298
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,840
and Alicia doesn't need
a ton of introduction.

299
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,230
I'm sure you have seen her on the
amazing show. Orange is the new black,

300
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,380
which is one of that sort
of few shows out there.

301
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:42,170
It's certainly one of the only shows
it's an all female cast or a majority

302
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,370
female casts.
Um,

303
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,110
one of the few shows that also has
really focused on the mass incarceration

304
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:51,590
issue as part of that, one of
the themes of the show, um,

305
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Aleisha along with many of
the cast members and the
writers have also put a lot

306
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:59,790
of time into calling attention to criminal
justice reform and not incarceration

307
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,170
of women, which is important.
And her new movie acquity, uh,

308
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:07,770
which she was here at Google
when like a month ago. Yeah,

309
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:12,771
a month ago to talk about on is the
first all female driven movie Wall Street

310
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:18,330
film. Um, that was written by,
directed by and starred in by,

311
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,940
that's not really offended.
Um, all women. Uh,

312
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,850
and I've been talking with her about
that movie for a very long time.

313
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,870
So please join me in
welcoming Elise Reiner.

314
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,803
Yeah.

315
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,560
Hi. How are you? I'm good.
He thinks he's thought,

316
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,570
is he on? She's not on.
Uh, are we on the screen?

317
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,250
Can they see us in California, California?
He's been, are you there? Okay.

318
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,660
Um,
so,

319
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,230
so I started to say that in many ways
it's hard to think of Hollywood or movies

320
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:58,460
or TV, which is kind of, you
know, fun and fluffy, right?

321
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,490
That's the invite and fluffy. It's
hard to think about that as having, um,

322
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,830
an important role to play in the
context of all the rest of the, um,

323
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,130
but I know that I often talk about it as,

324
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:12,860
and I say that I told the story
in the book that when I was a kid,

325
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:17,861
one of the most influential women that I
saw on television with wonder woman and

326
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:21,040
wonder woman with at her,
uh,

327
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,380
height of power in my early childhood,
uh,

328
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,050
Linda Carter lived in Washington.
And that was also a big thing.

329
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:29,770
And she would live like in my neighborhood
and my youth like ride my bike path

330
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:32,360
or house, always trying to get a glimpse
of her, cause I'm so obsessed with her.

331
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,080
I never saw her. But you know, wonder
woman kicked off, right. I mean,

332
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:40,340
she was an absolute feminist icon
and for, you know, for me it was,

333
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:42,770
it made a big difference,
but you know, it,

334
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,890
it does feel like in some way then I
think the numbers bear this out and I know

335
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:49,490
you know them really well. You
know, the sort of early eighties,

336
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,080
late seventies, early eighties in
many ways was kind of a high point.

337
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:59,081
Like we haven't really seen a substantial
increase in like women role model,

338
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,920
uh, in the movies and on TV
since then. And that's, you know,

339
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,150
I am here later today for
the Dean Davis Symposium,

340
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:12,320
which we'll talk about,
not only be actual statistics,

341
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,350
but perhaps a piece of technology that
Google is involved with to look at these

342
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:20,030
statistics and,
you know,

343
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,720
I just want to roll it back for a second
and say thank you for everything that

344
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:28,490
you said.
Also as a very privileged white woman,

345
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,520
like I grew up thinking
I was outrageously lucky,

346
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,960
um, and I was teased mercilessly.
We now call it bullying,

347
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,130
but I was the fat kid
and he's mercilessly,

348
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,030
and there was this interesting
dichotomy of like, oh,

349
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,540
I feel like the outsider,
I feel like crap.

350
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,620
But I went to a very privileged white,

351
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,760
the fairly diverse school,
but um,

352
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,420
was made aware because it was a very,
it was ethical culture,

353
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:06,421
which makes you very aware
of your privilege and aware
of the world around you.

354
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:11,140
And we learned ethics
in first grade and um,

355
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,720
and I felt very like,
how dare I feel anything but lucky.

356
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:19,810
That's pretty much how I grew up.
Um,

357
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,470
and never really like an felt a similar
responsibility to make change for

358
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,530
others,
not for myself.

359
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,980
So I think coming to a place where I was
really looking at the statistics about

360
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:40,801
women in the media was took me a long
time because I had this how dare I

361
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:44,050
mentality.

362
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,350
And then I did become aware of the
statistics and a lot of it had to do with

363
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:54,160
becoming a mother for me.
Because what you said about if,

364
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,400
if you see it, you can be it.
I became the mother of a girl,

365
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:04,120
have a daughter,
and I wanted her to see certain things.

366
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,240
And I then did some research and Stacy
Smith does some amazing research.

367
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:14,830
The Gina Davis Institute doesn't some
amazing research. And what I found out,

368
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:19,030
it's 77% of the people
you see in all of media,

369
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,340
which includes film, television,
cartoons, everything.

370
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,750
77% are male.

371
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,400
So when you're looking
at that as a human being,

372
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:34,660
as a female human being, you feel
like a massive minority. You know,

373
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,340
as I explained it to my
work because it's not.

374
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,150
And as a male you feel like
you're in the world. Um,

375
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,030
and that is something that we're
seeing every day. By the way,

376
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:52,150
one of the most interesting things that
I heard someone say to me about the

377
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:55,630
movie Yackety, which I encourage you
to all go see first time I bought,

378
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,900
then go buy it. Go see acronym.
I'm sorry, I get to do that.

379
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,060
Movie's been out for a little while.

380
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,370
Mine just came out this week that you in
my book just came out this disease. So,

381
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,700
um, but one of the most interesting things
that I heard somebody say after seeing

382
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:10,390
equity with a friend of mine
went with her husband. And, um,

383
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,280
and if you've not seen
the movie, you know, the,

384
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,230
the female characters
really drives a movie.

385
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,110
And it is the story of women
as a very important story.

386
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,050
We've been on Wall Street,
it's also with thriller. Um,

387
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,060
it's not overtly like about
women in a traditional way,

388
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:24,820
but it is driven by women. And
one of the things that, um,

389
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,230
my friend's husband said to her was the
male characters are so one dimensional

390
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:33,970
and Finley's on. And she was
like, yeah, welcome to our world.

391
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:36,750
Because if you look at movies like
Wall Street or any of these things,

392
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,960
I mean I think, you know, when I,

393
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,840
when I watched it the first time I started
laughing because of course the first

394
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:44,890
time you see a woman in the wolf of Wall
Street is Martha Robbie naked in the

395
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,960
bubble bath. And you're like, seriously
guys? Like really? That's like,

396
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,400
and then the next one is like the
never laying insecure secretary,

397
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,200
like not, so anyway, you get the
point. Um, but the, the point is,

398
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:59,570
is that one of the things that I thought
was so interesting is this week with

399
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,070
the Edney is and of course after the
Oscars, so white controversy last year,

400
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:08,360
which is by the way, not over.
So stay tuned for February.

401
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:12,120
We'll see if we see any significant
improvement. Unlikely. Um,

402
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,080
but one thing that's super interesting
is that the ambiance this year, you know,

403
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:18,530
we're so focused, there was so much
attention on diversity, you know,

404
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:21,380
shows like transparent and others
that got a lot of attention.

405
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,560
So you might conclude the TV's
doing pretty well right there,

406
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,740
Shonda land and all these
things, right. And it's,

407
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:35,310
it's disturbing when there's fault,

408
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,970
there's elevated and lay that,
yeah, that makes us feel like, oh,

409
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:44,960
we're doing great. Um, because
statistically speaking or not,

410
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:50,530
and statistically speaking,
80% of directors are women,

411
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,360
similar to 8% of female CEOs.

412
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,050
And we do have,
you know,

413
00:24:57,051 --> 00:25:00,500
it's I think one or 2% cinematographers.
Um,

414
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,390
we do have that 77% gap,

415
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,420
even in like the extras you see in the
background didn't like bazonkers crowd

416
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:14,760
scene. So how do we change that? Um,

417
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,820
and, and that equity was
a big piece of that. So,

418
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:21,710
and I think part of it
is true. I mean, so,

419
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,030
so you talked about your daughter and I
haven't talked about my kid, but it is,

420
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,480
um, sort of important piece of the
puzzle, which I didn't mention,

421
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:34,220
which is that both my daughters
are African American. And
so when I think about,

422
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:39,080
um, what I want for them, uh, you know,

423
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,740
I'm obviously as this at her age, you
know, I'm glad we have doc McStuffins,

424
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,050
which by the way, just got canceled. Uh,

425
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,680
if you didn't know tragic
loss and Disneyland, doc
McStuffins has been canceled,

426
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,180
your daughter's devastated.
She's seen every episode at
least a hundred times. Uh,

427
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,160
but you know, that, that question of
like, what an impact it really makes.

428
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,310
And I talk a little bit in the book about
the impact of the Cosby show, right?

429
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,940
And how sort of groundbreaking
that was for so many Americans.

430
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:05,930
And I think now in some ways,

431
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,560
master of none is kind of breaking that
territory for Asian Americans that we've

432
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:13,790
seen so few Asian Americans ever. And
in his speech at the Emmy's, right?

433
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,120
Fresh off the boat, I fresh off the boat.
I mean this is like the biggest deal.

434
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:17,361
I mean,

435
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:22,340
and if these are huge segments as American
society and yet they'd be like barely

436
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:26,480
see them. So, so at least you're like,
what? What's the problem? Like why is,

437
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,030
you know, given that there
was a good economic case,
certainly in Hollywood, right,

438
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,800
the movies and the shows that you actually
reflect the country do really well.

439
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,290
I mean, you look at like how
frozen became the, you know,

440
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,580
the highest grossing animated
film of All time. So what is,

441
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,250
why is it so hard to make
change and to see, uh,

442
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,520
disease stories in Hollywood
that look like America?

443
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,790
In my experience, it's a
couple of different things.
One is our unconscious bias.

444
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I think there are so many parts of
us that were simply not aware of.

445
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,840
And I,
it's,

446
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:07,010
you were talking earlier about these
sort of over responsibility of the white

447
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:11,370
now and I really believe that to
be true because they're in power,

448
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,050
they are a, they're in power and be, I,

449
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,890
I feel like there are so many
systems in place that our habit,

450
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,700
we all have our habits, you know, and it,

451
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,100
some of them are good
and some of them are bad.

452
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,030
Hiring our friends is a big habit.

453
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:37,350
A lot of people have hiring
people that look like you,

454
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,600
that feel like you,

455
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,990
that you're comfortable with is just
a truth that most of the world does.

456
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,160
I mean, I always make the joke that
like, Karen's my key demographic, right?

457
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,760
Like Nice Jewish girls, you know,
similar backgrounds and hey, you know,

458
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:56,670
I totally was biased in my
hiring of Karen. Like, well,

459
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,470
we all do it. We all do it. I, you
know, I was at a screening of equity.

460
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,700
I did a Q and a and this girl who looked
just like one of the girls I grew up

461
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:11,821
with,

462
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:16,680
like look like an upper west side girl
came up to me and started talking to me

463
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,790
and her daughter goes to banks for
and my daughter grocery extreme.

464
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,180
And like all of a sudden we're friends
and I don't know if that would've

465
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,940
happened if it was a man,
like probably not first of all,

466
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:33,210
because I had married and,
and I only,

467
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,360
I only say that because if I was a man
and a woman came up to me like that's not

468
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:45,390
cool. So I'm not going to hire that
woman because, or I'm not going to make,

469
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,790
be friends with that willing cause.
What is my wife gonna Think?

470
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,980
And these are the like thing,
these unconscious biases,

471
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,460
these stereotypes that we aren't aware
of sometimes that we have to make

472
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:00,570
ourselves aware of.

473
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:03,450
I mean I'm kind of controversial on this
though because I will say that I don't,

474
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,290
I don't actually subscribe to it always
being unconscious. And I actually,

475
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,010
it makes me a little crazy cause I often
feel like the constant conversation

476
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:14,580
about unconscious bias sometimes
lets people off the hook. Like,

477
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,750
well I just wasn't conscious. Like
no, no. Like it doesn't work that way.

478
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,420
Like you don't get to be unconscious.
Like there are things that,

479
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,540
and by the way I think and I think
sometimes it is absolutely blatantly

480
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,680
conscious,
you know,

481
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:30,420
some of the biases that we are seeing
in this election cycle, you know,

482
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:34,950
you can't tell me that people
aren't conscious of the
fact that we don't ask men

483
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:37,110
to smile when they're
running for president.

484
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:42,100
And yet we asked women just my Al Right.
So I get really part of about this.

485
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,600
One thing I just wanted to share
is that part of why I am the,

486
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:47,530
and this is not to be like
a pain the off about it,

487
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:50,350
but I do think like it's
not an excuse anymore.

488
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:53,800
Like unconscious bias doesn't get to be
an excuse forever. Oh, I wasn't conscious.

489
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:58,600
And so I just, you know,
oops, my bad. Like we had to
get beyond that as a country.

490
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:01,630
We have, we have to do better than
that. And one of the things that I,

491
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,150
one of the reasons why I called
the book crossing the finish line,

492
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,910
then they didn't want to just like briefly
tell the story at he knows the story,

493
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:11,110
but I'll tell it briefly is that, um,
I have these two fabulous colleagues,

494
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:14,350
these lovely guys who
worked with me in Boston,

495
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,500
and there are these sort of
central casting, you know,

496
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,810
wait Bostonian Catholic guys,

497
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,910
and you would not look at them and
think that they were, you know,

498
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,110
I made a lot of assumptions about them
as we always do about everyone that we

499
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:31,960
meet. Well, it turns
out that my colleagues,

500
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:36,961
Brian and Sean are part of this
incredible prison ministry in Boston.

501
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,270
And Day along with a bunch of the other,

502
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,280
mostly white male executives from a
bunch of Boston companies are part of a

503
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:49,441
parish that goes into largely minority
because that is who the prison population

504
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:50,900
is, uh, you know,

505
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,160
maximum security prisons around the
Boston area and do these amazing sort of

506
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:57,520
collaborative ministries.

507
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:02,020
And the thing that Brian said to me about
it is why I titled The book the Way I

508
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:04,000
did and he blew me away when he said this.

509
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:07,900
He said after visiting these prisons and
he was terrified to do it. He thought,

510
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:09,280
what am I going to have
to say to these people,

511
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:14,281
what I have in common with them after the
first visit he walked out and said the

512
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:16,960
line between us and so very thin.

513
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,730
If I had made one different decision
in my life, I might be where they are.

514
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,630
But they had made one different decision
or had one different opportunity in

515
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:27,310
their lives,
they might be where I am.

516
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:33,150
And I was so blown away that he thought
of that as a thin line that he actually

517
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:36,460
saw there being so little
difference between them.

518
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,830
And I thought that's what we need.

519
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,190
Like that's what we need in the country
is we need more people to see these

520
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:45,280
lines as thin. And so,
you know, one thing that,

521
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:47,830
and then I want to open it up cause I do,
I think we should have a conversation,

522
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:48,664
but you know,

523
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Hollywood does have this amazing abilities
through storytelling to help people

524
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:59,410
relate to other human beings they
might not otherwise relate to you.

525
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:02,690
So like what have been the,
what are you seeing that you,

526
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,790
what are your signs of hope?

527
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,020
Like what do you see changing people
or what do you think is the sort of

528
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:12,160
possibility for that? Are we
moving, I mean the pace is glacial,

529
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:16,120
but are you optimistic,
pessimistic? I'm very optimistic.

530
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:19,330
I think I am a by nature an optimist.

531
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,540
And when you were talking about how
we like unconscious bias and that,

532
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,460
that sort of lets people off the hook,

533
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,150
I believe that we're good.
You know, there's, I, I was,

534
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,520
um, at an event yesterday and
they were talking about, um,

535
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,470
Einstein had this like core question like,

536
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,950
do you believe the world is good or not?

537
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,340
Do you believe that we're all trying
to make it better than that? And,

538
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,630
and that really is a core question
because if you do believe in the good,

539
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,020
like then you act from the good.

540
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,680
And I really believe in good.
Um,

541
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,370
so I believe that we can only
teach with love and compassion,

542
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,140
you know, and, and empathy and compassion.

543
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,510
And so I, yes, I believe we
are changing for the guys.

544
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,680
I really do.

545
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:27,310
I think it takes a lot of
conversations like this and a lot of

546
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,780
talking about the things that are really
painful and uncomfortable and making

547
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,400
art about it and it that's,
you know,

548
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:42,430
I became an artist because I felt like
that was the place where I could reach

549
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,500
the most people with true that there are
sometimes afraid to talk about in other

550
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:56,360
areas. Have you seen people
changed through shows? Like
orange is the new black,

551
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:59,690
like I know you've had lots of people
come up to you and say things to you about

552
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:03,170
it. So what was what anyone stand out
like what do you think has been the change

553
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:08,030
that a show like orange? I think
it's simply, it's that finish line.

554
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:13,270
It's people relating to those women
and feeling like I that could be,

555
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,580
well, that's what the show does. So well,
right? It was those stories of like,

556
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,200
you know, that Piper's story
too. And, and it, it's true.

557
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,880
And how do we, how do we tell stories
that create more compassionate?

558
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,930
How do we,
you know,

559
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:31,931
the first movie that I made as a producer
was a short about grief and loss.

560
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,590
I lost my dad really suddenly to cancer.

561
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:40,880
He was 55 and everyone,
I felt like a pariah.

562
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:45,350
Everyone was afraid to talk to me because
they were so afraid to talk about that

563
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,020
and they didn't know how to talk about.
So they just wouldn't.

564
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,570
And so I made this movie and I worked
with 10 grief counselors and social

565
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:58,571
workers and we created like basically
some art therapy with all these sort of a

566
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:00,290
different phases of grieving.

567
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:05,291
And we created a discussion guide and
a journal that went with it as a way to

568
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:06,950
help people process.

569
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,980
And I do believe deeply in this healing
power of art or I wouldn't be here.

570
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,483
Um,

571
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,930
I think it's hard in moments like this,

572
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,420
like in what's going on in the world
because you almost can't make the art fast

573
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,090
enough to really make impact.

574
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,560
So then I think for me
in a moment like this,

575
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:36,370
especially as a white privileged woman,
how do I make impact?

576
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:40,740
What, what? That's the biggest
question I sort of turn over to you in,

577
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,540
in these moment.
Well,

578
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,970
one of the things and then I want
to like open it up to conversation.

579
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:47,340
So one of the things that I,
and I mentioned my kid,

580
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:49,230
one of the things that I
learned, I learned, you know,

581
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,780
having worked on diversity for years and
those things I learned in researching

582
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:56,781
the book is how often minority Americans
talk to their children about race and

583
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:01,940
how rarely white Americans do.
And one of the sort of, so,

584
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,860
and I had a personal experience of this,
which I really had to face,

585
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:07,290
which is that when my
daughter cells is now seven,

586
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,950
came home from preschool
when she was three, she came
home one day and said, Mama,

587
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,933
I'm Brown.

588
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,430
And wanted to talk about the fact that
she was brown and some of the other kids

589
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:16,110
in, in cough warrants. And you know,

590
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,200
she wasn't probably as diverse of a
preschool as I would've liked for her,

591
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:22,410
but it was sort of the one that we
picked and she wanted to talk about it.

592
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:26,880
And my immediate visceral, so here was my
unconscious. The thing that I, you know,

593
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:29,520
thinking I'm so progressive about it,
my immediate visceral,

594
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:34,080
visceral reaction was I wanted to
change the subject. And I thought, well,

595
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,810
why am I trying to change the subject?
Like it's just an objective truth.

596
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,900
Like what am I going to do with no
teller? You're not like, it's ridiculous.

597
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,180
Like I have to be able to
talk about this and you know,

598
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,900
and so I had to like take a deep breath
and kind of face my own discomfort.

599
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,570
But I tell the story because
when I was researching the book,

600
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:50,790
one of the things that I learned
is that there's been all this,

601
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,380
like a lot of all this psychology,

602
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:56,400
the psychological research that's been
done about conversations around race with

603
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:59,560
children. And it turns out, you
know, so much of white America, we,

604
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:01,020
we want to be colorblind,
right?

605
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:04,040
We want to just see everyone is the
same and not as a big theme in the

606
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:08,340
collection. By the way, if you watch
five minutes of conservative news,

607
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:09,930
if you watch Fox for five minutes,

608
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,890
you will hear guest after guest after
guest challenge the assumption that there

609
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:15,390
is racism in this country.

610
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,780
Challenge the assumption that any of
these big issues that we're facing are

611
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:20,670
about race.
I mean that is this and that.

612
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,240
And you got to listen to that because
it's actually a very significant part of

613
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:27,180
the American perspective. And if we
deny it, we're missing a whole thing.

614
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,560
But here's the thing about it.

615
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,690
So even the most well intentioned among
us who think that by not talking about

616
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:38,400
race with our kids, we are
raising colorblind children. Well,

617
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:42,660
turns out that psychologically it has the
opposite effect. That in the opposite,

618
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,440
in the absence of conversation,
in the absence of information,

619
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,340
our children actually draw
a negative conclusion.

620
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,000
So the very thing that so many white
Americans do to try to, you know,

621
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,450
be good citizens,
right?

622
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,440
We don't need to talk about
that cause we're all the same.

623
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,000
It's actually the wrong choice because
it's actually reinforcing our kids assume

624
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:04,240
that when we're not talking about it,

625
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,990
it's because there's something wrong
or bad that were uncomfortable.

626
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,560
Piggyback on that. I feel many media,
we're not talking about it either.

627
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:15,540
So where are they going to get wrecked?
And I feel like it's almost,

628
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,600
it's so much better and easier with
kids because there's so much more open.

629
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,090
When you guys have workshops on diversity,

630
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:27,900
it feels a little forced sometimes.

631
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,190
And I think with kids it's,
you know,

632
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,300
at our school we have,

633
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,570
since first grade she's had racial justice
and advocacy classes in fourth grade.

634
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,930
And my favorite part,
yeah,

635
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,900
my favorite part is they
talk regularly about,

636
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,800
there are four different kinds of
their bored, not kind of the people.

637
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:56,010
They would hate me saying that there are
four different categories of human in

638
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:57,850
any situation.

639
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,140
So in any situation where
there was a conflict,

640
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:06,970
there's the mistake maker, the
target, the bystander. And the ally.

641
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:12,630
What I love about that breakdown is that
the mistake maker and the bystander,

642
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,020
or almost neck and neck
as a mistake makers,

643
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,370
that if you are a bystander,
that's not okay.

644
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,330
And I love that my daughter
goes to a school, the teachers,

645
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,330
it is not okay to be a bystander
that it is your job to be an ally.

646
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,980
That is your job in life.
And that's that unconscious bias.

647
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:44,010
Like how do we train ourselves
and how do we train our children?

648
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,180
So I want to open it up in conversation
in the room if there's lots of better

649
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,030
perspective than ours. Right. Um,

650
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,370
I wanted to talk about something you
mentioned earlier when you mentioned the

651
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:57,610
mes and they're pushing for
diversity. So at the Emmy's, you know,

652
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:59,950
Jeffrey temporary,
like you won an award for a transparent,

653
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,590
and in his speech he mentioned how
important it was to, you know, uh,

654
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:07,660
let Trans Women actually be on TV and
control their stories. But you know,

655
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:10,960
like the obvious irony of that is that
Jeffrey Tambor is himself, you know,

656
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,830
assessed man playing a trans woman.
And so my question is, you know,

657
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:19,480
how can you make sure people in positions
of power like that actually do sort of

658
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:22,330
vacate their spot and actually do
maybe room for people who need it.

659
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,210
That's a great, I love that question.
You want to, what do you think?

660
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,450
I think they got it. They
know first of all. Yeah.

661
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,620
I think a big piece of it is,

662
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:38,180
by the way also a white actresses playing
minority characters where they had no

663
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:41,100
business with doing [inaudible].
Right. Hello everyone. Um,

664
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,490
there's a long list of both of
which I talked about in the book.

665
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,090
Like they should never have said
yes to this part. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

666
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,040
And um,

667
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:54,550
so I want to start by saying one of my
favorite parts is that Jeffrey tambor

668
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,270
called himself out on
it and we have to like,

669
00:40:59,271 --> 00:41:03,050
that takes a lot of balls. You're
winning an award and you're like, dude,

670
00:41:03,051 --> 00:41:05,510
this is not okay.
Um,

671
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:11,050
and I think creating art that
talks about what you like.

672
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:17,120
I love Jill Solloway so much
cause she told her story.

673
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:19,010
She didn't look for like the story she,

674
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,620
that she thought would make
the most money or whatever.

675
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,400
She told the story that needed to be
told in her heart and the story that she

676
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:29,900
was afraid to tell the
story. She was probably most
afraid to Dell because as we,

677
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,490
as she's now put out is like her,
her family's story.

678
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,043
Um,

679
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:40,280
and I think that's what we all have to do.

680
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,750
She also said, you know,
top of the Patrick Marky,

681
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,760
I don't know how to do that.
I thought about it a lot.

682
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:55,220
What I know how to do is make
my art and make my own choices.

683
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:00,950
When I made my movie, I said from the
beginning before we even hired the writer,

684
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:04,460
I want to play a woman, married to a
woman, married to a woman of color.

685
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,490
Because if I'm making this movie,

686
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:12,491
I want to create an extra
role for a diverse woman and
extra woman from the LGBT

687
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,530
community and um,

688
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,400
and like basic and a woman.
So I,

689
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,020
I hit those three checks now I,

690
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:27,170
I did hire an actual, um,
African American woman.

691
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,580
It was tricky. It's tricky
then to go like, oh,

692
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,720
is it okay for me to ask people,
are you gay?

693
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:42,350
That's actually discrimination.
I'm, when I'm casting that role,

694
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,600
I'm not allowed to ask that question.

695
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,600
Just like I'm not allowed
to ask their eight,

696
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,280
even though there's incredible
reasons and men ages, um, and,

697
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,130
and so many isms in Hollywood.

698
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:59,090
So there's a lot of
tricky navigating there.

699
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,330
Um,
is it okay,

700
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,360
like here I was an actress and producer
trying to create more roles for women,

701
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,940
women of color,
LGBT women.

702
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,780
Was it wrong for me to play it because
I played a lesbian? Should have,

703
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,510
should I have hired someone
else to play my own role?

704
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:25,670
I don't know. Um, I've never
thought about it that way.

705
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,090
Yeah, it then that is I think in some
ways like, right. I mean, I don't know.

706
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:32,210
Other people may disagree. I think there
are some, it's not always bought. I mean,

707
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:35,330
there are gray areas in these on
these issues. But I do think to me,

708
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,920
there's no gray area,

709
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,940
no grey area whatsoever when we are
hiring white actors to play minority

710
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:44,450
characters. Like it's just unacceptable.
This happened in the star trek movies.

711
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,800
It happened in the movie Aloha.

712
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,920
Like we continue to do this
is absolutely unacceptable.

713
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:53,921
And I will say I just did 23 in me so
I know exactly what I am so that I make

714
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:58,790
sure not to lie about that.
Do you know what I mean?

715
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:03,140
I did that exactly for that reason
cause everyone's like, are you Italian?

716
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:07,340
Are you Russian? Are you, what are
you Armenian are you, and I, you know,

717
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:10,670
my grandparents would tell me one thing,
but I,

718
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:14,060
and I've played Armenian and I
believe I am in fact Armenian,

719
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,300
but I was also told I was Egyptian and
I'm doing 23 and me to find out if I

720
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:24,280
really am okay. Let me know. Okay. Yeah.

721
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,670
Um, I, um, I've lived in Oakland,
California for the past several years.

722
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:30,170
Raised both my kids in Oakland.

723
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:33,990
We're like the most progressive
humans on the earth. It's, I just,

724
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:38,130
and so I find that I just get,
so all my friends who are less

725
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:40,950
progressive,

726
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,850
I have some friends that
live in the central part of
the state of California and

727
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,120
places like Arizona.
And I just like,

728
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:52,500
I watched them evolve and you said
the pace is glacial and it is glacial.

729
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:57,210
But like when they finally get it,
it's like how do you,

730
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,440
I mean I'm super optimistic, don't get
me wrong. But I, these people, they just,

731
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:05,040
when they are so slow to about
makes me crazy and they just,

732
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:08,420
how do you have patients?
And one of the things for people who are,

733
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,630
are people of color who deal
with this crap on a daily basis,

734
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,270
loved ones being murdered.

735
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,530
And yet they get up there in front of
the press and there's so lovely and

736
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:23,850
articulate and understanding
and compassionate and I
just don't know how they do

737
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:28,500
it. Right. So I wanted to say one thing
about one part of why you had said um,

738
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,770
cause there's a lot there and I want to
unpack one thing about it and that is

739
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,120
when you talked about you know,

740
00:45:34,121 --> 00:45:37,930
people you know who are left progressive
and I'm going to say something really

741
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:40,420
crazy and I say a lot
about this in the blog.

742
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:45,220
One of my biggest lessons in the last
couple of years has been about my own

743
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:47,470
biases around people's
political orientation.

744
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:53,460
And I run now a nonpartisan women's
organization and I established it.

745
00:45:53,471 --> 00:45:55,120
It's a pull a women's
political organization,

746
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:56,250
which I didn't have time to talk about,

747
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:01,090
but I established it to be nonpartisan
because I believed so much that we need

748
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:05,530
more women in the political process,
whatever their political affiliation.

749
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,730
And there's actually a lot of evidence
that when women get into elected office,

750
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,290
women on both sides of the aisle,

751
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:14,860
Republican and Democrat are actually
more bipartisan, more productive,

752
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,220
more likely to put the issue, be interest
of the country ahead of their own.

753
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,550
So I had to actually go
out and this is my own,

754
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:25,180
like I've talked a lot about this.
I didn't know any conservative women.

755
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,310
Like I didn't have any
conservative friends.

756
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,320
I thought I had nothing
in common with them.

757
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,710
And so I went through a
process of seeking out, um,

758
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:37,720
some Republican women who were very well
respected in the political world and my

759
00:46:37,721 --> 00:46:41,680
relationships with them were
life altering, life altering.

760
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:45,580
And I see you shaking your head.
I know we don't agree on everything.

761
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,940
We won't agree on
everything, but the, the,

762
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:49,990
the challenge that we
have in the country today.

763
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:55,030
Now if you ask me do I think I do,
I think that there is,

764
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,590
um,

765
00:46:55,590 --> 00:47:00,590
that I want to sit down with someone
in the alt right or with a white

766
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:01,930
supremacists,
uh,

767
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:06,220
or somebody who is a virulent antisemite
and I try to have like a rational

768
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:10,510
conversation so we can understand each
other better. No, I will say that no,

769
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,720
I have nothing in common with somebody
who is that hateful about entire groups

770
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:18,700
of people.
I cannot relate to that.

771
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,730
And I wish I was a better person that
I'd be willing to take that on account.

772
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,760
But the truth is the vast majority of
Americans are nowhere near those polar

773
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,444
ends of the scale.

774
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:33,750
And it is the sort of dystopian world
of the current media cycle that makes us

775
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:34,900
think that is the case.

776
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,880
And it means that we're less likely to
have some very important conversations.

777
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,800
And there are a lot of common bond between
people who have different political

778
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:48,880
views. And if we can't have
those conversations, if
we're so uncomfortable with,

779
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:53,160
I'm like, it's another piece
of the equation, right, that,

780
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:57,640
that we have to be able to do that and
defined common bounce around and to

781
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,510
respect each other.
And look,

782
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:01,660
I think that is in some ways happening
in this election. I mean, you know,

783
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:06,661
the Republicans who had subscribed to
never Trump specifically because of the

784
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:11,320
racism and the misogyny that has been so,
uh,

785
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,540
such a critical part of this campaign.
You know,

786
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,400
I may not agree with
them on a lot of things,

787
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:18,550
but I certainly agree with
them on that. So, you know,

788
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:23,551
my only point is that I think we have
to see those conversations across the

789
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:27,670
political divide.
It's still a part of the same equation.

790
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,500
If it's hard and it's
uncomfortable and we all hate it,

791
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:34,660
cause the challenge and make it
look like challenge and we're not,

792
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:37,810
I don't like watching Fox News and
make me mad because I don't agree.

793
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,310
But I do it and I go on the show and
I do it because I don't know how I

794
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:45,400
understand the country if I own,
if I'm totally tuning it out,

795
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,050
just as I would want them watching
it. And I said, why, why, why?

796
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:52,300
I just thought that would want more
conservatives watching MSNBC. Right. So,

797
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:53,800
I mean,
these are the ones he's like big,

798
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:57,160
hard thing that like we're
going to have to fake, you know,

799
00:48:57,161 --> 00:49:00,190
or else like in length,
we're okay with where we are today,

800
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,350
which I think most of us probably aren't.
Okay.

801
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,140
It's in no way meant as a criticism.
And I think, you know, we're all,

802
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:09,760
we're all doing our bath to try to
like to contribute to, you know,

803
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:12,730
about her death cards. But I, but how
does it to say something about that? Yeah,

804
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,623
please.

805
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,061
Yeah,

806
00:49:14,061 --> 00:49:19,061
I have a more like similar on adding
on that I thought you would give you an

807
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:22,060
easier question there.
I live in Queens, um,

808
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,220
which is I guess the word is, yeah, it is,

809
00:49:25,221 --> 00:49:28,970
I believe the voice most
diverse, uh, neighborhood.

810
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:33,850
Now I'm 64. I'm lucky on battery.
However, when I was growing up,

811
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:38,760
I grew up in India where, uh, I
had my own beatings about that,

812
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,950
that before a nineties,
um,

813
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,410
I would go and do each
other like neighbors homes,

814
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,510
whether they were Hindus and Muslims,
doesn't matter.

815
00:49:47,511 --> 00:49:51,530
I would go into a mosque right
away without much issues.

816
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,320
Suddenly I realize something happened.
Everybody was talking about,

817
00:49:54,321 --> 00:49:59,321
it was like 91 92 and then we stopped
going to each of their houses unless they

818
00:49:59,721 --> 00:50:00,890
were the same religion.

819
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:06,200
We stopped going to across the mosque
and dumpers something happened and I

820
00:50:06,201 --> 00:50:10,550
realize, oh, some Moscow's to
[inaudible] 91 and the God issue.

821
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,170
And then that segregation, to my surprise
when I went back a couple of years ago,

822
00:50:15,171 --> 00:50:16,220
he's still there.
Yeah.

823
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,320
So now that actually I taught
like somehow in my mind I had ah,

824
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,950
that's the temporary, it will go away when
no, across the generations still there.

825
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,750
So segregation has been, they
just stay. That's what my take is,

826
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,660
unless you do something about it.
So

827
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:32,791
what does it end?

828
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:35,670
People ask us all the time and I get off
all the time with someone who works on

829
00:50:35,671 --> 00:50:36,810
this stuff.
I get asked all the time like,

830
00:50:36,811 --> 00:50:39,290
do you think that just
the rise of Gen y right,

831
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,590
that the Gen y in the United States as
the most diverse generation in it and had

832
00:50:43,591 --> 00:50:46,790
three most well educated generation in
history that like that's just going to

833
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:49,020
like change things, right? Um,

834
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,080
I don't know that it does automatically.

835
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,880
Like I actually think it does take work
and I'm glad you mentioned the religious

836
00:50:56,881 --> 00:50:59,130
piece. They, I wrote a little
bit about that. But you know,

837
00:50:59,131 --> 00:51:01,800
that's another place where like
we make choices every day, right?

838
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:05,100
About the kinds of searches that we go
to and whether or not we're choosing

839
00:51:05,101 --> 00:51:08,490
churches and then a guide that are,
you know,

840
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,510
are mosques that are welcoming and
inclusive or not. Um, you know,

841
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,660
I think in the Christian community,
especially because, you know, you could,

842
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:20,580
there are so many different sort of,
there's just a thousand flavors, right?

843
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,230
Uh, that, that question of like,

844
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:24,960
do you think churches that are
more diverse or lots of earth,

845
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,870
and it's another way that we make
those threats with birth families and,

846
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:31,020
you know, create conversation
or not. But, um, you know,

847
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,710
these are very closely held beliefs
and people get very uncomfortable when

848
00:51:34,711 --> 00:51:38,220
they're closely, I'll believe, or
in any way challenge. But I mean,

849
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:42,450
not the parality of our nation. I'm like,
how do we not do that? Like, I dunno.

850
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,040
And you know, the, in the film, like
there's been so much on that. Anyway,

851
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:49,160
I was just going to, sorry,
did you have anything else?

852
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:53,610
So on that,
I think with four year olds,

853
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,030
we'd have an easier shot there
because then they had, they have,

854
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,220
they can keep three things in their
mind. Right? And if they decide the hey,

855
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:05,760
um, if they talked to everybody and
uh, Jack with everybody had been,

856
00:52:05,761 --> 00:52:06,980
that's the best star.

857
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:10,700
So I have a four year old and he asked
me something that he wants to be a guard.

858
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:13,230
Like he wants you to be best. He
wants to be that. I thought, Oh yeah,

859
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:17,490
you can choose the board has come to this,
you can be whatever you want later on,

860
00:52:17,491 --> 00:52:21,000
but not now let's figure out
what you wanted to be. Um,

861
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,270
so if he asks me how is like
meeting different people,

862
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,890
are different kinds of people is useful?
Like how is diversity useful to him?

863
00:52:28,891 --> 00:52:31,690
And you have to say only three things
because it's a four year old, right?

864
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:35,460
They can't remember more than
three. Hey, what would you say? How,

865
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:39,400
why would diversity be useful to
you growing up later in life? Okay.

866
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,670
I took her to a four year old.
You're saying here for y'all,

867
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:43,850
I don't know what to do say,

868
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,713
but

869
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,530
yeah, four year old love
[inaudible] what would your thing,

870
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:57,390
um, I love that question.
So if my four year old ass,

871
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:02,250
I just want to make clear with my four
year old asked me why is diversity

872
00:53:02,251 --> 00:53:03,084
important?

873
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:07,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Useful
to them growing up,

874
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,140
crossing the Timnath Lane.

875
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:19,200
My honest answer if she said that right
now, so I'm a mat, I'm an actress,

876
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:23,940
so I have to like imagine that I'm doing
a new playground.

877
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,090
No, you're too pretty. Uh, no, I uh,

878
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,330
I would say baby
like don't,

879
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,790
don't know. I wouldn't say that because
we need more time to prepare. I do,

880
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:40,243
but I would,

881
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:45,260
I would really say the more
experience we have of life,

882
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,550
the more,

883
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,180
the more we know of the more
people and the more experiences,

884
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:58,590
the more compassion we have,
the more we can serve.

885
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,270
And then I would give a concrete example
because that's all like bad me, man,

886
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,190
my man, my man. So that I,

887
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,360
what I'm thinking about right now
is what's the concrete example?

888
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,340
And I would,

889
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:19,410
I would probably get a
book about two kids, like,

890
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,940
and I'm sure they had their summer
reading this beautiful book about like,

891
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:29,210
you walk a mile in my shoes and I walk
a mile in yours and how do we then

892
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,910
appreciate each other's lives?

893
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:36,150
And it really is what
Lauren was talking about,

894
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:40,770
about like make friends with that
super conservative guy that you don't

895
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:45,390
understand. Because if you
understand him in that process,

896
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:48,540
he'll understand you.
I was actually thinking,

897
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:52,080
I dare anyone to come make this with me.
I want to make like a little,

898
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:55,860
it's sort of like a Saturday night
live sketch up like we're friend,

899
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,790
you're conservative white now. Um, like,

900
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:05,570
because for me that's really
hard sometimes because
their opinions are so not

901
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:10,200
mine. And I can, I,

902
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:15,201
can I have my own unconscious bias
about that and how do we create more

903
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:22,701
situations where we're in rooms together
where we're understanding and then can

904
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:27,500
have compassion for each other. I'll
say like my, my little wrap up without,

905
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,590
I'm sorry about, um, what I talk about,

906
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:36,830
and this is a direct quote from Effie
Brown who's an amazing producer and she

907
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:42,771
talks about three things you can do to
change things for women are higher mentor

908
00:55:42,871 --> 00:55:46,560
and in bath.
So hire more women,

909
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,410
investing in women.

910
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,260
And if you can't do either
of those mentor. Yup.

911
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,590
So we're out of time.

912
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,410
I don't have all the answers and I
definitely didn't write the book because I

913
00:55:58,411 --> 00:56:00,060
had all the answers.
Um,

914
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,900
I tried to ask some questions that I hope
we'll all keep thinking about it and I

915
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:07,020
would really, I would love for you
to buy the book for free leave. Um,

916
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:10,250
but I would especially love for you to
continue this conversation, you know,

917
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,660
through social channels and
with your friends and online.

918
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:16,440
Like we need this conversation
now maybe more than ever before,

919
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:21,441
certainly in our lifetime and we need
it thoughtfully and inclusively and,

920
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,750
um, we need to bring our best to it. Um,

921
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,710
because this is some of
the most complicated and
difficult challenges of our

922
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:30,610
time, and I think it takes
all of us working towards it,

923
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,710
working towards a solution
to make it better.

924
00:56:32,711 --> 00:56:37,060
So thank you so much to Karen
and to everyone in Google.
Thank you for having us.

925
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:37,960
Thank you.
