1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,100
So I'm going to start off with just a,
uh,

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,820
a small background here
at my pace as a series.

3
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:15,330
I didn't envision myself doing
this so much, but it became so,

4
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:18,780
and every time I'd do another book
at adds meaning at least to my life.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,340
And it began when I took on the
Sheryl Sandberg Lean in conversation.

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:28,110
I wanted to expand it to be more about
the range of choices we make in our life.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,710
Some people that I say are leaning in
going on the autobon full speed ahead.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,260
Others have a more winding path.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,530
And my objective was that we celebrate
all our choices and then we reserve

10
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:43,080
judgment.
And that was this book right here.

11
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,590
And so the cover is about
blue sky and open roads.

12
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:49,440
That's how we should see our world.
Blue sky and open roads.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,060
And then I thought it was done.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,530
And then the next thing that happened
was that my mother was Aylien.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,440
She was coming on to the end of her
life and I wanted to elevate the

16
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,950
conversation from focusing on
her to something more meaningful.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,900
So I asked people the question,

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,050
what's one lesson you take from your
mother and how it's impacted your life?

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,920
And that gave us a really
rich conversation. And I found
out by the way, that, uh,

20
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,970
mothers and their kids have way more
complex relationships than I probably

21
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:17,880
realized at the time.
And that was booked two.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,480
And this was about showing your
gratitude or, uh, as I say,

23
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:26,430
giving either a flower or an olive branch
as you find comfort and peace in your

24
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:30,360
relationship with your mom. So now I had
two books and the marketer in me said,

25
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:34,320
well, now you probably need to start
thinking about a tagline. Um, and,

26
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,210
but I wasn't. So, and
I thought about that.

27
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:39,900
And so what the at my pace
series is about is at its heart,

28
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,700
it's about personal stories.

29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,270
And then from there we were
able to have a conversation,

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,720
an expanded conversation. And from there,
hopefully there's emerging insights. Uh,

31
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,000
so it's stories, conversation, insights.

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,450
Now I feel like I'm having
a tagline start to happen.

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,730
And then after that, uh, I was not
quite sure what I wanted to do,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,120
but I realized that I have a
lot of millennials in my life.

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,220
I have three children and a son in law.

36
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:09,240
So I think technically I have for
millennials in my life and on good days,

37
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,610
I understand them on other days.

38
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,310
I'm sort of perplexed by the
way they frame their world.

39
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,360
But I don't fall prey to the
generalizations that we always hear about

40
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:23,330
millennials. You know, these are, these
are some of the ones, uh, you know,

41
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,330
my social media obsessed, narcissistic,
want to get there fast, you know,

42
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,340
you can imagine all the
ones that you've heard.

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,660
And I wanted to hear from them themselves,

44
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,130
how they look at their world,

45
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:40,131
what their challenges are and what we
as as baby boomers can glean from it and

46
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:44,910
also what they can share among themselves
that will help them as they find their

47
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:48,990
way. So just in terms of
the, at my pace format,

48
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,110
what happens is there are
there a thousand word pieces,

49
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,540
roughly their story oriented.

50
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,920
I give guidelines and I
helped contributors get their
pieces together as much or

51
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:01,870
as as they need. Uh, and um,

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,050
so I came up with some guidelines for
the thousand for the, for this one, Lisa,

53
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,680
who's right here was fortunate.
Shoot my first contributor.

54
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,530
She was an awesome one. Uh, there's 29.

55
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:16,180
And so what I wanted to do today is talk
about what I learned and what you do

56
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:19,870
with it. And I'm hoping that we
can have a conversation about this.

57
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,490
I would like this to be informal and I
would like you guys to ask questions or

58
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:26,080
give me your thoughts as you hear them.

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,800
So I'm going to start off by just
giving you some of the titles.

60
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,410
There's 29 pieces in here.

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,100
I'm going to give you some of the titles
to give you a feeling for what I heard.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
And I want to see whether raise your hand,

63
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:41,320
if any of these either
resonate with you or you know,

64
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,610
somebody close in your life who you
think they could have meaningful. Okay.

65
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:49,480
So these are some of the
titles, uh, a layered identity

66
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,240
when the world tells,
you know,

67
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,400
detours.

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,753
Yeah.

69
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,400
Imposter Syndrome.

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,300
Okay.

71
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,040
Finding the power of me.

72
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,470
A series of new beginnings.

73
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,250
Okay.

74
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,010
A clash of perception and reality.

75
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,970
How to love myself,

76
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,780
the start and the restart,
turning,

77
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:29,700
caring into doing
and keeping the faith.

78
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,590
So those are just some,
um,

79
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:36,591
and what was exceptional to me about
these contributors as it was a look at

80
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:42,270
their lives and the most uncurated
way, they were extremely honest. They,

81
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:46,140
uh, when you read this book, you will
see that there's a fair bit of anxiety,

82
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,700
some depression, some stress,
tremendous uncertainty, self doubt,

83
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:54,510
all the things that we, you know,
I know as a, as a baby boomer,

84
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:58,140
I have felt for years,
but our twentysomethings feel that and um,

85
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,910
and they explain where it comes from and,
and what they're doing with it.

86
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,410
Okay. So, uh, I think the way, the, the,

87
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,010
the best way for me to begin
as to describe the first
piece in the book and the

88
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,700
last piece in the book, because I think
it really frames the discussion. Will,

89
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,580
the first piece is purposeful prisons.

90
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,430
A leasee wrote that and I,
well,

91
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:24,330
one of the questions I asked these
contributors is, what is a book,

92
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,400
a poem, a song, some new,
something that resonates with you.

93
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,300
I wanted a quick insight into
the window of their soul. Uh,

94
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:36,840
so tell me what that would be. Um,
and they could or could not use it.

95
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:39,960
It didn't matter to me, but at least it
helped me to understand who they were.

96
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,890
And so we see right away
said, oh, William Wordsworth,

97
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,580
nuns fret not now. I was an English major.
I happened to like worse, worse, worse.

98
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,190
But I did not recognize that poem.
Um,

99
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,130
and it's a wonderful poem
and in nuns front, not,

100
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,640
it's really about how the
constraints in our life,

101
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:59,000
sometimes us purpose and meaning.

102
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,310
And so Wordsworth discusses how nuns
like convents help poets like Sinus,

103
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,740
they're 14 lines.
And how,

104
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,370
while some people might find
those boundaries constraining,

105
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,560
infringing upon the things you want to do,

106
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,100
Wardsworth argues that those
boundaries are purposeful.

107
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,300
They're purposeful prisons that,

108
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,330
that anchor you and lacy who describes
being a software engineer at Ballet

109
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:27,950
Dancer and an observant Jew has
plenty of boundaries in her life.

110
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,700
But for Lacey, those boundaries
are purposeful. So she
makes the case for that,

111
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:36,650
those anchors, those very strong
anchors being a good thing in her life.

112
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,430
The last piece in the book is called color
outside the lines by Kimberly Roatan.

113
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,870
She is the oldest of the contributors.

114
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,760
She went to UC University of
Chicago. Law School, did really well,

115
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,230
had her pick of jobs at law
firms when she graduated.

116
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,610
Uh, deeply cares about the
social issues of our day,

117
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:01,880
wants her life to be dedicated
to the social issues of the day.

118
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,820
And so she picked what
she thought was the most,

119
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,170
one of the most progressive left leaning
law firms that she could find that she

120
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:13,610
could work in. Um, but it didn't last
very long for her. Even that did not work.

121
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,950
And so she leaves the law firm and she
goes and she fights for the social issues,

122
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:22,910
which include immigration rights, sex
worker rights, healthcare advocacy.

123
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,420
And she finds her way to today she is the
assistant director at northeastern law

124
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:32,930
school for policy. Uh, but
in the course of all that,

125
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:37,700
she discovered that she loves to paint.
She loved to dance. She, she came out,

126
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,590
there's a whole sort of sharing of her
life and a sharing of who she wants to

127
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,010
be, who she is. And so the,

128
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,050
there aren't too many boundaries for her.
For her,

129
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,350
it's about expressing yourself
and being true to who you are.

130
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,630
And so we have on one side,
purposeful prisons on another side,

131
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,920
color outside the lines,

132
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:02,210
which she literally as she paints with
her fingers and figuratively as she makes

133
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:07,140
choices in her life that defy some
of the more traditional choices. Um,

134
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,580
so we had that on the other end.
And so the question is, you know,

135
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,010
for these contributors,
for these 29,

136
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:16,130
where do I fit in and
what are my challenges?

137
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,960
And finding that place
where I can find a piece,

138
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,230
a truth to who I am, um, support
for the things I believe in.

139
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,400
I think that's the challenge. By the way,
I also was able to survey this group,

140
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,091
which is,

141
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:33,110
this is the first of the books that I
surveyed my contributors in the previous

142
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:35,210
one that just took their
stories and went from there.

143
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:38,120
But I wanted a little bit
of data because after all,

144
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:43,020
we live in a world of data and that's what
I do in my day job anyway. Uh, so, um, I,

145
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:47,140
I, I ended up, I read through these
stories working in the stories and I,

146
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,070
as I stepped back and look at them,

147
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,470
I found that they're basically
sort of five parts of,

148
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,210
of I what I think the contributor has
had to sort of conquer and manage to get

149
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:00,000
to a place that they felt good about.
Okay.

150
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,060
So the first one is just
about being healthy.

151
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,240
It's about being emotionally healthy.
It's about being physically healthy.

152
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,800
It's about feeling like you're standing
firm on your own two feet with energy

153
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:15,150
and purpose and ready to go.
That actually doesn't sound that hard,

154
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,130
but it's obviously it's very hard. And
uh, one of the early pieces I worked on,

155
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,410
uh,
was um,

156
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,370
a woman named Pam Nofx and she
writes a piece called heal thyself.

157
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,760
And what happened was I met her
sister and her sister said to me,

158
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:33,090
you need to get, you need to get ahold
of my sister. She has a piece in her.

159
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:36,810
It'd be very helpful, very therapeutic.
I think you should talk to her.

160
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:40,680
So I did talk to her and I'm just going
to read you the beginning of her piece

161
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,230
healed myself. Uh, she's 28,

162
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,800
so she's older and in this
range of 20 somethings,

163
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,980
I found that the older
you were in your 20s,

164
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,280
the more you had to share or more
willing you were to share what you had to

165
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:55,140
offer.
So this is what Pam says.

166
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,740
In June of 2017,

167
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:02,040
I was a bridesmaid for
the fifth time in my life,

168
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,410
I bought another expensive dress,

169
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,440
got my hair and makeup done and smiled
as I walked down the aisle on the

170
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,420
happiest day of someone else's life.

171
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,130
I looked around the room with this group
of friends and realize how far we had

172
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,270
come since high school,

173
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,040
six or the group of 10 were married
with one more couple on the way in a few

174
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,160
months. One couple was expecting a
child, another had moved to Sanford,

175
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:27,570
Connecticut and gotten a dog.

176
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,290
Most everyone was becoming
established in their careers.

177
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,960
These people were dear friends
and we shared a common history.

178
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:38,961
But in that moment I couldn't help but
feel pretty far from their realities.

179
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,430
So what happens to Pam is she
continues to do her her life,

180
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,870
but she, um, she looks at herself all
the time and feels like she's not,

181
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,510
she's not attractive.
She wants to eat less.

182
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:55,680
She ends up having some kind of an
eating disorder. Her Ma, she cries,

183
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:58,940
her mother says to her, we have to get
you help. This is not, uh, this is,

184
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,590
this is not okay.
And Pam agrees.

185
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,840
And so through a combination of therapy,
meditation and Yoga,

186
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,730
she finds her piece and she
understands herself far better.

187
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:17,090
And what she says at the end of our piece
is that the hard work of her twenties

188
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,880
has paid off for her and has laid the
groundwork for what she thinks will be a

189
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:25,260
much more positive, much,
much more energizing.

190
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,280
30 so she's looking forward to taking
advantage of the foundation she's laid.

191
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:32,940
And what she really wants to do is
help others who suffer like her.

192
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,570
She became a licensed yoga instructor.
She's going through other training.

193
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,140
And what she intends to do is to pay it
forward because she knows how long and

194
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:44,280
how hard her path was and she
wants to be able to help others.

195
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,600
So step one is being healthy and
you'll see when you read the book,

196
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:51,210
there's a set, the second piece in
the book is called sliding doors.

197
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:56,170
It's about a young man in college who
falls off a balcony and has serious trauma

198
00:11:56,171 --> 00:12:00,520
and has to relearn. His
gait, has to relearn. So many
things we take for granted.

199
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:04,180
And so he's also looking back at his
life and the sliding doors because it was

200
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,000
going this way and then it went
that way. And so, you know,

201
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:11,890
all of a sudden he sees his life very
differently and he has the same idea which

202
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,320
is get healthy and then
bit pay this forward.

203
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,740
And all the people in his life who have
helped him, which is quite a large team,

204
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,970
feel that,
uh,

205
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,470
there's now new meaning in their life
as they realize sort of what you,

206
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,710
what you can do for others and also the
fight that people have to have in them.

207
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,560
So, uh, healthy is job one.
Um, but the second one,

208
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,100
which I saw some hands raise
on is about managing rejection.

209
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,330
And for these 20 somethings,
uh, you know, they grew up,

210
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,690
like many of them grew up in families
where they're told they can do everything.

211
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,100
The world's your oyster.
You know,

212
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:48,940
we tried to groom them for the most
possible successful outcomes ever.

213
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,150
We tried to make sure that they weren't
experienced too much failure of any

214
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:55,570
failure. We tried to make
their life just smooth as silk.

215
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,930
And of course,
that's not the way the world is.

216
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,970
And so I'm talking to a journalist,
his name is Sam Tabachnick. He works.

217
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,920
He worked for the Washington Post. He was
a contractor and a list. Very happy one.

218
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,660
Uh, they told him, well,

219
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,780
probably when the contract runs out
we'll be able to get you signed on as an

220
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:18,220
employee. But as you can imagine,
it did not happen. And uh,

221
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,670
so now he's faced with trying to
figure out what he's going to do next.

222
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,740
And you probably know that journalism is
not the easiest places to land another

223
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:27,700
job,
you know.

224
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,200
And so he sent email after
email and has coffee.

225
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,300
He talks about how many cups of coffee
he has to try to network to Atlanta,

226
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,300
his next job and all.
He feels his rejection facing him.

227
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:43,690
And he writes this, he says, frankly,

228
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:48,100
I just wasn't used to this kind
of repeated rejection growing up.

229
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,530
I might get rejected from
the travel soccer team,

230
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,320
but there was always another team to join.

231
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,500
I went to schools where
the teachers nurtured us.

232
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,990
Pretty much everyone got A's and B's.

233
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,990
There wasn't a need
for a 10 of tough love.

234
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,150
So the question is what to do next?
Because he wasn't finding a job.

235
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,160
He needed both money and purpose in
his life. So he became a Lyft driver.

236
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,680
This was not anything he ever imagined.
Uh,

237
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,420
he doesn't actually love driving cause
he finds a traffic to be very burdensome.

238
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,440
But what he discovered was that
when he was driving people,

239
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,360
he loved talking to them and he lived
almost interviewing them to see what was

240
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:31,390
going on with them, what they
were about. And in that way,

241
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,560
it confirmed for him the
journalism and reporting.

242
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,450
And it is really what he's about.

243
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,340
And so he continued to be a Lyft driver
until he found his job in journalism at

244
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:46,170
another job for a smaller paper.
Uh, as I ended up being, you know,

245
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,300
he worked his way through it. But
when the world tells, you know,

246
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,880
it's about not expecting the
rejection you're about to feel.

247
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,380
And I feel that was a theme that made
it through so many pieces in this book,

248
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,130
how to manage rejection,
the surprise of it all,

249
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,770
how to pick yourself up and
just keep on going forward.

250
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,030
So in terms of, uh, the,
the, the, the steps that,

251
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,530
the challenges that these contributors
had to conquer to get to a good place.

252
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,570
One was emotional and physical health.

253
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,050
Another one was understanding
and experiencing rejection
and being able to make

254
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,960
your way through it. Um,
but there's a third one,

255
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,290
which I think both the
parents and the kid share,

256
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,420
and that's called the
burden of expectations.

257
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,440
We expect so much from them and they
expect so much from themselves too.

258
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,990
And when you live under
these high expectations,

259
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,390
there's almost the only one place to go.
Uh,

260
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,270
and so I'm going to read
you another piece that I,

261
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,770
at the beginning of another piece.
So back to my asking people, uh,

262
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:46,490
what is a song, a poem, a book,

263
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:51,410
something that resonates with you and a
piece called a clash of perception and

264
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:54,620
reality.
Gabriele rams starts the following.

265
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,860
He says there's a delightfully smoked
scene in season four of the office where

266
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:04,640
Ryan Howard has been promoted to the
corporate office in New York City.

267
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,220
Ryan's climb up the ladder. It means
he will supervise his former boss,

268
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,000
Michael Scott,
clearly pleased with his progress.

269
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,490
Ryan's looks into the camera and says,

270
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:22,010
people keep calling me a wunderkind. I
don't even know what that means. I mean,

271
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,390
I know what it means.
It means I'm very successful at your age,

272
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,550
so it makes sense. And uh,
and then Gabrielle says,

273
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,990
I thought I was just like,

274
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:36,770
Ryan's skipping a dozen
steps on my way up.

275
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,670
I crave the satisfaction of
being considered a wunderkind.

276
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,180
He goes to work for a political newspaper,

277
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,350
he's super excited and he gets to
be in on the issues of the day.

278
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,550
He gets to me senators,

279
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,130
he gets to have all these super
cool conversation to things.

280
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,910
But then he realizes that she was
having dinner with his father who was a

281
00:16:55,911 --> 00:17:00,140
journalist. So what are you really doing
where you know, we'll kind of work.

282
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:02,360
Are you doing,
where do you feel you're adding value?

283
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,220
The more he sorta of peels back the
layers, the more deflated he feels,

284
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,410
the less he likes the newspaper.

285
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,350
And he realizes this isn't
really a job for him.

286
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,520
It's not even a career track for him
and he is now disengaged from that.

287
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:21,550
He's going to go to a public policy
program in the fall and he hopes to enter

288
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:25,370
into a career of politics. It comes
from a very good place. He says,

289
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:26,750
I want to give more to the world.

290
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,770
Then I had a little more to the world
than I take back and so it's all good.

291
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,930
But his expectation of
being the Wunderkind,

292
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,440
that kid who would be able
to exceed all expectations,

293
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,620
that's a hard one to manage.
It's a hard one as parents,

294
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,760
when you place that on your kids,

295
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:44,390
and it's a hard one for kids who had their
own expectations that are quite large

296
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,480
and I think it doesn't always come
from a bad place in the parents.

297
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:50,100
We know that we know our kids and we
think know we want the best for them,

298
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,360
but it ends up being in a bad place
because it ends up putting pressure that

299
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:55,530
they already feel upon themselves anyway.

300
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,340
So when you decide to
go do fill in the blank,

301
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,350
what will you hope to get out of it?

302
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,440
If it turns out to be a path
that's not meaningful for you,

303
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:09,030
how will you know what's, uh,
a milestone, a measurement,

304
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:10,470
something that you hope to get out of it.

305
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:14,820
That's what's the marker that you hope
to see. And if you don't see that,

306
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,410
you know,
what would you do?

307
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,000
I think the problem is when we start to
place our answers on them and they're

308
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,920
not their answers. But, um,

309
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,090
I think it's tricky and maybe we have
some young 20 somethings maybe in this

310
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:31,210
room. Does anybody want to
offer any thoughts as to what,

311
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,760
what we could do, the older generation to
be a little more effective on this one?

312
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,740
Uh, I'm probably actually not even old
enough for this book to apply because I'm

313
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:41,550
only 19.
Um,

314
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,400
but I think one of the things that
a parent should do is probably,

315
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,390
um,

316
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,390
let their kid have other role models
other than like just parents and relatives

317
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:53,834
and stuff like that.

318
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,730
Because that's like a really good way
for the kid to be very isolated and have

319
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:00,470
like,
just,

320
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,790
they want to live the expectations that
their parents have for them. Right.

321
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,130
So other role models and really allowing
their kids to find other ways to get

322
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:13,480
their guidance. Yeah, exactly.
That's a great suggestion.

323
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,870
So the other part about that is why
don't you have this burden of expectation

324
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:21,610
and you'd go ahead and you decide
you're going to try to go live up to it.

325
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,661
What do you do?

326
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,560
And so they're contributors in this
book do a series of what I call

327
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:30,530
experimentation and wandering as
they try to find their way. Uh,

328
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,870
there is a piece by Carla Moody called
a series of new beginnings and she just,

329
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,500
she describes graduating college,
having no money,

330
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,850
having to get a job as a volunteer,
uh,

331
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,800
living with her aunt so she
can basically have free living.

332
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,030
And during lunchtime when people
might be able to do something,

333
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,420
she just wanders the street
walking because walking is
free and she loves water.

334
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,500
She's a Pisces,
she says.

335
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:02,880
So she looks at water fountains and she
entertains herself in the cheapest free

336
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,730
way possible. And from there she
ends up names. She just had, okay,

337
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:09,100
I need some money. She gets
a nanny job. From there.

338
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:12,220
She goes to work for Groupon
from their digital media.

339
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:14,920
She just wanders from one job to the next,

340
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,870
then she leaves Chicago and she goes to
Colorado. Um, and the last I spoke to her,

341
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:23,200
she's, you know, she said
every step along the way,

342
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,310
she learns something about what she
likes and what she doesn't and she now

343
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,190
understands. And this next job
she thinks she'll last longer.

344
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:33,580
And do you think she'll have a little
longer road on it but a wandering and

345
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:37,150
experimentation is the process.
And two things about that.

346
00:20:37,151 --> 00:20:41,050
One is that I think if we were to repair
our high school kids and our college

347
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:46,051
kids for this is a trajectory that many
golf go through versus thinking they're

348
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:48,670
going to have a straight shot.
I think that would be helpful.

349
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,420
And I think if we ourselves as parents
prepare ourselves for this trajectory

350
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:54,910
that's windy and has starts and stops,

351
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,780
then that's helpful too because we placed
less demands on them and we place less

352
00:20:58,781 --> 00:20:59,800
anxiety in ourselves,

353
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,010
which just ends up meeting and everybody
feels the anxiety that we feel.

354
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:09,270
So that's, that's an example, but
I'm on the experimentation piece. Uh,

355
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,810
I want to tell a story. There's a sudden
it was really funny. So as you know,

356
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:14,441
I asked,
you know,

357
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:19,090
give me something that I
source of something that means
something to you, a poem,

358
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:20,260
a song book.

359
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,580
And so I talked to this
man named Aaron Schoenfeld,

360
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:28,780
who I've never met and he
says to me, Oh, that's easy.

361
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,290
I love chem moves,
interpretation of Sisyphus.

362
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,050
Wow. Ken Mus interpretation
assists this. So it turns out,

363
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:42,580
let me give you a little background on,
on Aaron. He went to go work at city year.

364
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,280
He graduated college.
He thought it'd be a basketball player,

365
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:48,040
but his basketball career
wasn't as long as he thought.

366
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,520
So he studied anthropology and
he's all about giving back.

367
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:55,000
And he ended up joining city
year and going to Tulsa to teach.

368
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,120
Now he always high
expectations of what happened.

369
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,180
We went to Tulsa to go teach
high schoolers, but he said, um,

370
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,930
here's what he found. So he starts
off and he says, uh, that, um,

371
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,450
I spend most of my day mentoring and
tutoring students who are struggling with

372
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:12,760
attendance,
behavior and classwork.

373
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,240
I pull students out of class to
give them individualized support.

374
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,990
I met biweekly with students to discuss
behavior and attendance goals for the

375
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,750
week.
My services spelled feudal.

376
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:27,550
I could feel my activist spirit dwindling.
And so then what happens?

377
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,260
He, um, he realized, he
remembers, he discovers, he says,

378
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:35,620
I found out that it's tough to tell
students to do their homework when their

379
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:38,920
reason for not completing the assignment
was that they have no time in between

380
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:39,754
work.

381
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,020
They have no time in between working
to support their families and being the

382
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:46,540
primary caregiver to their young siblings.

383
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,500
So he was serving a very
impoverished, um, uh,

384
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,300
disenfranchised community and education
in the classic sense of what he was

385
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:58,720
trying to teach them was just not on.
It was not possible.

386
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,030
And so then he remembered Camou and you,
you know,

387
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,060
the mythicism business,

388
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:07,900
the boulder that you're trying to push
up and then it ends up coming down.

389
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,560
And so in the myth and in his interpret
and Campbell's interpretation,

390
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,600
the meaning is in the struggle to continue
pushing up and he says to fight the

391
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:20,590
nihilistic tendencies and woe is
futile and you have to find meaning.

392
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:25,360
And the in the every day grind of doing
the job and moving things forward and

393
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,090
the challenge of it all versus
the outcome of it all. And so, uh,

394
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,720
he says,
come and can't move.

395
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,020
The most important thing is that we
continue to believe in the world and in

396
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:39,310
ourselves. And in the struggle there was
meaning. So he completely reframes his,

397
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,100
his job and he alters his methods.

398
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:45,740
I had changed to more practical approach
hoping to meet students closer to where

399
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:48,050
they were instead of
where I wanted them to be.

400
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,970
And he describes what he does and he says,

401
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,000
all of a sudden the students
were improving their
attendance, their behavior,

402
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,030
their skills, and he says,
all was not exhausted.

403
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:59,510
My boulder awaiting me every morning,
but he was okay with it.

404
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:02,690
That was the challenge and
the value was in that push.

405
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,730
And so I think that experimentation is
just part of the process and that I'm

406
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,930
just like Wah Wah with Aaron Schoenfeld
and with Carla Moody, you know,

407
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:12,441
you have to,

408
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:16,280
you have to understand and expect the
fact that it's going to be sort of a fits

409
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:20,240
and starts and a lot of
learning along the way. So, um,

410
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,790
the last thing I want to
talk about is affirmation.

411
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:26,060
So you go through all this process,
you deal with rejection,

412
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:29,660
you're going to hell and
it's not sequential, right?
But you deal with rejection.

413
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:34,090
You've got yourself relatively in a
healthy place. You, uh, you know, you,

414
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,430
you manage your expectations and
or your family's expectations.

415
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,200
You're figuring out what you want to do.

416
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:44,000
But at the end game is that you can affirm
what you're doing and you as the one

417
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:45,950
of the contributors
says how to love myself,

418
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,370
that you really affirm what you're about
and then it has meaning to you and that

419
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:52,940
you can feel positive and go forward
with this, whatever your mission is.

420
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,360
So I asked her Steinberg as a comedian
and she's 28 years old and she is used to

421
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:02,960
being, when she gets on stage,
sometimes it's a friendly audience,

422
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,050
sometimes that's not a friendly audience.
You work hard to even get on stage.

423
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:09,170
She was on a Sitcom series
for a while that got canceled.

424
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,700
She just dealt with a series of
rejections that makes it hard for her to

425
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:17,150
continue to move forward. And yet there
was nothing else she wants to do in life,

426
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:18,410
but comedy and entertainment.

427
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,460
So she goes into therapy to sort of
work your way through depression.

428
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,620
And I'm going to read
you the story that she,

429
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:27,680
that her therapist tells her and I want
to take from you guys and whether this

430
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:31,910
would be comforting to you.
Um, I think is curious.

431
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,340
One day my therapist spent our entire
session telling me this long story about a

432
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:40,190
movie called Queen of the Nile,
which I had never seen.

433
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,910
It's about a missionary who goes
to Africa. Somehow the mission,

434
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,690
but missionary and a man end up on a
small boat and they sail for safety.

435
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,770
They both die on the boat after
a series of terrible events.

436
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,990
And right before the end of the movie,

437
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:57,920
the camera zooms out and reveals that
they were only a couple of feed from

438
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:02,600
safety. My therapist told me
that woman was me. Okay, so stop.

439
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:04,880
First of all,
would that make you feel better?

440
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,010
Hands up if it makes you feel better
to know that you're only a couple,

441
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,130
that the shoreline was right
there next to you. It's,

442
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,750
it's hard for me to imagine. Okay.
But here's what she says now I,

443
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,910
she said I was feeling desperate.
She said,

444
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:26,390
now I think go to a therapist
to her or him recap on movie,

445
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:30,200
but somehow it low as I was and feeling
assessment and I was hearing the story

446
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:33,950
brought me a glimmer of hope.
My take,

447
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:36,290
when you are in a moment
that is difficult and gloomy,

448
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:41,291
sometimes it helps to hear someone else
say you are so close and you can't even

449
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,980
see it.
So for her,

450
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,220
that story emboldened her and she felt
like there is hope that shoreline's right

451
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:54,060
next to her. And she kept on and she, uh,
she's actually doing very well. She's, uh,

452
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,780
she's on a series of shows and
comedy is going on and, but she,

453
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:59,820
she uses that as a
moment and she realized,

454
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:03,720
she asked it really just affirm herself
and remind herself does she is good. Her,

455
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:08,490
her skills are good. She can get there
if she wants to. Okay. Thank you so much.

456
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,160
Okay.
