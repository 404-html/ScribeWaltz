1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,190
Thanks so much. I'm just, after
I started work on this book,

2
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:16,191
I went to see one of the greatest scholars
of the 17th century and he'd written

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,330
some of the finest pages about Salem
and I wanted some advice. Well,

4
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,250
I left him that day. We're standing
on the front porch of his house. Um,

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,080
he added another little piece of advice
pretty much as an afterthought. Um,

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,880
he said, I should probably warn you
that when you write about witchcraft,

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,320
really strange things happen to you.
Um, and I kind of forgot about that.

8
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,110
Like the comment disappeared in the
air and I went on to research the book,

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,980
write the book. I finished it more or
less on schedule, kind of more or less,

10
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:48,420
maybe sort of approximately on schedule
at the publisher was really happy with

11
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,860
it and they were even happier when they
learned that publisher's weekly was

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,480
going to do a profile of me this summer,
um,

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,430
with which they would run a full bleed
full page picture. And indeed they did.

14
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:01,140
And here's what it looked like.

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,540
So as you may notice that
Stacey Schiff is not, I, um,

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,501
thanks to Twitter.

17
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,340
It took me about 90 seconds to figure out
that it's Amy Stewart, a novelist too.

18
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,180
I've never met.

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,240
She does have a book out this fall about
which I'm thinking maybe I could cross

20
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:20,241
promote and when I asked my publisher
to send me this page so I could show

21
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:23,400
people what strange things happen
to you when you work on witchcraft.

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,540
I also asked them to send me the
table of contents. Um, and here it is.

23
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,120
I don't know if you can read it, but, um,

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,730
essentially I was rather surprised
to learn that after four years in the

25
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:36,720
archives unearthing and deciphering
and squinting at documents,

26
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,880
corralling my imagination, the hiring
fact checkers, I had written a novel, um,

27
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,570
saw strange things obviously do happen
to you when you work on witchcraft.

28
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,520
This is not a book of fiction.
Um, instead it's a temp,

29
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,340
an attempt to grapple with exactly what
happened in eastern Massachusetts in

30
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:58,341
1692 among the loop iest really
certifiably strangest moments in American

31
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:02,370
history. Um, seller may
qualify as the best known,

32
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,470
at least understood chapter in our past,

33
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,790
partly because it seems so improbable
and partly because it comes to us through

34
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,850
Hawthorn and through Arthur Miller
who were in fact writing fiction.

35
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,320
Here we are halfway between Plymouth
Rock and Paul revere and suddenly

36
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:19,590
everything just goes
screamingly off the rails. Um,

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,780
allows them as well also make clear
in the course of nine months. Um,

38
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,010
we go from one very deep one kind of
story to a very different kind of story is

39
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:31,680
a tragedy to which we go back regularly.

40
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,740
A few corners of American history
have been so often explore it.

41
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:40,190
And if you don't believe me, take a look
at this. Here's my local libraries, um,

42
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,860
stack of 17th century American history.

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,700
So you can imagine me crawling my way
from eating my way from one end to the

44
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,210
other. Um, this, the other
side is my office shelf.

45
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:54,270
When I finished writing the book,
you can see there at the very top there,

46
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:56,700
those little low classical
library of volumes.

47
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:00,160
Those were leftovers from the
Cleopatra Years. And I'm just,

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,851
I've always wanted to,

49
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:04,210
what Cicero thought about being a wedged
between the puritans on both side of

50
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:09,010
him. There Salem is a little
bit our national campfire tail.

51
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:12,310
It's one of the rare moments
in our history when the
candles are knocked out and

52
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:14,800
everyone seems to be
groping around in the dark.

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,250
That's where all good
stories begin in the dark.

54
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:23,050
We imagined most vividly and we believe
most fervently it's in the dark and we

55
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,540
contemplate our mistakes
and wrestle with our fears.

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,970
In the dark goes the Italian proverb,

57
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,160
every cat is a leopard and if you read
the court papers at 17th Century Essex

58
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,990
County,
which I spent a lot of time doing,

59
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,230
you begin to notice that the
new Englander lived very much,

60
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:41,260
very attentively and very
apprehensively in the dark.

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,340
Women tend to stumble into their beds
to find strange men sleeping there.

62
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,960
Men trip home through the
night to discover that
familiar landmarks have moved

63
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,480
and then people get lost
in their own backyards.

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,040
Young men report that they're weak kneed
at the thought of riding home in the

65
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,660
night to their families after sundown.

66
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,080
And when the devil offers to
accompany them, they accept his offer.

67
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,890
I read every 17th century account of the
New England merch of the wolves howling

68
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,600
in the distance and the
lurking native Americans.

69
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,160
But it took me a really long time to
figure out how dark dark truly could be.

70
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,330
And in truth, it took me until this,
this is midtown Manhattan in 2012, um,

71
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,910
in the wake of Hurricane Sandy,

72
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,640
I was driving some friends
home to their home downtown.

73
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:28,120
We were up town and we had electricity
and suddenly all those accounts of the

74
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:31,720
New England wilderness made sense.
I mean, you couldn't see anything.

75
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,930
You could truly become
disoriented, um, in your own yard.

76
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,150
And hence the line in
chapter one of the book,

77
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:41,980
The Sky Over New England was crow Black
Pitch Black Bible black, so black.

78
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:46,090
It could be difficult at night to keep
to the path so black that a line of trees

79
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:50,590
might freely migrate to another location
or that you might find yourself pursued

80
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,320
after nightfall by a rabid black hog,

81
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,370
leaving you to crawl home
bloody and disoriented on
all fours. That's by the way,

82
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:01,840
from the court testimony,
the basic facts of Salem are simple.

83
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,410
In early 60,
92 over a particularly cold winter,

84
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,890
a nine and an 11 year old girl
began to shutter and scream.

85
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,630
They happened to have been the niece and
daughter of the Salem Village Minister

86
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,490
Samuel Parris. Here he is,
um, he would have been in his
late thirties. At the time.

87
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,170
The cousins complained that something
bitten choked them. Their bodies twisted.

88
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,080
They would attempt to fly through
the air and climbed down wells.

89
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,560
We have lots of descriptions of the,
of the afflicted girls,

90
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:32,830
the bewitched girl's symptoms. Um,
but we obviously have no image.

91
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,020
And here's the closest
that we can really come.

92
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:40,021
This is a 19th century French text on
the phases of hysteria on the emotional

93
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:44,200
trauma and what its physical
manifestations would've looked like.

94
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,570
Remember that no one in the 17th century
distinguished between an overtaxed

95
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,550
nervous system and be Wichman.

96
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,980
The first question anyone asked in the
face of these kinds of symptoms wasn't

97
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,070
for some time would remain MIB witched.
Um,

98
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,190
it was understood that any kind of
prolonged fit had been sent by the devil.

99
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,490
And indeed within,
within a matter of weeks to other village,

100
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,650
girls begin to exhibit the same symptoms.

101
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,490
Everyone's soon learned from their
parents or from local authorities are from

102
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:18,020
Reverend Paris that they were bewitched.
And with that was the diagnosis.

103
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:20,210
You can very well imagine what came next.

104
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,960
The girls symptoms seriously
deteriorated soon enough.

105
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,300
All four of them could
reveal who'd be which thumb.

106
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,970
We don't know why they
named the names they did.

107
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,960
But when you think about it for a
second to the question, who irritates?

108
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:36,740
Who annoys you? Who unsettles
you? Who wish, who wishes you ill?

109
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,330
Every one of us has an answer.

110
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,830
And so did the girls at the
answer to that question. And 60,

111
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,910
92 was clear.

112
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:47,480
It turned out that there were not
one but three witches flying around.

113
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,380
Salem warrants went out.
At the end of February for their arrests.

114
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,680
The suspects came immediately
before the authorities.

115
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,080
Justice was very swift
in the 17th century,

116
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,810
and they were interrogated
in the manner of the day,

117
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,350
which meant that a local beggar woman,
the first woman to be deposed,

118
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,250
was asked by the justices when she
had signed a contract with the devil,

119
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,670
why she hurt the girls,
what creatures she had dispatched to do.

120
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:14,390
So those questions came to
her from very well dressed,

121
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:19,280
important men who own
significant businesses who
spoke with weight and authority.

122
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,520
The contest was asymmetric.

123
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,730
And I should say that this is a story
that has something for everyone.

124
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:28,130
And here you can see it begins
to mutate because it turns from,

125
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,650
it begins as a kind of fairy tale.
Once upon a time,

126
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:35,060
a wicked witch cast a spell on a little
girl and it turns very quickly into a

127
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:35,930
courtroom drama.

128
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:42,170
Let me talk for just a few minutes about
how witchcraft worked. Um, what exactly,

129
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,120
uh, which was, um,

130
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,540
not every 17th century new
Englander was clear on the subject,

131
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:52,400
but those who were, were exceedingly
clear to the early American,

132
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,270
which existed as plainly as did
heat or light at the early American,

133
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:59,640
which I should add, did
not look like this. Um,

134
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,100
although there is a certain wizard of Oz
theme running through the Salem story,

135
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,670
and I'll talk about that in a minute.
And nor did a 17th century,

136
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:11,810
which looked like this. This is by the
way, the original, if you can believe it,

137
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:14,270
the original wicked witch
of the West from the, um,

138
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,630
from the book that wizard of Oz.
I particularly like those, um,

139
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,630
that flying pig tail on the spats, which
are kind of unexpected for a which, um,

140
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,470
this is an early American Halloween,

141
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:28,360
which you can see that which is
came very late to, to Halloween. Um,

142
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,570
and they didn't dress and basic black
until after Margaret Hamilton and the 1939

143
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,820
wizard of Oz,
the witches,

144
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,590
a 17th century new Englander knew her
with someone who could perform unnatural

145
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:42,650
feats because if the compact that
she had signed with the devil,

146
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,510
and from that pact, she drew her power
to transform herself into cats, wolves,

147
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:50,240
rapids,
and of course rabid black hawks,

148
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,900
which could be a man or a woman
the more often she was female.

149
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,123
And she maintained them,

150
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,220
maintained a menagerie of imps or
familiars who could do her bidding.

151
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,300
And those mascots could be
turtles are weasels, um, cats,

152
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:08,130
dogs and toads are very prevalent. As
you can see here. This is a 17th century,

153
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:12,990
which who is feeding blood
to her diabolical toads. Um,

154
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,640
this is a woman who has her diabolical
familiars with her. It's her.

155
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,290
You can see her black cat,

156
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,690
of which there are a great number and
her demon familiar and Sheila's straight

157
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:28,150
to 1621 English witchcraft case. But, but
this woman actually was acquitted, um,

158
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,220
at her trial. Here's some
more diabolical familiars. Um,

159
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,670
you see that they range from
the sort of standard issue,

160
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,710
barnyard pig to rather gargoyle
like, um, fantastical creatures,

161
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,700
black cats, um, particular favorites.

162
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:48,000
They seem to have been the arch enemy
of man from the very beginning and they

163
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:51,210
turn up regularly throughout
the Salem testimony.

164
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,300
They said they've enjoyed an association
but the devil for a long time.

165
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:58,580
Black dogs turned up a lot too, but
historically English, which is, um,

166
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,240
tended to prefer feline to canine
form. This by the way, is not a,

167
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:05,490
which is familiar.
This is our family cat moose,

168
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:09,460
but I hope she's looking sort
of vaguely demonic here. Um,

169
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,260
but which signed her pact with the
devil and blood and she enchanted with

170
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:15,510
effigies and ointments.
She could be a muttering,

171
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,640
contentious malcontent or she or he
could be simply strong or unaccountably

172
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:22,440
smart,
both kinds of,

173
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:26,400
which is what turnoff in 1692
as would wealthy merchant,

174
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:29,250
as would wealthy merchants who are,
which is sea captains,

175
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:32,940
who are witches ministers and homeless
five year old girls who were witches.

176
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,700
While her power was supernatural,

177
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,700
the witches crime was a
religious one in New England.

178
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:42,960
Her target was the soul rather than
the body and her connection to the

179
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,610
convulsing Salem girls.

180
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,650
According to the legal guide on many
Salem desks in which was about to land on

181
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,250
Samuel Parris, his desk, this is
the volume by William Perkins.

182
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,470
Witchcraft when it manifests, it showed
up as senseless trances, paralyzed limbs,

183
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,460
convulsions, jaws, clamped, shot,
frothing, gnashing, and violent shaking.

184
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,790
In other words, the symptoms of the
girls in the parsonage to a tee.

185
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,660
When Massachusetts
established a legal code,

186
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,680
the first capital crime was a dollar tree.
The second was witchcraft.

187
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,530
In the years since those
laws had been codified,

188
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,940
New England had indicted about 100,
which is a quarter of whom were men.

189
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,230
They had hanged. Massachusetts,
however, had hanged only six aside,

190
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,740
the mystery of the girls symptoms
in Salem is a greater mystery.

191
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,240
Why in 1692,
the hasty and the merciless prosecution,

192
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,990
the charges were very familiar
from earlier witchcraft cases.

193
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,070
Casting spells on livestock was
a fairly common one in Salem,

194
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:45,720
which is cast spells on cattle. On Hay,
out of wagons. I must get some fireplaces.

195
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,820
They sent dishes, sailing
through the air. Um,

196
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,920
why you might ask her these
women riding on a pig. Um,

197
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,300
this is from an early English witchcraft
trial they had been at keeps women,

198
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:59,410
had been accused of be witching
the pig, um, New England,

199
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:03,220
which is do not do a great
deal of flying down chimneys.

200
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:07,270
And they do do Kirito flying down
chimneys and through apple trees.

201
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,270
And ultimately they will
fly to a satanic Sabbath.

202
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,110
But I should say the traditionally
the English which did not fly, um,

203
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,910
continent continental witches,

204
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:19,690
however we'll fly and that will give us
a clue as to what's about to happen in

205
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:22,630
Salem. And also, um, there had been,

206
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,160
there were ghosts in 1692 who tend to
flit in and out of the Salem courtroom

207
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:27,821
most,

208
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:31,780
but not all of them are women who have
come back to then judge themselves on

209
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:35,710
abusive husbands. Those two can
hook, do confess to witchcraft.

210
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,330
And there are quite a number will confess
to having flown either on the devil's

211
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:44,980
shoulders or on Poles or on branches
are on sticks. No New England,

212
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:49,670
whichever flies on a broom, I'm sorry to
say. Um, these are some English flyers.

213
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,230
Um, there seem to be recruiting
the woman on the ground here.

214
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,390
This is an 18th century woodcut.
However, as far as broomsticks go,

215
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:01,960
this one is my favorite. Leave it to a
French woman to be able to fly gracefully.

216
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:05,170
This is a 14th,
15th century French set of witches.

217
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,430
The accepted phenomenon on
witchcraft basically went like this,

218
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,620
which has existed everywhere in the world,

219
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:15,190
in every culture and how is
it possible that imagination,

220
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,110
which is so varied and so unpredictable
could deliver the same idea across all

221
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:24,370
cultures in all times? In other
words, witchcraft was so preposterous,

222
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:28,300
so improbable. It had to be true.
You just couldn't make this stuff up.

223
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,100
The first arrests in
Salem surprise nobody.

224
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:37,120
The suspect's counted among the likeliest
people to be voted off the island.

225
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,750
And let me talk just for a minute about
the next person accused the fourth

226
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:43,210
accused witch for a few reasons.

227
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:47,890
I think part of what fascinates
us about 1692 is the random,

228
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:50,020
the seeming randomness of the accusations.

229
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:54,250
What if the next knock landed on your
door? In the case of Martha Corey,

230
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:58,030
a very pious,
stiff spine farm woman in her sixties.

231
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,150
We know what happened with that.
When the knock landed on her door,

232
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:04,390
it was mid afternoon on March 12th.
Um,

233
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,590
she'd been named by a 12 year old village
girl and it surprised everyone because

234
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:12,850
she was a full church member and very
devout because she was the church deacon

235
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,150
and another man went to pay
a call as a courtesy on her.

236
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,880
And first they stopped off to see
the little girl who had accused her.

237
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,650
They asked if she could
possibly be mistaken and
could she describe what Martha

238
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,750
Corey had been wearing when she afflicted
this girl? I think the child's did.

239
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,790
She couldn't because the,
which had blinded her that morning,

240
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,020
but she would be back that evening to
torture her some more. The men rode off.

241
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:39,280
They found Martha Corey alone at her
house. She welcomed them with a smile,

242
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:44,080
but she also anticipated their question.
I know what you are come for. She said,

243
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,750
you are come to talk with
me about being a witch.

244
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,050
She was not a witch and she
couldn't stop people from gossiping.

245
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,750
How do we know all this? By the way,
this is the deposition against her, um,

246
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,820
which the two men will write out after
they've visited her with that day and

247
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:01,040
they tell her that the girl has,
um,

248
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,090
has deemed her the first
question Martha Corey asks is,

249
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,760
but does she tell you
what clothes I have on?

250
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,390
They were flabbergasted by that question
because of course it was precisely what

251
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,890
they had themselves asked.

252
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,470
And they seem to think that she had
some supernatural knowledge. Um,

253
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,590
she was sure that there
was no cause for concern.

254
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:20,870
She had nothing to do with
witchcraft as everyone knew.

255
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:24,050
She was a very devout woman.
She wasn't surprised though.

256
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:28,250
She said if the devil had recruited the
first three women, in her estimation,

257
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,500
they were malicious,
slothful people.

258
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,610
And interesting thing about Salem is
that even those who insist on their

259
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:37,790
innocence, who believe in their innocence,
think that the others are witches.

260
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:39,801
Martha Corey,

261
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:43,730
that afternoon promised that she would
open the eyes of the magistrates and the

262
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:46,310
ministers so they might
find the real witches.

263
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,370
Another comment that would
backfire within the week,

264
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,590
not only her 12 year old accuser,

265
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,950
but that girl's mother was
also afflicted a spectral.

266
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:57,590
Cory nearly tore the
older woman to shreds,

267
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:02,060
offering her a diabolical pact
to sign the warrant for Martha.

268
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,760
Cory's arrest went out immediately.
This is it.

269
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,800
She was accused of having committed
sundry acts of witchcraft on a grown woman

270
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,880
and on for youngsters. One of them
Reverend Parris, his 12 year old niece.

271
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,930
That note that you can see in the bottom
and the different ink is the Salem

272
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:21,950
constables confirmation that he's
arrested her and that she's in custody.

273
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,330
And this document is dated March 21st,
but because the sabbath was the next day,

274
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:28,640
she in fact couldn't be
arrested until Monday,

275
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,900
which left her time on Sunday to go
to church along with her accusers.

276
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,270
So before the pulpit that Sunday,

277
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,190
you have five spellbound girls and
women and one which suspect, um,

278
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,480
all of them in close proximity
in a tiny building. Um,

279
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,100
this is a reconstruction of the village
meeting house. It measured 34 by 28 feet,

280
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,620
and you can see how dark it
would have been inside. Um,

281
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,570
it wasn't always possible during the
hearings that were held here to identify

282
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:59,750
the suspects indoors. They often had
to be taken out into the daylight.

283
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,560
And when the minister began the
service, um, the march service,

284
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,920
he was interrupted by the
afflicted girls in the pews.

285
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:08,690
One pointed to the ceiling.

286
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,660
She claimed she could see Martha
Corey sitting not in her seat,

287
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,730
but up in the beams nursing a
diabolical canary. The next day,

288
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:19,790
Martha Corey returned to the
same room to defend herself.

289
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,690
It was thronged with spectators.
There was a palpable terror in the room.

290
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,440
A visiting minister said that he could
nearly make out the hammering hearts.

291
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:29,450
The raised hairs on the backs of the neck.

292
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,000
Martha Corey insisted on her innocence.

293
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,050
One asked one of the justices asked
the question that not on every mind,

294
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,530
how had she known that she would
be asked about her clothing.

295
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,290
She tried to explain,
but she was interrupted.

296
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,340
Generally 17th century courtrooms
were not orderly places.

297
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,040
The girls frantically pointed
about the room. They could see,

298
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:54,450
they said the devil whispering and Martha
Cory's ear. What did he say to you?

299
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,780
Asked the justice she had
neither seen nor heard of thing.

300
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,180
We must not believe all that these
distracted children's say she replied to

301
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:07,560
which they refresh agonists. Did she
understand the meaning of distracted us?

302
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,270
The justice?
Because by definition,

303
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:13,110
distraction was fleeting and the girls
were utterly, utterly consistent.

304
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,440
Everyone he reminded her,
understood them to be bewitched.

305
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,800
He urged her repeatedly
to confess she would not.

306
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,880
One of the interesting things about Salem
I should point out is that those who

307
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:28,260
refuse to confess, we'll hang. Um,
which is to say that the most principle,

308
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:32,130
the most noble, the most steadfast people
will end up faring the least. Well,

309
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,230
Cory was pelted with questions, none
of which she could answer. Instead,

310
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:42,180
she posed a particularly plaintiff
query herself. Can an innocent person,

311
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:45,180
she asked be guilty?
I don't know if you can see it,

312
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,960
but this is the document of that hearing.
And the first question here is, um,

313
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,760
you are now in the hands of authority.
Tell me now why you hurt these persons.

314
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,260
And she actually asks if
she can pray a request.

315
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,250
Just start asking several times to
request, which has repeatedly denied.

316
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,320
She insisted she had nothing
to do with witchcraft. Um,

317
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,020
a statement that incents the crowd.

318
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,150
The girls began to yell and to snap into
Maka replies when she bit her lip with

319
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:12,000
nervousness, teeth marks bloomed
on the arms of the girls.

320
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,330
If she clapped her hands together,
the girls were began to shutter.

321
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,150
She leaned forward.
They would crumple over an agony.

322
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,660
It seemed as if she were working
witchcraft in the courtroom itself.

323
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,190
By this time, two adult women are
bewitched and the course of the testimony,

324
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:29,670
one of them or 40 year old
woman starts to howl in pain.

325
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,550
And she says that it's Martha
Corey who's attacking her.

326
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,670
So the woman takes off her muff from
our hands and throws it across the

327
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:38,220
courtroom. At Corey, it fails to hit her.

328
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:41,970
So the woman then leans over and takes
off a shoe and lobster shoe at Martha

329
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,790
Corey and hits her squarely in the head.

330
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,360
A pin that she had stuck in one of her
victims also turns up that day in the

331
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,720
hearing room.
Um,

332
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,290
pins will tend to turn up often
in Salem Pearson cans. By the way,

333
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,100
the Puberty Essex is collection.

334
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:59,810
These were taken over the next
weeks or purportedly. So, um,

335
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,160
from the girls' hands and legs,
um,

336
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:06,060
one girl turns up with a pin puncturing
her lips so she can't testify.

337
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,350
Blood will trickle from another girl's
mouth and a red stain will appear across

338
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:15,300
her bonnet in the courtroom. How do
we know all of this from two sources?

339
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,070
Um,

340
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,800
a former village minister was on hand
that day and published his account of the

341
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,890
trials and April,
this is the title page.

342
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:26,910
You can imagine that the account of what
was happening did nothing to alleviate

343
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,440
the symptoms. And we have a lot of the
paperwork to from this particular hearing.

344
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,920
Um, this is the deposition
of one of Cory's accusers,

345
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,890
a 17 year old girl
named Elizabeth Hubbard.

346
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,640
It seemed that Martha Correa had urged
her to sign a pact with the devil.

347
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,720
She bitten and choked and pinched her
and the girl had the bruises to prove it.

348
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,070
I believe in my heart, she testifies
here than Martha. Corey is a dreadful,

349
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,670
which, and as you can see that
some of this was added later.

350
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,080
The court testimony is interesting because
it's not infrequently edited, edited,

351
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:03,750
or expanded on after the fact. This
is in the hand of Reverend Paris. Um,

352
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,380
it's the local innkeepers deposition
against Martha Corey for having tortured

353
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:11,890
the girls at the hearing. And you can
see on that second and third line,

354
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:16,060
he seems to have written out the account
before he asked his neighbor to a fixed

355
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:19,990
his name to it. And a third line,
Martha Corey that day went to jail.

356
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:21,690
She would spend the next
six months in prison,

357
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:26,500
in chains and in prison awaiting her
trial. Six days after the hearing,

358
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,920
um, Paris will deliver this sermon
in the, in the meeting house. Um,

359
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,850
you can see it's titled Christ
knows how many devils there are. Um,

360
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,040
and when I mentioned documentation, by
the way, this is as good as it gets.

361
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,630
Paris was a very meticulous,

362
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:45,220
very diligent man and this is the
finest of 17th century penmanship.

363
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,160
So I want you all to feel sorry for me.
Um,

364
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,250
it's a finger pointing sermon after this.

365
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,070
It's basically you're either
with us or you are against us.

366
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:57,040
And the community really divides
between accusers and accused.

367
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,840
People begin to remember things that they
can't explain often decades old things

368
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:02,980
that they can't explain.

369
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,550
Men Begin to see their neighbors
flying through the streets. Um,

370
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,180
the evening after the first hearing to
villagers will meet an unnatural beast on

371
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:14,470
the ground which dissolves
in the moonlight. Two or
three women they testify,

372
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,530
materialized in its place and fly away
shortly thereafter behind locked doors.

373
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,670
One of them sits up in bed when a great
gleam and a big fat cat appears in his

374
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:27,760
room. Um, if this has happened
to any of you recently,

375
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,090
please let me know afterwards.
Um,

376
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,800
all of this testimony
was store sworn on oath.

377
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,430
It's all full of tall tales unless
you happen to believe as woman.

378
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,550
One woman reported after
having bout to tell the truth,

379
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:43,120
the whole truth and nothing but the
truth that she flew on a stick with her

380
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:48,010
church deacon and two others to a satanic
baptism and that the previous Monday

381
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,120
she carried her minister in spectral
form through the air along with her along

382
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:56,740
with her having previously conferred with
her in her orchard with a satanic cap

383
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,290
again and again what working on the book.

384
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,410
I kept thinking of Dumbledore in
the seventh Harry Potter book.

385
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,500
Of course it's happening
inside your head herring,

386
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,620
but why on earth should that
mean that it's not real?

387
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,850
The first case came to trial in June.

388
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,450
The first suspect hang do week later
protesting her innocence to the end events

389
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:20,230
to moved quickly,
arrests and afflictions multiplied.

390
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,000
It was a plague that involved a hundred
witches and number that grew to 307 and

391
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:30,001
later to 500 and here's
where the courtroom drama
will mutate again now into a

392
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,510
horror horror story,

393
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:36,150
not only for those who spent months
roasting and that starving and airless

394
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,150
fedded prisons.

395
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,470
Some suspects would die there and
others in chains would give birth there.

396
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,660
By late July,

397
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:48,530
the authorities begin to piece a
tale of a diabolical sabbath, which,

398
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:52,550
which flew to from as far away as
Connecticut by various conveyances,

399
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,570
all of them to land in Salem village
and all of them part of a conspiracy not

400
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:58,970
only to subvert the church,
but to subvert the state.

401
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,220
And according to Parris his daughter,
by the way,

402
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:04,370
Martha Corey also will
attend that meeting. Again,

403
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:06,890
you can reconstruct that meeting,
um,

404
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:10,100
and these rituals from at
least 50 core confessions,

405
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,040
but we unfortunately have no
image of the diabolical Sabbath.

406
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:17,220
Here's the closest we can come. This is
a 17th century German engraving of a,

407
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:21,410
which is Sabbath. Um, it's a more decadent
production than a new England one,

408
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,450
but certain themes are familiar.

409
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:28,280
They'll remember that I said there'd been
no flying in Massachusetts before 1692.

410
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,930
Well, suddenly by the summer, everyone
in Essex County seems to be a loft.

411
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,430
Um, here's an earlier illustration
from a Swedish witchcraft epidemic.

412
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,550
And from the book you'll see why
Sweden is hugely important here.

413
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,050
But notice that this woman is
flying with her children. Um,

414
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,680
in Massachusetts in 1692 girls of eight
or nine are accusing their mothers of

415
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:53,630
coercing them into signing packs with
the devil by late summer that didn't see

416
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,440
denunciations are flying in every
direction. Daughters accused mothers,

417
00:24:57,441 --> 00:24:58,151
brothers accused,

418
00:24:58,151 --> 00:25:02,030
sisters and parishioners will
accuse their ministers in Andover.

419
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:05,180
Nearly one in 10 people was accused,
including never.

420
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,070
Nearly every female member of the
town's senior minister servants accused

421
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:13,040
mistresses. Although mistresses
did not accuse servants,

422
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:17,780
no one ever suffered from witchcraft
without also being able to name a witch.

423
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,700
Martha Corey went to her death and
September 22nd and what would be the last

424
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:24,440
hanging before she hangs?

425
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,270
She's visited in prison by Reverend Paris
who will excommunicate her and this is

426
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:30,980
his account of the excommunication.

427
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,840
He's irritated that the prisoner
who was a very religious woman,

428
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,410
refuses to pray with him in the 17th
century. A prisoner also by the way,

429
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:43,310
paid for her his or her jail charges
for the blankets and the provisions.

430
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,880
This is the jailer is accounting
and you can perhaps see that.

431
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:50,510
The third item here was for
Martha, Corey and her husband. Um,

432
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,080
by September the colony
had executed 14 women,

433
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:56,990
five men and two dogs for witchcraft.

434
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,650
Somewhere between 140
and 180 had been accused.

435
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,450
And then as broadly as it had begun,
the which panic was over,

436
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,710
the questions that Salem elicits or
those of our nightmares can an industry

437
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,220
innocent person,
Martha Corey asked to be guilty.

438
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,700
Might I be a witch and not know it?
Another suspect asked,

439
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:21,560
could anyone wondered a group of men
late in the summer, think himself safe.

440
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,580
A Brash widow in our fifties came
before the justices in April.

441
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,620
She was not a witch. She refused. She
could not even say what one one which was,

442
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,460
she had the bad luck to be
appearing before a final magician.

443
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,910
How can you know that you are
not a witch and yet, no, not no,

444
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,910
and yet not know what a,
which is as the justice.

445
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,040
So obviously what we have on our hands,

446
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,970
not entirely a fairy tale or a courtroom
drama or a horror story, but a thriller,

447
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,170
presumably that line of trees did not
move from one side of the field to the

448
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:55,980
other. Presumably there were no
flies through the air killer cats.

449
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,420
There was no satanic celebration with a
long banquet table in the Salem meadow.

450
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,760
How then did these things happen?

451
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,580
When you begin to pry the
whole episode of part,

452
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:09,900
you see that it makes uncanny and
eminently modern sense and no,

453
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:13,220
I'm not going to tell you how that came
to pass the clues as to what drives

454
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:18,030
Salem forward and what will result in
an unprecedented 100% conviction rate.

455
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,270
The only for the only
witchcraft panic in our history,

456
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,740
our woven a strand at a time into each
chapter of the book and it's meant to

457
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:27,990
read like a thriller so that you,
you get the,

458
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,330
the idea that only at the end it's meant
to unspool with the logic of a dream

459
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:35,460
and the lucidity of the supernatural,

460
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,510
the unlikeliest of heroes will
emerge in the end. Um, no,

461
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:42,270
I'm not going to tell you who they
were either because that would make my

462
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,350
publisher on happy.

463
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,390
We go back to Salem again and again for
the same reason that it came to pass in

464
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:51,240
the first place.
The irksome lack of closure.

465
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,480
We share the villagers
need for resolution.

466
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,280
We go back to the trials for another
reason too though, as crack ups go,

467
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,090
this one council among the
more sensational in our
history to which so many

468
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:04,860
later missteps would be compared,

469
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,880
that is less on account of the scale
than unaccounted the circumstances.

470
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,600
The court in 1692 consisted
of the best and the brightest.

471
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,320
They lived in the finest homes
in their respective communities.

472
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,830
In 60 92 it's the state,
the broad light of day,

473
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:24,060
and the name of God led by the ablest
men and the colony who sent innocence to

474
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:27,570
their deaths. When friends and
acquaintances came before them,

475
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,080
those authorities doubted not
the girls but their own friends.

476
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,330
This is a portrait of Chief
Justice William Stoughton
who sat at the head of the

477
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:36,780
Witchcraft Corp,

478
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,750
and I will give you a hint and tell you
that he is not the hero of the story.

479
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,040
He was nearly as starchy as he looks here.

480
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,990
He's the most eminent New England
legal authority at the time,

481
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:50,130
and he will die at home nine years after
the trials without a word of regret or

482
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:50,964
apology.

483
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,500
He was the goto person for all legal
matters and 17th century Massachusetts.

484
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,690
No one was better versed in,
in legal code,

485
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,980
which points up something else crucial
about the panic are you addition plays

486
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:04,810
much more of a role in this
story then does ignorance. Um,

487
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,860
arguably the bay colony qualifies as the
best educated community in the history

488
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:11,610
of the world.
Until that time,

489
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:16,170
the New England ministers here increase
in cotton Mather, the father and son,

490
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,970
to whom any number of civic authorities
would appeal for guidance had delve

491
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:22,290
deeply into the literature.

492
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,160
They had devoured libraries on the
subject of witchcraft. If anything,

493
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:29,280
they may have read too much today.

494
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:32,700
Of course the trials endure
as a sort of moral guardrail.

495
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,300
This is where Salem mutates,
yet again to become a cautionary tale.

496
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,080
They stop us when we overreact
or over correct to me.

497
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,500
When fear tends to overpower reason,
they make the experts seem less expert.

498
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,190
They remind us of the risk of
thinking ourselves. Exceptional.

499
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,420
Satan's appearance in Massachusetts seem
to the New England administry like a

500
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:55,990
badge of honor, further proof that
new Englanders with a chosen people.

501
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,620
That statement resonates in troubled
times. We naturally look for terrorists,

502
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:04,210
some traders, a secret agents because
they hate us for our freedoms.

503
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,220
I just want to add that CLM feels
deeply and eerily familiar in an age of

504
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:11,080
crowdsource stories as well.

505
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,580
I'm an oral culture bearers are remarkable
similarity to an internet one both

506
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,230
feet on indelible rumor,

507
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,610
neither has much use for truth and the
Internet turns out to be a brilliant tool

508
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,440
for sewing conspiracy theory.

509
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,300
Things went viral in the 17th century
two and today we couldn't be two places

510
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:30,520
and two people at once as well.

511
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,370
Just as Martha Corey could
simultaneously be at home,

512
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:37,720
minding her own business and
at the parsonage pummeling
and choking the children

513
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,640
at Salem is hard.

514
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,600
There's a sort of fairy tale or are
these rippling sexual undercurrents and a

515
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:48,580
lot of terror. It's really about what
we see when we close our eyes. Um,

516
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,150
and about how those images can
turn for one thing and to another.

517
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,610
It touches on what's unreal,
but by no means on true for all concerned.

518
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:02,220
It's a story about, um, everyone's
agendas and everyone's secret agendas.

519
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,390
The girls, the justices, the ministers,

520
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,630
everyone's trying to accomplish something
here, which is not what he states,

521
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,160
what he states that he has
accomplished his goal. Um,

522
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,250
there would truly unsettle us those
agendas just as they unsettle the 17th

523
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:19,390
century new Englander who met with
the Goblin or the rabid pig and out of

524
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:24,310
reasons the early American turned to
witchcraft for an explanation out of

525
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:26,620
reasons. You are of course
supposed to turn to a book,

526
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,200
which I hope you will enjoy.
Thank you.

527
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,290
I told you may have questions or
comments or corrections for me.

528
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,240
Hi, my name is Laura. Um,

529
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,280
I had seen something once PBS,
maybe, I can't remember where,

530
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,030
talking about one of the theories
for what happened in Salem, um,

531
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,060
being not just the hysteria of the girls
but also potentially a fungus that may

532
00:31:56,071 --> 00:31:59,260
have affected the mentally curious as to
what your thoughts are on that. I love,

533
00:31:59,290 --> 00:31:59,500
yeah,

534
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,900
there's a,

535
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,490
there's a theory that the rye supply
had been poisoned and that a holistic

536
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:04,960
agenda that a fungus
that causes hallucinate,

537
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:09,940
Jay Hallucinations had grown and it was
a great and incredibly elegant theory,

538
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,290
but it, which has been largely
discredited for two or three reasons.

539
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,830
The two foremost ones being that the
girls are strangely terribly afflicted at

540
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:21,670
sometimes and perfectly normal at other
times and they tend to be the convenient

541
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:25,420
times like when they're asked to do
housework or where they need to testify in

542
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:28,540
court. And other times they seem to sleep
like babies and be perfectly normal.

543
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,810
So that doesn't entirely hold
up. Also, if the, if the,

544
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,330
if the grain supply had in
some way been contaminated,

545
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,600
certain members of the household,
uh, everyone would've been affected.

546
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:39,620
In this case,
you often have like has family,

547
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:42,290
there are three unaffected children
and then there are two girls who were

548
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,590
convulsing. Um, one of
them is then sent away,

549
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,450
but it doesn't affect the household.

550
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,900
You're gonna universally and also
apparently was the wrong season for such a

551
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:52,010
fungus to have grown.
But,

552
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,860
but I love that theory because it
would have put a bit been so neat.

553
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,100
Excellent.

554
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,220
I have a couple of questions and you can
actually refer me to the book if that's

555
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:00,300
better.
But first,

556
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:05,301
what became of the girls who were the
original accusers here in second of all,

557
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,780
historically sort of how much
time did it pass before people,

558
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,780
uh, properly came around
on this and said, you know,

559
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:16,290
the witchcraft stuff is
something in our imagination.

560
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,590
How long was that before that was
generally accepted in society?

561
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,170
That's great though to read questions.
Let me start with the second one.

562
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,430
What's really interesting about the
end of the trials is that the accepted

563
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:29,340
wisdom seems to be that they
have indeed murdered innocence,

564
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,480
but they also let guilty people go free.
In other words,

565
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,260
the belief in witchcraft
survived 1692 the belief in it,

566
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:39,090
perfect prosecution does not.

567
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,320
So the inpatients here is with
the way this has been prosecuted.

568
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:46,770
It's not what the concept of witchcraft
and it will take years still for

569
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:51,540
everyone to give up the belief in
witchcraft in 1693 cotton Mather less his

570
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,600
well-documented heart is taking clinical
notes on two more witchcraft cases.

571
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:00,960
Two more girls who invest in Boston,
um,

572
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,310
claim to be clear are
basically experiencing the
same symptoms and he knows

573
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:09,390
enough in 1693 to take those
notes and to document the cases,

574
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,750
but he says it's too vulnerable for
him to publish these things now because

575
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,940
everyone is still so because
the handover has been, um,

576
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,990
has Salem and Andover had been such a
terrific wipe out and there was so much

577
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:21,810
puddling guilt and shame over the,
over the issue.

578
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,240
Nobody will talk about
Salem for quite awhile.

579
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,170
But that belief that there is that
that belief in witchcraft persists.

580
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,030
The girls themselves,
um,

581
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,710
it's a difficult book to write because
of course I'm no 17th century girl kept a

582
00:34:34,711 --> 00:34:39,310
diary. So we have the girls'
voices in the way in, in,

583
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,820
in how they converse with the devil,
which is interesting.

584
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:44,410
We place where they express
themselves the best when I,

585
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,950
the devil will bargain with them
and they'll speak back to the devil.

586
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,250
Those accounts of course come to us from
the male reporters in the courtroom,

587
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,510
so we have nothing that's actually
written in the girls own hand except some

588
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:55,344
testimony.

589
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,330
We have no diaries and we have very little
about what happens to them after 1692

590
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,710
one of the apparently does
continue to be in some way in from,

591
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,070
and it's very unspecific about
what continues to toward mentor.

592
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,610
The others go on to lead perfectly
normal wives and as I think I said in the

593
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:15,390
last chapter, they go on to get married
and have children, have families,

594
00:35:15,391 --> 00:35:16,620
not necessarily in that order.

595
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,240
There's a strange amount
of having children out of
wedlock among the cohort of

596
00:35:21,241 --> 00:35:25,230
girls who had been a flipped in 1692 but
most of them do seem to go on to lead

597
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:26,064
normal lives.

598
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,820
It's interesting because there had
been a case of possession of serious

599
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:32,280
diabolical possession
20 years before Salem,

600
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,630
and that girl who was done a grown woman
would have been alive at the time of

601
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:40,590
the, and the bother of a large family.
And I always wondered, you know,

602
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:42,480
what did she think of what was happening?

603
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:45,480
Because it could so easily have
happened in her case years earlier,

604
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,340
but the minister who had dealt with her
affliction had really been very careful

605
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:53,190
about con about containing
the crisis in that case.

606
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,650
Can you talk a little
bit about the research,

607
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:59,960
how long it took and where are you did it,
and just what the process was like?

608
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,180
Um, it took approximately 120
years. Um, it took, the research,

609
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,160
took him three years completely.

610
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,100
It took me about three years to research
entirely and then a year and a half to

611
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:12,910
write during which I was still researching
a little bit because of course once

612
00:36:12,911 --> 00:36:13,481
you start writing,

613
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:16,810
you realize that you forgot to research
something or that you would need to know

614
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,690
more or you had just haven't gotten to
the bottom of something or you're just

615
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:22,660
obsessive and you need to keep researching
because it's better than writing

616
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,600
always. Um, so about, it breaks
down about that way. But Dot.

617
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,720
The trial documents,

618
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:33,490
these illegible beauties that you saw
or most of them at the Puberty Essex in

619
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:37,300
Salem and you know,
it's just astonishing because you know,

620
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:40,120
you're holding these papers that
would say so and so is, you know,

621
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:43,480
has been maliciously and feloniously
and wickedly practicing witchcraft in a

622
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:47,410
sentence to hang. I mean, they just
sent chills down the spine. Um,

623
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,340
they have a great collection.

624
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:51,700
Danvers has a terrific collection
because they have the church record book,

625
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,890
which I'm speaking to holes
in the narrative leapfrogs
over the entire summer as

626
00:36:56,891 --> 00:37:01,210
does a lot of the documentation are huge
holes in the documentation. So great.

627
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:05,040
Was the regret and the shame in
the wake of Salem, Massachusetts,

628
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,380
torical society has
terrific stuff. Um, so does,

629
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:11,530
is it the new England historical
genealogical or s geological historic,

630
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:13,960
whatever it's called,
has great contextual stuff.

631
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,740
And the American antiquarian society
has a lot of the Mather material and

632
00:37:17,741 --> 00:37:22,741
essentially what I filled in with other
17th century diaries and the quarterly

633
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:26,170
court records of the
years proceeding Salem,

634
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,830
which are really into giving you a
sense of what New England life was like,

635
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:34,000
what people's garages and antipathies
were, who was suing everyone by the way,

636
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:38,730
is suing everybody. This is the most
litigious society you can imagine. And,

637
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,010
and we're talking about litigation
that can last decades and slights that

638
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:45,160
reappear, you know, years
later. Um, it's just,

639
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:47,770
it gives you such a sense of
what people's obsessions were,

640
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,720
what the hot spots were that trespass
and drunkenness and fornication with the

641
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:55,510
big sellers. Um, there's
a lot of witchcraft.

642
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,820
There are number of witchcraft accusations
that go nowhere. Um, it's really, it's,

643
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:03,490
it's just, it's fascinating in terms of
giving you a flavor of New England life,

644
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,120
which obviously came in handy when
you're trying to explain the strains on

645
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:11,200
either a young girl or on
a civil authority in terms
of adjudicating something

646
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:14,020
like this. Another question. Um,

647
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,890
so I think one of the most
frustrating aspects of this stories,

648
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,050
this concept that there's no way
to really prove your innocence.

649
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,840
Um, I was curious if
there, and if there's,

650
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,670
if it's a spoiler you don't have to share,

651
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:31,500
but if there's any record of someone
actually rationalizing their way out of

652
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,130
being accused outside
of just being executed,

653
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,280
confessing or pointing the finger at

654
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,150
somebody else. Um, you put your finger,

655
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,950
I think on the thing that
kept me awake most nights,

656
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,080
which is that you're in a locked
room and you can't get out.

657
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,350
And once you're accused, basically
you're convinced the answer is no,

658
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,230
no one manages to get out of once accused.

659
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:53,550
Nobody manages to shirk the accusation.
There are two ways out. One,

660
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,430
and this was a very class,
plays a huge role in this story.

661
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,290
The wealthy managed to escape. And they,
most of them will escape to New York,

662
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,650
which the relations between Massachusetts
and New York at this point are,

663
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,470
are very hostile in New York.
Very happily. Takes them in.

664
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,320
And I kept thinking they were going
to be great papers in New York saying,

665
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:12,510
you know, those crazy puritans look
what they're doing to each other.

666
00:39:12,511 --> 00:39:14,730
I never found them,
but most of the,

667
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,310
most of the fortunate people
who escaped to go to New York.

668
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,180
And the other way to get out of it
was to confess. And that's, you know,

669
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,460
it does beer have some,
without spoiling anything,

670
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,050
it does have some bearing on why you
have these unbelievably specific and

671
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,320
colorful confessions.
Because the more you confessed,

672
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,430
the happier the justices were, the more
useful you were in the prosecution,

673
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,380
the better you fleshed out this. And
Caribbean, you know, it's crazy story. Um,

674
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,810
and the confessors go back to prison,
but no confessor hangs.

675
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,160
So after a certain point,

676
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:48,120
it does become clear that it's
better to accuse than to be accused.

677
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,180
And it's best to confess.
So

678
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,700
they've told me an old
Sturbridge village that, um,

679
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,560
there weren't forests for the most part,

680
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:59,460
everything had been clear cut to be
used for buildings and heating and such.

681
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,680
What was it like around
the setting, um, uh,

682
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,260
150 or whatever years earlier?

683
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Was it foresty because all the public
media presentations of I thought I saw

684
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,700
something, hey, where did
that person come from?

685
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,270
Or in a forest and sort of environment,
particularly when you have a low light,

686
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:22,020
when you have shadow we light,
it becomes a very easy to imagine things.

687
00:40:22,021 --> 00:40:26,550
The demons in your mind basically become,
become more tangible.

688
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,890
Was it like that then?

689
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,340
That's,

690
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,790
that's also a great question and here's
where the court papers came in handy and

691
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:36,170
as did some of the captivity narratives
of which there are quite a few very

692
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:38,560
unforced did. They were,
had been a remarkable,

693
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,760
but basically the puritans arrived
and cut down all the trees.

694
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,850
There's the long and short of it
and it sounds familiar, right?

695
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,330
And today it's much greener and Lusher,
um,

696
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,870
in Essex county than it would have been.
Ben.

697
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,750
And I kept having to remind myself of
that with the help of the dam versus story

698
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,340
and Richard tracks because I would say,
well,

699
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,610
you can't see from this household
to the parsonage. And he would say,

700
00:40:58,611 --> 00:41:03,440
but you could have in 1692 these
trees are a hundred years old. Um,

701
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,680
and you can see in the,

702
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:09,110
in the court records how much obsession
there was with timber because of course

703
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:12,080
without timber they can't build it
without what, they can't hit their homes.

704
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,660
And with, again, without
spoiling anything,

705
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:16,710
the Paris household is under particular.

706
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,170
It is a particular danger that winter
because it's up to the parishioners to

707
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:23,840
bring their minister firewood or they
don't like him and they're not bringing

708
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:24,330
him ward.

709
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,920
And it's a very cold winter and he's
shivering and he's talking about this from

710
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:31,490
the pulpit and he's basically saying, how
can you leave me without, without good.

711
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:34,190
I can't pray without pray. I
live, you know, when I will,

712
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,870
you will dispatch me to the other world.

713
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,490
And you'll have this on
your conscience is you know,

714
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,010
it's a pretty contentious relationship.
So yes,

715
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:42,170
the wood is a huge flash point as he,

716
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:44,930
as the trespass on other
people's yards to cut down.

717
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:48,730
Would that maybe isn't yours or the
carting away of other people's homes that

718
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,580
you know,

719
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,870
that you could use for the word and there
was a second part of your question. Oh,

720
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,580
if you were a lot about swamps.
Sorry,

721
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,350
what I was going to say when you read the
captivity narratives and when you read

722
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:01,970
about um, spectral presences
at this moment in Gloucester,

723
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:06,920
there are a lot of sightings of a spectral
band of Frenchmen and Indians and the

724
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:10,910
local militia is terrified because they
can hear these men, they see these men,

725
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,940
they can't find these men and
they're clearly just seeing things,

726
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,850
but they always arise from the swamps.

727
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,980
There's a lot of talk about the
swampiness of, of the landscape.

728
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,310
Very little about the trees. Um,
thanks. This has been [inaudible]

729
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:25,460
fascinating. I'm looking forward to
reading your book and I was just curious,

730
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:28,220
do you have any thoughts yet
on the topic of your next book?

731
00:42:28,221 --> 00:42:29,120
If you're willing to share.

732
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,600
I was hoping you all were
going to bring that to me,

733
00:42:31,601 --> 00:42:34,920
isn't that I thought that was
the transaction here. Um, no, I,

734
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:36,300
it's interesting this material is,

735
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,560
it does get under the skin in a way and
I have not entirely been able to emerge

736
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:45,040
from it. I keep servicing angles that I
wish I could play with a little bit more.

737
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:49,230
Um, and I'm not sure if that's the fault
of the material or of the tired and um,

738
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,810
Ondor downtrodden author.
But at the moment, no.

739
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,120
Um,

740
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,120
it sounding like the possible explanation
of sort of a combination of external

741
00:42:59,341 --> 00:43:04,341
stresses and internal just quarrelsome
notice that seemed to exist.

742
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:08,490
You know, it may be a good candidate for
explaining all this, but I'm wondering,

743
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,520
um, and you've talked about some
of the possible external stresses.

744
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:12,354
I'm just wondering,

745
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,790
have people been able to develop
any personal motives in any of this?

746
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:20,460
In other words,
worse,

747
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:25,580
did some of the accusers have grudges or
particular quarrels or property issues

748
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:30,150
or anything like that against the
people that they were accusing?

749
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:33,750
I think in your book, I think you say
that there was a lot of just, you know,

750
00:43:33,751 --> 00:43:37,410
even people within the same
family accusing each other,

751
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:38,910
which would argue against that.

752
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:43,911
But I'm sure people have done probably
you have done investigation about just

753
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:48,090
the more obvious motives that
might have existed and what, what,

754
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,320
what's the story on that?

755
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,970
It was a wonderful book.

756
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:54,660
Some of you may know which essentially
argued that this had been a property,

757
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,470
the whole thing had been a property scam
and that if you accuse the right person,

758
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,340
your estate would therefore,
um, flourish and it,

759
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:05,580
and it had a wonderful set of maps which
proved that the accusers were on one

760
00:44:05,581 --> 00:44:09,030
side of town and the accused on the other
side of town and how this is how all

761
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:12,960
of the properties, uh, joined that too.
Unfortunately, it doesn't really hold up.

762
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,940
And it's also doesn't explain why you
have the intro family accusations or why

763
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:21,570
someone like Rebecca nurse who has
this extremely pious older woman who's

764
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:25,560
actually never been in court, which was
unusual in New England, gets accused.

765
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,670
It's possible that the fact people
thought the family had too much land.

766
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:32,730
It's possible that it's because all
her children lived and most people lost

767
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:33,990
children as possible.

768
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,350
That the family was simply to functional
and other people were jealous and we

769
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:38,490
just,
we do not know.

770
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:42,900
And so many cases why the finger is
pointed where they pointed the property

771
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:45,390
thing.
The only person who makes that well,

772
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:50,550
it terms of confiscating properties is
the local sheriff who was an extremely

773
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:55,320
tireless figure and managers
to be confiscating things
the minute anyone is put

774
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:58,020
in prison. But he doesn't, he
seems to have done it in a,

775
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,680
in a somewhat under the radar way and
he doesn't share his proceeds with the

776
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:02,910
authority.
So it doesn't,

777
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,170
it doesn't really hold up in terms of
some kind of conspiracy in that way. Um,

778
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,280
it is a number of forces to my mind.
It's a number of forces come together.

779
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,300
And I guess the one that I would talk
about without it being a spoiler alert is

780
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:16,110
the political scene,

781
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,680
which is that this is a colony
that's completely for three years,

782
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:22,950
has been living without government,
has a new government in place.

783
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,030
The strains of the chaos of the last
years are still very apparent and the

784
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:31,830
importance of establishing rule of law
in 16 in the summer of 60 92 was huge.

785
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,660
So for these men,

786
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,200
for the justices all of whom have helped
to topple a royal governor three years

787
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:42,201
earlier and are in disfavor of London
to prove that they are competent and law

788
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:47,370
abiding and law enforcing officials
plays an enormous role here.

789
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:51,890
Uh, I'm just curious like
your research process,

790
00:45:51,891 --> 00:45:53,600
like the start to finish,

791
00:45:53,601 --> 00:45:57,420
if you could maybe touch on like how
you kind of like the first thing you do

792
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,790
when you're starting to research a book
or like how that sort of evolves as

793
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,830
you're further into
researching the book and stuff.

794
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,810
Yeah. I'm, I'm really unscientific. Um,

795
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,540
which is to say if I'm
working on a biography,

796
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:10,400
which until now I had more living person,

797
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:14,930
I usually started with interviews because
I knew I had limited amount of time,

798
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,860
often with a particular
demographic, obviously with
a book like Cleopatra, this,

799
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:23,180
that didn't apply. So I tend to
go first to the primary materials,

800
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,540
which is possibly the wrong thing to do
because you're coming to them without

801
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:30,260
the context. And then I circled back
to them in the end. So I started,

802
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,710
I went immediately to the Peabody
Essex and read through the witchcraft

803
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:34,191
testimony.

804
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,220
I didn't know what to make of some of
it because I hadn't read everything else

805
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:38,450
yet.
Um,

806
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,170
I tend to confine myself to
primary materials wherever
possible because there's

807
00:46:42,171 --> 00:46:43,580
just such,
I mean,

808
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:46,610
you saw those shelves and you could be
reading in those shells for 15 years and

809
00:46:46,611 --> 00:46:48,320
never get to the end.
Um,

810
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:52,460
so my feeling is as little as like to
use the secondary materials as little as

811
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:55,430
possible. Um, things like
the pure at the sermons,

812
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:57,800
any 17th century direct
could get my hands on him.

813
00:46:57,801 --> 00:46:59,210
I don't think there's one that I missed.

814
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:04,400
Anything that is 17th century
new Englander would have
known or read at anything

815
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:07,230
he wrote I needed to read.
Um,

816
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:09,680
and I don't do that in a
particularly scientific way,

817
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,650
partly because you don't really
know what you're looking for.

818
00:47:12,651 --> 00:47:14,390
You haven't articulated your questions.
Yeah.

819
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,470
And then that ultimately of course means
that I end up going back to some of

820
00:47:18,471 --> 00:47:21,050
those things once or twice again.
And you know,

821
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:24,950
the court testimony is a perfect example
of this. I read it once in the original,

822
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:29,770
most of it is published, 90%
of his published, at least
I went back to it again.

823
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:32,720
It is published form over and over again.
And then often,

824
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,690
not until two years later is that
I actually noticed that, you know,

825
00:47:35,691 --> 00:47:37,970
when a particular person's testimony,
um,

826
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,240
she doesn't really give the
authorities what they're looking for.

827
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:44,140
She's just agreeing with
them and collaborating with
whatever w and agree with

828
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:46,840
whatever they've said. She's not adding
anything to their questions, you know,

829
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:48,970
it's a kind of thing that doesn't jump
out at you until you've read it several

830
00:47:48,971 --> 00:47:50,440
times.
Um,

831
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:55,470
so I guess the answer to your question
is it's a kind of full immersion process

832
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:58,780
for me, but it doesn't
necessarily follow a linear line.

833
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:02,660
And with people like
Stoughton or the matters, I,

834
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,340
I can't read everything that math, no one
can read everything about others right?

835
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:09,640
Road. So I would read secondary
sources and I can find myself.

836
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:11,440
So that's actually a frustration.
But somebody like,

837
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,390
like cotton Mather who writes,
I think 92 books and the 69 he's alone.

838
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You have to really limit yourself in
terms of what you're going to read. Um,

839
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:23,860
and those texts are really crucial
because you begin to compare different

840
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:28,861
accounts he gives or how he accounts for
witchcraft at different moments and how

841
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:30,400
his thinking of all.

842
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:34,480
So I tend to go back to the same things
over and over and read them more closely

843
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,510
rather than necessarily
spreading myself more broadly.

844
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,123
Thank you all.

845
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:45,660
Okay.
