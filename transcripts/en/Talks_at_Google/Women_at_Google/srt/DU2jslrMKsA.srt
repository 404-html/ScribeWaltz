1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,420
I am super excited to have Clara Hemphill,

2
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:12,200
founder of inside schools here with us
today. She's a font of knowledge and uh,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,760
it's exciting. So just a little bit about
Clara so you know who uh, who she is.

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,370
She leads the center of New York City's
New York City at fairs pop policy work

5
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:26,720
on economic segregation of
the city schools examining
why there are schools with

6
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:30,290
high concentrations of poverty
even in mixed income neighborhoods.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,840
The New York Times called her three books,

8
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,180
designed to help parents
choose good elementary, middle,

9
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:36,680
and high schools for their children.

10
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,720
The most definitive guys to the city
schools in New York magazine culture,

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,990
one of the 200 most influential
New Yorkers for her work
in empowering parents.

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,190
Previously as a reporter,
an editorial writer for New York News Day,

13
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:54,860
she shared the Pulitzer
Prize for local reporting.

14
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,790
New York magazine called her writing
on the homeless worthy of Dickens.

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,170
She was a foreign correspondent for the
Associated Press and a producer for CBS

16
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:04,490
news based in Rome.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,470
She has two children both now grown
and they both attended in New York City

18
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:13,880
public schools from kindergarten through
high school. So please welcome me.

19
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,560
Uh, please, sorry. Excuse me.

20
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:19,370
Please join me in welcoming Clara Hemphill
to talk about the public schools and

21
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,880
navigating the very segregated and
ridiculously complex New York City school

22
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:23,720
system.
Thank you.

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,280
Thank you. I'm really glad to be here. Um,

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,560
I wrote the first edition of this book
20 years ago when my children were a

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,500
three and one.
They're now all grown up and I thought,

26
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:49,450
Gee, I can figure out this bureaucracy.
I was a foreign correspondent in Rome.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,550
I covered the Vatican,

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,510
which I thought was the most
secretive bureaucracy on the planet.

29
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,460
And then I realized the board of Education
is even more secretive and complex.

30
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:03,070
So I thought if I had trouble,

31
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:07,300
other people might have trouble too.
And I set aside,

32
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:10,640
I started writing the books.
Then a couple of years later, uh,

33
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,640
we set up the inside schools website and
we just released the fourth edition of

34
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,380
the New York City's best public pre-k in
elementary schools on sale on the back.

35
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:23,560
I hope you buy it. Thanks very much. Um,

36
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,400
the, um, why should you
choose public school?

37
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,190
Why to public schools matter?

38
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,060
And one of the things that
the last election showed us
the national elections is

39
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:45,931
how divided we are as a country
and public schools when they work.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,880
Habs the ability to bring us together
to help us understand one another.

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,080
Um, and we need this public
schools. Now more than ever. Uh,

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,650
this picture here is an example of a
school that I think brings together.

43
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:03,190
It's those point base in Washington
Heights. Um, you if you know,

44
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:06,460
Washington Heights on the east side
of Broadway is mostly Dominican,

45
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,150
Spanish speaking kids on the west
side is mostly English speaking.

46
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:15,040
Kids dose Puente's brings these kids
together in a dual language program where

47
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,300
they speak, uh, English one
day a week, you know, uh,

48
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,870
half the time and they
speak Spanish half the time.

49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,240
And it's a really lovely,
lovely school and an example of how,

50
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,390
uh,
children can learn together.

51
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,500
One of the things I like about it is
that the, the parents meetings are given,

52
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:39,100
sometimes they're given in Spanish
with English translation and sometimes

53
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:42,610
they're given Spanish with a,
in English with Spanish translation.

54
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,060
And one of the things I liked about
going to that school was having the

55
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:50,530
experience of being somebody who didn't
understand the language that was spoken

56
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,040
and had to have the translation.
So that's one of the schools and the book,

57
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,830
you know, that I can remap, recommend. Um,

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,280
public schools are just about the only
place besides jury duty and the subways

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,620
where people of different races,
incomes and backgrounds mix.

60
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,880
This is a Ella Baker school
on the upper east side,

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,120
which is open to children by
lottery from all five boroughs.

62
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,910
So it's not a zoned school.
It's a citywide school. Um,
and the, the, the great,

63
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,400
um,
Phil Educational Philosopher,

64
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:31,450
John Dewey at the turn of the last
century wrote that schools should teach

65
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:36,451
children to be social beings trained
for leadership as well as the obedience

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,190
train. So they can be voting
citizens in a multiethnic democracy,

67
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,110
not passive subjects.

68
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,030
Teaching them to be social beings without
letting the mingle with other children

69
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:54,031
do we wrote is like teaching them to swim
without letting them go in the water.

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,820
Um, I remember a, um,

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
talking to a Jewish father some time ago
who was choosing between a Jewish day

72
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,410
school. Is My mic on. Yeah.

73
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,340
Who's choosing between a d a Jewish
day school in a public school?

74
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,970
And I told him, yes, I understand
you want your child to learn the,

75
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,350
the reader about your
religious traditions, Hebrew,

76
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,090
your values are very important to you,

77
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,850
but if you send your
child to public school,

78
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:26,851
I guarantee he will meet at least one
child who celebrates Ramadan and a child

79
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:33,340
who celebrates Ramadan. We'll meet at
least one child who he interrupted me.

80
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:37,810
He said, yeah, I get the idea. I get the
point. And that clinched the deal for him.

81
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,750
Um, the, uh,

82
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:45,040
this is a PS 75 on the upper west side,

83
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,430
which serves both Columbia
University professor's children,

84
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:52,410
but also children who live
in public housing nearby. Um,

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,660
um, one of the great thing a lot of the
schools in the book are ordinary zoned

86
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,050
neighborhood schools. No
special application. You
just sign your child up. Um,

87
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,970
this is [inaudible] 80 in, in
Harlem. In some ways it's an,

88
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,270
it's an ordinary school test
scores are nothing special.

89
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,690
It's just sort of an ordinary school.
But a mother told me,

90
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,010
I feel like I'm part of a community and
a neighborhood in an in a way that I

91
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,520
never expected the pleasure of
making friends with other parents,

92
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:26,840
sharing babysitters and afterschool
pickups, even sharing holiday meals.

93
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,090
So one of the things I never felt,

94
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:32,600
I live on the upper east side and
I never felt I really lived in the

95
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:36,170
neighborhood until I had children
and send them to the public schools.

96
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,950
And there's something
about having, uh, being,

97
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:44,780
sharing the responsibilities of parenthood
with other people in the neighborhood

98
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,790
that really makes you feel like
you belong in a neighborhood. Um,

99
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,890
now I know some of you will say, oh, well
that's all very well and good for you.

100
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:56,360
And you live on the upper east side.

101
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,130
But what if you live in the
Bronx or in Central Brooklyn? Um,

102
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,550
one of the questions I got
ahead of time for this, uh,

103
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,510
talk was public school.
This is a quote from one of you.

104
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,530
Public School is not a viable
option for every New Yorker.

105
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,270
This parent was zoned for one
33 in district five and Harlem.

106
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,630
I cannot in good conscience
send my children to my zone.

107
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:25,631
School charter is also not an option
if you're against rote memorization and

108
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:30,620
some other very regimented tactics
they use to teach students.

109
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,250
It's true that there aren't as many
good schools in poor and working class

110
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:40,940
neighborhoods as there are enriched
neighborhoods and racial segregation.

111
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,970
Racial economic segregation is a reality
is those of you who are at Nicole

112
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,320
Hannah Jones, a talk sometime ago a
remember, but in researching the book,

113
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:55,160
we found good schools in
every one of the cities,

114
00:07:55,161 --> 00:08:00,110
32 school districts. Not as many
as we'd like, but at least a few.

115
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,540
And we found some pleasant surprises.

116
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,250
You don't have to live on Park
Avenue to find a good school.

117
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,140
Um,
uh,

118
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,300
I also want to say that not all the
charter schools are rigid places where

119
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,660
children are expected to act
like robots. There are some, uh,

120
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,550
progressive schools where children
learn through exploration and play. Um,

121
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,640
and it, it's not, oh, not all
the charter schools are the same.

122
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:28,190
Just the way all the ordinary
public schools are not the same.

123
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,100
What about segregation? It's true and
it's really the shame of our city.

124
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,490
But even predominantly white schools
or predominantly Asian schools are

125
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:45,851
predominantly black and Latino schools
still have lots of different religions,

126
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:49,580
lots of different languages.
Um,

127
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,660
I was at [inaudible] 89 in crown
heights the other day in Brooklyn,

128
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,880
it's 97% black and Latino,

129
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,450
but the children's speaks
Spanish, English, creole. Um,

130
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,730
there's even some Chinese kids there.
There's a range of incomes.

131
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:09,630
There's a pediatrician, there's
a, uh, uh, a cab driver,

132
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,800
a home health aide.

133
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:16,050
It's a school that has served
generations of parents and crown heights,

134
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,430
and they have dual language programs where
children can learn Spanish and creole.

135
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,780
They even learn Latin. So that's
the school, which in some ways,

136
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:29,520
these indeed highly segregated.
And in other ways is diverse.

137
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
I remember going to an all
black school in, uh, in,

138
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,500
in Brooklyn and asking the kids what
they liked about it and they said, oh,

139
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:42,330
I love the diversity. And I said,
what do you mean? And they said,

140
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,740
oh, we have kids from every single
island in the Caribbean. Um,

141
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,660
another reason to choose a public
school is a kids need parents who aren't

142
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,680
stressed out. Uh, commuting
time really matters.

143
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,720
If you're trying to decide between a
great school 20 blocks away in a pretty

144
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:07,950
good school across the street,
I would choose the one across the street.

145
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,720
Another question is,
if you're,

146
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:13,500
if you're working 60 hours a week
to pay private school tuition,

147
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,160
maybe you're better off sending
your child to public school.

148
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,060
If working part time means you can
go on an occasional field trip,

149
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,250
volunteer at the school you may enjoy,
you know,

150
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,990
being with your child and at that
time, uh, it can be very important.

151
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,560
I also want to point out that education
is not just what you have from 9:00 AM

152
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:36,120
to 3:00 PM 180 days a year.

153
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Just living in the city of New York gives
you access to resources that people,

154
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,190
uh, elsewhere don't have.
The natural history museum,

155
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,610
the Bronx Zoo,
um,

156
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,730
my children danced with the
national dance institute. Uh, the,

157
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,000
um,
there are huge numbers of resources that,

158
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,230
that you can take advantage of
just by living in the school.

159
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,540
Um, of course the argument about the
60 hours a week may work the other way.

160
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,220
If you're already working, I realize
I'm talking to Googlers here. Um,

161
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,540
if you're already working 60 hours a week,

162
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,890
you may want to choose private because
you don't have to be on top of everything

163
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,050
at school.
But what my point is,

164
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:24,051
is that consider your own convenience and
your own levels of stress when you're,

165
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,210
um, uh, deciding on school,

166
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,080
the children are made of rubber and
they can adapt to lots of different

167
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:33,270
situations.
Um,

168
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,010
another thing I want you to remember
is that no school is perfect.

169
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,100
As a parent,
you have to decide what you can live with,

170
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,310
what you can supplement at home.
Um,

171
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,850
there's some things you can fix
and there's some things you can't,

172
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,210
you certainly don't want to send your
child to a school where there's lots of

173
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,580
bullying or where the
adults at the children are,

174
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:58,330
where teachers have low expectations
and the children are overwhelmed by the

175
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:00,490
problems of poverty.

176
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,330
My children's school had physical
education just one day a week.

177
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,460
So what did we do? We
supplemented with west side
soccer league, which is a, um, uh,

178
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,700
volunteer. Moms and dads will
coach kids on the weekend.

179
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,150
They take up most of the park space in
the city and the weekend you've probably

180
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:19,720
seen them. Um, if there's
not enough math thrill,

181
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:23,830
you can have flash cards at home.
If there's not a foreign language,

182
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:27,510
you can take the whole family to France
for three months for the price of a

183
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,230
private school tuition.
It also depends on your child.

184
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Some children in there, like a nursery
school teacher described this to me.

185
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,960
Some children like Dandelions,
they're robust and they can flourish.

186
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,380
And lots of places,
others are more like orchids.

187
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,810
They're delicate and they need
just the right temperature.

188
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,550
Some schools do a good job with
children with special needs. Uh,

189
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,410
others do not.
Um,

190
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,970
so it depends a little bit on
your own family situation. Um,

191
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,210
and on the uh, um, that
what your child has.

192
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:06,211
Like the most important thing of friend
once told me is to find a school that

193
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:11,590
doesn't kill your child's
natural curiosity.

194
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,330
A lot of what children learn
in the early years is not a,

195
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:19,870
particularly in kindergarten,
it's not cognitive, it's social.

196
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:24,190
Learning how to sit in a circle, how
to share, how to develop independence,

197
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:26,020
things like how to tie your own shoes.

198
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,900
The tone and climate of a school may
be more important than the children's

199
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,750
scores on standardized tests. Scores, by
the way, tell you where a school's band,

200
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:40,230
it doesn't tell you necessarily
where a school is going.

201
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,100
A school that's promising and on its way
up may provide a better experience for

202
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:50,050
your new child than a complacent well
established school that's a coasting on

203
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:52,350
its reputation.
Um,

204
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,840
so that's my pitch on why public.

205
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,880
Now I'm going to give you the sort of
the nuts and bolts of how to navigate the

206
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,740
New York City public school system.

207
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,960
The good news is that all four
year olds are guaranteed a seat.

208
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,220
And pre-kindergarten,

209
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,210
the bad news is it may not be in
the school closest to your home.

210
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
If you're willing to travel a bit,
you'll definitely get a spot. Um,

211
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,410
the applications open in mid January,

212
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,570
the deadline through
at the end of February.

213
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,710
But if you're looking for school
for your child this fall, um,

214
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,490
take hearts seats open up in the spring
and the summer for your child to be

215
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:32,590
eligible,
he needs to start.

216
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:37,180
He needs to have his fourth birthday
by December 31st. That means in,

217
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:41,590
say if he has a fall birthday, he'll
actually start pre kindergarten when he's,

218
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,520
uh, when he's three. Um, there, uh,

219
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,160
de Blasio has also promised
that he's going to have a pre,

220
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,220
pre kindergarten for three year olds.

221
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:55,190
They're going to start in
two high poverty districts,

222
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:58,070
one in the South Bronx and one
in central Brooklyn in the fall.

223
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,600
They haven't got money for anything
else. So, uh, I, I think, uh,

224
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,610
asking this, uh, uh,

225
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,050
asking the federal government and the
state for extra money right now is

226
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:13,040
probably not going to happen. But we
do a pre K for four year olds. Um,

227
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,990
not all of the pre kindergarten
classes are an ordinary public schools.

228
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:18,891
In fact,

229
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:23,000
most of them are housed in childcare
centers or private nursery schools or

230
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:26,990
religious schools. Um, you
can see the pie chart here.

231
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,280
The city's also opened what
they call pre-case centers.

232
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,810
These are standalone schools that your
child will attend for just one year.

233
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,900
We list some of our favorites in the book.
Um,

234
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,340
it's certainly a good idea to visit,

235
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:43,610
but most of the programs
we visited are pretty good.

236
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,030
So That's pre k elementary.

237
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,770
This is where the big kid school begins.

238
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,970
And this is when you're
five years old, you, uh,

239
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,240
if you are five before December 31st,

240
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:03,410
you're entitled to start school
in that September, most of you.

241
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,020
So for the,
for the pre K,

242
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,810
you're guaranteed a seat someplace,

243
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,480
but not necessarily in your zoned
neighborhood school. In fact,

244
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,720
most of you will not have a seat and
you're zoned neighborhood school.

245
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:22,721
Some of them just have 18 seats for
pre k and 125 seats for kindergarten.

246
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,400
So most of you are going to have to look
outside of your zoned public school for

247
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,940
pre-kindergarten. However,
for elementary school,

248
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:36,941
most of you are Garren or have a zoned
elementary school and your child is

249
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,810
guaranteed admission there.
Um,

250
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,270
one of the questions that you gave me an
advance was about wait lists. There are,

251
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,890
some schools have wait lists,

252
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:50,891
but honestly almost all of the wait list
clear and they ask parents to sign up

253
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,490
early and many do.

254
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:59,810
And they tell you that you're on a
wait list in March. But by September,

255
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:00,890
an awful lot of kids,

256
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:05,660
they've either moved out of the city or
chosen a private school or gone into a

257
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:10,640
gifted and talented program. So I would
not worry about, there's a couple of,

258
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,590
um, schools that have serious
wait lists in sunset park,

259
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:19,700
a couple in queens, but by
and large, there are, um, uh,

260
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,520
it's not going to be a problem.
Um,

261
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,550
the timeline is in, do I have
another slide for this? Nope.

262
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,170
This is the district's. Um,
the city is divided. Oh,

263
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:38,171
so I see the timeline is you apply in
November if you want your child to be

264
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,410
considered for a gifted program.
Um,

265
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,620
I'm not a big fan of gifted education,
but uh,

266
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,220
if you're zoned neighborhood
school is inadequate,

267
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,910
it's certainly an option
that you should consider. Um,

268
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,900
the testing for children for the gifted
program is in January, in February,

269
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,090
in by January. Then you submit
applications for other schools. Honestly,

270
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,950
the deadline is way too early.

271
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,130
Most people in the city don't know in
January what they're going to be doing in

272
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:11,730
September,
and they always almost always extended.

273
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,390
By the end of March, you'll find out
where your child's been assigned.

274
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,100
If you're interested in charter schools,
the deadline is April 1st.

275
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,780
Um, and then in April you find out
if your children, you know what,

276
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,170
I'm making this too complicated. Read
the book, Ask questions afterwards.

277
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,120
I can see that the eyes are getting
a little bit panic stricken here. Um,

278
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,200
zone maps,
sorry.

279
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:40,610
Okay.

280
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,450
Okay.
The city is divided into 32 districts.

281
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,140
One of the questions was,
why are the district so weird?

282
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:52,910
Why don't they just make them
according to the voting districts?

283
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,320
The answer is buried in
history. Um, uh, the,

284
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,683
um,

285
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,150
districts were set up in 1969 as part
of an experiment in community control.

286
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,590
They were set up,
some of them were set up for,

287
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,510
they're all set up for political reasons.

288
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,170
Some of them were designed to keep
all the white people together.

289
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,390
Some of them were designed for, um, uh,

290
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,560
the keep give Puerto Ricans
power in East Harlem.

291
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:25,410
Some of them were designed to dilute
African American power somewhere in the

292
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:29,330
more designed to concentrate
African American power. The, I'm,

293
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:33,680
the reason you need to know about them
today is that your child has guaranteed a

294
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:37,190
seat in one of these in the
district in which you live.

295
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,970
And some of the districts are really
first rate and some of them are not ready

296
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,630
for primetime.
Um,

297
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,470
one of you said that the, um, whoops,

298
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,460
I seem to have missed the inside schools.
All right,

299
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,100
well if miss one of you said that the um,

300
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,020
the department of Education
website is very hard to use. Um,

301
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,010
we agree.

302
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,050
We at inside schools have been working
very hard to develop a new website.

303
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:12,051
We have a development now
we plan to launch and in the
end of May and I'm hoping

304
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:16,520
to get some Google,
um,

305
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,870
volunteers to help us with a guided
search that will go through, um,

306
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,270
help parents answer a certain
number of questions. Um,

307
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,490
I don't know what happened to that slide,
but um,

308
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,980
if you go to inside schools.org,

309
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:39,960
you'll see our old slide
and if you go to the, um,

310
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,700
ah, here it is, um, what we're
hoping to get as a guided search.

311
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:49,701
So instead of searching by finding your
zoned school or finding schools in your

312
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:54,130
neighborhood, we would also have
a ask a couple of questions. Like,

313
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:59,050
how old is your child? Um, how
far are you willing to travel?

314
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,920
Are you interested in a dual language
program for pre kindergarten?

315
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:06,610
Do you need care from eight in
the morning to six at night?

316
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,280
Are you able to pick up
your child after school?

317
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:14,020
That kind of guidance search we would love
to have some help with, from, from um,

318
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,090
any of you. Um, we have a couple of
other, uh, projects for volunteers,

319
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:23,350
which, um, she thought has
put on the, uh, Google give.

320
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,480
So I'm going to,
um,

321
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,003
the,
the,

322
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,780
the,
um,

323
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,820
the best school guides and the inside
school guides are a product or projects of

324
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:38,770
the Center for New York City
Affairs at the new school.

325
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,300
We're not for profit and we
rely on donations to keep
providing this service to

326
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,134
parents.

327
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,340
So if you'd like to help us out by making
a donation or buying the book or both,

328
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,450
we'd be very grateful.

329
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,960
The New York City public schools
help make my own children,

330
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:56,950
the adults they are today,
intellectually curious, morally grounded,

331
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,670
every generous and able to get along
with people of all races and backgrounds.

332
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,200
We wrote this book in the hopes that it
can help you have the same experience

333
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:08,710
with your children.
So I will answer questions now.

334
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,083
Okay.

335
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,810
Um,
can you just go to the next slide?

336
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,413
MMM.

337
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,370
Okay. So I just wanted to let you
guys know that inside schools as,

338
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:32,190
as you mentioned it, they, they
operate on a shoe string budget. Um,

339
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,410
and they have a lot of interesting,

340
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,190
a few interesting projects that I
put in for Google serve for June,

341
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:41,180
some engineering projects.
So marketing strategy projects.

342
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,280
Really if you want to get involved,

343
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,110
I put a goal link inside schools dash
volunteer or check them out. Also. Um,

344
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,100
you know, I think as you mentioned, there
are nonprofits, so I put a gold link for,

345
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,821
for donations.

346
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:57,530
There's also books in the back if you're
interested in reading what Clarise book.

347
00:22:57,531 --> 00:23:02,510
It's, it's fascinating.
Um, I also wanted you guys,

348
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,670
if anyone has questions,
please come up to the mic and ask,

349
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:08,480
I think where we can spend the rest of
the time on questions cause I know you

350
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:09,314
have a lot.

351
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,193
Okay.

352
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:23,150
Hello. Oh, thank you, Clara for coming
here. Um, I have a quick question about,

353
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,220
um, I know like many parents,
including my wife actually and,

354
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,900
uh,
six years ago I believe,

355
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,440
told me that if we should move to a
place where the school is nine and 10,

356
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:38,150
I said what? He's nine and 10. So the
inside schools or had the dynamic system,

357
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:41,580
they 10 and that's how we ended up
buying a house. There was long, long ago.

358
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,600
And now my son is five years old.
Uh,

359
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,970
so that was too planning
towards the ranking it,

360
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:49,200
but I still don't understand like the,

361
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,210
how the numbers go because that
nine and 10 became six and 10.

362
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:54,560
Then that became eight and 10.

363
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,080
So how I learned that it's not really
test scores. And how do you lead?

364
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,150
Is it worth like giving that
much weightage depending on,

365
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,040
that's a good question. We
don't, we don't rank schools.

366
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,970
It's our dread competitor.
Great schools.net. Um,

367
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:15,390
the difference between great schools.net
and us is that we live in New York and

368
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:20,680
we actually visit schools
and we base our, um, uh,

369
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,330
reviews on, uh, our visits to schools.

370
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,300
Great. schools.net uses two
year old, uh, national data.

371
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,100
It's a national website and it's
largely based on test scores,

372
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,510
which is,
as I said,

373
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:41,560
we're a school has gone
not where a school,

374
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,320
we're a school of span and
not where a school is going.

375
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,100
I think pest scars are um, uh, rough.

376
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,950
We have test scores on our website.
Um,

377
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,880
and I think they are a rough measure
of the quality of the school. Um,

378
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,160
if you have single digits of children
passing the tests, that's a problem.

379
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:05,070
If you have 80% passing,
that's a good thing. The um,

380
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,740
uh,
we on our website we have,

381
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,890
we draw the data from the
department of Ed Surveys,

382
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:14,860
which are given to a million parents,

383
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:17,950
teachers and children
themselves at the schools.

384
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,960
And the data that we consider important,
um,

385
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,270
aside from the test scores is attendance
to most of the children show up.

386
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,880
Teacher attendance to most of the teachers
show up. Uh, teacher satisfaction.

387
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:35,050
Do most of the teachers like the
principal respect the principles?

388
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:39,640
Do they work together as a team? So
those, um, those are some of the,

389
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,840
we have those,

390
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,700
that data for every school in
the city and we have um, uh,

391
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,900
qualitative reviews for
about 800 of the schools. Um,

392
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,250
does that help? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

393
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,890
So you mentioned you weren't
a big fan of gifted education.

394
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,540
I was just wondering if
you could expand on that.

395
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,680
Do you think the whole idea is bad or just
the way it's actually implemented? Um,

396
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:08,790
there are clearly some children who
need gifted education as there are some

397
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:12,970
children who need any kind of
special education and um, you know,

398
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:16,510
when a room of Googlers there probably
some very gifted children. I would, uh,

399
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,540
I would guess the, um, the,

400
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,810
a lot of what, um, if your child is,

401
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,840
is two standard deviations from the mean,
um,

402
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,440
he may well need,
he may need gifted education.

403
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:37,441
The problem is that the tests
are set up on national norms,

404
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,700
not local norms. So your child
might be two or three grade levels.

405
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,830
You might in the Bronx and your child is
two or three grade levels ahead of the

406
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:51,780
kids in the Bronx. Um, but the s the
city test wouldn't recognize that.

407
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,870
So there's almost no kids in the
Bronx who are considered, uh,

408
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,540
eligible for gifted education. Um, on
the other hand, if you're, if you're,

409
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,440
um,

410
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,440
and I think the tests also reflect a
socio economics as much as they reflect

411
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:12,090
some kind of, um, uh, curiosity
or, or natural ability,

412
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,270
the, um, in, in more
wealthy neighborhoods,

413
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,210
your child may be two standard
deviations from the mean and,

414
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,120
but everybody else is the
same in that neighborhood.

415
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,350
So that a district 22 on the upper
east side is like lake Wobegon.

416
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:29,580
Everybody's above average.

417
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,200
But that doesn't mean that they
all need gifted education. Um,

418
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,000
I can always tell when I've
got a real one on the phone,

419
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:40,710
the parents says that the child has taught
himself Algebra at the age of three.

420
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,380
Um, and he's having a little
trouble making friends and uh, uh,

421
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,480
it doesn't get an a in the
parents desperately want
their children to be invited

422
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:51,840
to birthday parties. That's an
example of a child who I think needs,

423
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:56,790
needs a gifted education. Now, if we
all had good neighborhoods, schools,

424
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:01,170
there wouldn't be, there'd be a very,
very small need for gifted education.

425
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,340
Unfortunately,

426
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:07,240
the quality of schools
is really uneven and, um,

427
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,550
gifted education is,

428
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:11,940
it is a particularly good way to get out
of a nasty neighborhood school that you

429
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:14,580
don't want to send your child to. The, um,

430
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,630
the other problem with the
gifted education is I think
children need to learn

431
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,420
that hard work is what matter.

432
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,900
And you're not born with gifts as much.

433
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,130
I mean,
you may be born with gifts,

434
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:32,220
but counts is how hard you work
and that there's a kind of,

435
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:35,550
in these gifted programs, there's
kind of a fear of, of falling.

436
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:40,060
It was a fear of failure.
Um, also I think, uh, the,

437
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,520
the tests measure a rather
narrow range of academic skills.

438
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,610
They don't past. If you're a
great musician, they don't test.

439
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:50,820
If you're a great artists,
they don't test if you're athletic,

440
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,980
they don't test if you're particularly
good at making friends and, uh,

441
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:59,880
ending playground squabbles. So, uh,

442
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:04,881
I want my children to be exposed to all
of those things and not just to kids who

443
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,040
do well on a particular test.

444
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,020
The other thing is I think giving the
test to four year olds is really too

445
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:15,780
early. I just think that
you can't, you know,

446
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:20,430
the predictive quality of these tests
is not that the tests are not that

447
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:25,431
accurate and the divide between the 99th
percentile and the 98th percentile of

448
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:29,820
kids at the age of four
is kind of ludicrous.

449
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,630
The other thing is a lot of what you're
learning in elementary school is not

450
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:37,680
cognitive. It's how to tie your
shoes, how to sit in a circle, um,

451
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:41,620
how to make friends, how to get along
with the classroom routines. So,

452
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,390
um, I, I, this is what I think
about early childhood education.

453
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,710
I think by third, fourth,
fifth, sixth grade, the, um, uh,

454
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:53,950
a very good teacher can
reach range of children,

455
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,150
but the wider that range is,

456
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,210
the harder it is for a teacher to,
uh,

457
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,400
reach that. Um, in my kindergarten,

458
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:11,430
what you'd want to ask of your of the
school is how do you challenge children at

459
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:14,350
the top and how do you,
um,

460
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,120
give help to kids who need it? And
your child might need both, right?

461
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:24,010
Your child might be a math wiz who has
trouble making friends or your child may

462
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:28,330
read way, you know, maybe meeting Harry
Potter and kindergarten but can't add,

463
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,130
right? So you, you, your child
can be simultaneously gifted and,

464
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,400
and struggling at the
same time. Um, my kin,

465
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,950
my son was very good at puzzles
and when he, in kindergarten,

466
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:44,380
he finished the hundred piece puzzle.

467
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,930
The teacher would pull down the
500 piece puzzle for him. Um,

468
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,170
when you look in classrooms,
you want to see a range of books.

469
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,360
If everybody's reading the same book,
that's probably not a good place.

470
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,510
But if some kids are reading frog
and toad and other kids are reading

471
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:03,580
Charlotte's web,
that's a sign.

472
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,060
If you look at the writing on
the board and you see some kids,

473
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:10,660
the writing five pages and some
kids are writing three paragraphs,

474
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:15,880
that's a sign that the school is
adapting to kids with different needs.

475
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:20,881
So of course you want your child to be
challenged if he's very bright and you

476
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:24,250
want them to get the
help, uh, if he needs it.

477
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,260
But that doesn't necessarily mean
he needs to be segregated, um, in,

478
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,120
in a classroom with other kids who are,
who are,

479
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,860
who do well on this academic test.

480
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,500
Um, so, uh, the school that we're
zoned for is relatively new.

481
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,240
It was just launched like
four years ago maybe.

482
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:46,780
So I think there's not a lot of
information on it yet. It's um,

483
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,030
the school for social social action.
Yeah. I know. 27 I think. Yes. Um,

484
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,520
so we ideally want to send,
our daughter's only seven months old,

485
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,780
but we want to send her there,

486
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:59,200
but we're being told by a lot of people
to keep our options open and make sure

487
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:03,550
we're planning for the possibility of a
gifted and talented program or a private

488
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:06,370
school. Um, so I guess
my question is two fold.

489
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:10,330
Like what are your thoughts on that and,
and knowing that our daughter so young,

490
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:12,970
like what are the things that we should
be thinking about right now to set her

491
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:16,960
up for whatever options, but ideally
wanting to send her to public school.

492
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:18,880
Are there things that we should
be thinking about doing now

493
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,260
if you could afford to stay in
district two? Yeah, I'd stay put um,

494
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,360
district to not only has
terrific elementary schools
that also has good middle

495
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:28,920
schools and good high schools,

496
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,690
which is not universally the case at all.
Um,

497
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,220
uh, then, um, I like five 27 a lot. Um,

498
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,100
it's a shade traditional than some of,

499
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,560
well I won't get into details
about individual schools,

500
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:47,210
but in your district I like five 27.
It's in the book, you can meet about it.

501
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,970
There's also a gifted program,
a flute few blocks away.

502
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,020
There's two gifted programs a few blocks
away, both of which I liked very well.

503
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,470
So what are there things we should be
thinking about doing know to like make

504
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,830
sure that she's prepared for like the
application process for gifted and

505
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:03,650
talented or for getting her
ready for elementary school.

506
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:06,710
Because I've just heard from people
like in the building who are saying they

507
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,510
send their kids to gifted and
talented and they're like, oh,

508
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,670
there's all these things you have to do
these classes you have to take to make

509
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:15,170
sure that they're, you know, on
the resume for like, yeah, I,

510
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:19,730
I think it's kind of sick. You know, I,
I want to like let children be children.

511
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,900
Right. And I will encourage
you to resist that. Okay.

512
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,790
My son, I thought he was
gifted, uh, you know,

513
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:32,480
he was doing the big puzzles and
kindergarten, you know, um, but um,

514
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,920
he was at the age of four,

515
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:37,940
he was still throwing blocks and the
thought of having him sit down with a

516
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:42,020
stranger and a pencil and paper test
just seemed insane, you know? So,

517
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,320
um, yeah, sure.

518
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:50,060
There are people who will charge you
lots of money to prepare for this test.

519
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:53,300
But I would strongly discourage it,

520
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:56,930
particularly because you
live in a neighborhood with
his own schools are fine,

521
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,630
you know, in neighborhoods with
his own schools are not fine.

522
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:03,050
I don't mean to trash gifted and
talented across the board, you know,

523
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:07,220
easy for me to say my kids went to the
local school and it was great for a lot

524
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:11,300
of people that gifted schools are
a good option. One other, sorry,

525
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,920
one last thing then.
If the baby,

526
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:17,060
you mentioned that the cutoff is December
31st there's a lot of theories about

527
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:19,340
keeping your child back or advancing them.

528
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:22,490
But it sounds like my reading showed me
that in public schools you don't really

529
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:26,360
have that choice. Is that true? Or can you
hold your child back? You cannot, you're,

530
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,230
you're stuck with the, uh, um, yeah.

531
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,290
So this is called red shirting where
you hold the kids back year of the idea

532
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,450
that there'll be bigger and
stronger and smarter. And then,

533
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,870
and it's the same group of people who
are telling you to get the test prep for

534
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:43,160
your seven months old,
you know, you know, um, I,

535
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,170
my,
I have a November birthdays.

536
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:49,430
My daughter was the November birthday
and she was pretty tiny for kindergarten

537
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:52,640
and she was pretty exhausted
at the end of the day. Um,

538
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:56,870
so I understand the, um, theory. Yeah,

539
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:59,900
I understand the impulse to, uh, I,

540
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,770
I mean I think it's actually their,

541
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,680
their political reasons why these things
are set up that don't necessarily have

542
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:10,120
to do with pedagogy or child development.
Um,

543
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:15,270
I hope the question you could ask
at five 27 or any other school is,

544
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,180
um, I have a November birthday, you
know, my child has a November birthday.

545
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,543
Um,

546
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:29,340
how do you adapt for younger children?
You know,

547
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:33,500
do they have a rest time?
Um, do they have, um,

548
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,410
you know, are, are, are they,

549
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,670
or can they accommodate a child who's
a little bit younger and, and, and,

550
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,920
and see what the answer. I mean, I
think that's a, that's a valid question,

551
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:46,590
but they won't let you red shirt
and I'm afraid. Yeah. Okay.

552
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,870
Yeah. Hi, I'm a couple of
questions if I may. Um,

553
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,250
first I love to hear your thoughts
on non zones district schools. Yeah.

554
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,970
Why do they exist and what steps can one
take it there a great one year by that

555
00:35:58,971 --> 00:36:02,400
you want to get your kid
into. Um, and then second, um,

556
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,280
the school in my son appears to not
be a good school. I haven't looked,

557
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,690
haven't I'm going to buy your book.
Yeah. You convinced me. But I've,

558
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:15,250
I've looked at like at like a school
digger and the ranks are good. Um,

559
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:19,700
and so what, what's the school alpha
docs. Okay. I know. That's cool. Yeah.

560
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,510
I mean my kids are four, they're,
they're already signed up for preschool,

561
00:36:23,511 --> 00:36:26,720
but I'm thinking about kindergarten,
um, for, you know, a year down the road.

562
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,011
Realistically,

563
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:31,580
are there things that I can do as a
parent who wants to be involved to really

564
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:36,560
make an impact on the school nearby or
it's my time better spent thinking about

565
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,030
how I can get my kids
into a different school,

566
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:41,150
whether they said the nuns zone district
school or moving or something else.

567
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,430
I love that question. That's
a really good one. Um, yes,

568
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:47,710
parents can make a difference.
Um,

569
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,040
you have to talk to,

570
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,350
you have to talk to other
parents and decide, um,

571
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:00,070
other parents and see if you've got
other people who can work with you.

572
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,490
And then you have to talk to the
principal and see if he wants you to work.

573
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,610
And it's gotta be,
you can't say this a terrible school,

574
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:09,400
we're going to save you and make it
better for some reason that approached

575
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,240
doesn't, um, you know, it's not
really welcome, but you know,

576
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:18,010
we love the school and we want to
support it. Can we do x, Y, Z, um, is,

577
00:37:18,011 --> 00:37:19,180
um,
now district.

578
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:24,130
So some of the districts have
district wide school choice for,

579
00:37:24,131 --> 00:37:28,980
so this is again, this is a, um,
hell's kitchen. It was right by,

580
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,660
yeah. And there's, there's midtown west,

581
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:36,340
which is a school that accepts kids
from all over the district. Um,

582
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,900
and um, supposedly by
lottery. Um, same as,

583
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:44,590
I don't know if you read the piece
in the Sunday Times about one 65 and

584
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:46,780
Manhattan school for children
and the upper west side.

585
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:52,050
Another case of a sort of unfavored
zone school and a favored cool,

586
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:57,430
groovy Boutique, um,
hipster millennium school.

587
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,593
Um,

588
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,400
and how they got set up was dissatisfied.

589
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:07,420
Parents who were zoned for the unfavored
school were dissatisfied and created

590
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:11,950
something new with under the
auspices of the Department of Ed.

591
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,960
Um, and, um, that the,

592
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:22,050
the use to these district schools use
to have their thumb on the scales for

593
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:26,890
parents who wanted to volunteer.
The last administration,

594
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:31,810
Bloomberg thought that was not really
fair. Um, I think there was one, um,

595
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,880
uh,
Joel Klein,

596
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:38,881
the previous chancellor may read in my
book where I said one family had two

597
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:42,790
mothers and they promise to mothers in
the PTA and that that got them into the

598
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,750
school.
Um,

599
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,900
and he thought that this kind of the
skulls chancellor thought this kind of

600
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:49,870
string pulling was willing,
not very nice. So we made it,

601
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:54,740
everything's done by lottery now.
However, after the first, um,

602
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:00,010
round of admissions comes out, the
admissions reverts to the local school.

603
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:04,270
And at that point, pleasant persistence,
you know, can make a difference.

604
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:09,820
Um, one pan, this the one 11 year
school. I didn't put it in the book,

605
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,930
but it's a, it's a, it's, it's,
it's moving in the right direction.

606
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,880
So I would give it another facet.

607
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,890
And I also want to encourage you to go
to inside schools.org and not school

608
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,720
digger and you know,
thank you.

609
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,380
Hi. Thanks for coming today. We love,
we love you. We're, we're a bit,

610
00:39:28,381 --> 00:39:31,240
we're a big fan of your books
and your site. Thank you.
That's a general question.

611
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,480
What's like a trend that you would like
in public schools and wants to try and

612
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,410
you're not so happy about?

613
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,220
Oh, well I think preK is
wonderful, right? I mean,

614
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:44,210
I paid $12,000 for nursery school,
you know, when my kids were little.

615
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:47,900
So I think that's, that's
a, a wonderful trend. Um,

616
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,380
I think the trend towards
progressive education is a good one.

617
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,790
I think children learn through doing,
they learn through play,

618
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:59,660
they learn by putting together
blocks. They learn, you know,

619
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,930
engineering and math skills
with blocks and Lego.

620
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:07,250
So I like classrooms that have a lot of
blocks and lego rather than classrooms

621
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:10,190
for the little kids that have lots
of pencil and paper exercises.

622
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:15,200
I like schools where the children read
what they call authentic literature that

623
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:18,140
has children's picture books and
books that you might read for fun.

624
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,750
I think that's um,
uh,

625
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:24,350
the extent to which that's increasing
I think is a very good idea. Uh,

626
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,160
what I don't like is the
obsession with standardized tests.

627
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:33,430
Some schools have become just test prep
hell where the kids work for hours and

628
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,670
hours and hours filling out,
learning how to fill out bubble sheets.

629
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,883
Thanks.

630
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,860
Hi. Um, I have, uh,

631
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,390
maybe two questions this time about
reading between the lines on a school.

632
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,660
Uh, one question is how, how,

633
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:55,460
how do you determine if the
fiscal is sort of improving?

634
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:57,980
Cause you mentioned how it's not
about where the school has been.

635
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,360
Okay,

636
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,680
that's a really good question.
Um, in terms of a data,

637
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,790
I look to see if, um,
enrollments increasing.

638
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:11,510
That's usually a sign of parents
voting with their feet. Um,

639
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:15,620
I look to see if attendance is
improving before the test scores go up.

640
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,380
You've got to get some of the,
some of the public schools have very,

641
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:23,381
very high rates of absenteeism and that's
the sign that the kids are not happy

642
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:28,050
to be there. And um, so when you
see the attendance going up, um,

643
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,090
the most important thing
is an effective principal.

644
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,250
Um,
hands down,

645
00:41:34,251 --> 00:41:39,251
a good principal will attract
good teachers and encourage
them to work together

646
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:45,260
as a team. A bad principal can
dismantle a good school just as quickly.

647
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,590
So leadership is all and you can usually
feel the difference within about a

648
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,150
couple of weeks of the new principal
coming to pound. So in terms of the data,

649
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:57,110
we do look at

650
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,240
teacher satisfaction with the
principal as one thing to look at,

651
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,810
which we have on our, on
our, on our website. Um,

652
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,380
and uh, the, the,

653
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,420
the, those are the signs that a school is
moving in the right direction. Again, um,

654
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,090
what I was talking to some schools
start in the schools that are improving,

655
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:24,440
start getting better in the lower
grades and build up one by one.

656
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:29,450
So if you see a good
pre k and kindergarten,

657
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,950
but the fifth grade is not so hot,
that may be okay.

658
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,820
It could be that they're
building from the bottom up. Um,

659
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:40,550
so look for the lower grades.
Is that helpful?

660
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,040
My other question that
are not quick. Um, uh,

661
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,510
so speaking of someone who's Lil B
be parents of mixed race children,

662
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,480
I'm thinking of,
um,

663
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,770
can you determine how could you determine
if there's the educational quality of

664
00:42:56,771 --> 00:42:58,790
level for all children?

665
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,150
Because sometimes some schools we looked
at and I think some anxiety of like, oh,

666
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:04,160
they're rating on like school,

667
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:08,840
school crusher or whatever they're rating
on some other website, uh, is high.

668
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:12,530
But then I there see like
really significant segregation
at the gas levels of

669
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:13,970
other things.
So I worry about getting,

670
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,260
so how could you read into whether it's
a good education for all of the studio?

671
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,860
Um, I, yeah, I talked to parents
about that. Um, it's funny,

672
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:24,780
I went to ps 75,

673
00:43:24,781 --> 00:43:29,550
which was one of my slides with the
African American staff member and I'm one

674
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:30,480
66.

675
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,760
75 is mostly black and Latino
and one 66 is, is mostly white.

676
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,530
And she felt right away sort of
a different vibe, you know, in,

677
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:43,800
in the building about how welcoming
they are to people of color. Um,

678
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,900
but a lot of the,
um,

679
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:52,580
a lot of the schools that are multiracial
do have lots of multiracial families

680
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,980
also because for them it's very
important. You know, if you have a,

681
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,330
a black mother and a white father,

682
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,940
you may not want your child
in an all black school,

683
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:07,200
but you don't want your child in an all
white school either. Um, so I would ask,

684
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,250
I would ask for the, um,
the, the parents, um,

685
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:15,470
I think a, a, a good, you know,
I should have brought our, uh,

686
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:19,620
I'll send you a link to our report
on integrated schools that work,

687
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,650
which is on the center for
New York City Affairs website.

688
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,680
And one of the things that really matters
is that the principal wants the school

689
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:29,784
to be integrated.

690
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,560
You'd be at the number of principals
who really don't care and are happy with

691
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:36,000
whatever the status quo is.

692
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,090
Okay.

693
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,650
Hi.
Um,

694
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,310
I'm in the middle of going through
the process with my four year old.

695
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,550
So it was just wondering if you had any
more insight or could explain more about

696
00:44:49,551 --> 00:44:54,020
the waitlist situation. Um,
and how that movement works.

697
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:58,940
Because being in May now and I were on
the wait list at five different programs

698
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,640
and wait list at five different programs
for pre K or for or breaking yeah.

699
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
And our wait list now,

700
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,900
like when I called the schools were like
114 on the list and number 42 on the

701
00:45:11,301 --> 00:45:13,210
list.
And since

702
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,170
pre k you're talking about,
yeah,

703
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,520
when I was being blessed say about
the weight lifts I was talking about

704
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:22,360
kindergarten, pre K it's a whole
different kettle of fish. You might have,

705
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,380
you know, 18 seats and
500 kids. So uh, applying.

706
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:30,350
So don't move or they don't let let,

707
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,880
let's talk afterwards a little bit about,
through your particular situation,

708
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:38,480
how do you manage between, so because
pre k is so different than kindergarten.

709
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,660
Like my understanding from everyone I
hear is that you have to go through this

710
00:45:41,661 --> 00:45:46,430
all over again for dinner. Isn't it
awful? I do believe it. It's just,

711
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:50,030
yeah. And then middle school
and high school to even plan.

712
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:54,740
Like what pre k you would want to go to
if like for consistency sake for your

713
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:59,670
kid. I mean consistency is
nice. It'd be great. You just,

714
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,640
it's not realistic.
Yeah.

715
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,130
I'm mean I have, I talked to
parents who have um, you know,

716
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:10,660
private nursery school for third for
the three year old and then public pre k

717
00:46:10,661 --> 00:46:13,180
for the four year old and then a
public school for the, you know,

718
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:17,440
when he's five and moving three times
since three years would drive me nuts. So,

719
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,670
you know,
I can understand.

720
00:46:18,671 --> 00:46:22,200
I think continuity is probably worth
spending a little money for if, if,

721
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:27,160
if you have to, um, but more
for you than for your child.

722
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:30,200
I mean, I think your child will
probably adjust with, you know,

723
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,430
the pre k situation.
It's only been around for two years.

724
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,680
They created 70,000 seats practically
overnight. That it's functioning is,

725
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:43,570
is, is a miracle. And that there
are, um, uh, but there are, uh,

726
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,190
certain neighborhoods of the city,

727
00:46:45,191 --> 00:46:48,400
there are just long wait lists and
they haven't figured it out yet.

728
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,550
It's shocking. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yeah.

729
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,500
So you said several times,
you know, principles,

730
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:56,530
the most important thing and you said, you
know, the principal can make it happen.

731
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,740
Now this school across the street from us,
it's ISP has 38,

732
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,880
the Pacific in Brooklyn,

733
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,820
all the comments talk about trouble with
the administration and the principal

734
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,481
not being good.

735
00:47:04,481 --> 00:47:07,720
And is there something that you can do
about that or is it just you avoid the

736
00:47:07,721 --> 00:47:09,130
school or,
I don't know what,

737
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,180
um, parents can lobby to
get rid of a principal.

738
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:17,770
They succeeded at two 82 which is
in park slope not too far from you.

739
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,960
Um, some at 38, they're trying to
like work around the principal.

740
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,200
There are a couple of schools that
managed to build a cohesive staff,

741
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:34,450
an inadequate principle. But um,
then you have to figure out why the,

742
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,081
you know,
some,

743
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:39,520
some parents have also gotten rid of
terrible a district superintendents in

744
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:43,510
Washington heights, parents
United to get rid of. So um, yeah,

745
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,420
get rid of or work
around or the two answers

746
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,740
does, does working around work,
like what do you think? That's cool.

747
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,090
It can be functional or is it really it's,

748
00:47:50,091 --> 00:47:51,980
it's kind of in trouble with
the principal like that.

749
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,180
I think you should talk to the
parents who were there every day. Um,

750
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:00,650
there are,
I agree with your assessment that said,

751
00:48:00,651 --> 00:48:02,810
there's some parents who were
very happy with the situation.

752
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:10,450
I wanted to go back a little bit to
the gifted and a very high functioning

753
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:11,300
district school questions.

754
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,520
So I went to a public magnet school that
was amazing and it was a really good

755
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:17,710
experience,
very along the lines of [inaudible].

756
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,790
So at the high school level
and it and where I came from,

757
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:25,660
there was definitely a concept of feeder
schools that there were middle schools

758
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:28,830
that gave rise to most of the high schools
and their elementary schools like a

759
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:30,190
rose to most of the middle schools.

760
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,420
Is there a feeder school style
set up here for the high school?

761
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:37,240
Alas, yes. Okay. There are, um,

762
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:40,600
another one of our reports on the center
for New York City's Ferris website

763
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:45,601
shows you what middle school feeders
there are to Stuyvesant in Brooklyn Tech

764
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:50,350
and the, and the specialized
high school. So, uh, yes,

765
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:54,310
but you don't have to worry
in kindergarten. Okay.
I think, yeah, I guess,

766
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:54,880
do they tend

767
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,690
to be the sort of like really good
neighborhood schools or do they tend to be

768
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:00,190
gifted schools or is it a mix?

769
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,453
Okay.

770
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,210
Don't worry about it in elementary. Okay.
Yeah, call me in five years and we'll,

771
00:49:05,211 --> 00:49:06,860
you know, we'll work it out, but it's,

772
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,400
I'm not pretending the system is
equitable and works well for everybody.

773
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,793
MMM.

774
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,940
We have three more minutes, I guess. Yes.

775
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,030
Okay. So, uh, I grew up in Europe
and I'm a lot more familiar,

776
00:49:18,031 --> 00:49:20,490
but the school systems there,
a lot of things are different here.

777
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,410
Two things that we
haven't really touched on.

778
00:49:22,411 --> 00:49:26,210
One of them was a that we learn that uh,

779
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,780
classes get new teachers every year and
instead of like one teacher taking down

780
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,140
throughout, I didn't know the
first five years of school.

781
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,320
Is that true across the board and most
public schools or are there differences

782
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:40,550
or what,
what's your opening?

783
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,990
Um, it's not the, it's not true.

784
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,270
Some schools have what they call looping,

785
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,190
which is I teach kindergarten this year
and first grade next year and then I go

786
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:52,870
back to kindergarten and then first grade.

787
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:57,340
So I have you have the same
teacher for two years. Um,

788
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:01,270
and if you put looping into our search
engine and you might find some schools

789
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:03,280
like that or in the book you can,
you can see some,

790
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,460
the other thing that they signed a few
schools have is what they call bridge

791
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:11,461
classes where you have both kindergarten
and first grade in one classroom and

792
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:14,290
you stay in that classroom with
the same teacher for two years.

793
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,790
So we do have some of that.
Rudolph Steiner School is private.

794
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:22,760
It's the only one I know of that
keeps the teachers for the whole, uh,

795
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:26,430
we keeps the kids for, you know, the
whole of their elementary school. Um,

796
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:30,800
the new American Academy might
do that as well in Brooklyn. Um,

797
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:32,510
I think they may have that European model.

798
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,200
You don't think there's real value in
data, right? It's just not common or,

799
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,420
oh, sure. I mean there's like any
of these things, there's, there's,

800
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:43,090
there's a advantages and drawbacks

801
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:47,200
and sort of other thing I wanted to touch
on is about the PTA where like people

802
00:50:47,201 --> 00:50:50,470
as how they can get involved and
do something where to school.

803
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:54,180
I sort of want as the opposite,
like in Europe, like schools,

804
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,230
suburb can you can't get
involved a little bit,

805
00:50:56,231 --> 00:51:01,231
but I sometimes feel there is like an
expectation or pressure for people to get

806
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:03,400
involved.
And I didn't even know.

807
00:51:03,401 --> 00:51:08,401
This isn't like a private preschool that
parents who don't get involved are cold

808
00:51:08,801 --> 00:51:09,850
out or it's like,

809
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,090
like I think it's,

810
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:18,190
I mean the other difference between the
United States and Europe is that our

811
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:23,640
schools are supported through local taxes,
mostly property taxes.

812
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,720
And in,
in most countries of the world,

813
00:51:27,721 --> 00:51:29,970
it's a national system where
everybody gets the same.

814
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,830
All the teachers get the
same pay and the same,

815
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,960
the schools all get the same resources.

816
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:38,760
So what we do in New York City is we
have these insane PCAs that, you know,

817
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:41,130
raise $1 million a year.
Um,

818
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,960
I agree with you that it's lunacy.
Um,

819
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,380
some schools will pressure you.
Um,

820
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:53,730
some actually have a kind of
parents stay out attitudes.

821
00:51:53,731 --> 00:51:58,100
So it varies from school
to school. Um, yeah.

822
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,260
I mean I agree with you.
It's ridiculous. Thank you.

823
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:05,080
What are your thoughts on dual language
programs and how effective they are for

824
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:09,700
a native speakers of English
are very good questions.

825
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:14,310
So we have in the, in the end of the book
you'll find a dual language programs.

826
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:19,020
There's a Chinese, Spanish,
Polish, Italian, um,

827
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:23,730
Haitian creole, French,
Mandarin. Um, there's even,

828
00:52:23,731 --> 00:52:28,350
there's one in Korean as well.
Um, and some of the children,

829
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:32,580
the way they're supposed to be designed
as half the children speak English at

830
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:33,860
home.
Um,

831
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:38,370
half of them speak the other language
and they alternate the language of

832
00:52:38,371 --> 00:52:40,140
instruction from day to day.

833
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:44,070
And the kids who are supposed to be fluent
in both languages by the time they're

834
00:52:44,071 --> 00:52:48,090
in fifth grade, the um, some
of them work very well indeed.

835
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,930
Um,
it also depends on the language.

836
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:57,020
I think a Chinese and Korean are very
hard for non native speakers to learn just

837
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,360
in that,
in that six hours a day.

838
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,680
Some of the successful Chinese dual
language programs continue until five

839
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:08,940
o'clock in the afternoon, particularly
for writing. That's difficult for Spanish.

840
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:13,170
I think non native speakers come
out doing, you know, pretty well.

841
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:18,420
Um, and there's also a, um,
uh, like everything else,
there's a range of quality.

842
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,300
Some of them, it's just sort of
a little smattering the language.

843
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:26,100
You'll learn to sing some
songs. Um, others are, you

844
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,300
really learn to write and spell and speak
about science and the second language.

845
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:35,490
So there's a arranged there.
So it's one o'clock.

846
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:38,830
I think we have to wrap up,
so thank you so much.

847
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,090
[inaudible].
