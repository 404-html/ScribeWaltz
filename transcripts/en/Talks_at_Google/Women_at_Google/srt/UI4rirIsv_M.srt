1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,830
Thank you guys all for coming today. Uh,
I would like to present Ruth Whitman,

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,460
we're here today to talk about
her book America, the anxious, uh,

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,880
why are search for happiness is driving
us crazy and how to find it for real.

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,450
Um, as a quick introduction to Ruth is
a British journalist and has contributed

5
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:26,520
pieces to the New York Times,
The Guardian,

6
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:28,290
the independence and the Huffington Post.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,920
She previously worked for BBC where she
was releasing numerous documentaries and

8
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:39,120
in her book she examines what's gone wrong
with American happiness and why it is

9
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:43,650
leading such an anxious and ultimately
unhappy society and what can be done

10
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:47,820
about it. Um, my name is Nisha Hoti,
Emma, long time Googler. Um, and yeah,

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,740
so do you like to tell
us more about yourself?

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,241
Um,
so yeah.

13
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:56,241
Well we moved to California about six
years ago from the UK and it was quite a

14
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:00,360
culture shock. You know, my
background is in journalism. Um,

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,720
do you want me to tell you
a bit more about, yeah, what
prompted [inaudible]? Yeah,

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,530
yeah. Okay. Well, when,
when we first got here,

17
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:12,360
we came because my husband got a job
working in a tech startup and it was quite

18
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:14,220
a leap into the dark for us,
you know,

19
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:19,080
and I had given up my job in journalism
back in the UK and everyday he would

20
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:23,820
kind of shut the door to going off to
work and I'd have these 12 Calvinists

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,690
hours of time to fill before I could
have, uh, an adult conversation again.

22
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,070
And know we had a young baby at the time.

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,810
So I was sort of putting myself out
there and trying to make, um, you know,

24
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:34,920
as many people as I could,

25
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:38,130
having lots of random conversations with
senior people in the dry cleaners and

26
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,090
the grocery store and you know,
um, in the park with my son.

27
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,800
And I found very quickly that
this strange thing was happening.

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,020
I seem to be having the same conversation
over and over again. You know,

29
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:55,710
different people, different situations,
different, you know, different,

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,150
different scenarios.

31
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:02,151
But the same topic just kept on coming
up and this was some variation on this

32
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,270
theme of happiness.
I painful,

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,720
we're talking about happiness almost as
a real source of anxiety in their lives.

34
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:13,350
You know, people were kind of asking
these really big questions of themselves,

35
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,570
you know, am I happy? Am I happy enough?

36
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,270
Am I as happy as all my friends that
I see on social media? You know,

37
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,440
could I be happier if I was following
my passion? But what is my passionate,

38
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,470
you know,
what did this?

39
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:26,430
And there seemed to be this real gap
between what people expected in terms of

40
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:30,000
their happiness and how happy
that actually were feeling.

41
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,060
And you know,
and so I was kind of prompted.

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,270
I was really fascinated to do and it
was a real cultural difference because I

43
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:40,260
think in the UK, you know, happiness
is that a little bit suspect. You know,

44
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:44,400
you don't want to show too many
overt signs of being too, too,

45
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,990
too happy. So I just was, I
was, I wanted to look into it.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,610
And what I found was that, um, you know,

47
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,260
you would think given the kind of cultural
focus on happiness here in the states

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,740
and the amount of money and time and
effort that people put into becoming

49
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,250
happier, you would think Americans would
be the happiest people on the planet.

50
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,730
But statistically, you know,
they actually ranked very,

51
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,080
very far down the list of happiness.

52
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,450
So that was kind of my starting
point for writing this book.

53
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,670
I just wanted to find out why, you know,
what's going wrong and you know, what,

54
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,360
how we could, you know, how,

55
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,740
how we can find out what
really makes for a happy life.

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,510
Yeah. Um, one thing that you defined it
in the book, almost like a rat race. Yeah.

57
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,320
Happiness. Um, what did
you mean by that exactly?

58
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,140
Yeah. I mean that the
expression, asset of happiness,

59
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,860
rat race kind of came to me when people
would kind of talk about happiness

60
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,510
almost in the same way that people
talk about going on a diet. You know,

61
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,380
there's not much pleasure involved in it.
But you know,

62
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,010
if I just read this book and do
this meditation App and you know,

63
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,330
go to this in my gratitude journal and
be more mindful and Damon positive and be

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,150
well this, then, then I
can be happy. You know?

65
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:52,440
And it sort of felt like it was really
a lot of hard work, happiness, you know,

66
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,930
there wasn't much pleasure involved in it.

67
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,040
And something that's interesting. You've,
you have had all these experiences,

68
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,850
you've talked to all these people who
seem to be filling their life with all

69
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:05,340
these measures to become happier. Yeah.
But when you look at it statistically,

70
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:07,190
if United States,
maybe one of them,

71
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,600
the least happy countries and also our
happiness levels really haven't changed

72
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,910
in quite some time. That's
correct. Right, right. Yeah.

73
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,650
So, um, when you look at
the actual data on this, um,

74
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:23,110
despite spending more time and money and
emotional energy and trying to kind of

75
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,490
become happier compared to
other developed nations,

76
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:32,690
Americans as some of the least happy
people and in the Western world.

77
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:35,660
And actually there was a study
that came out a year or so ago,

78
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:40,661
which actually put the day
to day contentment of people
in the U S at two places

79
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:45,350
behind Rwanda. I mean, if you just
think about that for a moment, you know,

80
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,840
Rwanda is a country that has suffered a
major collective psychological trauma,

81
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,660
but yet people that we're writing
is more content than, you know,

82
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,150
American office workers.
So that really kind of,

83
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,360
that was a paradox that made me
want to know more and you know,

84
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,020
find out what was going wrong.
Exactly.

85
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,730
And are there,

86
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,650
are there key differences that you
noticed specifically for moving from

87
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,620
okay to the United States
and whatever that was?

88
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,770
I think that there are a
lot of differences in the
way that people talk about

89
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:19,730
happiness. I think there's a real
focus in the u s and you know,

90
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,940
I think this is a good thing in
many ways, but there was a real, um,

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,150
valuing of people being positive,
you know,

92
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:30,600
people being cheerful and positive all
the time and appearing happy in a being

93
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,550
happy and also looking
happy to everybody else.

94
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,200
And don't be a Downer and everything.

95
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,070
And I think in the UK maybe people are
a little bit more dated and I actually,

96
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:43,470
a big kind of negativity is almost
part of the culture in a way. You know,

97
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:48,120
it's not expected that people would
have such a in a such a high level of,

98
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,170
of, of happiness all the time and people
don't go after it and quite such a

99
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,660
relentless way I think.
Yeah.

100
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,030
So let's take a step back then and
then talk about the book for a second.

101
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,570
Could you give us a brief
kind of quick outline?

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,430
I found it really interesting how you
went about examining this rat race. Um,

103
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,430
could you give us a brief outline
of, of what you did? Yeah, so, um,

104
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,940
I did lots of different things.
I spent a lot of time,

105
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,970
I am sound put quite a few of
the south help offerings that,

106
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,450
that people are selling.
You know,

107
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:21,290
I realize this is south help in this
country is a multibillion dollar industry.

108
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,350
A lot of money is changing hands in this
pursuit of happiness and this and this

109
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,900
idea that we can kind of control our
happiness and make ourselves happier.

110
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,740
So I did the landmark forum. I don't
know if any of you have heard of that,

111
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:34,131
but it was,

112
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:39,131
it's a very popular self
help kind of weekend,

113
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,760
four day course that's incredibly intense.
And you know,

114
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:47,150
I went through everything on this
spectrum of emotion while I was doing that

115
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:51,710
from sheer terror to
depression, to anxiety, to joy,

116
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,790
to all, all of it. I spent time, um,

117
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,580
with uh, I went to Las Vegas
where I spent time in, um,

118
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,430
Tony Shay, who is the CEO of
Zappos, the shoe retailer.

119
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,500
He has a kind of happiness,
um,

120
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,080
city almost that he's set
up in downtown Las Vegas.

121
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:13,280
He's bought up a whole load of land and
is running it as a kind of happiness

122
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:17,330
community based on principles
of positive psychology and um,

123
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,840
you know, on the idea that you
can maximize people's happiness.

124
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,810
And that was a very sort
of strange place to be.

125
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,690
And I spent time with Mormons in Utah.

126
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,950
The moments actually rate as statistically
as the happiest people in America and

127
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,360
but actually what,

128
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,100
what makes this slightly more complexes
that they also have the highest rate of

129
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:38,300
antidepressant use.

130
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,920
So I was kind of trying to unpick what
was going on there and I looked at the

131
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,090
workplace, some trends and kind of
happiness engineering in the workplace.

132
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,390
I looked at parenting,

133
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,710
social media and I spent some time looking
at the kind of academic research on

134
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:55,240
happiness, which frankly was the most
joyous part of the whole endeavor.

135
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,790
Academic studies on happiness are
really quite dry. Yeah. And so in,

136
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,070
in listening and reading a good book.
Yeah.

137
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,030
It was really interesting to see how
you jumped from one topic to the next in

138
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:12,500
this overall vision of what you perceived
the United States to be in terms of

139
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:13,760
this pursuit for happiness.

140
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,500
Which one of those experiences did
you find to be the most revealing?

141
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,810
Huh? That's an interesting question.
I mean, I think it's hard to pick one.

142
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:28,090
I mean don't to to spend some time at
the downtown project in, in the, um,

143
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,960
you know, the Las Vegas thing that was
talking about where, you know, this very,

144
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:37,070
very wealthy tech billionaire has brought
people from all over the United States

145
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,400
to live in this, in this community
and work as entrepreneurs.

146
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,590
And that's this kind of
semi communal living,

147
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,640
a lot of it where they people live and
work in the same place and they've kind

148
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:49,010
of maximized happiness by,
you know,

149
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,730
putting the buildings in certain
places and the square, you know,

150
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,040
how many people per square foot
and everything is so planned.

151
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,490
And one of the really kind of shocking
things was in this site called happiness

152
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,324
community,

153
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,770
they ended up having one of the highest
suicide rates in the United States.

154
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:09,771
So I'm in that was a very dark and awful
tragic but also kind of fascinating.

155
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,740
And I think it sort of had partly to do
and a lot of the people that were saying

156
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,030
that it partly had to do with this
extreme pressure to be happy all the time.

157
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,240
You know, the I think really
kind of stress people out.

158
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,610
And that was the thing
that I kept coming back to.

159
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,360
Yeah.

160
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,960
I think it's an interesting topic too
for discussion because in the tech world,

161
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:31,170
a lot of what we're discussing
today is how can the Internet,

162
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,810
Internet of things
influence your surrounding.

163
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:36,960
So whether it's your home or whether
it's the city itself that you live in,

164
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,290
how can being surrounded by technology
create a more fruitful life,

165
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:45,600
a happier life. Um, from your experience,

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,950
was that something that was most relevant
to the time that you spend in downtown?

167
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,210
Was technology ever present and did it
cause more happiness or was it rather

168
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,420
something else that calls
people to commit suicide?

169
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,250
I am. I'm in, all of these things
are quite complex. I mean the,

170
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,750
the downtown project,

171
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,840
I mean there was a slight sense at the
beginning that they were going to use

172
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,674
happiness.

173
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,790
That they were going to use technology
even more to kind of monitor where people

174
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,031
went.

175
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:16,030
And they had this idea that everyone was
going to wear a wristband to measure,

176
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,120
you know, how many social interactions
they had and how happy they were.

177
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,070
And this technology actually exists.

178
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:24,370
I mean I found that they weren't actually
using this response in the downtown

179
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:27,610
project,
but they do use them in many companies.

180
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:30,670
This has become something that your boss
can kind of monitor how happy you are

181
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,800
and how productive you are and
how the two relate to each other.

182
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,310
And there was something very big
brotherish and sinister about that.

183
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,660
And I think in terms of the way that most
people use technology and the Internet,

184
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:43,870
I mean it's no one thing. I mean
technology is kind of what you make of it.

185
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,030
And I think there's good and bad in that.

186
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:49,810
I mean I looked at social media was a
big thing that I looked at and I think

187
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:54,250
that can bring it so, and anxieties. I
think it sort of raises the expectations.

188
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:56,680
It's the way that we use social media now.
You know,

189
00:10:56,681 --> 00:11:00,220
Instagram and Facebook trying
to make our lives looking quite,

190
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:02,500
it was almost like a personal
PR project has it, you know,

191
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,420
your Facebook profile
and how happy you look.

192
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:07,720
And here I am having so much fun and all
these different situations and I think

193
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:12,100
that in itself has kind of raise the
stakes for anxiety. So many of us,

194
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,040
one of the things that
I really loved about,

195
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,490
and I thought it's so relevant
to my life was two things.

196
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:21,650
First and foremost tell you, you're right,
social media becomes this PR, right?

197
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,250
It really,
it is your brand and it's unrespectful.

198
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,170
But then you also mentioned in your
book that it's also creating a sanitized

199
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:30,270
version of your life to
a degree. Right? Right.

200
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,100
And maybe even replacing some kind of
interpersonal communication you have with

201
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:35,800
other people.

202
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,690
Hi, I'm in. It's kind
of become an Oms, rice.

203
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,050
And I think we all did it to a certain
extent. And I find myself doing it.

204
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,270
Even having written a book about this,
you know,

205
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,290
I find myself doing the same thing. Like,
for instance, you know, when we went,

206
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,900
um, I took my kids apple picking in a,
in a sort of local orchard recently.

207
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,180
Frankly, the day was kind of
miserable. I mean, we did, you know,

208
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,000
the kids were whining the whole time.
It was really hard.

209
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,530
Everybody was kind of butchered.
The APP was rural, mushy.

210
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,980
And then the five times the w
ended up on Facebook of this day,

211
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:12,250
the one probably many second and the
entire day when everyone was smiling and

212
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:14,530
posing and whatever.
That's what ended up there.

213
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,670
And anyone looking at that thing
would've thought, you know,

214
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,790
there's what a great day she's having.
And you know what?

215
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,020
I wish my life was like that. Meanwhile,
you know, just sort of thinking,

216
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,450
how come that God that's over,
you know, and it's, you know,

217
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,480
the way that we kind of
curate our lives now,

218
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:33,010
I think it does give a very
unrepresentative picture
of what happiness looks

219
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:36,850
like. And I think that is adding
to this anxiety of, you know,

220
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,990
my life really should be like this and
it's on my hair and you know, this gap.

221
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:41,850
Yeah,

222
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,340
that's very true. Um, one thing
I wanted to touch upon was, uh,

223
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,480
really diving into your experiences
with the self help community.

224
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,240
The landmark forum is kind of
the pinnacle one in your book.

225
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,500
Then there's a few other ones. It's
an elementary schools as well. Um,

226
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,570
and you do a really good job of just
bashing on these forums and these pundits

227
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,060
who really examining in a,
in a,

228
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:07,820
in a crude way like almost
other swindling people. Um,

229
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,700
what do you think from what you saw
attracted people to the form and then also

230
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:15,160
it's even ray up and say
like all do level two,

231
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,520
right? Well, I mean this
thing it's, it's also,

232
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,980
I mean I think that the naturally,

233
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:24,310
the type of people who are attracted
to south help tend to be in the more

234
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:25,570
vulnerable end of things.
I mean,

235
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,200
you don't go on a self help course
when your life is already bullet in.

236
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,430
I see you,
you know,

237
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:34,180
you're already dealing with people who
have issues and problems and this is a

238
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,500
business.
I mean this is,

239
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,800
there was a lot of money changing
hands and that it is in these people's

240
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:41,590
interest to take out as
much money as possible,

241
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:44,950
which is not to say that everybody in the
south end health industry as some kind

242
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:45,731
of,
you know,

243
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:48,760
Charlatan or fraudster or whatever
that's trying to steal your money.

244
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,810
But I think there was an
element of that in this thing.

245
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:57,130
And I think the landmark forum was a
very, very intense program. I mean,

246
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,420
you're in this room,

247
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,920
it's a kind of conference room and
you're there for a very long hours.

248
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:06,310
You have very limited
breaks. Um, your, you know,

249
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,250
it's till 10 o'clock at night and you're
just getting all this information and

250
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:12,970
everybody's sharing these incredibly dark
moments from their lives and you feel

251
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,330
very, very vulnerable, you
know, and those moments.

252
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:17,500
And then they come in at just
the crucial moment and say, well,

253
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:19,560
maybe you'd like to sign up for
the next course and you not,

254
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:22,910
you're whipping about, they had a
terrible childhood and whatever,

255
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:26,470
and you're like, okay, whatever, whatever,
I'll pay whatever it takes. And you know,

256
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,940
I, it was a very powerful emotional
experience being there, you know,

257
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:31,830
and not necessarily

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,290
for the good, that's for
sure. Was there a for a time,

259
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,970
because I imagined in
researching this book,

260
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,610
you want it to you as much information.
He's good. Was ever a time where like,

261
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:42,440
I don't want to go to another
self up for them and yeah,

262
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,120
but you force yourself to do so.

263
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,500
Yeah. I mean, what the, you
know, it's funny it, the deed,

264
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,900
when it came to the landmark forum,

265
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:52,340
I actually did the landmark forum before
the bucket kind of went the other way

266
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:54,710
round. And that was one of the things,
you know, everyone had told me, you know,

267
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:57,260
do this thing. It's amazing. It's amazing.
Amazing, amazing. You've got to go.

268
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,360
And it was partly,

269
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,330
it was sort of almost the other way
round that I did the forum thinking, um,

270
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,570
just because I'd want it to be happier,
you know,

271
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,320
I was kind of lonely and
my new country and um,

272
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,610
and I went and that was part of what led
to the book rather than the other way

273
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,880
around. But yeah, I'm in through email.

274
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,550
Debus I did a lot of this kind of
mindfulness workshops. I did meditation,

275
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:20,200
I did various things and a lot of
the time I did sort of say, Oh God,

276
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,920
not another one.
But you know,

277
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,290
at the same time I want it
to be open to these things.

278
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,790
I didn't want to start from the position
that this is all a load of rubbish and

279
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,980
you know, just, you know,
w I wanted to see what,

280
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,400
what actually worked and what didn't.

281
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,960
Um, and, and you bring
up a good point too,

282
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:40,280
and the majority of people that are maybe
going to a self folk forum or reading

283
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:44,390
a book about self help or an
actual need of help or other,

284
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,410
or are seeking some kind of answers
from the people that you interacted with

285
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:52,620
from people that you met. Do they,
they find answers in these books? Um,

286
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,820
did they, did they experience
some kind of transformation?

287
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,740
Well, I think a lot of people
do. I mean, that's an atmosphere,

288
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,600
kind of like a tent revival. And there's
a lot of these places where it's like,

289
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,010
ah, yes. And everyone gets whipped
up into this kind of [inaudible].

290
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,720
And then the most successful people in
this industry are the people who can

291
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:12,280
really prey on those emotions and kind of
whip people up into a kind of a frenzy.

292
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,350
And I think people do
feel very transformed.

293
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,910
But then one of their kind of depressing
statistics is that the most likely

294
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:22,630
customer of a self help book is
somebody who's bought another self help.

295
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:24,370
But within the last 18 months.

296
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,360
So there's obviously something where
people get on it kind of spiral and you

297
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:28,481
know,

298
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:32,580
none of these things are
actually providing quite
the answers that the people

299
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,790
are hoping for. And I think, you know,

300
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,550
you raised an interesting point when you
said these are the people who need help.

301
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,800
There's something about
in this whole idea it,

302
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:41,470
so it's a very American idea in a way.

303
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,470
This idea that our happiness is
something that we can control, you know,

304
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,120
that self help, you know, rather
than helping others or that you know,

305
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:52,480
that help should be provided from some
other source or that you are entitled to

306
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:53,261
help. It's like, you know,

307
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:56,830
go out and help yourself and pull
yourself up by your bootstraps and make

308
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,830
yourself happier. I don't know if you've
ever seen these memes that say, you know,

309
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,340
happiness is a choice. You know,
there's a quite a common phrase here.

310
00:17:03,341 --> 00:17:04,820
It's almost like if you don't,
you know,

311
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:07,910
it's your responsibility to
make yourself happier. Yeah.

312
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,450
Which can be quite insanity
inducing in itself.

313
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,950
And that's, that's definitely
an interesting point you
bring up in the book,

314
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:17,951
which is that in America it seems that
we're really seeking ice happiness in

315
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,250
isolation.
Yeah.

316
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,540
And is that starkly different from your
experiences not having lived in the

317
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,370
country?

318
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:24,491
Well,

319
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:29,380
so this is one of the things that I
cat's coming back to in my research,

320
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:34,381
which is that pretty much every piece
of research that's ever been done and to

321
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:39,370
human happiness and no matter how much
that all these studies all kind of

322
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:40,780
contradicted themselves in other ways.

323
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,090
There is one factor that we know is like
the single biggest cause of happiness

324
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:49,920
and that is our social connections
or relationships with other people,

325
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,510
but yet the south hop industry and are
kind of conception of happiness is moving

326
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:57,750
more and more and more towards
being about the self. And you know,

327
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:02,100
a lot of the activities that we're
taking part in now like meditation,

328
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:04,260
like mindfulness, like
yoga, like you know,

329
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:08,520
they're all about having a very private
emotional experience about looking

330
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:12,900
within your soul and Gina being
internal rather than external.

331
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,420
And I think that's one of the,
one of the real problems.

332
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,940
I think that was one of the key findings
that really made me think, okay,

333
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:21,350
this might be where we're going
slightly wrong. And you know,

334
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,910
I think it's a trend that's true
in other western countries as well.

335
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:27,960
We're living increasingly
isolated lives. But, um,

336
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,150
I think in America there's
a very individualistic
culture and I think that is,

337
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,130
you know, and our approach
to happiness is, you know,

338
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:38,580
me and my happiness journey and my quest
for happiness and how can I make myself

339
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:41,640
happier, which is probably going
about it in slightly the wrong way.

340
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,180
And I've only really first and needing
to listen to the stories that you bring

341
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:49,510
up specifically the grown a yoga and
meditation help people would be so doing

342
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:53,430
that four or five yoga classes a week
to try and get that sense of fulfillment

343
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,070
and happiness and mindfulness. Um, and it,

344
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:59,520
it had kind of opened the door to maybe
a different world than, than I would see.

345
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,000
Cause I don't know many friends that
are doing yoga on a day to day basis in

346
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:06,390
order to view your content through
in order to build that happiness. Um,

347
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,110
from what you saw,
do you think that maybe,

348
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,610
I don't know if extreme is the right word,

349
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:14,190
but where they extreme
examples of the Sikh,

350
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,790
is this the seeking out of there
can cause, yeah. I mean, you know,

351
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,670
I don't want to give the wrong impression
that I think that yoga is the cause of

352
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:23,520
all the problems because
obviously that's not true.

353
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,860
But I think it's about a kind of mindset.

354
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:30,861
I think California is kind of the world
headquarters of self actualization,

355
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:33,030
isn't it? So I think the things
that you see here in California,

356
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,570
and maybe a little, oh a little more
extreme than you would see elsewhere,

357
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,530
but these trends do hold true. You
know, across the country. You know,

358
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:43,500
you think about Oprah and the influence
that she's had and it's all about,

359
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,440
you know, my personal
happiness journey and you know,

360
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,990
my own responsibility for my happiness.
And you know, a lot of these, um,

361
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,560
you know, these, the, the whole sort
of yoga, mindfulness meditation,

362
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,400
what I've come to think of as the
spiritual industrial complex, I mean,

363
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:03,100
that is worth about $20 billion to
the economy. I mean, it's, it's,

364
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,270
it's a lot of money changing
hands it units, it's very popular.

365
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,700
So these self help forums, you've
software books are to a degree useful,

366
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,050
but maybe not there. Maybe will
hold all the answers for us. Right.

367
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,270
From your research, what do you think
could lead Americans to have your life?

368
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,720
Well, I think that what I found,
just again and again and again,

369
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:28,980
whether that was through the kind of
field work or the academic staff or

370
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:29,550
whatever,

371
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,550
is that the key to happiness really
is in relationships and other people.

372
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:35,401
And you know,

373
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:39,480
I could say this all the time and one of
the most common responses that I get is

374
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,700
people say, well, you
know, that's fair enough,

375
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:46,350
but that doesn't apply to me because
I'm an introvert and I hate other people

376
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:49,590
and you know, rather just sit in my
basement. That ends to it. I'd never,

377
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,610
never talked to anyone, but actually
all the research supports that, uh,

378
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,570
the fact that the,

379
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,700
the importance of social connection is
just as true and important for introverts

380
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:04,290
as it is for extroverts. It might manifest
in a slightly different way. You know,

381
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,170
it might not be going to lots of huge
parties and being the center of attention,

382
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,260
but I'm still,
you know,

383
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,670
the importance of having supportive
relationships is just an author.

384
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:20,240
It's not just for our happiness,
it's for our health. Um, um,

385
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,060
low social connection or loneliness is,
has carries with it.

386
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:29,090
I risk of premature death comparable to
that of smoking and it's about twice as

387
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:34,180
dangerous to be lonely as it
is to be a base, you know,

388
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:37,450
and you think how much money and effort
we put into dieting and not big on base,

389
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:41,350
you know, when actually, you know, here's,
here's an answer, which is so important.

390
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,310
Right?
Yeah.

391
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,490
There was an interesting part of the,
um,

392
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,700
at the end of the book talking about the
genetic component of happiness and how

393
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,700
you kind of have this like biological
marker of where you're going to always be

394
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:54,470
happy and then you can have your words.

395
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:59,240
Was there ever any information or studies
that you've found that showed maybe

396
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:02,480
that that fulfillment and that the
biological market could be tweaked upward?

397
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:04,470
Not, not necessarily change?
Yeah, at the baseline,

398
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,940
but like social interactions with the
things that made that mark or move up?

399
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:08,950
I don't even know if it's measurable.

400
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,120
Yes.
I mean,

401
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,000
I think there's been various ways to
measure it and I think that people are

402
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:16,180
generally agreed that there's a
big genetic component to happiness.

403
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:18,950
So people have a kind of happiness
set point that they keep returning to.

404
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
But you can kind of walk around it a bit.

405
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,760
What were the whole positive psychology
movement has become slightly political,

406
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:32,761
slightly ideological is that it very much
downplays the idea of circumstances on

407
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,210
our happiness. I'm very much plays
up the idea of individual control.

408
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
So there's a lot of research
now and it's kind of,

409
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:45,601
a lot of it is funded by a very right
wing by a very what right wing bias

410
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:48,250
organization that this
belief that you know,

411
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,120
we can kind of is this bit straps idea
that we can make ourselves happier by,

412
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,700
by trying all this stuff and you know,

413
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:55,660
it's kind of your responsibility
and if you're not happy,

414
00:22:55,661 --> 00:23:00,340
it's almost like it's your own fault
and downplays all these factors like,

415
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,140
you know, um, income, race, social
class, you know, so social projects,

416
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:08,800
which actually is not a fair reading. I
don't, I believe it's based on a very,

417
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,810
very fluid reading of the,
of the data.

418
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,660
And actually circumstances
do make a huge difference.

419
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,000
So maybe a, an an open ended question is
we have all these things. We have yoga,

420
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:20,760
we have, we have meditation
to, to build mindfulness. Um,

421
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,440
religion is something that you discussed,

422
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,140
you and that religious people
are statistically more happy,

423
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:29,280
but maybe in real life those statistics
don't necessarily hit all the actual,

424
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,960
the reality with, with all
of these things. Um, how,

425
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,550
how do they get built into a happy
life while also maintaining it? Yeah.

426
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,431
Well,

427
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:42,660
the religion thing that you just mentioned
is really interesting because across

428
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:46,490
the world it's, it's pretty robust
finding that religious people do, right?

429
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,170
As happier than nonreligious people.

430
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,210
And I think the temptation is to think
that that is because people have this

431
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:55,400
kind of private belief in God and this,

432
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,720
this certainty that things will be okay
because there's an afterlife or whatever.

433
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,080
But when you control for the fact that
religious people have much greater number

434
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,370
and quality of social connections,
when you control for that in the study,

435
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:10,580
it's the difference disappears.

436
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:14,990
So actually the reason why religious
people tend to rate us happier than other

437
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:18,560
people is because they have such a
strong sense of community generally.

438
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,560
And when I went to spend
time with movements in Utah,
that was a huge finding.

439
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:22,881
You know,

440
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:26,330
I was staying with a Mormon family and
we were sitting there for half an hour

441
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:26,840
and their living room.

442
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,840
And I think 10 different people stop by
for drop off some cookies or a cup of

443
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,890
tea, not a cup of tea.
They don't drink tea,

444
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:38,720
but that's my Britishness and whatever,
you know, a drink or something.

445
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,160
And you know,

446
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:43,790
so I think it is that sense of community
that really is at the heart of why

447
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:48,080
religion, you know, does
it make people happier? Um,

448
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,660
so maybe,
uh,

449
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,620
a point for the audience as a guardians
of technology at Google arbiters of new

450
00:24:57,051 --> 00:25:00,350
things. One recommendations
would you have to us as we,

451
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,940
as we build technology for people,
um, from what you've seen in terms of,

452
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,193
in terms of happiness,

453
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,440
one of the key things that
we say at Google is like
gold to me that someone will

454
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,980
look to use. Um, almost like a toothbrush
experience. It's kind of when things,

455
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:13,814
it's like you want to use them,

456
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,650
you wanted to use it every single
day cause they love it so much.

457
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,450
It's so useful when we're building these
things. What should we be considering?

458
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,690
Wow, that's a big question. I, if I,

459
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,200
if I knew that I'd be making a lot
more money than I, than I am now. Um,

460
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:28,971
I think,
you know,

461
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:33,260
technology is a competitive thing because
it can be a force for connection and

462
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,220
bringing people together.

463
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:37,370
And it can also be a force for isolating
people as well and keeping people

464
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:40,870
locked in their own smartphone
and not, I've been, um,

465
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,910
this is not Google, but I
remember one of the, you know,

466
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,870
one of these moments when I was
researching, there's Burke and I thought,

467
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:48,421
oh my God,

468
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:52,970
do you know this is the end
of civilization was when
I downloaded a happiness

469
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,500
app to my phone and I went onto the
APP store and there's like a thousand

470
00:25:57,501 --> 00:26:01,370
different options for happiness apps
that you can eat conducted, you know,

471
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:02,640
they'll,
you know,

472
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,940
send you pictures of sunsets
and puppies and beaches and,

473
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,580
and there was this one liquid,
you know,

474
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,230
send you pictures of your own loved ones
so that you could kind of sit looking

475
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,450
at your phone, scrolling through
pictures of your loved ones. Well,

476
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,200
presumably your actual loved ones.
I like looking at pictures of you maybe,

477
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,630
I don't know,
on their phone.

478
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,540
And I remember there was this one time
when the one that I downloaded actually

479
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,110
we'd send you these kind of positive
affirmations every hour or so throughout

480
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:30,720
the day. And you're supposed to repeat
them. So it was, you know, I am beautiful,

481
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,240
I am enough for whatever it was.

482
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:36,380
And I remember like the problem was
every time my phone buzzed when I got a

483
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:39,900
message from this thing,
I get that Pavlovian kind of jealous of,

484
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,080
Oh someone sending me a
message. Great. You know,

485
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:44,580
somebody wants to go out and
meet for coffee or you know,

486
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:49,320
it's a friend or whatever. And then
it would say, you know, I am enough.

487
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,060
And I think the cross the cross the
thing, cause the whole point is, you know,

488
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:56,580
I am not enough and I think
if we are really looking to,

489
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,030
to an APP to make us happy
that something's gone.

490
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,920
And then just kind of put a little bit
on the research you did around social

491
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:07,310
media. Have you found that, um,

492
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,800
at least in your research that a lot
of people have replaced those in person

493
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:14,070
connections, those interpersonal
connections with your phone,

494
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:14,860
with your application?

495
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,161
Yeah,

496
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:18,640
I think that's quite good evidence to
show that that has definitely happened.

497
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:22,570
And especially for the kind of
millennials and younger generation,

498
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:24,240
I think there is a lot of um,

499
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,390
concern over the fact that people are
replacing real world interactions with

500
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,770
online once you know, smartphone.
Yeah. Thanks for sure.

501
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,760
Cool. Well I think we're going to open
it up to questions from the audience. Um,

502
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,410
and as well as on the dory. Uh,
Alison, if he's still in the room, uh,

503
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,450
I think he has a mic that he can
pass around. I think someone had fun.

504
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,640
Hi. Oh, hi. Oh, so one of the
topics that you kind of pointed out,

505
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:57,050
like regarding this whole stress of
trying to be happy is like the whole like

506
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,530
self help community and like
whatever. But like, yeah. Oh,

507
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,820
also the other thing I kind of I'm
curious about is like what about the

508
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:08,850
contribution of the family? Like,
because like one of the things I see, I,

509
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:09,740
I could be wrong,

510
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:14,741
but my understanding is also like we are
in this trend where like probably the

511
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:17,800
kids are being like either or pamper,

512
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,830
like this whole notion of having any
kind of negative emotion is like, oh,

513
00:28:21,831 --> 00:28:24,830
something is like extremely wrong.
Rather than just teaching them,

514
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,400
it's just part of life and like, yes, oh,

515
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,100
you need to just go through it and like
kind of teach them how to handle it.

516
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:32,040
So yeah.
Oh,

517
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,110
how much is that also contributing and
creating like generations of people who

518
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:38,420
are like kind of probably
extremely confused about

519
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,270
what is right.
It's an excellent point.

520
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:45,140
I actually wrote a whole chapter
about parenting and, sorry,

521
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,490
I lost my thing here. So sorry. Um, yeah,

522
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:53,450
I write a whole chapter in the book
about parenting and exactly what you're

523
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:55,670
describing. I think
there's this, you know,

524
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,170
in the same way that there's this feeling
that we can kind of force ourselves to

525
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,460
be happy with enough hard work.

526
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,180
There's also a kind of parallel feeling
that we can kind of build this half a

527
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:06,020
happy child,

528
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,650
that if we just make every moment
kind of magical and we take away every

529
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:14,000
negative sense and every negative emotion,
prioritize positivity above all else,

530
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:18,770
then we will turn out this perfectly
happy kids and it's backfiring, you know,

531
00:29:18,771 --> 00:29:19,880
really badly.
I mean,

532
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,820
some of the examples that I came
across when most of the book,

533
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:26,600
we're actually quite ridiculous and
humorous. You know that there was this,

534
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:30,320
one thing I was so shocked by when I
first moved here was that a friend of mine

535
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:32,690
left her two year old,

536
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:36,620
I think two and a half year old with
another mom while she went to run some

537
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:38,450
errands and this woman,

538
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:42,820
the other woman breastfed
this friend's child,

539
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:47,500
this friends to road because she was
crying. He does it was this, this villain,

540
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,610
there's talk can't be distressed for for
one moment without somebody stepping.

541
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,800
I mean,
that's a very extreme example,

542
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:57,670
but I think that is this sort of data
that we've become, or you know, I'm a,

543
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,870
I'm a parent and I know that I'm part of
this and it's hard to get away from it,

544
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:03,940
but yeah, we have become these
helicopter parents who, um,

545
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,130
sort of micromanaging our
kids' lives and then the,

546
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:12,610
the evidence is showing that kids in
college now are actually suffering some

547
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:16,420
really serious mental health problems, you
know, so it's severe levels of anxiety,

548
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:19,060
depression, lack of resilience,
those kinds of things.

549
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:21,460
And I think those trends are,
are related for sure.

550
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,460
Okay. Hi, I

551
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,550
took a class at Google
called search inside yourself
about a year ago. Um, it's,

552
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:34,920
uh, I don't know if you
call it a self help class.

553
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:37,140
It does include some meditation.
Um,

554
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,200
but I think the biggest takeaway I had
from it was a piece of advice that was

555
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,640
don't aim for a happy life, aim
for a meaningful life. Right.

556
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,280
So is that something that you found is
you should look for meeting instead of

557
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,270
looking for happiness?

558
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,910
Yeah. So I think it's really, I mean,

559
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:56,570
I haven't done that course so I can't
speak to exactly what was discussed. That,

560
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:59,150
and I think meaning is
obviously really important.

561
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,610
And I think connection is the
thing that's most important.

562
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:05,600
I think in a way there's this trend
where meanings become the new happiness.

563
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:06,950
Everyone's testing
meaning meaning meaning,

564
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:11,360
and then it kind of loses its meaning
because what is meaning meaning is

565
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:13,580
something that's different to
everything else. And I think when it's,

566
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,880
when there's this kind of MacGuffin this
thing that we're all supposed to chase

567
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:21,410
after, then it becomes its own rat race.
But yes, I think you're right that,

568
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,270
that it's,
um,

569
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,230
it's important to see what things have
value in our lives and just for happiness

570
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:32,030
to be a kind of byproduct of our lives
and living a connected meaningful life

571
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,460
rather than chasing after happiness.
Specifically,

572
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,940
you touched upon briefly the connection
between religious people being more

573
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:47,470
happy because of social gatherings.

574
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,830
And you elaborate a bit more
on that correlation. Like
what exactly causes that?

575
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,870
Why does social connection?

576
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:57,010
Because religious people that I'm
happy because of their social, yeah.

577
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,930
Well, I think that there's lots of
research that shows that people who have a

578
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:04,220
religious affiliation,
um,

579
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,620
spans more time socializing
and being part of a community.

580
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:10,420
And it's not necessarily,
you know,

581
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,270
that they go and more
dinner dates or whatever,

582
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:17,960
but it is that if you have a religious
place where you go every week, you know,

583
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,990
if you go to church or mosque or
synagogue or whatever, you know,

584
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,100
that's very much based on community
and it's based on this kind of shared

585
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:27,220
understanding that people are responsible
for each other's welfare and people

586
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:28,690
will look out for each other.
You know,

587
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:30,310
not every religious
community is like that,

588
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:33,660
but I think that's a kind of
baseline. And so people, you know,

589
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,400
and there's research that
shows that people who are
religious are more likely to

590
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:40,220
do things like give blood and uh,
more likely to,

591
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,260
to be involved in community events,
to have

592
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,980
more social events per week
then than other people.

593
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:47,410
And I think that's why
when you control for that,

594
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:48,940
when you take that out of the equation,

595
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:53,020
then actually religious people aren't any
happier than, than anybody else. Got It.

596
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,980
Thank you. Thanks. Hey, thanks for coming.

597
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,470
So you've been talking a lot
about the happiness aspect,

598
00:32:59,471 --> 00:33:02,310
but you also mentioned the
term self actualized. Yeah. Uh,

599
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:04,960
and I was Kinda curious to hear your
perspective on how you view the difference

600
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:08,020
between those two and come to
the point of out of cheese,

601
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:10,390
like a life of trying to find meaning.

602
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,970
What about like an effort to try
and get to better know yourself, uh,

603
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,700
do that self actualized term.
Yep.

604
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,261
Yeah.

605
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:21,261
So I think it's about balance because
obviously getting to know who you are and

606
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,450
you know,
becoming the best self that you can be,

607
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,430
all of those things are important and to,

608
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,850
to work out who you are and how to
work with that. But that's very,

609
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:32,190
very important. But I think what's
happened in America is that we've,

610
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,280
the balance has somehow got out of whack.

611
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:39,000
So we're putting self
actualization above connection.

612
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:42,800
So the idea was that we kind of
engineer happiness from the inside out.

613
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:45,420
That if you can perfectly know
yourself and understand yourself,

614
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,910
I don't know if you've heard this phrase,
happiness comes from within.

615
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,180
It's actually impossible to do to get a
result on a Google search that tells you

616
00:33:53,251 --> 00:33:57,030
the opposite. Because I typed in in
our happiness, I was going to do some,

617
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,740
at one point, I was going to think of
Dang some slides for this and I typed in,

618
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:02,240
you know,
meme happiness comes from within.

619
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,320
If you've got a thousand
results of all these, you know,

620
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:06,810
different that memes sort
of same variations on this.

621
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,190
If you type in meme in an image search,
happiness comes from other people.

622
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,140
Every single result seemingly,

623
00:34:13,141 --> 00:34:16,290
or at least on the front page that comes
back says happiness does not come from

624
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:17,930
other people having a
discussion with them.

625
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,180
And it's almost like that's how I
think the balance has got robbed.

626
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:26,520
So I'm not saying that people should not,
you know,

627
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:28,920
tried to understand themselves,
reflect on themselves, all of that.

628
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:30,090
That's obviously important,

629
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:34,410
but I think the emphasis has got
wrong some somewhere, you know,

630
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,850
I think if we make connection and other
people are starting point and then throw

631
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:41,380
in a bit of self actualization
rather than, you know,

632
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:46,020
having the balance so skewed
the other way. Thanks. Hi.

633
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,420
So you were talking about the
importance of social connections.

634
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,230
I think there are two types. I can
imagine. First there, for example,

635
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:57,850
close friends who I spend a lot of time
with and I have deep connection and then

636
00:34:57,851 --> 00:35:01,130
there are just, just people
I barely know. Yeah. So, uh,

637
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,700
it just hard to have many close
friends because it's like,

638
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,880
it takes a lot of time, but you can
have a lot of people you barely know.

639
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:11,710
Is there any distinctions which type of
relationships is more like what's the

640
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:14,920
difference between them and how do they
influence happiness in different ways,

641
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:18,740
close relationships and more meaningful
or just know as many people as you can

642
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,560
actually important surprise in it.
So it goes without saying.

643
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:27,710
I think that close friendships and
really supportive relationships are more

644
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:28,660
important than,
you know,

645
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,560
the women who sells a your newspaper
in the morning or whatever. But um,

646
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:38,710
and that's really the key is sort of
focusing on a few very close supportive

647
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:43,740
relationships. Ah, there is pretty good
evidence to show that having lots of um,

648
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,020
uh,
what there is a technical term for it,

649
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,440
but it's sort of small social connections
also and being part of a wider

650
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:54,030
community and feeling invested in a
community also has a big impact on our

651
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:57,480
happiness as well. So you know,
just feeling that we're, we're,

652
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,790
we're part of something
bigger than ourselves I think.

653
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,440
So I think an aggregate unit might not
be that every single one of those little

654
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:06,510
connections really is,
is that meaningful.

655
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:09,420
But overall I think they
can make a big difference.

656
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,570
And I thought that there was a,
an interesting point in the book,

657
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:13,400
not to give too many details away,

658
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:18,380
but you kind of quote Thomas Jefferson
in the pursuit of happiness and in your

659
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:21,650
interpretation it's not so much
pursuing this inward happiness,

660
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,740
which is kind of is perfected
from all my self actualization,

661
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:28,700
but rather pursuing a happiness
which makes you part of a community.

662
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:30,110
It makes you part of that larger hole.

663
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,480
Yes. I mean, I think that's,

664
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,690
that's pretty clear that the founding
fathers weren't really thinking about a

665
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:39,170
self help workshop when they eat. I mean
there's taking it straight, but yes,

666
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:42,680
they were talking about kind of civic
engagement and community and that was very

667
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:45,190
much being part a kind
of part of a larger,

668
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,610
okay, cool. That's just, yeah. Hi. Um,

669
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:57,430
wonder if you can read your book feet
touching that or what'd you think about,

670
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,700
what are you notice I'm not
from here either. Uh, and um,

671
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,670
I wonder if you've noticed that there's
some, seems to be some bragging around

672
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:13,510
mentioning or just even implying that
you're busy and people, you know,

673
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:18,010
it's just fun. I find it very hard here
to just call a friend up and say, Hey,

674
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,590
here you go for a beer. Nice.
Almost. It's virtually impossible.

675
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,580
And where I come from, it's like, you
know, we're adults, we have these lives.

676
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,120
But yeah, it's just
easier. And, and I, I've,

677
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,770
I've almost become that
and myself to where

678
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,240
I have to kids and you know, and
I work full time. And so, yeah,

679
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,640
it's also hard for me sometimes,

680
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,360
but I get the sense too that sometimes
that I feel this inner pride of saying,

681
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:47,800
well, you know, no, I'm VC
tonight. It's not, can make
it work or not. And I'm like,

682
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,380
Oh yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm going
to be the person. And then I'm like,

683
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,970
that feels like shit. I haven't had
a beer in a long time, would anyone,

684
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,123
and I dunno.

685
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,110
Yeah.

686
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:01,130
I mean it's so easy to
purchase socializing down to
the absolute bottom of their

687
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:04,040
priority list, isn't it? I mean, you
know, if you have a full time job,

688
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:07,220
you work hard. I think there's this, I
mean, we didn't actually talk about this,

689
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:08,710
but it's something that we touched,

690
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,230
I touched on in the book that now what
used to be called work life balance,

691
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:14,780
they're now calling work life integration,
you know,

692
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:16,550
which it just makes my heart sing.

693
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,760
I used to be more work that you have
to have your phone on all the time,

694
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,320
that your answer, boy,
you're always on the clock.

695
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:26,360
And that we're kind of merging
all these parts of our lives.

696
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,350
So there's very little socializing
or communicating or whatever with,

697
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:35,080
with friends that is totally free of
work and free and responsibilities in the

698
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:37,180
way that perhaps it used to be.

699
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,940
And I mean there's this really
just sort of chilling I thought,

700
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:41,840
chilling statistic, which is the, um,

701
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,140
I don't know if you've heard of
the American time use survey,

702
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:48,610
but they just categorize
how people literally spend
every moment of that day and

703
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:52,660
every activity that you can think of,
you know, working, sleeping, drive, him,

704
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:54,760
having sex, whatever,
it's all categorized.

705
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,440
And there's a category on
the survey called socializing
and communicating and it

706
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:02,240
doesn't just cover the good stuff.
So it's not just the United,

707
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:04,660
the lovely heart to heart that you
have with your best friend or their,

708
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:07,660
there's door in compensation with deal
with your boyfriend or girlfriend.

709
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,510
It's like all the arguing then lighting
the bitching and whining, everything, oh,

710
00:39:11,511 --> 00:39:12,550
thrown in together.

711
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,680
So as long as there's one more
than one adult present and um,

712
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,850
it's not an incidental
part of something else.

713
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,120
Does anyone want to hazard a guess how
much time we spend on that category per

714
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,860
day?
The average American.

715
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,953
Hmm.

716
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,540
Yeah. It's about 30 minutes a day.
So put another way, you know, we,

717
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:38,910
we know this is the single most important
sort of pillar of our happiness,

718
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:43,320
but yet we spent 23 and a half hours
out of every day not doing that in know,

719
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,610
doing something completely different.
So, you know, I found that pretty scary.

720
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,360
Hi. Hi. Thanks for your talk. Um,

721
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,570
did you happen to see the article in
the New York Times magazine this last

722
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:02,250
weekend? It was called the kids who
can't just kind of like a Meta title. Oh,

723
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:02,971
I don't think so.

724
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:06,930
It was about an anxiety with millennials
and especially the youngest millennials.

725
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,310
Um, it was saying that, you know,
it's talking about this phenomenon.

726
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:11,881
So first of all,

727
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:15,540
I wondered if you came across this in
your research anxiety being a bigger

728
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:19,080
problem with younger people. Yes,
definitely. And then, you know, hazard,

729
00:40:19,081 --> 00:40:22,500
any guesses at how to explain it and
mentioned the social media phenomenon,

730
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:25,170
which I think is right on the money.
And you touched on that. Yeah.

731
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,370
But another thing I talked about was how,
I don't love this word,

732
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:30,570
but it says that,
uh,

733
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,350
it said that the youngest people were
being cuddled in the sense that it's

734
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,330
common now if a kid's feeling anxious,

735
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:38,900
that they're just allowed to
stay on from school. Yeah.

736
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,440
Or that they have their own like dedicated
entrance to avoid the stressors of

737
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,850
the main entrance at school.
Yes.

738
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,780
And that was one of the ideas that was
put forward as to why does actually

739
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:52,020
having a negative effect and keeping
them in this like spiral of anxiety.

740
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,080
So I wonder what you thought about,

741
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:57,940
yeah, I think that's absolutely
right. I mean, I, and I
notice it in myself as well.

742
00:40:57,941 --> 00:41:02,830
You know, I have two kids and um,
in know my, my, what, my oldest son,

743
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:07,831
he goes to this kind of drama grade
partner on a Thursday and he decided he

744
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:11,110
doesn't like it and he doesn't want to
go and that he's got some anxiety around

745
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:14,230
that and it's an, I take into
like, oh, we've got to stop him.

746
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,510
He doesn't have to go, well, you know,
why should he have to go to that?

747
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:19,720
And you know, it's, it's very
easy to, to think, you know,

748
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:23,070
and I was about to pull them out of this
thing and the hell am I doing, you know,

749
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,280
I mean is there,
you know,

750
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,310
and I send it back to my
[inaudible] probably a good 70,

751
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:30,820
80% of the stuff that I didn't really
want to be doing that much. And you know,

752
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,620
nobody was suggesting that I would
not be doing it because of that.

753
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,960
I knew that there's a balance and,
and whatever.

754
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:40,070
And I think it's good that we consider
kids failings more now and that we

755
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,240
consider their emotions and treat them as
important. And I, I do think that, but,

756
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:47,480
but absolutely I think there is this
tendency and this idea that everything has

757
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:52,340
to be magical and wonderful for kids
and that we remove negative experiences

758
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,370
from their path. You know, that
the is very damaging for sure.

759
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,513
Yeah.

760
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,030
How you doing? Thanks for coming. Um,

761
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,690
so my question actually kind of relation
to that right there along with the

762
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:02,241
gentleman's question.

763
00:42:02,241 --> 00:42:05,110
Never hear about it shrank the
connection and also time usage.

764
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,780
So you talk about the sense
of community obviously and uh,

765
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,170
to go along with these younger
generations kind of being a little more

766
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:15,780
hyperactive or something, these
social media and everything. Um, it's,

767
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,660
it seems to be like a stereotype
type of millennials that there add,

768
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:20,890
they can't keep their
attention for anything.

769
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:24,790
So this idea of fragmentation of not
only your working life balance and

770
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:26,850
everything, but also your
personal interest. Um,

771
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,950
do you find any correlation between
simplification of kind of kin or really

772
00:42:31,991 --> 00:42:34,980
focusing on a specific
interest of yours, um, in,

773
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,960
in regards to this idea of like
having too many communities are to me,

774
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:40,810
friendships that you don't actually
get the value out of it that you might,

775
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:43,360
or is there a threshold or correlation
at this idea of that, you know,

776
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:46,180
at some of these less developed countries
have less things to worry about?

777
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:48,370
Not necessarily lessons were about and
very important things to worry about,

778
00:42:48,371 --> 00:42:51,460
but this idea that maybe they're
just not overexerting where they,

779
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,760
where their interests lie and trying to
do too much or have too many communities

780
00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:55,770
to really get invested in.
Yeah.

781
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,070
Too much choice. And I
think that is, you know,

782
00:42:58,071 --> 00:43:02,030
we live in this very consumerist world
whether we have so much choice for

783
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:04,580
everything all the time. And I think
that can sometimes be paralyzing.

784
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,280
That if you can be anything,
you know,

785
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:10,850
if we were all told you that be whatever
you want to be, follow your passion,

786
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:14,180
you know, find your, find your path,
you know, you can, you can do anything.

787
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:16,370
I think sometimes you kind of think,
oh my God,

788
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,480
I can't do anything because it's just,
you know,

789
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:25,481
the expectation is so high of what
happiness should look like and you know,

790
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,380
there's so many choices,
so many demands on our time and attention.

791
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,760
I think absolutely that it,
it can be quite paralyzing.

792
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,180
Yeah. Sorry, just super
quick followup meaning, um,

793
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,950
more specifically like do you think that
there's value in trying to find a few

794
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:41,400
interests as opposed to kind of
just diversifying that a bit? Okay.

795
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,400
That's interesting. Yeah. I don't know.
I didn't look into that specifically,

796
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:47,610
but I think that probably depends
on the individual as well.

797
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:51,360
I think some people you know really have
a very deep and abiding passion for one

798
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:55,290
thing and that really brings
them happiness and meaning
to, to, to follow that.

799
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:58,410
And other people will try lots of
different things throughout the course of

800
00:43:58,411 --> 00:44:00,990
light. And same with friendships. I think
somebody over here have asked about,

801
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:05,820
you asked about, um, you know, is it one
handful of close friends or is it nothing,

802
00:44:05,821 --> 00:44:06,511
lots and lots of people.

803
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:11,070
And I think that is to do with individual
personality really what it comes down

804
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:11,904
to.

805
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,550
Cool. Um, any more live questions? If not,

806
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:21,180
we can go to the dory for one or two.
Oh, I think, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

807
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,940
I was actually curious about what
you found when you were reading.

808
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,160
Um, because I actually, I'm
like a natural born cynic

809
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,960
generally when it comes
to things like this.

810
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,710
But I went to a talk here
actually last month, um,

811
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,780
this guy named Daniel Gorman.

812
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,560
And it was really interesting and
actually kind of skewed me towards,

813
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,600
he came with the gun,
other neuroscience.

814
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,650
He came with a neuroscientist and
they basically had done research where

815
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:53,350
meditation and this
practice of mindfulness. Um,

816
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:58,230
there was data done where they looked at
the brains of monks and it showed that

817
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,700
it actually decreased, you know,
stress. And there was just,

818
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,870
and that's actually the same book we were
talking about before. Altered traits.

819
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:11,310
Yeah. And so I guess I was curious in
your own findings, you know, this is

820
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,310
so,
this isn't really,

821
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:16,760
this has been one of the most
controversial things actually, that I'm,

822
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,630
this whole thing about meditation.
Every time I ever bring up meditation,

823
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,990
I get a million emails
from angry meditators.

824
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,740
All of the world's wanting
to run me out of that.

825
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,960
So I think there's a few things that
I think neuroscience is much more

826
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:33,080
complicated than popular neuroscience
would allow us to believe.

827
00:45:33,081 --> 00:45:37,640
So when we say something changes the
brain, it sounds amazingly impressive,

828
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:40,730
but pretty much everything we do
changes the brain. So you know,

829
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:44,450
from going to the bathroom or to, you
know, sitting here now to hear, you know,

830
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:45,830
hearing your questions,
everything we do.

831
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:48,290
So the changes the brain because
that's the nature of, of brain.

832
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,810
But so meditation and mindfulness,

833
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:55,070
there have been many thousands of studies
done into the effects of these things.

834
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,710
And the results have been,

835
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,370
I would say from my experience that,

836
00:46:01,371 --> 00:46:03,110
not that there are no
effects of these things,

837
00:46:03,111 --> 00:46:04,820
but they have been quite
strongly overhyped.

838
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:09,110
So there was a metro analysis
that came out a year or two ago,

839
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:14,150
which looked at all of these studies and
found that out of something like 1800

840
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:18,460
studies, only 40 of them actually
had a control comparison group.

841
00:46:18,461 --> 00:46:21,590
So I don't know how much people know
about how these kinds of studies work,

842
00:46:21,591 --> 00:46:22,424
but you know,

843
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,120
sort of comparing a group of people who
meditates or group of people who don't

844
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:29,760
do anything isn't really a fair
comparison because you know,

845
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,880
there's so many other factors
that could be going on.

846
00:46:31,881 --> 00:46:34,430
They could be placebo effect, it
could be the effect of, you know,

847
00:46:34,431 --> 00:46:36,800
having a social connection,
whatever.

848
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,240
When Meditation is compared to a control
group where they are doing something

849
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:43,640
comparable, you know, a
reasonable control group,

850
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,530
meditation performance no better and
often worse than than something like

851
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,300
exercise,
listening to spiritual audio tapes.

852
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,070
Um, any kind of sham control
where you're just, you know,

853
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,180
putting something to
be a control condition.

854
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:01,700
So I think we need to
approach it with caution,

855
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,390
which isn't to say that for many people,
you know, it's an extremely meaningful,

856
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:09,470
an important part of their
day and something that they
really get a lot from and

857
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:13,100
that's great. But I think once we start
rolling out as the answer to everything,

858
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:15,350
then that's where it becomes problematic.

859
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,180
Sorry, one more question. So in your foe,

860
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,440
so while you're writing this
book and doing research,

861
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:24,900
was there anything that
you found was effective?

862
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,550
Yeah, I mean I think it
comes back, you know,

863
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:30,280
this is just keep banging on
about the same thing in a really,

864
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:32,490
it does come down to to um,

865
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,260
connecting with other people and
doing that in a way that's most

866
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,830
meaningful to you. But um, you know, but
literally spending more time, you know,

867
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:45,010
seeing that we spent half an
hour of our day socializing,

868
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:47,980
communicating as opposed to three hours
watching television or being on the

869
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:52,030
internet or whatever and actually just
try and to upsize minutes, you know,

870
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:56,650
to just spend more time doing it and
sort of nurture the relationships that we

871
00:47:56,651 --> 00:47:56,921
have.

872
00:47:56,921 --> 00:48:01,180
I think that really is the far and away
the best thing you can do for your own

873
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:05,510
happiness. Sorry to clarify, I meant out
of all these kinds of help. Help. Thanks.

874
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,790
Yeah. Yeah. Huh. That's an interesting,
you know, I think a lot of the things,

875
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,600
a lot of these self help things it dead.
They were one or two points within them.

876
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:16,450
They were interesting and that I took
away and thought about some more.

877
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:18,420
And you know,
there were things in the landmark forum,

878
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:22,930
there were things from mindfulness that
I think in certain situations can be

879
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:23,321
useful.

880
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:27,970
But I think overall any one package
of solutions I think is usually over

881
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,160
promising quite heavily.

882
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:35,850
And so there was no one book or apple
costs or whatever that I could say,

883
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:40,240
okay, well the answer is
this in a because it didn't,

884
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,220
it didn't really feel that way to me.

885
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,900
Cool. I need more live questions.
Sure. Cool. We'll go to a,

886
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:53,200
one of the door to questions
then when measuring happiness,

887
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:54,550
how do you correct it?
Yeah.

888
00:48:54,551 --> 00:48:59,551
There's a question that have is how do
you correct for cultural differences and

889
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:05,410
what being someone very et cetera happy.
Um,

890
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,230
I guess maybe how do you, has your id
measure for cultural differences? Yeah.

891
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,070
Happiness.

892
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,320
It's a really interesting
question. I mean, there's, um,

893
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,300
there's a lot of research on this
because people are in different cultures

894
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:20,130
define happiness in slightly
different ways. And I think, um, they,

895
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,360
uh, people in the west tend to
favor, there's a word for it,

896
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:28,170
which has gone from my mind,
but very high energy kind of emotions,

897
00:49:28,171 --> 00:49:32,850
like exhilaration and excitement
in a real sort of extreme emotions.

898
00:49:32,851 --> 00:49:35,590
And I think maybe in some other
cultures they value our calm,

899
00:49:35,591 --> 00:49:37,380
I kind of contentment,
whatever.

900
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,760
There was some really fascinating research
that came out of UC Berkeley recently,

901
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:46,140
which looked at how have people define
happiness in different countries around

902
00:49:46,141 --> 00:49:50,130
the world and hey, how they
defined it. And then B,

903
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:55,050
how happy, you know, how happy
they were. And they found that,

904
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,920
um,
in parts of East Asia and in Russia,

905
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:01,920
I think that people define happiness
in a much more collective way.

906
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:05,520
So they didn't really see it as a kind
of individual pursuit in the same way

907
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:07,740
that we do in the u s but
they're still at Maura's.

908
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:12,540
I kind of socially orientated endeavor.
And for those people, the more they,

909
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,600
if you define happiness in that way,
the more you perceived happiness,

910
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,920
the happier you became.

911
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,120
Whereas in the u s where people define
happiness in a more individualistic way,

912
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,670
the more you pursue happiness,
the less happy you become.

913
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,950
So it's kind of the opposite way.
Super Fascinating. Yeah. I'm just cool.

914
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,760
Well, Hey, thank you for coming here
and thank you for speaking with us. Oh,

915
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,040
thanks for having me.
It's wonderful. Thank you.
