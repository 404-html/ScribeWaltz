1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,280
Good morning. Thanks for coming.
I'm here to introduce, uh,

2
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:15,410
Amanda gefter and her book
trespassing on Einstein's lawn.

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,870
And I came to this book through a
confluence of several factors. My,

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,370
my late father was a physicist and had
the opportunity to exchange a few letters

5
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:27,770
with Einstein himself and,
uh,

6
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:29,780
always had them locked away
in the safe deposit box.

7
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:34,370
It was always a special family
thing. And, um, separately,

8
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:36,570
he and my mother used to go to a,

9
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:40,700
a particular Chinese restaurant
in Philadelphia all the
time. And the young son,

10
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:44,650
five year old son of the owners would
always hang around and, you know,

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,800
being playful. But he also liked
math a lot. And my dad, uh, um,

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,760
started tutoring him in math young man,
grew up, went to Wharton and is now, uh,

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,040
at Khosla partners of venture capitalist
out in, uh, out in silicon valley.

14
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,140
So my dad helped, helped spawn
a silicon valley hot shot. Um,

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,580
so when I heard of Amanda's book
and that it involved Einstein,

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,020
physics, father's restaurant,
Chinese restaurants,

17
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,180
and Philadelphia where,
where I'm from,

18
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,230
I realized this was the book I had
to read. So, uh, without further ado,

19
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,540
Amanda gefter.
Okay.

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,973
Okay.

21
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,220
So first I just want to thank Google
so much for hosting me here today.

22
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,360
It's a real privilege to be here in this
building and to get to talk to all of

23
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,283
you.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,773
So

25
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,320
when I was 15 years old,

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,150
my father took me out to dinner at our
favorite Chinese restaurant and asked me

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,040
how I would define nothing.

28
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,970
And this was an odd dinner table question,

29
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:57,640
but not entirely out of
character for my father,

30
00:01:57,641 --> 00:02:02,200
who was the sort of Zen Guru,
like former hippy turned radiologist.

31
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,050
And so I said I would define nothing as
the absence of something or the absence

32
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:12,520
of everything. And really this is how
everyone defines nothing as avoid.

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,500
But my father had a different idea. He
had been thinking about this for a while.

34
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,770
He told me,
and the other day he had had an epiphany.

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,740
He was at the mechanics waiting
for his car to be fixed.

36
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,570
And it dawned on him that you could
define nothing as an infinite,

37
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,670
unbounded homogeneous state.

38
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,550
So a state of utter sameness that
extends without bound forever.

39
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:40,551
And this wasn't a semantic trick and
an infinite unbounded homogeneous state

40
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:43,950
would literally be indistinguishable
from a void. It's nothing.

41
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,610
But my father thought it was an
interesting definition because it defined

42
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:50,670
nothing. Not In terms of what it
isn't, but in terms of what it is.

43
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,990
And so he explained all this to me over
a plate of cashew chicken and then he

44
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,553
asked me,

45
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,070
do you think this could help
explain how the universe began?

46
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,000
Now you have to bear mine.
I'm his teenage daughter.

47
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,940
I was not exactly the
most well behaved kid.

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,710
I would not be described as studious.
I was failing math class.

49
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,750
I was not even taking physics class.

50
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:20,890
I had opted for meteorology because
that was what my high school offered in

51
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,690
place of physics for the underachievers.

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,940
And here are my father is asking
me how the universe began.

53
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,070
And he just sort of shrugged like it
was a normal thing to do and said,

54
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:37,480
I think we should figure it out.
And so that is how at 15 years old,

55
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,140
I found myself on a mission to figure
out the origin of the universe.

56
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,920
So my father and I started
teaching ourselves physics. Um,

57
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,560
we stayed up late every night.

58
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:54,040
We started amassing a crazy
collection of physics books,

59
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:58,210
reading everything we could get our hands
on and talking about all these ideas

60
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:00,100
until my mother would
yell at us to go to bed.

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,630
Because if you want to understand this,

62
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,840
something that came from nothing
when the universe was born,

63
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,270
you have to look at
both sides of the coin.

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,260
So my father had already thought long and
hard about the nothing part and now we

65
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,350
needed to understand the something
and that's what physics is.

66
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,450
Which incidentally,

67
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,500
before I started the
secret project with my dad,

68
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,660
I had no idea what physics was.

69
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,720
I didn't take physics class because I
thought that physics was like a set of

70
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,300
rules and numbers for describing
how like levers and police work.

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,470
And now I know that physics is about
uncovering the reality behind the

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,313
appearances.

73
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,760
It's about glimpsing this deep and
hidden architecture of existence itself.

74
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,900
It's about embracing the fact that the
world is not what it seems and that

75
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:54,730
everything is stranger and simpler than
we can imagine. And yet comprehensible.

76
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,040
And I think if I had
known that from the start,

77
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,840
I wouldn't have taken meteorology.

78
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,780
But eventually I graduated high school
and I moved to New York City for college.

79
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,100
And then when I finished college,

80
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,160
I did what any physics loving
amateur reality hunter would do.

81
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,350
And I took a job at a bridal magazine.

82
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,940
So I was working as an assistant,

83
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,390
that Manhattan bride and
I was there in the office,

84
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:25,480
which was really just the one bedroom
apartment of a guy named Rick.

85
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,230
When I read an article in the New York
Times announcing this huge physics

86
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,220
conference that was going to
be happening in Princeton,

87
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:35,650
New Jersey called science
and ultimate reality,

88
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,940
and all of the world's leading physicists
were going to gather there to talk

89
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,830
about their most cutting edge ideas.

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,480
So I'm reading this article and a
light bulb goes off over my head.

91
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,860
I wait until Rick leaves for lunch
and then I pick up the phone,

92
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,710
I call the people in charge of
publicity for the conference.

93
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,500
And in the most professional
voice that I can muster,

94
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,500
I lie and say that I am a journalist.

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,460
And then I'm calling from Manhattan
magazine because that sounded better.

96
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,900
And then I wanted to come cover the event.
Oh,

97
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,290
of course we would love you to
come. They said, great. I said,

98
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,830
put me down on plus one.
Now, in that moment,

99
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,960
I had no idea how that one little lie
would forever alter the course of my life,

100
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:24,080
but I called my dad and I said, pack
your bags. We're going to Princeton.

101
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,120
So my dad and I show up in Princeton
and we crashed this physics conference

102
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,180
posing as journalists.
You know,

103
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:38,780
we found our press badges at the press
table mindset in Manhattan magazine.

104
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:43,550
I had a blank for my plus one and we put
them around our necks and just wandered

105
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:48,440
amongst our heroes, like two idiot
Deere cotton genius headlights.

106
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,760
We got to listen to these
physicists lecture about
their most recent ideas about

107
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,750
the nature of reality.
And then as if that wasn't good enough,

108
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,180
we got to go into this magical little
room that they call the press room where

109
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:09,620
you sit down and they deliver to
you one by one, each physicist,

110
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,360
so you can ask them questions.

111
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,320
It was the most amazing
experience of my entire life.

112
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,090
And when the conference let out my father
and I had just sort of like wandered

113
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,890
through the town of Princeton in a daze,

114
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,000
talking about everything we had just
heard and eventually we found ourselves on

115
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:26,691
Mercer Street,

116
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:31,340
which is the street where Einstein had
lived and we found his house at one 12

117
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:32,174
Mercer.

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,350
It was undergoing some sort
of construction so it was
sort of cordoned off by

119
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:40,730
yellow tape, like a murder scene,
but we just stood there in awe,

120
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,680
trespassing on Einstein's
lawn to bogus press badges,

121
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,800
still hanging around our necks.

122
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,520
And it struck me then that this little
private hobby that I shared with my dad

123
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,600
was maybe going to be something bigger.

124
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,210
And it also dawned on me that I was not
ready to give up this journalism front

125
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,310
because it was like just
too good to be true.

126
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:07,250
Like all you need is this press badge
and suddenly you can learn physics

127
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,290
directly from the physicists.

128
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,210
I figured the Manhattan magazine Scam
wouldn't work for long because someone was

129
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,400
bound to look it up and
see that it didn't exist.

130
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,900
But I figured I would use it one more
time. So when I got back to New York,

131
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,860
I called an editor at scientific American.
Again,

132
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:29,030
I lied and said it was journalists with
Manhattan magazine and that I had been

133
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:33,230
to this conference and I wanted to cover,
um,

134
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,040
or you know, write an article
about physics for their magazine.

135
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,750
And miraculously he agreed.

136
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,260
So my article comes out in scientific
American and suddenly my fake journalism

137
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:48,500
career has just morphed into
a real journalism career.

138
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:52,370
And I was able to use that to sort of
worm my way into more situations where it

139
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:57,310
didn't belong. So I'm sure you can
see like Stephen Hawking there,

140
00:08:57,311 --> 00:09:01,920
front and center,
and then there inexplicably is me.

141
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,870
It was the perfect scam.
And at this particular conference,

142
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,900
I ended up meeting an editor
from New Scientist magazine.

143
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,820
We struck up a conversation
and I mentioned that I wrote
for scientific American.

144
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,710
I didn't mention it was only once and it
was the only article I've ever done. Um,

145
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,850
and he suggested maybe I should
write for new scientists.

146
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:26,430
And so I started writing articles
for New Scientist. And then, um,

147
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:27,480
when I turned 25,

148
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,040
New Scientist asked me to be an editor
there landing me the ultimate permanent

149
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,290
press that okay.

150
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,760
So once I was an editor at
like a major science magazine,

151
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:43,761
I had access to everything that my
father and I needed to learn physics and

152
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,060
start to figure out the origin of the
universe, which is the whole point.

153
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,250
Um, and I was learning so much
trying to come to grips with this,

154
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,330
something that's supposedly a rose
from nothing 14 billion years ago.

155
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,550
And if you try to learn all the
fundamental physics from scratch,

156
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,040
not only is it a lot to learn,

157
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,540
but it can seem like a lot of
sort of crazy unrelated facts.

158
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,750
But early on I had an epiphany that
made it infinitely easier to connect the

159
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,710
dots and to see the big picture.

160
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,180
And so I think if you want to know
one thing about fundamental physics,

161
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,320
this is the one thing to
know something is only real.

162
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,890
If it's invariant.
And I'll explain what that means.

163
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Something is only real if it remains
unchanged in every reference frame.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,660
If it changes or disappears
from some perspective,

165
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,780
then it's not ultimately real.

166
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,700
And actually,
even though this is very deep idea,

167
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:50,370
it's something that we all
sort of know intuitively.

168
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,260
Like if you were sitting in your lobby
and out of the corner of your eye,

169
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:58,920
you saw like an elephant walk by,
like even for Google,

170
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:03,150
that would be pretty unusual.
And you might find yourself wondering,

171
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,480
is that elephant real or am I
having some kind of breakdown?

172
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,760
And instinctively,
you know,

173
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:11,400
there are two strategies
that you can use to find out.

174
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,830
So the first would be to get up,

175
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,010
walk over to the elephant and just sort
of walk in a circle around it from every

176
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,700
angle suspiciously because you know
that if at some angle it just vanishes.

177
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,780
Then it was something more like
a mirage and less like a mammal.

178
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,360
And the other strategy you can use is
to just turn to the Googler next to you

179
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,030
and say,
do you see that elephant to?

180
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,050
And if she says no or just
stares at you blankly,

181
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:43,410
then you know that you should
probably go see a neurologist.

182
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,820
And why do you know that?

183
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:49,470
Because you know that something is only
real if it remains invariant and every

184
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,770
reference frame.
Okay?

185
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,870
So just because something's
not ultimately real,

186
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:58,240
it doesn't mean it has to
be a hallucination, right?

187
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:03,100
Like take a rainbow is a rainbow real,
not really,

188
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:07,000
right? I mean it's not subjective.
It's not a hallucination. Um,

189
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,480
but it's also not like a physical
object hanging in the sky.

190
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:14,500
You can't go touch it because it's a
product of your reference frame, right?

191
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,740
You see a rainbow when you're standing
in just the right spot and the sun

192
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:21,430
streaming in from behind you and the
lights being refracted by the moisture in

193
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:25,030
the air. And if you ask the guy next
to you, do you see that rainbow too?

194
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,710
He'll probably say yes. But if you run
the test of walking around in a circle,

195
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,660
you will eventually see it disappear
because it's not invariant.

196
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,650
It's not ultimately real.
It's not a fundamental
ingredient of ultimate reality.

197
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,150
And so if you want to find the
fundamental ingredients, ultimate reality,

198
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:46,870
the something that arose from nothing,
you have to find what's invariant.

199
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,410
So if there's one thing that you
remember about physics, let it be that

200
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,890
it was Einstein who first recognized
this link between invariance and reality.

201
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,230
And I would actually argue that this was
Einstein's single greatest contribution

202
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:06,250
to physics, which I realize is a very bold
statement. And he did a lot of things,

203
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,560
special relativity,
general activity.

204
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,080
It's not even what he won
the Nobel prize for her.

205
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,610
You want it for the photo electric effect,

206
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,130
which is just so bad ass
if you think about it,

207
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:18,800
because it's like the thing he wanted to
know about prize for barely cracked the

208
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,350
list of the best things we ever did.

209
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,010
But the best thing he ever did was to
eliminate this link between invariance in

210
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:30,730
reality because it's set the future
trajectory of modern physics and motion.

211
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:34,960
And it changed physics from being a set
of rules and numbers that describe how

212
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:39,250
levers and pulleys work to being a way to
glimpse the reality behind appearances.

213
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,980
And there's a good reason that no one
before Einstein thought of this link

214
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:48,760
between invariants and reality.
And it's that before Einstein,

215
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,470
everyone shared the same reference frame.
So in a Newtonian universe,

216
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,600
the speed of light is instantaneous,

217
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,090
which means everyone sees the same thing.
So everything's in variant.

218
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,480
And in Einstein's universe,
this is no longer true.

219
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,660
So Einstein realized that in order for
every observer to see the same laws of

220
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:15,400
physics, um, every observer has to
measure the speed of light to be the same.

221
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,000
And so it doesn't matter if you're
running a million miles an hour or you're

222
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:21,580
standing still,
as you measure a beam of light,

223
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,870
that beam of light is going to be
moving in 186,000 miles per second.

224
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,900
And what's important about that
number is that it's finite.

225
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,670
Light does not travel
instantaneously. It takes time, right?

226
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:36,460
Light from the sun takes
eight minutes to reach us.

227
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,420
Light from distant galaxies takes
millions or even billions of years.

228
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,270
And so looking out into the universe
as a way of looking back in time.

229
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,600
But the point is you can't see everything.

230
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,290
The universe that you can see is bounded
by the fact that light has only had 14

231
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,020
billion years to reach you.
And so beyond that,

232
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,660
the universe for you is dark.

233
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,540
Now the boundary that marks the
very edge of what you can see,

234
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,080
it's called your horizon
and it's uniquely yours.

235
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,420
You are sitting at the center of a sphere
that encompasses your one of a kind

236
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,080
universe and the person next to you is
sitting at the center of a different

237
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,410
sphere. Now, they mostly
overlap, but not entirely.

238
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,940
And so Einstein realized that in a
universe with a finite speed of light,

239
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,330
every observer occupies
a unique reference frame.

240
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,490
So you can no longer just describe the
universe without first specifying from

241
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:34,380
WHO's frame you're describing it.

242
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,190
Because things might look very
different from one frame to another.

243
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,980
And if things look very different
from one frame to another,

244
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,430
this introduces a
fundamentally new problem.

245
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,020
How do you know which things are real?
And Einstein figured out the solution.

246
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,890
Something is real if it's in variant,
in every reference frame.

247
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,670
So it was this way of thinking that
led Einstein to his famous discovery,

248
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:03,610
right? By analyzing how things
look from different frames,

249
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,620
he was able to see that space and time,

250
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:09,700
which everyone had always assumed were
the same for every observer are in fact

251
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,230
not the same for every observer.

252
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:16,030
They look different from one reference
frame to another. So what I see as space,

253
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,610
you might experience
this time and vice versa.

254
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,450
And so space and time are not invariant.

255
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,230
They are relative to your reference frame.
That's what relativity is.

256
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,700
But he found that there is something
that remains in variant and that is this

257
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,050
combination of space and time,
this unified four dimensional space time.

258
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,010
So we might disagree on
measurements of space or have time,

259
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,450
but everyone will always agree on
measurements of this combined spacetime.

260
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,710
Okay?

261
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:49,710
So space and time are not real spacetime
Israel and everyone always focuses on

262
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:54,820
the first part because it's like really
mindblowing. Space and time aren't real.

263
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,900
But I'm site actually cared more about
the second part because he knew that the

264
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:02,770
key to finding ultimate reality
is to find the invariant.

265
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,910
And actually later in life he said that
he regretted calling it the theory of

266
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:10,720
relativity and wished that instead he
had called it the theory of invariance.

267
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,220
So once we knew all of this,

268
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:19,420
my father and I now had like a
concrete plan, like the question,

269
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,110
what is ultimately real? You know, what
is the something that arose from nothing?

270
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:25,930
It was no longer this sort of
vague philosophical question.

271
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:30,340
It was a rigorous physics question.
You know, what is invariant?

272
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,880
And so we were out to breakfast at a
pancake house and we wrote a list of

273
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,100
possible ingredients of
ultimate reality on a Napkin.

274
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,700
So things like spacetime
dimensionality, particles, strings,

275
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,800
et cetera. Um, this image,
by the way, is a recreation.

276
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:51,390
The original Napkin was eventually lost,
her possibly sneezed in,

277
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,230
but we made this list and then I used
my journalism career to investigate each

278
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:02,160
one. And I want to tell you about
two of the items on the Napkin.

279
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,590
So the first one is particles.

280
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,640
Particles seem pretty fundamental,
right?

281
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:12,990
If you ask what is all the stuff in
the universe made of particles is the

282
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:17,910
obvious answer or what I thought until I
encountered the work of Stephen Hawking.

283
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,410
So I have to confess something. When I
was first learning all of this stuff,

284
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,220
I had the suspicion that
Stephen Hawking was overrated.

285
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:34,290
Like I just wasn't convinced that
his contribution to physics could be

286
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:39,210
proportionate to his same because there's
just something about a guy that speaks

287
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,600
in a computer voice that
sort of automatically sounds
like a genius. You know,

288
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,750
like he automatically sounds like he
knows something no one else could possibly

289
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,470
know.
But as I studied his work,

290
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,500
I learned that he had done this remarkable
calculation in the 1970s actually he

291
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,640
was annoyed at another physicist.

292
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:59,730
And so he was doing this calculation in
order to show that this other guy was

293
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:04,200
wrong. And the calculation
proved three things first.

294
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,730
That revenge is an excellent
fuel for genius. Second,

295
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,270
that I was an idiot because if anything,

296
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:14,160
hawking is underrated.

297
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:17,460
His physics was brilliant and the only
thing that's disproportionate is the fact

298
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:19,440
that everyone knows
who Stephen Hawking is.

299
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,860
But if you ask them what did he
actually do that was so important,

300
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,210
hardly anyone knows.

301
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,060
But now you guys will know because
I'll tell you the third thing,

302
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,960
his calculation prove that
particles are not ultimately real.

303
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,000
And here's why.

304
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,800
So thanks to quantum mechanics.

305
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,670
Empty space is not really empty.
The uncertainty principle,

306
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:45,570
it tells us there's a tradeoff
between time and energy,

307
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,300
which means that on
incredibly short timescales,

308
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,320
fraction of a fraction of a fraction
of a second large amounts of energy can

309
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,970
bubble up out of empty space.

310
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,540
And this energy takes the form of pairs
of particles and antiparticles that

311
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,010
emerged from empty space and then meat
and annihilate and in the blink of an eye

312
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:08,790
disappear. And this is happening
all the time, all around us,

313
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,280
these particles and
antiparticles emerging meeting,

314
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,720
annihilating and disappearing.

315
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:16,710
But it happens so quickly that we just
refer to them as virtual particles.

316
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,920
But when hockey was
doing this calculation,

317
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:24,150
he realized that something different
happens when you have a horizon.

318
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,330
And so as you already know,

319
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,190
horizon marks the an edge beyond which
like can't reach an observer, right?

320
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:37,191
So we talked about the horizon that
surrounds your unique universe and there's

321
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,210
an analogous kind of horizon.

322
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,830
It's actually mathematically equivalent
kind of horizon that surrounds a black

323
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:45,390
hole.
So in this case,

324
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,680
the horizon marks the edge beyond which
light can't escape gravity's clutches in

325
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:52,570
order to reach an observer on the outside.

326
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,150
So if you're standing
outside the black hole,

327
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,030
the horizon marks the
edge of what you can see.

328
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,890
So hawking realized that if these
pairs of particle virtual particles and

329
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:11,260
antiparticles are bubbling up out of
empty space in the vicinity of a horizon,

330
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,210
something sort of amazing,
it can happen.

331
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,420
The horizon can separate the pairs so
that where one particle sort of is just

332
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:20,530
outside the horizon,

333
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,060
it's antiparticle partner can be just
inside the black hole and now they can no

334
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,560
longer annihilate.

335
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,270
And so instead of disappearing
and they just stick around,

336
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,630
these virtual particles
are not so virtual anymore.

337
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:38,980
They're actually totally normal particles
that are exactly the same as the

338
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,320
particles that make up
anything in this room.

339
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:43,750
You could collect them until
them and build a chair.

340
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,470
But there would be something really
weird about that chair because it would,

341
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,000
oh its existence to the horizon,
but the horizon's not a real thing.

342
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,440
The horizon's not like a brick wall that's
floating in space or horizons like a

343
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:56,921
rainbow.

344
00:21:56,921 --> 00:22:01,810
It's a product of a reference Rayme
namely the reference frame of an observer

345
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,050
who is lucky enough to remain
outside the black hole.

346
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,030
And textbooks tend to call the
observer outside the black hole. Bob,

347
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,550
I like to call them safe.

348
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,140
There's another kind of
observer who's not so lucky.

349
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,020
I'm an observer who's in inertial motion.

350
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,630
Freefall can't escape gravity's clutches
and fall straight through the rise in

351
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:28,210
and into the black hole.
And I like to call him screwed.

352
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,170
So from safety point of view,

353
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,483
these

354
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,050
once virtual particles that can no
longer annihilate with their partners are

355
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,760
streaming out from the horizon as
if the black hole is radiating.

356
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,190
That's why we call it hawking radiation.

357
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,750
But for screwed,
there is no horizon.

358
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,740
He's just fall straight through and
there's no edge of what he can see.

359
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,220
So for screwed these virtual particles
just continue to annihilate and disappear

360
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,420
like always.

361
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,720
And so where safe sees this stream of
hot particles screw just ordinary empty

362
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:12,870
space.
So you see what's happening here.

363
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:16,590
The particles are not invariant
and that's what hawking discovered.

364
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:20,190
That's so important.
Particles are not ultimately real.

365
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,810
They're a product of your reference frame,

366
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,020
not only in the vicinity of a black hole
but everywhere because every one of us

367
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:27,990
has surrounded by horizon.

368
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,690
So my father and I crossed particles
off the list on the Napkin.

369
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,080
Now Hawking's discovery has driven and
continues to drive theoretical physics

370
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:44,870
forward for the last four
decades because it's rife with,

371
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,920
and there's nothing that a
physicist loves more than a paradox.

372
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,780
And I'll give you an example.

373
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,900
So let's take our elephant from the
lobby and throw him into a black hole.

374
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,690
All right,
there he goes.

375
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,500
So safe is watching this from afar.

376
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:08,180
And so we can ask in safes reference
frame, what does this look like?

377
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,640
And Fair warning,
it's not pretty.

378
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,720
So from safe's point of view,

379
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,230
the elephant is going to fall towards
the black hole and then encounter this

380
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:25,661
stream of hot hawking radiation and she's
going to be burned to a crisp before

381
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:30,530
he ever crosses the horizon in his Astros
will just sort of emanate back into

382
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:34,070
the universe. Okay, so
that's gruesome in terrible,

383
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,810
but we can also look at
screwed point of view, right?

384
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:43,811
Because screwed is just falling straight
through alongside the elephant and for

385
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,410
screwed.
There is no horizon.

386
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,440
So there are no hot particles to harm
any animals and so for screwed the

387
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:53,474
elephant,

388
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,340
it's just in ordinary empty space and he
can live out the rest of his life until

389
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:00,260
he eventually reaches the
center of the black hole.

390
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,520
So there's a problem.
Okay.

391
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,410
The Laws of physics require that
both of these stories be true.

392
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,090
If either one of them were not true,
you'd violate a law of physics.

393
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,330
And so the elephant has to be both dead
in a pile of ashes outside the black

394
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:23,480
hole and alive and well
inside the black hole.

395
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,540
That alone is just weird.

396
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,290
But the problem comes in because
there's another law of physics.

397
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:33,860
It's equally as fundamental as the others
that says you can't have two copies of

398
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:34,694
the same elephant.

399
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,440
So both stories have to be true
and both stories can't be true.

400
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,520
That's the paradox.

401
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,580
And it was a physicist named Lenny
Suskind who solved this paradox.

402
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,130
He said, as long as you stick to
one observers reference frame,

403
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,330
as long as you talk about what safe sees
or what screwed sees all the laws of

404
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:57,440
physics remained intact.

405
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,470
It's only when you try to talk about
their points of view simultaneously that

406
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,100
you see these two illegal
copies of the elephant.

407
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:13,370
So it's this picture. That's
the problem. Einstein had said,

408
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,960
you know,
if you describe the university,

409
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:17,210
you have to first specify
your reference frame.

410
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,350
And the fact is this isn't unphysical
reference frame. It's impossible.

411
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,580
There's no one who can see inside and
outside of horizon simultaneously.

412
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:27,440
That's the idea of a horizon.

413
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,010
And so as long as we just stick
to physical reference frames,

414
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:41,540
what an observer could actually see that
we never see two copies of the elephant

415
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,320
and all the laws of physics remain
intact. So the problem is solved, but

416
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,660
there's still something very unsettling
about that because we would like to

417
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:55,740
think that there's some actual answer
to the question. Where is the elephant?

418
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,071
Right?

419
00:26:56,071 --> 00:27:00,750
Is the elephant dead outside the black
hole or is it alive inside a black hole?

420
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:02,580
We like to think that
there's some real answer.

421
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:07,581
And what this is telling us is that
there's not so Suskin realized that the

422
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:13,200
location of the elephant in
spacetime is not invariant.

423
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,030
So spacetime,

424
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,530
this unified four dimensional space time
that was left in variant by Einstein's

425
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,580
theory of, and Marion's turns
out not to be in very after all.

426
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,270
And so my dad and I had to
cross spacetime off the list.

427
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,780
So we continued our search for
these ever elusive in variants,

428
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:38,850
these fundamental ingredients
of ultimate reality.

429
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,690
I was running around the world having
fascinating conversations with these

430
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:46,230
brilliant physicist and usually making
a total fool of myself in the process.

431
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,250
And often my dad was there with
me and when he couldn't be,

432
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,240
I would report back to him and detail
all of my crazy adventures and everything

433
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,074
I had learned.

434
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,730
But looking back on this 17 year journey,

435
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,620
here's what I realize now, if
I, if it weren't for my father,

436
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,660
I would have never done any of this.

437
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,820
Like even if I had somehow become
interested in physics on my own,

438
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,390
I would have never crashed a
conference posing as a journalist.

439
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:20,100
I would have never turned one little lie
into an entire career because without

440
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:22,650
my dad there at my side or on
the other end of the phone,

441
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,580
it wouldn't have been fun and
it wouldn't have meant anything.

442
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,500
And that's the thing about invariance.
It doesn't just make objects real.

443
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:36,150
It makes our lives real. And I really
think that's why we need other people.

444
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,870
We need them because they bear
witness to our lives. And in doing so,

445
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:41,700
they anchor us to the world.

446
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,380
The anchor us to a reality that can
be seen from every angle when you walk

447
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:47,214
around it.

448
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,680
I needed my dad because that's second
reference frame gave my life a sense of

449
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:57,570
invariance and created between us a shared
reality so that every time I learned

450
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:01,560
something deep and wondrous about the
universe, I could turn to my dad and say,

451
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,520
do you see that too? And he could
smile back at me and say, yes,

452
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:09,810
but just as we were creating
this shared reality,

453
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:14,811
we were also chipping away at it piece
by piece as we crossed item after item

454
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,990
off the Napkin,

455
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,610
slowly undermining the very
notion of a shared reality.

456
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,750
Because once you know this one thing about
physics that what's real is what's in

457
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:28,634
variant.

458
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,240
The entire trajectory of physics
sort of snaps into focus.

459
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:38,241
The whole history of physics from Einstein
to exactly what's going on right now

460
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,240
has been a steady and relentless
progression of invariant
after invariant giving

461
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,260
way to observe her
dependence and illusion.

462
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,030
And so the list of fundamental ingredients
of reality is getting shorter and

463
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:55,240
shorter and shorter.
And so we can ask like,

464
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,280
where does this trajectory end? Does
it end with one fundamental ingredient,

465
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,790
one in variant,
one thing that everything else is made of?

466
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,580
Well that used to be the hope.

467
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,730
I mean a lot of people thought that
that was sort of the idea of of string

468
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,640
theory, right? That all
these different things,

469
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:14,260
all this variety we see in the world,

470
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:16,440
it's actually all just meet
up of this one ingredient,

471
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,920
these little vibrating strings.

472
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:23,680
But the most exciting and interesting
and challenging thing that's happened in

473
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:27,460
string theory in recent years is that
it's turned out the strings are not in

474
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,400
variant.
And so this is,

475
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:35,050
this are starting to think that maybe
there's not one fundamental ingredient.

476
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:40,000
And so, so where does the
trajectory end? Does it end it?

477
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:43,450
Nothing. Because here's the
interesting thing about nothing.

478
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,530
If you think about it, not in terms of
what it isn't, but in terms of what it is,

479
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,130
an infinite unbounded homogeneous state
is by definition in variant in every

480
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:55,510
possible reference frame.

481
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,570
So my dad had started with the sort of
existential question of how do you get

482
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:02,680
something from nothing?

483
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,520
And

484
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,520
now everything we were
learning was presenting us
with the very real possibility

485
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,870
that that something might not be made.
Anything that something might be nothing.

486
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,913
And

487
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,930
on the one hand that's really good news
because that actually offers a possible

488
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:26,110
solution to this sort of
ancient existential riddle.

489
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,040
But on the other hand,

490
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,760
it's kind of a bummer when you've just
spent 17 years trying to create a shared

491
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:37,650
reality with your father only to
learn that there maybe no such thing.

492
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:40,251
You know,

493
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:44,480
physics taught me that I have my reference
frame and my dad has his reference

494
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:48,380
frame and they mostly
overlap but not entirely,

495
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,550
which I think is just another way
to say that over the past 17 years,

496
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,310
physics has taught me
what it means to grow up,

497
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,930
but still I'm comforted to know that
there is a reference frame in which we are

498
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,250
together side by side,
my dad and me.

499
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,240
And that's the reference frame that
sits between the covers of my book.

500
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,830
So thank you very much.

501
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,813
Okay,

502
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,800
I can take questions.
Anyone has,

503
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,860
what's a good suggestion for getting our
daughter's involved in math and science?

504
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:30,950
Um, you have a chance to speak with a
lot of people who've made this be their

505
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:34,760
profession and, uh, from
their experience and yours,

506
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,650
what do you think is a good first step?

507
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,310
So I think it depends

508
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,480
on like personality a lot.
So for me,

509
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,190
I was sort of this rebellious kid and I
think if physics had been presented to

510
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:57,140
me in any normal way, like as like
something you have to study in school,

511
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,010
I just don't think it would've
ever like captured my imagination.

512
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:06,011
I think it was the fact
that my dad presented it as
this like secret thing that

513
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:07,720
we were going to do and
it was this mission,

514
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,200
we're going to figure out
the origin of the universe.

515
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:13,760
And it felt like by doing physics
that was rebelling in some way.

516
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:18,560
And so, which actually, I mean
I've thought about this a lot.

517
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:23,561
I think physics is a very inherently
rebellious subject because it requires you

518
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:28,610
to sort of question everything
we think we know about reality.

519
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:31,150
And if you look at sort of the
greatest physicists of all time,

520
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,170
they tend to be very
rebellious characters.

521
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:37,700
So I think it's sort of a shame because
a lot of times the people who are sort

522
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:42,260
of encouraged to go into science and
math tend to be like this sort of very

523
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:44,990
studious people who sort
of like go by the book.

524
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,270
And that's not always going to be,
I mean you need that,

525
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:49,760
but that's not always going to be
like the most creative thinkers.

526
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,720
And I think sometimes we weed out
creative thinkers who could've really

527
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:57,950
contributed to physics by not
appealing to that type of kid.

528
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,370
Um,
but you know,

529
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:05,480
I realize not everyone's going to go on
a secret mission for 17 years to figure

530
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:09,170
out the nature of the universe.
Um, so I don't know. I mean,

531
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:14,171
I really think it's like the physics
that's taught in school cool.

532
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,470
Like you don't get to the really good
stuff until you've already sort of

533
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:23,440
committed,
right?

534
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:27,250
So like you do Newtonian physics in high
school and then it's not until like if

535
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:28,570
you did physics in college,

536
00:34:28,571 --> 00:34:31,090
like you'll start to get into relativity
and quantum mechanics and that's where

537
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:32,500
it gets really cool.

538
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:38,610
But I think you can actually present
those topics to kids without needing a

539
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:41,980
crazy amount of math that they don't have.

540
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,960
And so I think if there was a way
to present the cooler parts physics,

541
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:51,820
a really exciting sort of mind blowing
stuff earlier on so that they would see

542
00:34:51,821 --> 00:34:53,710
that, okay, I have to get
through all this other stuff,

543
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:56,740
but it's going to be really
good. I feel like, you know,

544
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:57,970
people would be more into it.

545
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,093
Right?

546
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,350
So I'm actually like about 50%
through your book right now. Um,

547
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,920
and I have this problem when reading like
the sort of theoretical physics books,

548
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:18,590
which is at, you know, I usually
follow through, you know,

549
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,490
special relativity and general relativity.
But once I get to sections about,

550
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,600
you know, um, like supersymmetry
and string theory and
things like that, you know,

551
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:30,460
like I just stopped understanding.
And um,

552
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,370
you actually talk a little bit about
this in your book that, you know,

553
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:39,371
part of the problem here is that these
aren't actually like accurate because

554
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:43,590
really they're just describing
these mathematical equations, right?

555
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,210
Is it impossible to understand this
stuff without understanding like the math

556
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:54,000
involved or is this,

557
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,940
is it something that you encountered
when you were learning this at some point

558
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:59,910
did you just like say
like, wow, like, you know,

559
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,200
I didn't take physics but now
I have to like learn, you know,

560
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,990
differential equations just to, you
know, even understand this at all.

561
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,890
Right. It's a really good question. Um,

562
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:14,120
and I've sort of struggled
with this because there
definitely were times where I

563
00:36:14,121 --> 00:36:16,880
was like, oh my God, like I'm reading
through these papers and I'm like,

564
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:20,780
if I knew this math,
this would be a lot easier.

565
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,400
And I think it's true what
you were referring to.

566
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:30,350
Like this idea that physics is
expressed in mathematics, right?

567
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:33,980
And then if you try to
translate that into English,

568
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,910
there's not a one to one correlation
between English and math.

569
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:42,770
And so something is inevitably
lost in the translation. Um,

570
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,373
and,

571
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,240
and science writers tend
to rely a lot on metaphors.

572
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,350
And so now you're almost like an another
level where you're like losing a little

573
00:36:54,351 --> 00:36:56,720
bit something. Yeah. It might make
it easier to sort of understand,

574
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:59,960
but on the other hand you're
like losing more of the nuance.

575
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:05,050
And so you might say you can't really
understand it unless you understand the

576
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:08,750
math.
But on the other hand,

577
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,560
you know like the joke that
like the meaning of life,

578
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:17,760
the universe and everything is
42 like the reason that's funny,

579
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,700
like why is 42 not a satisfying answer?

580
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:24,140
Because you want like an
answer in English, right?

581
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,740
Like you want like a number wouldn't be
the answer because we want to know what

582
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:29,341
it means.

583
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:34,341
And so the math doesn't tell
you what anything means.

584
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,760
And so even though you lose
something in the translation,

585
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:41,490
you gain a sense of meaning.
And

586
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,320
a lot of physics is really based on
principles and having these foundational

587
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:52,810
principles and then deriving
the math from that. You know,

588
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,420
that's how Einstein worked.

589
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,540
And so you can understand all the
principles without understanding like the

590
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:01,830
particular solutions of equations.

591
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:06,831
And so I think you actually can have a
complete big picture understanding even

592
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:12,840
if you can't sit down and
actually do a particular problem.

593
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,593
Yeah.

594
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,200
My understanding of string theory, by the
way, I really enjoy your New York talk.

595
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,300
Thank you. My understanding of string
theory is a little bit, uh, outdated. Um,

596
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,980
why are strings, uh, not in variant?

597
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,070
Yeah, great question. Um, so

598
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,140
there was a period of time where everyone
was hoping that was the case and then

599
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,360
this is realized they had five different
versions of string theory that we're

600
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:48,010
all completely consistent. And so this
was sort of an embarrassment of riches.

601
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,170
Like you don't want five
dairies have everything,

602
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:51,430
you want one theory of everything.

603
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,790
And so this was sort of a crisis and Ed
Witten came along and he realized that

604
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:04,690
actually these five string theories,
even though they look very different,

605
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,420
are all mathematically equivalent.

606
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:10,450
There's transformations that you
can make to go from one to another.

607
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,900
And that's really unexpected because
you have like a theory with strings

608
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:20,350
vibrating in 10 dimensions and then you
have a theory of like these membranes

609
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:25,351
and 11 dimensions and then you have
particles and you have like radically

610
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:27,620
different space,
time geometries and,

611
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:32,621
and things that you would look to us like
drastically different physical worlds.

612
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,300
And they're actually all
descriptions of the same thing.

613
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,210
And so that was,
you know,

614
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,760
people refer to that as the
second superstring revolution.

615
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:46,870
And that was sort of considered this
amazing step because it's like, oh,

616
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,310
we don't really have five days.

617
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:52,120
We have one theory and now we'll
call it m theory. And that's great.

618
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,200
But what m theory is telling you is that
things like dimensionality and strings

619
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,440
are not invariant because what looked
like strings in one point of view,

620
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,010
one of these series look like particles
in another and they look at the memories

621
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:09,460
and another and what looks
like 10 dimensions and one
is 11 dimensions and other.

622
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:13,660
And there's no way to say that. Like it's
not like one's right and one's wrong.

623
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,970
It's just that there are two different
ways of looking at the exact same thing.

624
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:20,971
And so now m theory basically undermined
the idea that you can have an invariant

625
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,160
fundamental ingredient.

626
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,650
I was just snooping on your bookshelf.
So,

627
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,240
I know you've run into a couple of these,
and I'm,

628
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,820
I'm not going to remember the guys names,
but there are a couple of people who,

629
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,920
um, look at the, the,

630
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:45,760
the sort of the evolving
contradictions, uh, and,

631
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,903
and

632
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,930
if you wind up proving that
nothing is real, you know,

633
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:54,880
like if all of our particles,

634
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:59,670
the makeup us in this room
right now or originated, uh,

635
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,070
as hawking radiation and, and, you know,

636
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:07,150
so there's some frame of reference from
which absolutely nothing is real, that,

637
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,680
uh,
that you,

638
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:16,710
you sort of need to find another
kind of answer to things that,

639
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:21,830
what you've, you've the, I, I think
of that, uh, there's sort of like

640
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,270
a girly girl, listen, you know, notion of,

641
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,100
of completeness and being able to
prove the system is completed then the,

642
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:33,370
that may be, so you've got
the guy who thinks, uh,

643
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,320
the entire universe is
a cellular automata.

644
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,790
And then there's also the, uh, the,

645
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:44,390
the sort of thought experiment thing
that suggests that maybe the entire

646
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:48,600
universe is a simulation and
somebody else's universe. Uh,

647
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,290
uh,
I don't know.

648
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,080
I just wondered what you thought
about those kinds of notions.

649
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,750
Yeah, so they're all
really interesting. Um,

650
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:04,370
I think the same problems sort
of plague all of those ideas.

651
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:09,371
And the simulation question is really
interesting and it's actually directly

652
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:13,640
related to Godel
incompleteness theorem because

653
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:21,470
the sort of main conceptual difficulty
in talking about the universe as a whole,

654
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,310
especially when you have to apply like
quantum mechanics to the university as a

655
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:27,690
whole is the fact that

656
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,340
unlike anything else that we know of,

657
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,390
the universe only has an inside.
It doesn't have an outside,

658
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,030
it's like a one sided coin.

659
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:43,230
And so you can't have an
observer outside the universe.

660
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,590
So the universe is this like set
that contains itself, you know,

661
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:51,080
like you get into these
weird paradoxes and the,

662
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:55,530
there's no way for an observer to describe
the universe without it being self

663
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,950
referential in some sense because
the observers part of the universe.

664
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,910
And so with the simulation question,

665
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,940
you're saying, you know, what, if this
whole universe is actually, you know,

666
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,660
a simulation embedded on a
computer and some higher reality,

667
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,113
well,

668
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:21,610
for one thing, I don't know
that it would matter that much.

669
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,300
Like they would still be some fundamental
laws of physics that I really believe

670
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,800
you would be able to figure out. Um, but

671
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,250
there's also like,
in order to assess the reality of reality,

672
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,540
you have to step outside of it, right? So
like to know that you were a simulation,

673
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,750
you'd have to be outside the simulation
and then how do you know that that's not

674
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:49,840
a simulation? You'd have to be
outside of that. And so it's again,

675
00:43:49,841 --> 00:43:52,090
this question of what is
your reference frame like,

676
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,420
because by definition you
can't be outside reality.

677
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:00,450
And so there is no reference frame from
which you can determine the reality of

678
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:05,590
reality. And so I don't know if
that totally answers your question,

679
00:44:05,591 --> 00:44:06,430
but I think,

680
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,040
I think all of these issues that
you're raising are very related. Um,

681
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:17,560
and you know, Stephen Wolfram's
theory that you were referring to.

682
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,320
Um,
it was really interesting.

683
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,440
I don't really know it well enough to
comment that intelligibly but I mean it's,

684
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,160
it's going to be subject to the same
issues that we're talking here but because

685
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,180
it's another way of doing things but
it still has to like replicate all of

686
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:40,740
physics as we know it. And so it's
going to run into these same questions.

687
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,160
Emails.
That's true.

688
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,500
Makes Sense. Because this stuff's
amazing but also makes my head spin.

689
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,250
But what is, you said there was a
trajectory and things are, you know,

690
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,030
what is in variance becoming smaller
and smaller and it may be nothing,

691
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,220
but what is the end game for?

692
00:44:57,221 --> 00:45:01,300
Obviously there's an end game for people
that study this and are amazed by and

693
00:45:01,301 --> 00:45:04,660
everything else. But for someone who
doesn't have this understanding, your,

694
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,600
and when, if there is an end game
where it does become figured out,

695
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,620
does it have an effect on those?
Like what,

696
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:13,720
what effect could it have on
people outside of just in theory?

697
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,063
Um,

698
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,470
I mean I think,

699
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,440
I don't think it's going
like have technological
applications. I mean, I don't,

700
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:31,260
you never know. Right? You never know.
You can ever see these things coming.

701
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:36,261
But I think this is really just about
answering sort of deep existential

702
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:42,450
questions that humans have been asking
for as long as there have been humans.

703
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:47,130
Right. I mean the question
of like, what is real?

704
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,890
What am I, how am I here? What
am I seeing? I mean it's just,

705
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,790
I think it's just things that
we deeply want to know. And,

706
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,740
and it's funny because on the one hand
it seems like incredibly abstract,

707
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:04,170
especially if you're talking about what
you have 14 billion years ago and the

708
00:46:04,171 --> 00:46:08,910
origin of the universe or the cosmos,
which is so huge and quantum mechanics,

709
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:12,450
which is the scale is so tiny and you
sort of can't like place herself in these

710
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:16,770
things. But I always have these
moments where like, cause I get,

711
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:17,611
you know,

712
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:20,370
I start thinking about this stuff and
it kind of start taking it for granted a

713
00:46:20,371 --> 00:46:23,010
little bit. And then like all of a sudden
I'll have this moment where I'm like,

714
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,400
oh my God. Like I'm talking about like
literally like this isn't real. You know,

715
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:31,401
like I'll have like I'm talking about the
stuff right here and me and all of us.

716
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,820
And so it's not that abstract.

717
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:40,260
It's just like you can't really live
your life thinking about it every minute

718
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:43,560
like that or else you're going
to have a problem. But yeah.

719
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,330
So I think it's just sort of,

720
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,500
I mean I think anytime you have a better
understanding of the way that nature

721
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:53,334
works,

722
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,080
it's going to have some positive
effect or maybe not positive.

723
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:02,820
It's going to have some effect. It's going
to be useful in some way. Um, but yeah,

724
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:06,360
when you get to this level, like
will it be practical? Probably not,

725
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,600
sorry for being a stick in
the mud, but, uh, if they're,

726
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:15,470
if strings aren't invariant is,
are there any invariance in theory,

727
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,860
there are, not that anyone knows him. Um,

728
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,390
and it's really interesting because
when I've talked to string theorists

729
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:30,940
and I'll say like, like you, you'll hear
a string theorists will say things like,

730
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:36,370
we don't really know what the theory
is. Like, we have all these equations,

731
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,040
we have the theory,
but we don't know what it's a theory of.

732
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,490
And what they mean by that is like,
you know,

733
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,980
like quantum field theory is
a theory of quantum fields.

734
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,770
String theory was a theory,
strengths m theory,

735
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,680
they don't know like
they have the steering,

736
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,720
they don't know what it's describing
and there's no basic ontology there and

737
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,310
they're well aware of that.
And it's like

738
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,250
they see it as either something will
emerge and there will be something that is

739
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:09,990
describing that we just don't realize yet.

740
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,200
I happen to think it's
actually more useful if, if
there's not an ontology there,

741
00:48:16,201 --> 00:48:19,800
because now you can answer this question
of how you get something from nothing.

742
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:23,880
But I mean, it's really
fascinating like m theory, like,

743
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,470
you know, if you read physics books,
like everything you read will say,

744
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,590
nobody knows what the m stands for.

745
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,950
Like maybe it stands for
mystery or mother magic or,

746
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:40,050
um, you know, I think there was
a Nobel prize winner who said,

747
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:43,290
I think it stands,
it's the upside down w for Whitten.

748
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:45,860
And people had all these
theories about like,

749
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,760
like even you read Stephen Hawking's book,
it's like,

750
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:52,140
no one knows what the m stands for. And
I'm kind of like, how can no one, no,

751
00:48:52,141 --> 00:48:56,520
like Edwin coined it and he's still alive.
Like, why doesn't someone just ask him?

752
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,600
And so I went and I asked
him and he was like,

753
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,140
it stands for membrane. Like I,
you know, originally said like, oh,

754
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:07,020
it could be mother mystery, whatever.
But I was kidding. You know?

755
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,050
And nobody really got the joke.
But,

756
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,730
so the m stands for membrane,

757
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,120
but membranes are not invariant
and that theory. And so,

758
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,073
yeah.

759
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:26,140
So there's a deeper point to the like, no
one knows what I'm stands for, which is,

760
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,260
even though like,
literally it stands for membrane.

761
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:34,290
I think part of what that means is like
they don't know what it's a theory of.

762
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:41,270
It's just never really happened. I mean,
it's like a weird way of doing physics,

763
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,333
but fascinating.

764
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,453
Yeah.

765
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,590
All right.
Thank you guys so much for coming.

766
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,700
