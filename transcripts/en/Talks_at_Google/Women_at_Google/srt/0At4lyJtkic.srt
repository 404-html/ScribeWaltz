former president Barack Obama.

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,710
You've actually carried the torch in
the Olympics and the Winter Olympics.

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,563
I was out,

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,450
done any sports in my life,
nothing.

18
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:10,020
I can't even walk and I had to
carry the flag and the Olympic.

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,390
Thanks.
Go figure.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,200
We were happy to have you represent
Latino Medica and women all over the world

21
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:19,270
and that,
um,

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,310
you've received a lot of honor awards
and honorary doctorates from universities

23
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,040
and very,
very successful

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,770
for someone who high, hardly finished
high school. Well those honorary degree

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,760
received very ironic.
Yeah.

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,170
It's to say that we shouldn't have
gone to high school, but um, no,

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,351
we're,

28
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,720
we're absolutely thrilled about all the
works that you've given us to the world.

29
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,020
Um, and you continue to give back.
You give yourself back with your,

30
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:47,931
the sub l again,

31
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:52,240
the foundation that empowers women
and girls and all throughout cheating

32
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,170
California and were amazed by the words
that you have for us and the actions

33
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:58,990
that you continue to give.
Thank you. Thank you.

34
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,170
So I think would like to start
with, um, but from the beginning,

35
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:07,060
from like how you became the person you
became, someone born, a girl born in Peru,

36
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:12,061
which lane girl born in Peru and came
here and had stories of love and mystery

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,960
and coincidence is, can you
tell us a little while? Um,

38
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,750
I wasn't planning to be a writer really.

39
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,840
I was born in the middle
of the second war,

40
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,000
world war in a very conservative,
Catholic,

41
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,110
patriarchal environment.
And I was supposed to be somebody's wife,

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,770
somebody's mother.
It didn't work out for me.

43
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:40,090
I didn't have the raw material
for that job. I, no, not at all.

44
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,990
So I was very rebellious.
Even when I was very young,

45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,260
I sort of realized that being a woman
was not to my advantage because I saw my

46
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:52,690
mom, I saw that my momma in
the household where we lived,

47
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,480
we lived with my
grandfather and my uncles.

48
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,380
The males had all the privileges and the
W my mother, who was the woman, didn't, I,

49
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,040
she didn't have any money and
she didn't have any independence.

50
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,600
I didn't want to be like her.

51
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,050
So I think I became a feminist around
age five before that word was invented in

52
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:12,970
Chile. And then, um,

53
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,100
I became a journalist until
it worked as a journalist.

54
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:23,080
I did everything except radio.
I did television, newspapers,
magazines, you name it.

55
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,220
And then we had a military coup in Chile
in 1973 and very soon I had to get out

56
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,024
of my country.

57
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,420
And I went as a political
refugee to Venezuela where
I could not find a job as a

58
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,314
journalist.

59
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,480
So I worked in all kinds of odd jobs
to make a living and support my kids,

60
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,090
two kids and at least one dog.
And um,

61
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,130
and then by 1981,
I was working,

62
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,710
administering a school in Caracas.

63
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,810
That was not the job for me.
I can't even add or subtract.

64
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,320
And I had to deal with checkbooks and
with money and it was just a total

65
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:08,530
disaster.
But they get me for like four years.

66
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,440
And during that time in 1981,

67
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,700
I got a phone call that my
grandfather whom I adored,

68
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,340
was dying and I could not return to
my country to beat him farewell. So I,

69
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:25,510
um, I started a letter, which
was like a spiritual letter.

70
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,040
I would write to him often,

71
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,510
but this was a different letter because
I wasn't sure if he was going to be able

72
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:32,344
to read it.

73
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,810
And I wanted to tell him that all
the stories that he had told me,

74
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:40,420
and he was a wonderful storyteller.
I remembered them,

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,490
I had them all with me. It was my,
they represented my background,

76
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,510
my roots, my family, everything
that I had left behind.

77
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,800
And I think that in a way,
as a political refugee,

78
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,080
I felt an overwhelming nostalgia. You,

79
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:02,770
you sort of idealize the
country that you left.

80
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,530
There's a reason why you left
because you couldn't live there,

81
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:07,900
but still one idea license it.

82
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,300
And the idea is to try to go
back all the time. So, um,

83
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,890
the letter from my grandfather was
about the stories that he had told me.

84
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,510
And the first story was a
story of my aunt Rosa. My,

85
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,590
my great aunt Rosa was my grandfather's
first fiancee and she died in mysterious

86
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,720
circumstances before
they could get married.

87
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,570
So eight years later,

88
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:39,571
he married the youngest daughter in the
same family with the idea that if he had

89
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,780
been accepted once,
he would be accepted the second time too.

90
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,550
So that's why he married my grandmother
who nobody wanted to marry because he

91
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:52,840
was so weird. She was, she was
adorable, but totally weird.

92
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,580
She knew she lived in another world.

93
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,590
She was always experimenting
with the paranormal.

94
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,010
So my first few years were with this
wonderful grandmother and there was a

95
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:05,280
table,

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,280
a very heavy Spanish table
where my grandmother would
have the same answers and

97
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,030
she would call the spirits with a table
and they say that the table would jump

98
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,570
twice for years.

99
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:22,220
One for now I have the table in my house.
I've tried to

100
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,420
everything you need to men to the table.

101
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,330
So I don't know how she did it,
but there must've been some trick

102
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,200
there. So with that
background, with that family,

103
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,970
I think that it also only natural
that I would have to write about it,

104
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,270
about that grandmother who is
clad in the house of the spirits.

105
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,330
My first novel.

106
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,610
So the idea was to tell my grandfather
that I remembered what he had told me on

107
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:53,590
the first story in the letter
was a story of my aunt Rosa,

108
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,830
my great aunt Rosa.
And then I kept on driving.

109
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,910
He died and I couldn't stop.
And it wasn't the memories of the family,

110
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,650
things that I invented that I made up
and the history of my country for 17

111
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:07,484
years.

112
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,580
So it wasn't micro world of the family
that reflected the macro world of the

113
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,650
country. And so that's the
house of the spirits. Of course,

114
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:16,880
I didn't plan it that way.

115
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,030
It just happened later in this book was
written 35 years ago and now that the

116
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:26,990
book has been studied and whatever,
people tell me all this

117
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,400
because I didn't plan it,
you asked me what the book is about.

118
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:35,240
I'm telling you what the reviewers upset,
not what I had in mind.

119
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,300
So knowing now the reach
that that book has had,

120
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,900
would you have done anything differently?
Would you have?

121
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,840
Well, you know, I was,

122
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,490
we were talking in the car that I never
read my books because there's so much

123
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:50,590
that you can correct. You
can correct forever. Well,

124
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,090
it saw what it was.
Okay.

125
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,520
At the time is totally
politically incorrect today.

126
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,180
There are certain terms or certain
things that you can say today,

127
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,740
not even in Chile.
In Chile,

128
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:06,630
we have very little idea of what
politically correct is in Venezuela.

129
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:08,630
Even less. But, uh,

130
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,810
but still there are things that you
don't say anymore in this century that we

131
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,160
live in today.
Too Bad,

132
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,510
we're very colorful actually.
Do you think,

133
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,500
do you think that the Spanish language,
um,

134
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,180
has morphed the way that you think in
terms of femininity and masculinity?

135
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,390
And as that's being translated
to these other books,

136
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,400
is there anything that's
lost in translation?

137
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,150
Well,
as we all know in the Spanish language,

138
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,240
you cannot change everything.
Every,

139
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,810
every adjective has gender because
it applies to a now that has gender,

140
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,060
which doesn't happen in English.
So for example,

141
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,380
I have a granddaughter who is
into the LGBT, et Cetera, and she,

142
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,730
um,

143
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,730
she has asked me to change the pronouns
in English being the second language.

144
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,770
For me it's pretty hard.

145
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,630
But to translate that into Spanish is
almost impossible because every adjective

146
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:11,460
would have gender. And so I can't
handle it in Spanish that well.

147
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,480
In that sense, it's a very different
language. The other thing with,

148
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:20,481
with Spanish also is that it is a
less flexible language than English.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,260
In English, everything can be turned
into a verb. You can add other words.

150
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:30,000
You can put words together in
wonderful ways. Spanish is very strict,

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,360
so you have to stick to
grammar and spelling of course.

152
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,380
And you've been called the most widely
read Spanish language author and you have

153
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,520
got a CMR kiss and Jose,
um,

154
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,460
and so many other amazing authors.

155
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,100
Now that you see your name among those,

156
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,040
does it change the way you
approached new books and new stories?

157
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,580
No, it doesn't because I
tried to write from the womb,

158
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,320
from the brain so much and I
tried to write the best I can,

159
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:09,710
whatever the critics say or how many
books are sold or if they are compared to

160
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:14,520
somebody else's writing. I
can't worry about that. And uh,

161
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,980
I don't even read the
reviews because I get either,

162
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,680
I would say I get influenced.

163
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,430
I don't get upset because I understand
that if you do anything in public what we

164
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:33,150
do, people will criticize you. Some people
will like you or some people will not.

165
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,460
And I have to be ready for that.

166
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,610
So I don't get all

167
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,970
upset because something is bad and I
don't celebrate too much when something is

168
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:49,080
good because everything passes,
it doesn't matter in the long run,

169
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,490
nothing matters.

170
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,390
And out of all these authors like Jose
Donoso and Garcia Marquez, was there any,

171
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,460
any one off there that influenced
you and that you looked up to?

172
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,080
I was in my late teens,

173
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,110
early twenties when I started reading
the big names of the boom of Latin

174
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,410
American literature,
at least 25 all male.

175
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,470
Many of them would mustache man
who wrote this fantastic books.

176
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,320
They were different books in
different countries of Latin America,

177
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,710
but all of them was formed as sort of
harmonic choir of that that you know,

178
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,323
in a way,

179
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,870
told the world what Latin America was
about and told us who we were as a whole.

180
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,800
So I grew up reading them.

181
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,720
Yes. And did you ever know, you know,

182
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,170
being them male authors,

183
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:46,620
was there anything about you that you
wanted to share differently that would

184
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,420
impact Latino literature?

185
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,610
I didn't plan it.
I didn't think that way.

186
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,780
I just wrote what I knew and had been
working for women and with women and being

187
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,850
a woman all my life.
So,

188
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,890
so it was only natural that my protagonist
would tend to be more female than

189
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:07,510
male. So when, when my book, the
House of the spirits was published,

190
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,540
they said that I was the only
female voice in the boom at then.

191
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,150
They rapidly said, no, she doesn't
belong to the boom. She's possible.

192
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,710
They didn't want a female in
the boom of course. So, um,

193
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,890
so I'm possible whatever posters and um,

194
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,150
I never compared my writing to
what they wrote other people did,

195
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,520
but I don't,

196
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,900
you're writing was definitely influential
to too many other authors after

197
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,780
is that because my book was so
successful that even from the,

198
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,320
from the start publishers all over,

199
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,690
not only in Spain but all over
realize that there is, um,

200
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,890
a readership of feminine readership
that wants to read female voices.

201
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,650
So there was a market for,
for,

202
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,340
for female authors that before
they had not maybe noticed.

203
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:06,660
Yeah.
And so in a way,

204
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,230
that book opened the door for
other women to be published.

205
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,460
And I feel very proud of that.

206
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,790
Well, yeah. And within these books you'd
have powerful women, powerful women.

207
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:22,420
Are these women portrayed and from
real life people in your life?

208
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,130
Do you know any weak women?
I do not

209
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,430
know.
I just pick up

210
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,880
people in the street and people,

211
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,580
women that I know through the foundation,

212
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,610
extraordinary women who are survivors
of sometimes the most horrible trauma,

213
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,490
and they not only survived,
they become leaders in their communities.

214
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,930
So that kind of of person,
if a woman or man,

215
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,570
it's always fascinating. Yeah. And,

216
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,290
and I'm always attracted
to those people who are,

217
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,500
who stand outside the big
umbrella of the establishment,

218
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,060
immigrants,
refugees,

219
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,620
and people who have other gender choices.

220
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,370
People who are come from different races,
from different ages.

221
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,590
I've been writing a lot about very
old people and some readers say,

222
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,050
why do you write all these
people who don't even read?

223
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,850
Because they can't even breed.
No, I, I'm interested always in,

224
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:27,450
in what is outside. Yes.
Not the main stream.

225
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,920
So including these diverse characters,
of course,

226
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:34,340
there's a part of magic to
it that Magic's not normal.

227
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:39,170
You don't see that every day.
And well, let's, let's, yeah,

228
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,640
let's imagine to you, magic to
me, or I guess the way I was,

229
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,590
I was phrasing it is, you know, the
fire and the poof in the, you know,

230
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:52,040
out there, but, but the magic that you
see in the night reading your books

231
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,660
is natural,
is in the one in the room.

232
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,580
What I understand is that we know nothing.

233
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,480
Maybe you hear hearing Google are, you
know, more, but, but normal people,

234
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,610
normal people know very little.
Uh,

235
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:10,280
normal people have very little control
over their lives and everything that

236
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:14,660
stands outside that control,
that explanation of life is mysterious.

237
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,640
And some in some cultures like American,

238
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:22,040
many play places in Europe
who would, you don't, would,

239
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:26,930
you cannot explain what you're going
to control and what you cannot sell,

240
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,120
you ignore. It's not in the
realm of reality. However,

241
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:36,080
in most of the world, and I would say
all of Latin America, all of Africa,

242
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:36,950
all of Asia,

243
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,500
we understand that there are dimensions
of reality that we don't control them.

244
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:47,420
We don't understand it, but we accept
them. For example, in everybody's lives,

245
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,170
they are coincidences. Those
moments in which you, you think,

246
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,080
I have been here before and you,

247
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:58,070
I know this place and you know
that you have never been there,

248
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:03,071
but somehow it's familiar or a person
that you meet and you have the idea that

249
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:07,760
you've met that person before or I am
thinking of someone on the phone rings and

250
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:11,120
it's that person that kind of,
or dreams,

251
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,360
that kind of thing that
happens in everybody's life.

252
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,010
You all ignore it because you
don't need it. But, but in my life,

253
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,640
in my country, my culture, you use it,

254
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,740
you use it in everyday life. It becomes
part of, it's integrated to life.

255
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,210
For example,
my,

256
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,560
my mom died two weeks ago and she,

257
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,670
she was wonderful and we had a very close
relationship and she would write to me

258
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,750
every single day and I wrote to her
every day for four years or more.

259
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,440
So I have 40 years of letters in boxes.

260
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,120
Every box has between 600 and 800 letters.

261
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,840
So multiply by 40 I can't multiply,
but you can Google it.

262
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,610
It's a lot.
And now that she's gone,

263
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,990
I thought, well, why can't I write to her?

264
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,280
Maybe she cannot write to me anymore,
but I can try to her. Why not?

265
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,700
And so then I started writing to her
and establishing a connection that is

266
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:19,300
perfectly natural to me.
And I know that,

267
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,770
that if I write about it in a novel,

268
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:26,330
it would be either crazy or magic realism.
It's just life.

269
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,040
It's a d like when people say that
your work is part of magic realism.

270
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,000
I think that my work is very realistic.

271
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,980
It just accepts what is mysterious,
but it's very realistic. You know,

272
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,720
Garcia Marquez, the master of
magic realism explains it very,

273
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,450
very wonderfully.

274
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,390
He says that in his book a
hundred years of solitude,

275
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,090
he has Romaleos, Labeija,
Eh, rises to heaven in, in,

276
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,510
in body and soul.

277
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:02,820
The original stories that in the village
where he lived in the town where he

278
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:03,654
lived,

279
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,690
a girl had got the air girl got pregnant
and the family made it disappears,

280
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,680
centers centered away.

281
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,160
And the explanation the family gave
was rose to heaven in Seoul and,

282
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,780
and body like the Virgin Mary.

283
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:24,360
And nobody asked more questions because
everybody understood that no questions

284
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:28,200
were accepted. But when he wrote
that in the book, it didn't,

285
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,790
it didn't work.

286
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,800
And he said he wrote it several times
and he'd never worked until he had her

287
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,980
hanging the sheets to dry and a winter
came and lifted her with the sheets.

288
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,730
And then there is sort of explanation,
you know,

289
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,530
it's a parachute that elevated
her with a sheets is magic.

290
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:53,790
Real listen without the sheets
is fantasy like Harry Potter.

291
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,050
Hmm. It, yes. It is interesting.

292
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,580
And it's interesting to hear that magic
realism within the Latino literature is

293
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,710
almost easier to understand because we
have, you know, spirits and we believe in,

294
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,040
but we have spirits here too. I mean,
all my friends see psychics, they

295
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,300
please start here. They see
the whore horoscope. Everybody
has a sign. I mean, yeah.

296
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,740
Sodiank sign or whatever.

297
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,780
So what's the difference? It has a
different name. Yeah. That's interesting.

298
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,480
And do you do speak to them about that?

299
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:29,070
Like do you connect those spirits
into the, into the Latino community?

300
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,250
Meaning for those that go to psychics and,
um,

301
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,610
before we go to psychics to oh,
that's right. That's right. Yeah.

302
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,590
Is there a way that you
use this to impact, um,

303
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,060
Latino literature are not Latino
literature, but literature globally,

304
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,950
like this idea of, of everybody
believes in the same things. It is.

305
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,210
They're wonderful literary devices.
When you can't solve something, you,

306
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,930
you introduce a psychic
and it's wonderful.

307
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,670
The only time that it didn't work for me,

308
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,440
I was writing a crime
novel and in a crime novel,

309
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:09,150
everything needs to fit so I couldn't
introduce it. Astronomer, other psychic.

310
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:09,984
Unfortunate.

311
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,060
Sure. So, um,

312
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,170
I'm curious because you've had a lot of
impact and not just Latino literature,

313
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,000
global literature in representing the
Latino Culture in Tulane culture and

314
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:27,820
history, how do you see that this is
impacting others and seeing, you know,

315
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,050
Chilean history and books and those,

316
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,800
I don't know if how it
impacts how this, but, but um,

317
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,760
I hope it does because I try to,

318
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,580
what I have written several
historical novels and,

319
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,860
well, when you write fiction, you
have more freedom of course. And that,

320
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,990
that's wonderful.
But I tried to present an event,

321
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,390
historical event from the perspective,

322
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,680
from another eye, not the perspective
of the winners. For example,

323
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:03,390
I have a novel,
a novel called Island beneath the sea,

324
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,270
and it is about the slave revolt in Haiti.

325
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,580
And of course all the history
books were written by white men,

326
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,540
French or American or whatever,
winners. The winners always.

327
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,700
We never have the perspective of the,
of the, the poor people, the slaves,

328
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,920
the people of color,
the children,

329
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,760
the people who really
experienced the event.

330
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,470
So that's where I try to stand
as a writer and as an observer.

331
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,490
When I research for,
for a historical novel,

332
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,560
I go to if possible,

333
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:41,250
to pry the documents because
if I read the history books,

334
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:44,670
that's the official history.
And I want the other history,

335
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,950
what people were saying in their letters.
I have a, an oval about the gold rush.

336
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,400
We all know the gold rush
because we've read about it here,

337
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,560
written by the 40 niners or the people
who follow the 40 niners but long before

338
00:21:58,561 --> 00:22:03,150
the 49 or so arrived, people of
color were here, native Americans,

339
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,190
Mexicans, Peruvians, Chileans.

340
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,400
We were all in the minds before and
that those voices have been obliterated.

341
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,720
They don't exist. And the women
who came also, they don't exist.

342
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,420
So in that,
for that book,

343
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,930
I went to the library in Chile to research
letters that Chilean miners wrote to

344
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:31,470
their families in Chile in 1850. So, uh,

345
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,770
I got a perspective from,
from another angle,

346
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,990
but we never hear in the United States.
Yeah,

347
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,900
that's interesting to hear that letters,
the stories, the stories, stories,

348
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,770
a person in a, in a letter for
example, someone can explain that. Um,

349
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,273
Eh,

350
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,840
a bottle of champagne was
cheaper than a glass of milk.

351
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,070
You never see that in a history book.

352
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,160
And the reason is that there
was no one to make the cows.

353
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,750
They were all looking for gold and at
champagne came in ships from France.

354
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:04,310
So that was available.

355
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,320
Interesting. So here at Google, um,

356
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,830
similar to you being a storyteller
and expanding the stories,

357
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,410
reached to people around the globe.

358
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,740
We write code and we make products and
try to make these products accessible to

359
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,990
the world. How do you see
Google being our, you know,

360
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:26,991
yourself in reaching out to these greater
audiences with stories that had these

361
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:31,320
little details that aren't
communicated in other ways? Yeah,

362
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,620
I love the process of building a universe
of details that it is in the details

363
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:41,730
that you get the,
the setting,

364
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,790
the theater where the characters move and
the more details I can find to make it

365
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:53,960
believable, then the better
that the reader will believe.

366
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,930
The unbelievable,
which is the fiction.

367
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,290
So I create fictional characters that
move in a real world and that makes it

368
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,540
more believable for the reader.
Now,

369
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,140
how that reaches other cultures,
I don't know.

370
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:11,390
But I love when I read a book,
for example,

371
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:15,750
written by an Indian author and I
can see how life is in India for,

372
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,240
for that group of people and
learn about them or it's,

373
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,180
I find it fascinating.
And do these stories impact your stories,

374
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:28,100
stories from all over the world? I
mean, you don't, you my latest book,

375
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,840
um,
what's the name?

376
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,000
What's your latest book?
And I forgot Laurie,

377
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,810
in the midst of winter. Sorry,
because this is a memoir, right? No,

378
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,130
it's not that my leg,

379
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:44,540
my latest book is fiction and I forgot
the name because I write in Spanish and I

380
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:47,600
remember everything in Spanish.
I can't remember anything in English,

381
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,230
and in that book I have a character
that is what the Marlin undocumented

382
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:54,950
migrants,

383
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,950
she's a refugee and she's running away
from the gangs in her country that they

384
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:04,820
have exterminated her family.
I didn't have to invent that character.

385
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,980
I had to reconstruct her world, but
that character, we have cases like that.

386
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:14,810
In my foundation, we work with
refugees and a story like that.

387
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:19,790
I don't have to create the story.
I just have to recreate the village,

388
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,570
the house, the grandmother,
the food, the market,

389
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,450
the voyage,
traveling,

390
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:30,170
all the way from what the Amala Gross
Mexico to come to the United States,

391
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,360
the border living in clandestine it
in the United States, undocumented.

392
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,880
That's the world I need to construct
very carefully and sticking to the truth

393
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,990
because if I can be very
believable in that aspect,

394
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,280
then the character of Evelyn
Ortega will emerge as real.

395
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,560
And in sharing these stories of other
people and you have memories of your own

396
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:02,030
life and line and recent one,

397
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,130
is there a difference in the way you go
about writing other stories versus your

398
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:11,180
own story? Yeah, Eh,
when I write a memoir,

399
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:13,490
I'm not writing about me alone.

400
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,290
I wrote about me and the people who
are around me, my family friends,

401
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,530
and I asked myself,
is this my story to tell?

402
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:29,531
Am I betraying someone if I have to
choose between betraying my mother or

403
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:34,430
telling the story, I tell
the story. Yeah, I can't.

404
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,620
I can't a system, I tell the
story, but I understand that,

405
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,010
that there is a limit to how
much, so my, my way of handling,

406
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,100
when I write a memoir first the
problem is I write in Spanish,

407
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:51,140
but once it's translated or
I have this sort of idea, I,

408
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,600
I show it to the people who
are named by name in the book.

409
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,230
And if they don't approve, I
take them out. I don't change it,

410
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:03,090
but I think I take them out. It
has happened only once. And I,

411
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,930
with the latest memoir that
I wrote a long time ago,

412
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,860
I promised my son that I
will never write another one.

413
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,890
And I have so much has
happened since then.

414
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,850
I have so much to tell and I can't
because I promised Nico I wouldn't.

415
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,510
Hmm. So you have your
family here or your, um,

416
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,200
your son having your family near and,

417
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,790
and having your mother
be a huge inspiration.

418
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:32,070
Does that come across very well in the
love that like Latinos usually, you know,

419
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,360
very communalistic, uh, community.

420
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,220
Yeah. But I don't have the
extended family. You know,

421
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,670
I've tried to put together an extended
family and it worked for a while when my

422
00:27:42,831 --> 00:27:44,270
grand children were little.

423
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,430
We sort of adopted friends with their
children that were part of this almost

424
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:52,430
compound where we lived.
And uh,

425
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,650
kids would come to the pool. It would
be an open house, always open house.

426
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,930
And I had the feeling that I belonged
in that little tribe where we all belong

427
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,140
in Latin America,
but now all that is gone.

428
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,520
The grandchildren are older.
They have gone to college,

429
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,210
they finish college, they have their own
lives. They don't remember me at all.

430
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:19,430
You can adopt me. Yeah. Yeah. Good.

431
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,820
And so, um, I like you're saying,

432
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,950
a lot of us have immigrated
over and there's been a
consistent or the bureau, um,

433
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,520
consensus just recently in
the seventies and eighties,

434
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:35,030
started using the term
Hispanic, Latino. Um,

435
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,530
and we've been here long before then,
so in,

436
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,140
but we're still kind of creating our
identity within the United States.

437
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,690
How do you think is created already?

438
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,580
And so how do you see us showing
to the world that you don't?

439
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:53,000
We've been here long before anyone else

440
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,940
and you know,
I don't think it matters.

441
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:59,350
I don't think it matters who came first
because we all came from somewhere else.

442
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:01,510
Yeah.
Except native Americans.

443
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,920
Every single person who lives in this
country has some ancestor that comes from

444
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:06,754
another place.

445
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,140
So who came first or who came
second is not that important.

446
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:16,590
I think that what is important is how we
sort of blend into the culture without

447
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:22,300
losing our identity.
And we contribute or not to court.

448
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:27,301
This is this large country made of
so many different colors and voices.

449
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,410
So it is the diversity that
makes the United States so,

450
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,560
so powerful and so unique.

451
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,210
It took country created on an idea,

452
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,570
most emerge historically
out of circumstances,

453
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,940
geography,
um,

454
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,210
tribes that get together or
not language that is common,

455
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,750
but the United States was created with
an idea and the idea of the founding

456
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:59,320
fathers was very clear.

457
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,830
And it's a country that with those
ideas has been so powerful and so,

458
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,800
so important in the world.

459
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,460
And we tend to forget what made
this country so extraordinary.

460
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,960
The ideas,
the values,

461
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,990
the principles in which the country was
built and the people who came from all

462
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:25,960
over the world,
all that is so important to keep going,

463
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,420
to keep being what we are.
Yeah.

464
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,910
That's inspiration on.

465
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,960
And we're very excited to continue to
build and show the world our identity from

466
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:38,570
these, you know, the American
dream of coming here. Um, yeah,

467
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,280
but the American dream is not white
supremacy and its diversity. No,

468
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,780
it is all of us. Absolutely. Yeah. Um,

469
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,860
I have one funny question then since we're
here at willow. We did read question.

470
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,460
Yes. Yes. Have you, um,

471
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,990
have you ever googled yourself and
no. No. Never googled yourself?

472
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,110
I hadn't thought about it. One.
Interesting. Maybe we should try to,

473
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,860
would I did Google like guy? Um, yeah,

474
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,430
that's the only time
I've googled me buddy.

475
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,260
I was,
um,

476
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,930
I separated from my husband
after 28 years of marriage.

477
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,320
I'm in good terms.
It wasn't something awful at all,

478
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,060
but I was in a sort of dark mood because
I was 73 years old and I thought the

479
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:29,900
rest of my life I'll be alone
sleeping alone with my dog. Not Nice.

480
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,160
Not that my daughter, no,
no, my dog is nice. And um,

481
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,480
and then a guy out of the
blue started emailing me

482
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,500
and there are a few stockers,
but not many. As you get older,

483
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,030
the stockers diminish number.

484
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,510
Um, I saw, he started emailing
me and then I googled him.

485
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,010
But I had a wonderful assistant, Shandra
who was like, like Sherlock Holmes.

486
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:01,340
She could get in Google. And yet,
I mean the brand of underwear,

487
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,410
every everything. So by that time
I met the guy five months later,

488
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,530
I knew absolutely everything about
his life, his family, his kids,

489
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,950
his car, everything. Wow.

490
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:17,210
So Google has a big dollar all the time
that I have used to Google for that.

491
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,280
Well, thank you so much. I think at
this time we'd love to open up the,

492
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,240
that will be great.

493
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:28,270
The floor to questions from the audience
and we'll have to Google yourself.

494
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,570
Sometimes he won't care.

495
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,970
So he's interesting and sometimes
flattering or I'm sure with you often,

496
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:39,940
I'm sure it's not flattering when
you start seeing your pictures. Yes.

497
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,990
Hi, my name Monica. And um,

498
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,650
you used the word blend
in an interesting way.

499
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,723
Um,

500
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:56,020
blend to sort of blend
culturally so that um,

501
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,310
we're, you know, we're seeing for who
we are and how we are. The way that,

502
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,340
that I've experienced blending as a
Latina and trying to fit in is in contrast

503
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:11,390
to how you described it.
And I'd like to know,

504
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,600
have you had experiences of trying to
blend that have been at compromise or at

505
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:18,740
odds to who you are?

506
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,613
Well,

507
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,280
sometimes I asked to speak to
Latino youth mostly who feel,

508
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,500
who are either calm recently or they
descend from Latino parents who speak

509
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:37,330
Spanish at home.

510
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:42,331
So it's a very Latino culture
at home and they feel outside,

511
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,420
like outsiders.

512
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,350
They feel that they are not the blonde
kid with blue eyes that is popular at

513
00:33:47,351 --> 00:33:49,510
school.
And I keep telling them,

514
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,320
you don't have to let go of anything.
You can have everything.

515
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,500
You can have your culture,
your language, your food,

516
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:03,460
your music and you can still have
everything that this country offers.

517
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,740
Why compromise for less.

518
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,900
You can have everything
and keep what is your,

519
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,320
your roots and makes you
different and special and richer.

520
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,160
I,
but because I speak two languages,

521
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:21,250
I feel that I have two
different visions of the world.

522
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:26,500
When I read my books in
translation because I have
to check the translation into

523
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:30,790
English, I realized that it is,
that that language is like blood.

524
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:35,770
So personnel, it comes with
your upbringing, with your DNA.

525
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,060
So keep it, don't, don't forget it,

526
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:44,080
and just incorporate more and
more and it becomes a richer life.

527
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,030
And I, I, when I say blend,
it doesn't mean that you,

528
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,180
that you forget or renounced
to who you are. Not at all.

529
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,083
Thank you.

530
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,880
Hi, my name is Marissa. Uh, and yeah,

531
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,420
thank you so much for your talk. And, um,

532
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,990
several times you brought up
letters like, uh, you know, how you,

533
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,940
you've written to your mom and,
and how you've researched, uh,

534
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,120
people's letters from so
long ago. Um, and, uh,

535
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,000
I worked in Gmail for a while here.
So you know,

536
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,450
a lot of data privacy and things go
to, uh, uh, about people's letters.

537
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:28,560
But my question is about,
you know, now that you have
a foundation, um, and you're,

538
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,710
and you're working with some of these
groups that each person has some stories

539
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:36,270
that, that they are important to,
um, to our history, right? Um,

540
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,790
how can we like empower
those voices? Um, you know,

541
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,440
do you in your foundation tell
these people like, Eh, you know,

542
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,590
even though this is something difficult,
like we have to write some letters,

543
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:50,010
we have to, um, make a way so that
these voices are heard, you know,

544
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:51,870
a hundred years from now,
200 years from now.

545
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:52,451
Well,

546
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:56,650
there is a program in the United States
tell your story in which they record

547
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,540
people. They record
migrants, people who go,

548
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,230
who will come here from all over the
world. And they go into this little cabin,

549
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,880
which they record their,
their story.

550
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,750
And all of those stories are
being kept somewhere and archived.

551
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,930
So now with all the media that
we have with all the inquiry,

552
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,500
if the fact that everybody's taking
selfies on, um, youtube sign,

553
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:23,320
everybody's in social media, this
is a huge way of recording. What,

554
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:27,370
what before would be lost
without the letters. You know,

555
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,090
I think that there are three, four up
photographs of me. When I was a child,

556
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,650
no one was taking pictures to take
a picture. It was a major thing.

557
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,590
Today you take a picture
of a hamburger for God,

558
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,190
everything is recorded.

559
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,140
We have a baby that was born in the family
and the mother every single day since

560
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:50,410
at least two or three
pictures of the baby. I mean,

561
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:52,470
I know the baby's bumped by heart.

562
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,730
That was impossible before. So I think
we, we don't have to worry about that.

563
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,180
Their voices are being
recorded better than ever.

564
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,190
Hi.
So actually I'm,

565
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:09,840
my question is kind of a continuation
and what you were saying is that, um,

566
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,460
you know, when everyone's taking a picture
and everyone's a writing stuff and,

567
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,260
and making movies, uh,
then it all gets lost. So,

568
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:21,660
uh, what it is that you're
a piece of technology,

569
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:25,980
the printing printing press 500 years
ago made literature is such an important

570
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:30,960
part of society and now technology
is making it disappear because uh,

571
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,261
you know,

572
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:36,261
the attention spans are under two minutes
were read more than ever before but

573
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,900
only you know,
half sentences or 140 characters.

574
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,560
What are your take on where
it's going in the future?

575
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,630
You know, I'm fairly optimistic
about the future. Um,

576
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,650
I don't think that technology will,
um,

577
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,240
will destroy culture. I
think it contributes, I need,

578
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:58,060
creates a new form of culture.
Yeah.

579
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,200
I think that very soon we
will start filtering more
the formation we get because

580
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:09,190
we are overwhelmed with,
with trivia and more and more,

581
00:38:09,191 --> 00:38:13,960
our brain gets a little bit overloaded
with things that are not really important.

582
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,880
So we will learn to handle
that. It's a, it's, it's,

583
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,080
we are in the process of change.

584
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,010
Our brains have changed how our
children are born different.

585
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,510
When I see a three year
old working in a computer,

586
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,480
I mean playing games and I
can't even turn it on. It's,

587
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,620
it's interesting how, how humanity
adapts to new forms, you know,

588
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,300
and I'm very optimistic.

589
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,560
I don't think that the stories will be
lost or literature will disappear. We,

590
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:50,080
we all need to hear stories as
part of our acumen, human heritage,

591
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,910
like music.
We needed him.

592
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,650
And you can say it's more accessible now
because of the internet and you can get

593
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,670
ebooks and have them make on
you at anytime of the day.

594
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,420
I traveled with 20 books in
my iPad. That's great. Yeah.

595
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,760
Hi,
I'm Marcus left media,

596
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,780
like a nice to have lots of
questions. But, uh, one day,

597
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,800
I know you were saying that when
you write about a specific person,

598
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:27,250
a real person, um, usually
go and ask him what,

599
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:32,120
what happens with a big
character like, uh, uh, uh, Neto,

600
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,900
the, and about the agenda that you
wrote about. I'm here all day. I know,

601
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:41,010
I know. What I mean is, uh, do you, uh,

602
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,750
do you try to do in Jerusalem under
shoes and try to imagine what would they

603
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,490
think about the way you wrote them?

604
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,490
I have never written about someone that,

605
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:55,470
I mean tap someone like and I do that.
Why that person is still alive.

606
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,940
I'm trying to create a fictional character
out of them. I don't do that. If I,

607
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:04,650
if I'm writing about some awkward really
exists, I stick to the, to the person,

608
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,200
whatever the person has said I would,

609
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:12,230
I would quote that person but not invent
something that that person said because

610
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,650
it would be so easy to,
to prove me wrong.

611
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,100
I like when I,
usually my,

612
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,920
my historical books are from the far past.
It could be 200 years ago,

613
00:40:25,921 --> 00:40:26,754
a hundred years ago.

614
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,440
I have a book about the
conquest of Chile 500 years ago,

615
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:37,370
but if I have someone who now I'm writing
a book in which one of the characters

616
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:38,880
is still alive,

617
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:43,910
he's 103 years old and
he's my friend and when I,

618
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,080
I don't,
I used him for the book as a character,

619
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:54,081
but not with his name and I have used
the information that he has given me.

620
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,910
Ask you gave it to me.

621
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:02,210
I didn't make up anything
about him because he's alive.

622
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:07,050
He'll be dead by the time the book
is published. But still thank you.

623
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,680
Out of respect. I mean, hi.

624
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,910
Um, some of the things I love about
your books is how they transform me to a

625
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:19,900
different time, especially in Latin
America being Latin American. Um,

626
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,980
my question is,

627
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,310
it's been a long time since you left
Chile and a lot has happened politically.

628
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,610
What are the major changes you
see when you get to go back there?

629
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,790
Chili's and other country
from the country I left,

630
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:34,170
but that has happened everywhere
in the world. I mean, um,

631
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,480
I left healer 40 years ago,
more than 40 years ago in 1973.

632
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,240
And um,

633
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:46,450
I left a country that was
under a dictatorship living
half the population living

634
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:49,540
in terror and the other half,
uh,

635
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,210
very happy with what was happening with
the dictatorship because they were in

636
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:57,740
control. And, and uh, 17 years later,

637
00:41:57,741 --> 00:41:59,810
that's how long the dictatorship lasted.

638
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,380
I went back and I found
a country that still had,

639
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,830
was a very cautious society.

640
00:42:06,831 --> 00:42:11,800
People didn't talk much at the time.
Now everything has changed. But the,

641
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:15,950
the, the fabric of the society
has changed in those 17 years.

642
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,450
Plus the world has also evolved.
So Chili's and other place,

643
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:25,810
I go back with this romantic
nostalgic idea of the chiller I left,

644
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:32,591
which was a poor sober country that was
struggling to find its way in the world.

645
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,820
And I find a totally different society
that is a neo capitalist place that sort

646
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:46,580
of doesn't fit my idea of Chile,
but, but it's still chilly.

647
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,990
People are the same.

648
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:55,310
So I did have one last question.
Um, are you writing another book?

649
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:59,450
I am. I just finished it like,
well, I will finish it tomorrow.

650
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,740
I thought I had finished it last week,
but no, I will finish it tomorrow. Um,

651
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,950
because I write in Spanish,

652
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,280
I don't have the possibility to
share the writing with anybody.

653
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,890
And when the book is finished,

654
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:22,000
I don't have anybody to
show it too because my mom
died and she was the one who

655
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:24,920
would read the book and,
and,

656
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:30,390
but I showed it to my brother and then
I showed it to my former editor in Simon

657
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:35,620
and Schuster who speaks Spanish.
But she left Simon and Schuster.

658
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:40,621
So still I showed her the book and so
I'm getting their input and by tomorrow I

659
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:44,200
should have a clean copy of the book.
And the book is,

660
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,160
I won't say historical
because it's very recent,

661
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:53,161
but it starts in 1936 in the
civil war in Spain and it,

662
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,470
it ends many years later. Well,
we're very, really excited.

663
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,690
I'm excited too because
every book is like, you know,

664
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,380
it's like like a bottle,
like,

665
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,840
like a message in a bottle that you
put in the sea and you never know who's

666
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,520
going to happen if someone
is going to pick it up,

667
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:14,800
if it's going to be read by someone.

668
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:19,390
I have written so many
books and still have that,

669
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,690
that feeling of total uncertainty.

670
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:27,120
Does it help that feeling?
Because I feel like if you were,

671
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:31,610
I don't know the other,
I don't know what were the other in gray.

672
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:37,020
I don't know that feeling. I think
we're in the same boat here at Google.

673
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:39,300
We're always aspiring
to be great and perfect,

674
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:43,370
but like we're very excited to read guys
expecting new things every day. Yeah.

675
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:48,540
Which is how I feel about the writing
that every book you have to invent

676
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:54,810
everything again, and I try not to make
the same mistakes that I've made before,

677
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,620
but I make new ones. There's
always new mistakes. Right.

678
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,300
That's always comforting. Yeah. Well,

679
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,590
thank you so much.
He said in the end,

680
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,160
it's been truly an honor speaking
with you and your very soul.

681
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:10,150
Last week we had to here to speak
with everyone. Thank you very much.
