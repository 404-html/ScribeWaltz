1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,880
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,350
My name is Trudy mechanic and it's my
pleasure to welcome you to today's talks

3
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:15,470
at Google event featuring
bestselling author,

4
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:18,960
educator and consultant Rachel Simmons.
Um,

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,440
as the mother of an 11 year old girl.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,640
I've been a big fan of Rachel's for a
few years now and I've found her work in

7
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:29,420
valuable as I've worked to understand
and help my daughter navigate the

8
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:34,280
challenges of growing up today. And let
me tell you there are more than a few. Um,

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,970
I've also been a little bit surprised
to find that Rachel's lessons and

10
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:42,890
teachings have been so relevant
to my own life because shocker,

11
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:47,030
it turns out the challenges that girls
face don't just stop at the end of

12
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:51,560
adolescence. Um, so really happy.
Rachel's here to join us today.

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,970
A bit more about Rachel.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,680
She is the New York Times best selling
author of the books odd girl out and the

15
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:00,860
curse of the good girl.
Her most recent book,

16
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:05,861
which she'll be talking about with us
today is enough as she is how to help

17
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:10,790
girls move beyond impossible
standards of success to live healthy,

18
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,030
happy, and fulfilling lives. Pretty cool.

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,000
Rachel is also an educator.

20
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:21,470
She consults nationally on women's
professional development and is a national

21
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:26,471
spokesperson for the always like a girl
and keds brave life project campaigns.

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,030
She was the host of the PBS television
special a girl's life and her writing has

23
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:36,200
appeared in the Washington Post
Atlantic sleet and the New York Times.

24
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,450
Rachel is a regular contributor to good
morning America and appears often in the

25
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:42,350
national media.

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,790
Odd girl out was adapted into a highly
acclaimed lifetime television movie.

27
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,040
Rachel cofounded,

28
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,510
the national nonprofit girls leadership
and that's actually very important and

29
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:57,350
important as an organization because
what it does is it takes the research and

30
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,520
work that she's done and puts it
into actual practical application.

31
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,200
We're lucky that Simone who cofounded
girls leadership and as the executive

32
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:09,350
director is here with us today and
we'll have the opportunity to learn more

33
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:11,600
about that amazing organization as well.

34
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:15,860
At the end of Rachel's Talk we
will have some time for Q and a.

35
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:19,520
For those of you on live stream,
there is a dory available.

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,360
It is go slash Rachel Simmons Dash Story.

37
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,730
And for those of you
who have books in hand,

38
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:29,030
Rachel has kindly offered to stick around
after the talk at the back of the room

39
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:33,200
to sign them. With that, please
join me in welcoming Rachel Simmons.

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,950
Thanks Trudy. Thank you. Um, hello.

41
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,110
It is a pleasure to be with you today.

42
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:46,490
I want to thank Google and Google talks
and Trudy Mckenna for putting this

43
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:47,760
together.
Um,

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,840
so I want to talk with you
both as potential parents
in the audience but also as

45
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:56,210
individuals because as Trudy said,

46
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,520
there's no question that a lot of what
I write about not only applies to girls

47
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:05,380
but applies to grownups,
applies to boys and men. And um,

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,250
I have had that pointed out to me many,
many times over the last four weeks.

49
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,990
I've been touring this book
all over the country. Um,

50
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,480
today is actually the last day of my
tour, so woo hoo. And, um, and so, yeah.

51
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:18,670
So I really, um, and if I'm honest,

52
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:23,140
so much of what I write about come from
comes from personal challenges that I

53
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,680
myself have been navigating and trying
to make peace with. And so with that,

54
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,670
I encourage you to listen with
lots of different hats. Um,

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,000
today what I'd like to explore with you
in the 30 minutes or so that I have to

56
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,030
talk with you are three
things. One is, uh,

57
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,100
to talk about ways that the culture has
changed for girls since we were teens

58
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,351
too,

59
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:48,520
is I want to be a translator for you of
some of what I would say are the more

60
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,360
toxic messages about success
that girls are getting. Um,

61
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,070
because I think it's very important that
we as advocates for girls, as educators,

62
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:01,390
as teachers, as parents, that we learn how
to talk back to some of those messages,

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,020
um, so that we can shield them
from those messages. And finally,

64
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,140
what are the skills that you both need?
Meaning you,

65
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:10,810
both parent and girl need,
um,

66
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,170
to help her redefine success
in some healthy ways.

67
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,970
So let's start off with a couple of
changes that have occurred since I was

68
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:23,410
younger, although I kind of want to
start with even an earlier change.

69
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,130
Um, and meaning something
that's been around for a long
time and I'm going to ask

70
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,290
the members of the audience
to do a brief exercise.

71
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,620
I promise there won't be
anything else after this.

72
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,900
You can be totally just hanging out,
but if you could sit,

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,760
as you would imagine a typical guy
sits in his chair, like how do you,

74
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,510
okay, so everybody, for those be
livestreaming, everybody's like,

75
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,480
man spreading right now.
Everyone's like spread now.

76
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,390
And then how do you think a
typical girl sits in her chair?

77
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,320
There's no more laughing. Just if you
can't hear the typical girl posture,

78
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,210
everyone is starting to contract.

79
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,880
Everyone's sitting up
street crossing their legs,

80
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:02,160
looking like they're being watched.
And Yeah,

81
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:04,890
you guys were totally manspreading
during the, during the man thing.

82
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,480
And I love that activity because I think
it illustrates what people would call

83
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:10,380
gender norms,

84
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,980
some of the unwritten rules that girls
and guys grow up with about how you're

85
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,130
supposed to act.
And what I also liked about that activity,

86
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:19,080
and it's a great one to
do with your own family,

87
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,880
is it allows us to think not just about
the space that guys might be given to

88
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:24,990
take up with their bodies,

89
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,320
but also with their voices and
their opinions and their appetites.

90
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:33,300
Because when I asked you to sit like a
girl, everyone suddenly gets smaller.

91
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,800
And so there are often also messages
that girls get about the permission they

92
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:41,640
should be taking up or not taking up the
space that they should be taking up or

93
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:46,590
not taking up with their voices and their
opinions. Um, and why does this matter?

94
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:46,831
Well,

95
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:51,831
it matters because in addition to this
pressure that girls get not to take up

96
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,650
too much space, we have also
said two girls, hey, guess what?

97
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:58,790
You can go do and be anything.
So we've said to girls like,

98
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,700
would you like to go now be an engineer?
Fantastic.

99
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:05,210
Would you like to go work at Google and
study cognitive science and you know,

100
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,670
do robotics? Absolutely. Awesome.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,490
What we haven't done is
we haven't said to them,

102
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:13,220
but you don't have to worry
about being liked anymore.

103
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,800
You don't have to worry about
pleasing others anymore.

104
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,800
You don't have to worry about having
that perfect bikini body anymore.

105
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,960
What psychologists call, what girls
are facing right now is role overload,

106
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,330
which basically means too many
roles for one person to play.

107
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,610
Role overload is linked to a lot
of stress. As you can imagine. Um,

108
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,250
you may be surprised or not to learn
that adolescent girls get the least sleep

109
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,900
of any group of youth.

110
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,220
And I honestly think that this is in
part due to the expectation that you not

111
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:47,710
just be smart, but you also better get
one like permitted on Instagram. Um,

112
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,010
God help you if you don't. You also
need to be involved in activities.

113
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,040
You need to be in charge of
the captain of a team. Um,

114
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,140
and that is fatiguing.

115
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,370
It leads to early burnout and it also
creates what researchers call role

116
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,280
conflict. So, in other
words, in a 24 hour a day,

117
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,920
like what it takes to have
the bikini body that you want.

118
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,120
I keep saying bikini body because
if you open up Instagram, um,

119
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,340
and you even this week,

120
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,880
there's a lot of young people on spring
break and I actually follow a lot of

121
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:20,230
them and luckily they usually forget that
I'm following them. So I get to learn.

122
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,740
Um, but there's a ton of bikini
pictures coming out, right?

123
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:27,380
And it's all about look
at me and look at my body.

124
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:30,260
And it's a very specific kind
of body that's being shown off.

125
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,510
And what we're finding actually in the
research is that whereas it used to be

126
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:39,070
that like when I was, you know, a
hundred years ago, a teenager, um,

127
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,240
and I wanted to look at
somebody cute little body,

128
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,510
I would have to go to the grocery store,
I'd have to buy a magazine,

129
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,780
I'd have to look at a celebrity.
What's different for girls?

130
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,400
Is it all you have to
do is open your phone.

131
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,220
And not only are you going to
see the bodies of celebrities,

132
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,160
but you're also going to see,
um,

133
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,580
the bodies of your friends and that can
create and that is creating body shame

134
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,430
that is creating, um, concern and a
loss of confidence in their own body.

135
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,730
So these are some of the things
that are really different. Um,

136
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,100
another thing that I would call as
different as what I like to affectionately

137
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:13,770
call the college application
industrial complex. Um,

138
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,780
and by that I mean the very
intense pressure that girls
face almost from middle

139
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:22,190
school at this point that the,
this sort of message,

140
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:27,110
they get that if they don't craft
themselves into the most perfect specimen

141
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,830
worthy of college admission,
they are going to lead mediocre lives.

142
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:35,810
They really get this pressure that
they have to be absolutely amazing at

143
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:37,980
everything they do. And if they don't, um,

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,150
I dunno like cure major disease and
their science project in middle school,

145
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:43,130
like they're going to
lead very unhappy lives.

146
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,550
And what they feel is that there are
whole worthiness is kind of riding on that

147
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,680
day. Whether or not they get accepted
into the college of their choice.

148
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,340
And I think what it's doing
is it's sending them some
very toxic about success.

149
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,960
Um, one of them is the expectation that
they'd be amazing at everything that they

150
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:05,360
do. What can you say to girls and
frankly to ourselves about this,

151
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,100
this expectation? I mean, first of all,

152
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,780
there's absolutely no way that we can
be amazing at everything we do. No Way.

153
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,480
And in fact, if you expect
yourself always, I mean,

154
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:18,120
at what I do with girls and I sort of say,

155
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,880
if you always expect
yourself to be up here,

156
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,600
you are invariably going to
feel that you are not enough.

157
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,040
You will feel that you are less
then you will feel that you, um,

158
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,460
in the moment as you are or not worthy.

159
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,890
And it is impossible to try to be amazing
at everything you do. And when you try,

160
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,990
in addition to feeling
that self criticism,

161
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,190
the other thing that happens is that you
feel like you can't take any risks. And,

162
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,670
um, you know, as I speak at a place like
Google, I feel like Google is all about,

163
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,050
you know, taking risks, asking
questions, being curious.

164
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,510
And if you feel that you have to play it
safe because you can't mess up because

165
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:01,080
you've got to get that perfect resume,
you've got to have that perfect GPA,

166
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,330
your muscle for risk,
taking,

167
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,580
your ability to comfortably face
uncertainty, that will atrophy.

168
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,450
And I think what we want for our girls,
if you really want to be brave,

169
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:16,620
you have to regularly put
yourself out there in small ways.

170
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:21,110
I never say I, I'm not a big believer
in the um, Eleanor Roosevelt saying, uh,

171
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,360
do something everyday that scares
you because I'm kind of like,

172
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,210
who wants to be scared every day?
Do you guys want to be scared every day?

173
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,620
I'm not down with that personally.
No.

174
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:31,200
I would like to be like a little
nervous every day. I could do that.

175
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:32,940
I could get with that.
Um,

176
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,550
that was my long winded way of saying
that comfort with risk taking happens

177
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,510
through small things that we do all
the time to challenge ourselves.

178
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,910
When girls are trying to be perfect,

179
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,140
they lose comfort with risk taking
and it diminishes their courage.

180
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,450
The other thing that happens is what
I affectionately call the mass mass

181
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:58,230
nationwide adolescent hallucination that
all my friends are doing and being more

182
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:02,670
than I am. I'm, in other words, girls
are often taken with the sense that like,

183
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,740
obviously all my friends
are smarter than me.

184
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,380
All my friends are doing more than me.
Um,

185
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,210
they're cooler than I am and I think it's
super important to talk to girls about

186
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,770
the kind of futility of that attitude
because the reason why you think

187
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:20,550
everyone's doing more than you
is because you don't feel enough.

188
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,970
If you're trying to get up
here all the time, of course,

189
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:26,850
you're looking over your shoulder
being like, who's coming up behind me?

190
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,560
One of the most common questions I've
been asked on the road for this tour has

191
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:33,930
come from girls who come
to my talk and they say,

192
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,890
what am I supposed to do about the fact
that I don't feel happy for my friends

193
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:42,780
when they succeed? What do I do about
the fact that like there's something,

194
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:47,490
there's a competition between me and my
friends where I don't feel like I don't

195
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:51,210
feel good about it and we're not talking
about it and it's eating away at our

196
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,044
relationship.

197
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,770
Now I think this is a warning sign
in terms of when we think about women

198
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:57,790
supporting other women,

199
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,590
if girls are operating from a belief
that even their friends are potentially

200
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,510
threats to their own success,
again,

201
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:06,760
stemming from that sense
that they are not enough,

202
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,240
what does that mean for how women
support each other later on? So, um,

203
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
there are quite a few. Um, I
wouldn't call them side effects,

204
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:18,880
but there are real consequences to what's
happening around the culture in terms

205
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:23,560
of that pressure to be admitted to a
four year college or university. Um,

206
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:27,790
so what are some things you can say
to the girl in your life who might be

207
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,624
struggling?

208
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,640
I have been totally blown away by how
much the following makes a difference to a

209
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:37,570
teenager's wellbeing saying to them,
I don't think this is your fault,

210
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:40,900
what you're going through. In
other words, a lot of teenagers,

211
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:45,690
girls and guys who are overwhelmed
by anxiety and stress, they very, um,

212
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,580
they're very convinced that like,
what's wrong with me?

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,030
That I can't overcome this?
What's wrong with me?

214
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:56,380
That I can't keep up and to say
to a teenager, you know what,

215
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,420
what's wrong has very little to do with
you and much more to do with how broken

216
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:05,770
this culture is around achievement and
success and the pressures that it's

217
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:09,850
putting on you. It's very, it's
transformative for a teenager because,

218
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,310
and I don't want to oversimplify my work,

219
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:15,970
but I do believe that when you can make
a teenager feel like they're not the

220
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:17,740
only one suffering from something.

221
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,750
And I mean I think we all can feel
the benefits of that awareness.

222
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:27,640
But when you can tell her this isn't
just you, it makes a huge difference.

223
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The other thing I think we need to say
is we don't want to tell them why are you

224
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:34,870
guys putting so much
pressure on yourselves?

225
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,100
I know I was told that many years ago
by my parents and I actually wrote an

226
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:42,910
article in the Washington Post about a
month ago about this very thing and in it

227
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,140
I really call on parents to stop telling
their kids that they put too much

228
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:51,370
pressure on themselves. And here's
why. When you say that to a kid,

229
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,330
the implication is if you could just
chill, everything would be fine.

230
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,750
Cause it's just like all you,
that you're,

231
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:59,740
you're just doing this to
yourself when in fact we know,

232
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,890
and hopefully I've convinced you somewhat,
but this is a cultural issue.

233
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:06,790
This is something much bigger than
what one kid is doing to herself.

234
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,270
And it's actually much more helpful
to your kid to hear that everybody's

235
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,470
struggling right now. And you could
have a really peaceful home. Like,

236
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:18,130
let me be clear,

237
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,130
you could have an amazing house that is
like super then and like very spa like,

238
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:26,110
and you really aren't putting pressure
on your kid and I totally believe you

239
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:29,980
that you're not. However, the second
year kid walks out of your house,

240
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,900
she is flooded with that stress. So it's
not about what she's doing to herself.

241
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,140
I want to talk about
imposter syndrome right now.

242
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,630
This is a picture of Maya Angelo and who
is obviously a giant of a human being,

243
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,990
um, and and a writer and
a poet and so many things.

244
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,410
She has been very public about her
struggle with imposter syndrome and she

245
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:54,200
believes and has said that,
you know,

246
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:58,400
she has this abiding fear that at some
point she's going to be found out and

247
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,810
when she's found out,
you know,

248
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,200
everyone's gonna see that she's not
nearly as smart or as talented as everyone

249
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,370
thinks.
Well,

250
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:08,150
one of the great surprises of my research
with girls has been the extent to

251
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:12,470
which imposter syndrome is with
them from a very early age. In fact,

252
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,520
I discovered research that said that
it's firmly in place by adolescence.

253
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,140
And I asked my students,

254
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:21,890
I work on a college campus and I asked
my students all the time to finish the

255
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:22,730
sentence.
Uh,

256
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,590
I say sometimes I worry that I'm not
as blank as other people think I am.

257
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,210
Um, and I've also started doing the same
with adults. The most common response,

258
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:36,020
the most common fill in the blank is
I worry that I'm not as smart as other

259
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:40,550
people think I am. So what do we
say to our kids and to ourselves?

260
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:44,600
Because my goodness, I also struggle
with imposter syndrome for sure. Um,

261
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,710
and um, and relatively frequently
I was going to joke between meals,

262
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:52,040
but not that frequently,
but a lot. Um, you know,

263
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:56,600
when that voice comes up inside of us,
when we hear that voice that says,

264
00:15:56,601 --> 00:16:01,430
you don't deserve to be here, you don't
belong here, you don't have what it takes.

265
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,460
We have to talk back to it.
And we do this in two ways.

266
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,560
One is we realize that this
voice is a voice inside of us,

267
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:13,430
but it's not the voice that
is us, right? It's not you.

268
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,660
It's the small scared part of
you that kind of rears its head.

269
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,990
But it does not mean that it is used.

270
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:23,680
So we really need to teach not
only our kids but ourselves,

271
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,470
that that's a recurring part of us,
but we don't over identify with it.

272
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,800
And the second thing you do is you
name it. And I've actually had,

273
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:33,590
I had one student who named
her imposter voice Leicester,

274
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,880
which I thought was hilarious. And so
she'd be like, Yo, less drag off this.

275
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:40,490
You step off. Okay,
like Lester, I hear you.

276
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:43,700
I hear you telling me that I'm not smart
enough to be in this AP class or I'm

277
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:47,690
not. Whatever it is, enough
chill, dude. Just have a seat.

278
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,380
And so when you talk back
to and you name that voice,

279
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,500
it actually gives you an ability
to separate yourself from it. Um,

280
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,730
gratitude is a very powerful
practice that research tells us,

281
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:05,390
does everything from help us
sleep better at night, um,

282
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,840
boost our immune systems.
And elevator wellness.

283
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,940
And basically what this sounds like is
a kind of simple acknowledgement which

284
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:17,780
you can do any time of what it is
you are grateful for right now.

285
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,530
It does not have to be epic or
polished or important beyond.

286
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,290
I'm happy the sun came out
like I, you know what I'm
grateful for today. Honestly,

287
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,800
I was staying in Mill Valley last night
because I spoke there for my book.

288
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,440
I woke up,
I didn't have time to go to the gym,

289
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:36,830
which was five minutes away and there
was a terrible storm here last night.

290
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,510
And um, and somehow it stopped
raining and I got to go run outside.

291
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,520
And a few minutes after I came back in,

292
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,190
it started pouring and I
just took a moment and said,

293
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,310
I'm so grateful that I got to get
my heart rate up. That's enough.

294
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,730
That's enough when we
can in small moments,

295
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:57,270
say this thing that happened,
that's enough for me.

296
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,200
It allows us to be on the
ground instead of going up here.

297
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,890
It allows us to affirm
what matters right now,

298
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,450
but we also have to be willing to buy
into the fact that the small things count.

299
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,540
And I think a gradual practice,

300
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:16,290
and I want to say practice cause it's
just like that muscle that we have to flex

301
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,950
for risk taking is just like the do
something that makes me nervous every day.

302
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,890
We're not talking about
becoming like a zen monk.

303
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,330
We're talking about you're driving to
work. Uh, what are you grateful for?

304
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,070
Just stop and think about it. And this
can open up something inside of you,

305
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,960
a place of appreciation that can make
you feel enough in this very moment right

306
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:41,490
now. And I, it's been very powerful
for me and my young daughter as well.

307
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,280
Well I hope it's so powerful for her.
I might just be hallucinating,

308
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:47,580
but I think it's, I'm
hoping that it is. Um,

309
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,080
there are a couple of things that I want
to cover in this talk beyond some of

310
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:56,790
the smaller pieces of advice that I've
given you that are in the research, um,

311
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,870
considered very palliative
factors in adolescent wellness.

312
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,500
One of them is purpose. So
what's purpose, purpose,

313
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:09,501
having a sense of purpose in your life
means that you do something that you're

314
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:13,320
into. You really like doing
this, pursuing this goal,

315
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,760
but this particular goal or this thing
that you're involved in connects you to

316
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:22,200
something bigger than you. All right?
It's not like a self oriented goal.

317
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,430
So let's just think of
something purposeful. Um,

318
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,590
something that makes an impact
on the world in some way.

319
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,430
I mean it could be volunteering,
it could also be creating an APP.

320
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,280
It doesn't mean that it has
to be public service oriented.

321
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,430
I was on a public radio show
in the bay area yesterday,

322
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:42,480
a call or phoned in and talked about
how his daughter who had been riven with

323
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,680
anxiety discovered juggling.
And once she discovered juggling,

324
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:51,681
she began traveling and juggling for
underserved children and that this healed

325
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:56,400
her. And that's a sense of purpose. She
was part of something bigger than herself.

326
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,850
Contrast that with the kid who says,

327
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,100
my goal is to get good grades.

328
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,400
My goal is to be accepted
into a brand name college.

329
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,460
My goal is to score
perfect score on the sat.

330
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,970
People who are driven by self
oriented goals tend to be less happy.

331
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,240
They also tend to be less resilient.
Um,

332
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,280
I'll tell you who else actually just to,
I want to deviate from this purpose or,

333
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,960
or digress from this purpose conversation
for just a moment to say that there's

334
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,361
another,

335
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:30,240
there are two other differences that I
want to talk with you about in terms of

336
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,890
types of goals you pursue.

337
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:37,050
So Carol Dweck who is a psychologist
based at Stanford University who studies

338
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:42,051
motivation talks about the difference
between pursuing a performance goal and a

339
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,890
learning goal.
Now,

340
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:48,310
a performance goal is when you undertake
something at the approval that you

341
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:52,030
might get from others or because
you wish to avoid failure.

342
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,860
A learning goal,

343
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,160
which spoiler alert is what we want
girls to have and what we should all be

344
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:59,090
trying to pursue.
Um,

345
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,610
more than anything is when you undertake
a goal because you're trying to master

346
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:04,091
something,

347
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:09,010
you want to undertake this thing because
you really want to learn about it.

348
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:13,000
So for example, I want to master the
French, uh, the past tense in French.

349
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,380
That's a learning goal. I want to get
an a in French is a performance goal.

350
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,620
Now there's nothing wrong with
performance goals on their face,

351
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:25,330
like it's totally fine to want to be,
I'm just strive for attention and reward,

352
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,970
but that can't be the primary
thing that drives you.

353
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,320
Definitely not because for those
people who are driven per primarily by

354
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:37,120
performance goals, they are also less
resilient. They are also more unhappy.

355
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,170
Now, why are you, why are you less tough?
If you're driven by a performance goal,

356
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,670
we'll think about it. If what is
driving you isn't coming from within,

357
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,940
isn't inspired by a kind of genuine desire
that comes intrinsically from within

358
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,330
you,

359
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,350
it's so much easier to knock you over
so you have a setback and because you're

360
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:58,300
more invested in what other people think,

361
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,690
it's so much easier to get knocked over
because you don't have the grounding in

362
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:06,610
your own desire and in
your own motivation.

363
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,500
So what that means for you as parents
or for yourself as you pursue your own

364
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:12,610
goals is to say,
Hey,

365
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:16,990
am I doing this because I want to
or because I feel like I have to?

366
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,670
Are you taking that class?
You could say to your kid because you,

367
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:22,180
you really want to learn this thing.

368
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,810
Are you doing it because you
think it looks good? And again,

369
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,580
nothing wrong with wanting to look good,

370
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:31,360
but that can't be the primary
reason why purposeful.

371
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,860
A purposeful life is on the decline.
In terms of goals of adolescents.

372
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,650
Adolescents are increasingly saying, I
want to make money. I want to, you know,

373
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,770
get a great job.
I wanted to go to a good college.

374
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,690
The percentage of students who say,

375
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:47,050
I want to lead a meaningful life
has experienced a steep decline.

376
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,500
And researchers believe this is absolutely
related to the decline in wellness in

377
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:57,631
teenagers when you are with your
daughter and if your daughter or you,

378
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,960
um, honestly, because I'm,

379
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,410
what I'm about to say absolutely comes
to my own mind as I stand in the face of

380
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:06,220
a risk.

381
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,490
But if you want to get your kid to do
something that's challenging to her,

382
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,820
if you yourself want to take a leap,

383
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,340
there are three questions
that work really well.

384
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,130
One is what do you think the
worst that could happen is?

385
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,780
And I want to clarify here,

386
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,740
girls are particularly good at telling
you the absolute worst thing that could

387
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:25,510
happen on a catastrophic level.

388
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,730
And so I want to just sort of amend this
by saying like actual worst that could

389
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:34,330
happen. Not like catastrophe worst
that can happen. Um, you know,

390
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:38,320
because girls are such
good catastrophizers and
then can you live with it?

391
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,180
So for example,
um,

392
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,930
and I say this too because I know a lot
of girls who don't want to take risks,

393
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:47,060
they don't want to raise their hands
unless they have the right answer.

394
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,910
They don't want to try out for the play
because they're afraid they will get

395
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,560
apart.

396
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,680
They have like application fee or I don't
want to apply for that job because I'm

397
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:58,640
afraid I won't get it or that
internship or that fellowship. Um,

398
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,481
and so we say to them,

399
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,330
what is the worst that can happen
and can you live with that?

400
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,780
It's very rare that I have a student
who says, no, I can't live with that.

401
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,710
Most people once they really are
willing to look the consequence,

402
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:13,700
not the catastrophe consequence, the legit
one in the eye. They were like, yeah,

403
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:14,534
I could live with that.

404
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,460
Another question that has been profoundly
helpful for me personally is as you

405
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,770
stand in the face of a challenge,
a risk,

406
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,160
you're going to put yourself out there
in some way. You say to yourself,

407
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,340
what is the minimum benefit that
I could get from this thing?

408
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,960
Like what's the least good thing that
could come out of this experience and I

409
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,330
feel extremely strongly
about what I'm about to say.

410
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,540
If you want yourself or if you want
your daughter to resist perfectionism,

411
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,740
we have to help them appreciate
the beauty of the process.

412
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,160
We have to help them appreciate that
there are always unanticipated benefits,

413
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,670
lessons,

414
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,710
moments of inspiration and wisdom
that come when we least expect it.

415
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,860
That come when the big moment of glory
doesn't arrive so that even if you don't

416
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:06,800
get into that play or you get a
crappy chorus part and like, wow,

417
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:08,180
that's a bummer and I'm sorry.

418
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,710
There are other benefits that come from
this experience. You make new friends,

419
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,150
you learn a new skill,
you learn that you can stick stuff out.

420
00:25:17,151 --> 00:25:19,190
That's not what you
thought it was going to be.

421
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:22,370
I think that when we all
imagine like what are like,

422
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:26,600
if you think to yourself what
in the face of an obstacle,

423
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:29,870
have I learned what from a
heartbreak have I gained?

424
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,630
We ask ourselves this question as adults,

425
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,830
the same kind of a wisdom
will accrue to our children.

426
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,570
We have to have faith that it will.

427
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,290
I think as parents you don't
want them to be suffering, right?

428
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:47,291
We don't want our children to be in
anguish in any way and yet the same wisdom

429
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:52,301
and strength and courage that we have
gained from our own obstacles will also

430
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:57,551
come in due time to our children and we
have to have patients with that create

431
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:02,900
space for that because ultimately if
all we are driven by is the big polished

432
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:06,860
finish is the outcome is the
college essay worthy moment.

433
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,440
Then of course our children
will be addicted to perfection.

434
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,990
I want to talk to more things.

435
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:16,280
I want to say before I hand it over to
Samone marine from girls leadership.

436
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,360
Um,

437
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,800
parents need to practice
what psychologists call self
regulation just as much as

438
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:24,980
our kids do, right? Just as much as we
expect our kids to keep it together.

439
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,550
We also as parents have to do that.
Um,

440
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,250
and that's because it's really hard to
watch our teenagers go through the ups

441
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:35,780
and downs, the chaos of this time. So
here are three things you can do. One,

442
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,700
remember she is still watching you.

443
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,470
I say this because teenagers
are exceptionally good at
acting like they do not

444
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:46,730
care at best what you say and think
you're clueless and stupid at worst. Um,

445
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,910
and it's very important to remember that
even if you think your child doesn't

446
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:51,990
want to connect with you anymore,

447
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,860
it's not that it's the way she wants to
connect with you as deeply unsatisfying,

448
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,300
often,
often as the case.

449
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,390
I'm just going to be assuming
that everyone here is
laughing on the inside about

450
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:04,710
that one. Um, but anyway,
um, I still think it's funny,
so thank you for laughing.

451
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,830
Anyway, my point is that, um, your kid,

452
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:10,680
your teenagers absolutely still
connected to you. They are still,

453
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,210
they still want to know what you think
and the way that you react as a parent in

454
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:18,810
the face of a problem. Um, they
are absolutely downloading that.

455
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:22,560
They are mimicking it too in the sense
that just like they used to mimic the

456
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,480
words you say when,
when they were little,

457
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,690
they're now starting to mimic
how do you respond to distress?

458
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,710
How do you respond when things don't
go your way? They are watching us. Um,

459
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,400
and we do have to be careful with
how much anxiety we bring into our

460
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:39,180
conversations with them. Number
two, share your mistakes.

461
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,130
Do not imagine that being a good role
model to your kid is about acting like

462
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:46,470
you've never do anything
wrong when you do that.

463
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:48,540
When you don't tell them
about your setbacks,

464
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,840
they think that it's not okay for them
to experience them themselves and worse

465
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,650
or maybe related. They become afraid
to tell you about their own mistakes.

466
00:27:59,280 --> 00:27:59,970
Number three,

467
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,900
ask yourself this question and this is a
shout out to Sheryl Sandberg's question

468
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:07,470
and lean in when she posed the question,
what would you do if you weren't afraid?

469
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,730
When you stand in the face of
deep anxiety around your child,

470
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,170
when you look at something
that's not going well and
you say this thing happened,

471
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,760
what if this means blank? Because I think
parents can also catastrophize, right?

472
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:23,100
We can also say something went wrong here.

473
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,700
What if this means globally that
she's not going to make friends?

474
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,590
What if this means she's not that smart?

475
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,280
What if this means she doesn't
go to a good college? As parents,

476
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:33,360
we have to check ourselves.

477
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:37,800
We've got to walk that back down away
from the global anxiety down to what's

478
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:41,490
really happening and one of the best
ways to do that is to ask yourself,

479
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,360
all right, if I knew that everything
was going to be okay, right?

480
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:49,260
If I knew that would ever is freaking me
out right now about my kid was going to

481
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:53,700
be fine, if I could practice faith
and optimism, if I were not afraid,

482
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,190
how would you parent?
If you are not afraid,

483
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,400
the choices that we make in that moment
when we're not afraid are so much wiser.

484
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,410
They are choices were much
more likely to be proud of.

485
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,360
Then when we make choices from a place
of fear and what if and what does this

486
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:10,950
mean an anxiety.

487
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,320
The last thing I want to introduce
you to is self compassion.

488
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,110
Self compassion is a second,
um,

489
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,620
strongly research-based
palliative factor for adolescents.

490
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,510
It is the practice of being gentle with
yourself in the face of a challenge. Now,

491
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,010
many people think that gentleness with
yourself in the face of a challenge is

492
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:34,590
not only a way of being
lazy about your problems,

493
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,400
but also could result in complete
paralysis because who would possibly be

494
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,320
motivated if they weren't being
mean to themselves? This is,

495
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,010
these are all common responses to self
compassion responses I should say.

496
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:49,150
Like I had myself for sure when
I first encountered it. In fact,

497
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,800
what self compassion is about is not
pretending that something didn't happen or

498
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:57,880
taking responsibility. It's basically
about saying, yeah, something happened.

499
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,920
I don't feel good about it,
but I'm not going to trade away myself.

500
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,700
Worth in the process of
dealing with it include,

501
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,230
I also want to add that that research
shows that self compassion does not

502
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:11,080
diminish motivation and it doesn't
diminish performance standards.

503
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,540
So here's what it is. Here's
what, here's how it works.

504
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,550
There are three steps that
were developed by, um,

505
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,790
University of Texas at Austin Professor
Kristin Neff who has a book of the same

506
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:26,560
name, self compassion, a wonderful
website of course a tedtalk. And um,

507
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,250
the three steps work this way and I'm
going to teach them by telling the Google

508
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:34,420
world about something that happened to
me and how I learned to practice self

509
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:37,960
compassion. So, um, the first
step is mindfulness. Now,

510
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,961
several years ago I was really royally
and radically dumped and I went into a

511
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,400
total tailspin about what this
meant about me. So I, I'm,

512
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,100
I'm also an excellent
catastrophizer recovering now.

513
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,930
And so I went into this place of obviously
like I'm a broken human being who's

514
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,540
going to die alone with dogs,
not cats because I'm allergic to cats,

515
00:30:58,541 --> 00:30:59,920
but I think you got my reference.

516
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,610
And like clearly nothing good will
ever happen to me again in my life.

517
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,240
So that's not mindful, right?
Mindful is not catastrophizing.

518
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,150
Mindfulness means all right,
something bad happened.

519
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,500
What do I really feel right now?
Like what? What is my actual emotion?

520
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,640
Not The denial or the
catastrophe. I feel sad, right?

521
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:22,630
Like I'm grieving and the next,
well this week,

522
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,330
I mean probably the next year is
going to be really hard for me.

523
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,170
The second step of self
compassion is self kindness.

524
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,730
This is hard for a lot of people.

525
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:35,230
Deceptively simple and this basically
means like if you had a really close

526
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:36,310
friend who you loved,

527
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,000
who is being mean to themselves and the
way that you were being mean to you,

528
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,560
what would you say to your friend?

529
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,760
Because the reality is aren't we
so much nicer to other people?

530
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:48,670
We show other people so much more
grace than we show ourselves.

531
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,970
So this is a thing.
I also do this by the way,

532
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:55,420
by channeling one of my best friends who
I call my unicorn friend because she's

533
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:58,090
like so much nicer. It's sometimes
I think than I am. I'm like,

534
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:00,190
why are you friends with me?
Because you're so nice. And like,

535
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,040
do you ever have a friend like that?
I call her my unicorn friend.

536
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,500
Trudy actually knows her.
And um,

537
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,880
and I imagine what my friend Daniella
would say to me cause she's so nice and I

538
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:14,110
think what would Danielle is say, I got
to say that to myself. And then the, um,

539
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,050
the third step of self compassion,

540
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,820
another really powerful step is common
humanity. And what that means is,

541
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,600
are there other people who might
be suffering the way I'm suffering?

542
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:28,030
Like am I the only one
who's ever been dumped?

543
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,260
Thank you Google for telling me that
heartbreak advice gets 1.5 million hits.

544
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,070
Google was instrumental in helping
me understand that I was not alone.

545
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:39,560
So thank you Google. Seriously,
I promise you I did this.

546
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,960
And when you know you're not alone,

547
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,690
it is so helpful the,

548
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,700
the feeling of aloneness and isolation
that so many of us have exacerbates shame.

549
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,100
It makes us not want to solve a problem.
And so reminding ourselves,

550
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,590
we do have a shared
experience of suffering.

551
00:32:57,591 --> 00:33:00,950
We are not by ourselves
is absolutely powerful.

552
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,090
So following these three steps,
I strongly encourage you to practice this.

553
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:07,760
You can do it in the middle of the night.
If you ever wake up,

554
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:10,550
you had an extra glass of red wine,
you woke up at two in the morning.

555
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:15,020
I'm not saying I've experienced
that personally, of course
I have. And um, yeah,

556
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:17,000
and you walk yourself
through these three steps.

557
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,490
You Walk Yourself and you practice
just like you practice risk taking,

558
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,310
just like you practice gratitude.

559
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:28,390
The bottom line is that we all have to
be able to access why we are enough as we

560
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:32,780
are. And one of the best ways
to do that is to ask yourself,

561
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:38,530
what about me is valuable and of worth
beyond my external standards of success

562
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:42,140
beyond my salary,
beyond my position,

563
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:46,820
beyond the accomplishments that I may
want to share or that I think define me?

564
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,600
What beyond those standards
makes me enough as I am.

565
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,350
And when you know that you can be stronger
than you've ever thought possible.

566
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,490
Thank you very much.

567
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,613
Thank you.

568
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,200
So I'd like to turn over the mic to
Simone Marine and my dear friend,

569
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:06,750
my colleague,
um,

570
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,790
who is fiercely committed to
making sure that every girl,

571
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,120
no matter what her income
level or background,

572
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:17,660
has the power and the skills to
exercise the power of her voice.

573
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:19,170
So I want to introduce everyone to Simone,

574
00:34:19,171 --> 00:34:22,770
the CEO and cofounder of girls
leadership. Thank you, Rachel.

575
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,110
Okay.

576
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,850
I mission at girls' leadership is to equip
girls with the skills to exercise the

577
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:30,200
power of their voice.

578
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,640
And we see this as the
foundational skill of leadership,

579
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,950
no matter what a girl wants to pursue,

580
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:42,130
whether it is coding or business or arts
or government and all the places where

581
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:46,870
we want our girls to have leadership.
And I would like to say, um,

582
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,220
before telling you
briefly about who we are,

583
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:54,221
that I am so grateful to be back at
Google and grateful for the support of a

584
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,370
Googler, his contributions and,
uh, the matching program here,

585
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:00,760
which has made such a powerful difference.
Um,

586
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,690
and our work every year
at girls' leadership,

587
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:06,830
particularly in our ability to serve girls
in schools, in low income communities.

588
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:09,140
So thank you for that support.
Um,

589
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,190
what makes girls leadership unique
and the girl serving spaces?

590
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,580
Really three things.

591
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:19,030
One is that we are the only organization
to partner with the adults' and girls'

592
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:19,904
lives.

593
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:24,970
What we have found is that when we teach
a girl the skills to exercise the power

594
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:25,701
of her voice,

595
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:29,810
but she goes back to a school or to a
family that doesn't support that and

596
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:33,680
doesn't understand her voice,
that what we teach can be undone.

597
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,160
But if we work with the girl, not only
the girl, but also her, her teacher,

598
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:39,540
the caregiver,
the anti,

599
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,780
the Nana in her life who's giving
her scripts every day and giving her

600
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:47,310
permission, that's true.
Sustainable change. Um,

601
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,820
so of the 10,000 people that
we teach in person every year,

602
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:54,600
over 5,000 of those are the
adults and girls lives. Um,

603
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,290
the second thing that makes us unique
is that we are really grounded and

604
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,490
emotional intelligence,

605
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,670
which I think is so much of the work
that Rachel has been talking about.

606
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:06,960
This social emotional learning, these
invisible skills and processing. Um,

607
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,380
that is as is the vital foundation of
the external skills that we want them to

608
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:16,410
demonstrate, uh, in academics
or in the workplace.

609
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,800
And so our belief is that if a girl knows
what she thinks and feels and needs,

610
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,970
if she respects it,

611
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,750
that's the hard part that many of us
lose over the course of adolescence.

612
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:32,550
And she has the ability to express
it affectively. Those three things,

613
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,800
we'll provide that foundation for her.

614
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,490
The last piece that really makes us
powerful is that we see girls everyday

615
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,620
relationships as her
incubator for leadership. The,

616
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,100
so rather than saying to the girls,
if you are chosen as captain of the team,

617
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,540
if you are present to the class,

618
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:52,470
then you are a leader and
you have influenced where
are instead saying to girls,

619
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,840
uh,
leadership is a way of life.

620
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,850
You get to decide and the countless
decisions that you make every day, uh,

621
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,720
whether you're going to have influence
when you decide whether you, how you look,

622
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,554
somebody in the eye,

623
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,600
do you raise your hand in class
when you don't know the answer?

624
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,610
Do you raise your hand in class?
When you do know the answer,

625
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,120
where do you sit at lunch? Um, high
school or recently reminded me,

626
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:15,370
do you eat lunch? Uh,
was a leadership, uh,

627
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,200
question that she had to face everyday.
Where do you sit at lunch?

628
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,750
All of these countless
decisions are opportunities
that girls have to build this

629
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:28,100
self awareness and agency and
ability to make change. Um,

630
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:32,400
so those three things,
emotional intelligence is the foundation.

631
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,690
Adults are our partners and everyday
relationships are the incubator or what

632
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:40,080
makes girls leadership who we are.
Uh,

633
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,010
and right now we're focused
on to strategic initiatives.

634
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,650
One is that we are looking deeply at the
experience of girls and women of color

635
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,310
and really trying to
understand how does race,

636
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:57,450
ethnicity and income level
impact gender expectations.

637
00:37:57,451 --> 00:38:00,300
Because what we're finding is
there's very different, uh,

638
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,420
experiences that girls
have in different cultures.

639
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,150
And if we can gather the
data on that difference,

640
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:11,360
then we'll be able to reach the 25 million
girls in the US where they are across

641
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,340
those infinite differences that exist.

642
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,050
So that's the first
thing that we're doing.

643
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:21,051
And then we're also very much focused
on a educator training as the vehicle to

644
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:24,410
scaling our curriculum.
That uh,

645
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,330
reaching each girl one
by one is a slow process.

646
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,750
But if we can reach the educators,
the administrators, the principals,

647
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:35,751
the people that have power over
hundreds if not of girls lives,

648
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,490
that's um,

649
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,740
how we can really move the dial quickly
in the u s and so the last thing I would

650
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:45,730
like to say is we have a
couple Googlers on our board,

651
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,150
but if anyone would like to be
involved and participate in this work,

652
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,480
we are very grateful for the partnership
and the support of many is like

653
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,910
treating Mckenna has been here
over the years for myself. Um,

654
00:38:57,911 --> 00:39:00,850
so please reach out to me if you're
interested in being involved. Thank you.

655
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,503
Great.

656
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,560
Thank you. Okay, let's go to Q and.
A. If you have a question in the room,

657
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:12,160
go ahead and head to the mic and we will
be watching the dory for anybody who

658
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:16,510
has questions. Again, it's a go slash
Rachel Simmons Dash Story and Oh great.

659
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:19,450
We have a question in the room.
Let's start with that. Thank you.

660
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,340
Thank you very much. And
small. Uh, my question might
be the, I'm either, I'll be,

661
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:27,190
you can ask are probably,
um, my question is about,

662
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,890
so I observe this tendency among,

663
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,940
so I have a radio world calling myself
and I was there with this tendency for

664
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:37,260
her to very quickly identify her BFF,

665
00:39:37,261 --> 00:39:41,230
our school and sort of a constraint,

666
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:44,650
her relationship with this just small
number of friends. So even have to,

667
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:49,000
she is sitting next to a
mother, a daughter. You're a
god that she just met today.

668
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,520
If he was a boy then I think they,

669
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:55,270
there's more tendency for them to kind
of play a wrong as long as this kid is

670
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,770
well behaving. But, um, my
goal wouldn't talk. So I,

671
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,040
I'm not sure if this is good or bad.

672
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,020
Like Carolyn more about
relationship is good,

673
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:09,100
but I'm not expanding it is bad.

674
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:12,460
So I'm not sure how they sort
of come out in our future.

675
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,660
So I wanted to get your thoughts.
I think this is a [inaudible] question.

676
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:22,910
Yes, I would you want to come up here
and um, we'll do a little duet on that.

677
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,040
Songs. I don't have to sing. They
sing islands in the stream now. Yeah.

678
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,420
I mean there's an incredible pressure
on girls to find that BFF and not,

679
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:35,750
and to find her on the first day of
kindergarten and it's an eye contact and

680
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:40,190
there's rainbows and glitter. Right?
My little ponies. Yes. Jump around. Um,

681
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,710
and,
and I think we do need,

682
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,740
and the cost of that is like the BFF
rules are basically you like all the same

683
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:53,000
things. You do everything together and you
never fight. Right? Any of us as adults,

684
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:56,720
if we can imagine a 24 hour relationship
where we like all the same things,

685
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,410
we do everything together
and we never fight, right?

686
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,870
This myth is the biggest setup of all
time because of course all those things

687
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:03,704
are gonna happen.

688
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:08,150
So I think it is important
that we dismantled that
myth for girls and we really

689
00:41:08,151 --> 00:41:13,010
teach them what healthy relationships
look like and that how to navigate

690
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,150
disagreements and how to make people
feel included. And it, it is, I have my,

691
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:21,760
I have a six year old son and it's
still every day teach, you know,

692
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,420
giving him scripts.
And,

693
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,540
and teaching him about the impact
of his relationship choices.

694
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:29,480
And so when he doesn't talk to
that person next to him, right,

695
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:32,990
how does that make them feel? And what
is, you know, and I call it leadership,

696
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,190
like when you're,

697
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,360
when you have influenced them,

698
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:37,280
when you reach out to somebody
and when you're inclusive,

699
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,850
what's that change that you're making
in the world and that they can take on

700
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:44,030
that bigger label and that
bigger meaning of their actions.

701
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:48,350
So it is important to look at that
myth and that gender expectation,

702
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,101
dismantle it,

703
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:52,550
and help her build the full set of skills
to connect with people across a range

704
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:56,060
of differences. Couldn't have said it
better myself. So I hope that was helpful.

705
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,510
Yeah. And we do have several
questions on the dory. So,

706
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,191
all right,

707
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:07,670
so our top question right now on the
door is from Hillary and she asks,

708
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:10,880
how can parents lay the groundwork
for these skills and younger children?

709
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,550
I'm so happy you asked
that Hilary, because, uh,

710
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:17,540
I'm also the parent of a younger child
and you may know the common phrase,

711
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:20,000
little kids, little problems,
big kids, big problems.

712
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:24,020
And so by that I take from that
that little kids are somewhat more

713
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,330
impressionable on, easier, a
little bit easier to work with.

714
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:29,490
So what are some things you
can do with a young child? Um,

715
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,370
one you can make the practice of
gratitude part of every breakfast.

716
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,320
So every day at breakfast,

717
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:40,840
what is one thing you're grateful for
and you say it and they say it. Um,

718
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,361
again,

719
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:45,290
one of the benefits of doing this with
younger children is that as they proceed

720
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:48,230
into the eye rolling years,
they at least have this laid,

721
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,450
this groundwork that's been laid, um,
which helps keep them much more connected.

722
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,800
You have a much better
chance of hanging on. Um,

723
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:00,810
another thing you can do is talk
with them about the way they talk to

724
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,290
themselves.
So if you,

725
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:07,670
if you're physically comfortable going
to a place where you could maybe jump

726
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,340
over something with your child,
like for example like bouldering,

727
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:14,660
climbing on rocks or walking by a creek
and stepping on the rocks in the creek

728
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,360
and you since your daughter
anxious about something,

729
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,950
and I'm using the creek is an example,

730
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:21,770
but there are all kinds of things we
might do with our child where she feels

731
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:24,290
afraid when she's young.
You say to her,

732
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,000
it's a good thing to talk to yourself
in a positive way to say, I can do this,

733
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,330
I can do this. Teach her what
internal self talk sounds like.

734
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,410
This is certainly something my daughter
has has absolutely internalized and who

735
00:43:36,411 --> 00:43:39,480
is almost six years old and
who does this frequently. Um,

736
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:43,790
another great thing to do is when your
daughter is working on something that's

737
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:47,480
challenging for her and you can feel
her starting to either get frustrated or

738
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:51,080
want to walk away from it. You go up and
you give her tons of praise and you say,

739
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,310
look how far you've gotten at this.
Look how much you've done already.

740
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,460
And that's known as
process praise process.

741
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:03,461
Praise is about making sure kids feel
really good about being in the middle of a

742
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:04,760
challenging process,

743
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:08,720
making sure they feel praised for
sticking with it and being a part of it as

744
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:13,700
opposed to waiting until they finished
and cross the finish line as it were,

745
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,700
to give them the praise.
We know from research that,

746
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:19,640
and I find this amazing that they've
been able to figure this out.

747
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:22,070
We'll come to coming
out of Stanford that um,

748
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,580
even in toddlerhood boys get
more processed praise than girls,

749
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,810
which is unbelievable to me. And
if you hear process praise, if you,

750
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,540
if you are praised for like,
another way to ask this is, um,

751
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,910
let's say your kid is working
on something and you say,

752
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:38,850
tell me about the strategy that you used.
And by the way,

753
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:42,840
teach them the word strategy because
strategy implies there's always more than

754
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:45,420
one solution. There's lots of
different ways to do something.

755
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:47,450
So what kind of strategy did you use to,

756
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,900
to figure that out and they can get
excited about what they've done so far.

757
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:56,010
So all of this helps make kids braver
because it means they don't have to

758
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:57,720
perform at the highest level.

759
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:01,860
It means they know you care when they're
in it and in the process and trying.

760
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:04,630
So those are all things that you can do.
There's,

761
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,870
there's so much to do with younger girls.

762
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,320
So first I want to say I'm currently
reading enough as she is and one of the

763
00:45:14,321 --> 00:45:18,340
struggles I'm having is reading
it as both being an ass out,

764
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,360
like still being,

765
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:23,530
growing up and kind of trying to view it
from maybe how my mother felt about me

766
00:45:23,531 --> 00:45:24,720
growing up.
Um,

767
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,020
and something that my mother and I've
been talking about and trying to work out

768
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:32,140
for a long time is the fact
that it doesn't so much.

769
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,100
It didn't so much matter to me what
she said in matter to me, what she did.

770
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:39,940
And I would just near her behaviors,
even if she was telling me the opposite.

771
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,230
And as somebody who struggles
with things in my own life,

772
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:48,480
I wonder if you have any advice on
if you know you have a problem and,

773
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,840
and you participate in a behavior that
would be very damaging to mimic and yet

774
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:57,010
you're still struggling yourself to not
do it. How do you communicate this with,

775
00:45:57,011 --> 00:46:00,920
uh, with somebody who might be
watching you as a role model? Um,

776
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,320
that's a great question.

777
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:06,370
So meaning you have awareness of the
behavior that someone is mimicking. Well,

778
00:46:06,371 --> 00:46:10,250
of course the pat answer is do
as I say, but not as I do. Um,

779
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,070
but I think you're pointing to
something deeper, which is, um,

780
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,450
and something that's been
studied actually, it's just
beginning to be studied,

781
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:19,930
which is the way that young people can
tell the difference between what their

782
00:46:19,931 --> 00:46:24,040
parents values are and what their
parents actually say. So in other words,

783
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:28,000
teens have a great bs detector. They
know that their parent might say, Oh,

784
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:29,440
I really want you to be happy.

785
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,920
And they at the same time
know their parent is very
committed to them getting to

786
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:36,640
it into the best possible college
which may actually contraindicate their

787
00:46:36,641 --> 00:46:39,340
happiness. And so, um,
so I think that you're,

788
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,950
you're really highlighting something
that's quite, quite new in the,

789
00:46:41,951 --> 00:46:42,784
in the research.

790
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,260
But of course your question is about how
do you relate to somebody when you know

791
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:51,310
that you're mimicking, that
you're modeling something,
um, that's not healthy.

792
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:53,910
And I guess I think the kind of,
um,

793
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,550
I know Bernay Brown was here at Google
yesterday. I think vulnerability,

794
00:46:57,551 --> 00:47:02,080
authentic vulnerability is really
important. So to be able to say, Oh,

795
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,930
I'm most as part admission
of what's going on,

796
00:47:04,931 --> 00:47:07,810
but also part apology if
you believe it's called for.

797
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:13,080
I know on a smaller scale that in the
moments where I let my own child down,

798
00:47:13,361 --> 00:47:14,860
when I fail my own child,

799
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,390
whether it's because I have yelled in a
way that wasn't appropriate or it for,

800
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,860
or I have been too dismissive or
distracted, I catch myself and I say,

801
00:47:23,861 --> 00:47:27,760
I'm really sorry for what I just did. And
just like, it's okay. It's okay. Like,

802
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:31,670
I think she gets like, mom, stop being
awkward cause we live in New England and

803
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,810
she apparently has no feelings. This is a
we've anyway, um, she's like, please stop,

804
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:41,500
please stop. And she's only six. But I
say, I try to say to her, you know, this,

805
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,140
this wasn't right and I need to
make right. I need to make it right.

806
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:46,480
I need to make it better. I
don't beat myself up. But I,

807
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,600
so it's a combination of
that vulnerability, that
authentic vulnerability, um,

808
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:55,420
but also being willing to be accountable
and to say I don't have it all

809
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:55,901
together.

810
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:59,230
And it goes back to what I said earlier
about the importance of making mistakes

811
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:04,150
in front of your kids because your kids
need to know how to screw up as much as

812
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,370
they need to know how to succeed.
You will not have,

813
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,230
you can't know how to succeed well truly
well if you don't have the tools to

814
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:13,630
make mistakes.
And yet so many of us as parents,

815
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,840
we err too much on the side of we're
gonna teach you how to succeed.

816
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,100
And that's really part of what this book
is about. Um, I'm a big fan of the book,

817
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:26,101
lean in and I believe what we need to
teach our kids to do is to lean inside so

818
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:31,381
that they have the tools to be strong
and to navigate the barriers and the

819
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:35,500
unforeseen moments that arise
when they are pursuing success.

820
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,030
Great. We have another question on
the dory. This one's from Elizabeth.

821
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:42,730
She says she's currently reading
the curse of the good girl.

822
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:47,410
I'm published in 2010 specifically in
regard to part to breaking the curse.

823
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,790
Is there anything you'd update or advice
you'd modify based on things you've

824
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:56,200
learned and observed since
it was published? Wow, that's
a really good question.

825
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:01,180
Um, well I guess yes, absolutely.

826
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:05,050
And I actually talk about this in enough
as she is, that's a wonderful question.

827
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:05,681
Yeah,

828
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:08,530
I kind of realized that I screwed up a
little bit in the curse of the good girl.

829
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:10,480
So Elizabeth,
Maya Culpa,

830
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:13,460
and if you decide that you like my
work enough to read the next one, um,

831
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,540
you'll see actually talking about this.
So in the curse of the good girl,

832
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:21,430
I argue that the most important thing
girls need in order to thrive is to break

833
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:24,910
that curse is to not have to
sit like a girl all the time,

834
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:27,600
is to be able to speak up and you know,

835
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,000
not feel like they have to be modest
and have conflicts and express their

836
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:34,330
feelings.
And I thought that if girls could do that,

837
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,120
they would lead happier,
healthier lives. But why,

838
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:39,880
where I've,

839
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,420
so here's the problem with that is that
I was putting way too much emphasis on

840
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:44,500
the role of the girl.

841
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,850
I was not at all thinking about how
toxic the culture is for the girl.

842
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,320
And I think that just stems from my own
like can do I come from a very immigrant

843
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:56,110
family. Like you can do
it. Like just bootstrap it,

844
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:58,840
figure it out kind of
mentality that I grew up with.

845
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,210
That actually it wasn't fair to girls.

846
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,340
The thing that I've realized now almost
10 years later is that the data that we

847
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:07,360
see,
um,

848
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:12,880
around the world really in terms of
what girls are facing around anxiety and

849
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:14,200
depression and stress.

850
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:18,010
And the percentage of girls who say
on college campuses at the age of 18,

851
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,710
that I feel overwhelmed
by all I have to do.

852
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:24,970
These are all stratospherically rising.
That's not about the girls failure.

853
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,670
That's about the way we are
failing girls. And so, um,

854
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,400
and I do think becoming a parent
changed things for me. Um, it, it,

855
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:36,410
it allowed me to see the things that I
could control and the things that I can't

856
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,480
and then we all need to
work together to change.

857
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:44,360
All right. Another question
from the dory from Sri Lanka.

858
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,550
I apologize if I butchered
your name. Um, she asks,

859
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:51,990
teaching kids to be independent versus
being there through the process example,

860
00:50:51,991 --> 00:50:53,990
would you sit with them
passively or actively,

861
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,530
passively or actively through a homework
or leave them to work it out if, if and,

862
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,530
and let them ask if they have a question?
Such a great question.

863
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,570
And I think as our kids get older,

864
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,980
that is the kind of million dollar
question is where is the balance between

865
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:12,600
finding that zone of struggle and growth
that doesn't push them over the edge

866
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,220
and make them deteriorate into a tantrum
or whatever. Um, I think that is an art.

867
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:20,900
It's not a science. Um, I
think that what we want,

868
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,260
well let me tell you
what we want to avoid.

869
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,670
We want to avoid parenting and teaching
girls who feel like they have to ask

870
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:29,580
every five minutes. Is this right?
Is this right? Did I get it right?

871
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:30,630
I don't know if this is right.

872
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:35,430
And then what happens is they go to their
teachers and every couple minutes they

873
00:51:35,431 --> 00:51:37,470
keep asking,
is this exactly what you want?

874
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,160
Teachers are now complaining about this
to me all over the country and it's

875
00:51:41,161 --> 00:51:45,480
called learned helplessness
basically that, that, so it
is support seeking, right?

876
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,940
It looks like support seeking,
but it really what it is,

877
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,690
is it fear that if I don't get
it exactly right, oh my God,

878
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:55,310
like it's going to be a crisis. Now that
is not a muscle we want our kids to, to,

879
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:57,060
to cultivate.
And if you hear your teacher,

880
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:59,730
your daughter's teacher talk about this,
it's really important.

881
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,920
So how do you find that
balance? Well, first of all,

882
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:05,550
I think you have to prepare your daughter,
but beforehand and you say, listen,

883
00:52:05,551 --> 00:52:08,340
I know that you're going to be doing
your homework and I want you to know that

884
00:52:08,341 --> 00:52:09,000
I'm here.

885
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,300
And I also want you to know that my
goal is for you to challenge yourself.

886
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:16,260
And so I might not be as available to
you as I usually am because I'm going to

887
00:52:16,261 --> 00:52:19,950
ask you to grapple with some stuff.
Grapple might be a big word for your kid,

888
00:52:19,951 --> 00:52:22,020
but I'm going to ask you
to work on stuff yourself.

889
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,860
And I'm going to ask you to come up with
some strategies yourself for how you

890
00:52:25,861 --> 00:52:30,240
could help yourself without necessarily
using me. So I would say to a kid,

891
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,440
what's one thing you could do other than
asking me? Maybe it's to call a friend.

892
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:39,150
Those are all powerful things that
they can come up with to advocate for

893
00:52:39,151 --> 00:52:43,470
themselves to make good on a problem that
they have that don't involve going to

894
00:52:43,471 --> 00:52:48,090
you. Then I think you have to figure out,
you have to find that growth edge, right?

895
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,140
I think that's the phrase.

896
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:53,220
You have to find that place with her
where she's pushing herself but not

897
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:57,000
becoming so turned off by what she's
doing that she doesn't want to do it.

898
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:57,840
Cause here's the thing.

899
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,600
I think when kids really start
to hate what they're doing,

900
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,190
I mean they hate what they're doing.

901
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:06,690
So we also have to make for that
they're not getting, um, kind of undone.

902
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,470
And like I said, it is an art. I wish I
had a good, hard and fast rule for that.

903
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:14,310
Actually. Wait, I have one more thing
to say. Sorry. I did think of it.

904
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:16,320
It's hard to think on your feet because
I'm like, what would I really say?

905
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,260
So here's what I think I
would actually say to the kid.

906
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:22,890
What is one way that you could challenge
yourself that you've never challenged

907
00:53:22,891 --> 00:53:26,110
yourself before doing your homework?
That's what I would let you.

908
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,660
Let's come up with something that you,

909
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:31,950
that you would do to push yourself that
you haven't done before. Okay. All right.

910
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:34,800
And we've got one more question on the
dory and I think it's the last question

911
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:37,980
we'll have time for and it's
again from Hillary and she asks,

912
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,980
what is your take on single
gender education for girls?

913
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:44,850
Are there specific situations,
personalities where parents
should consider it?

914
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,540
Yes, I think so. Um,

915
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,560
my take on single gender education for
girls is that it can be a very important,

916
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:57,280
um, and empowering and enriching
experience for certain girls. Um,

917
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,010
but not necessarily for all girls.

918
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,330
There's a lot of great research
out there about, for example,

919
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,610
I'm thinking of the work of Linda Sax
at Ucla who has looked at the difference

920
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:12,600
in confidence, self reported confidence
levels, um, in the first year of college,

921
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:16,290
girls who have attended coed schools
versus single gender schools.

922
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,250
And there is a significant difference
that the girls who come from the all girls

923
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:24,420
school say a report, higher levels of
confidence, more speaking up in class.

924
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:25,710
That being said,

925
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,640
I mean I think there are wonderful
benefits to being part of a coed,

926
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,680
a community.
I also think,

927
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:35,010
are there certain kinds of girls that I
would recommend a single sex school too?

928
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:38,760
Yeah, I mean I think about this a lot
for my own, soon to be six year old.

929
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:43,530
And I think that if she turns out to be
a kid who is very vulnerable to social

930
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:45,870
pressure or particular round boys,
um,

931
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:50,520
who has a hard time distinguishing between
what sheet would her own values are

932
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,470
and what the values of her peers are.

933
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:56,790
I might seriously consider putting her
in an all girls school because I do think

934
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:58,800
that PR,
particularly around Middle School,

935
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:03,930
because I think that during that period
the powerful intense expectations to

936
00:55:03,931 --> 00:55:06,510
conform to what other people are doing,
um,

937
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,350
can be very destructive for certain
kinds of kids who are vulnerable.

938
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,310
So I'm thinking a lot about that for
my own daughter and watching her. Um,

939
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:19,410
I also think that for those girls who
need more attention around things like

940
00:55:19,411 --> 00:55:21,210
leadership development,
speaking up,

941
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,100
girls schools tend to be more oriented
to focusing on what the vulnerabilities

942
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:27,010
are that girls brings.

943
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:31,110
So I would say those two key points of
vulnerability to me would be rezoned to

944
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:34,710
seriously consider an all girls
environment. Terrific. Well, with that,

945
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:37,190
we are out of time.
Thank you so much for joining us,

946
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:41,680
thanking Rachel and Simone please.
Thank you.
