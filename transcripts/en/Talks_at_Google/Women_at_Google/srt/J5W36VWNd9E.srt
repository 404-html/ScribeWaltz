1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,540
Krista tippett is here with us today,
which is just absolutely amazing. Um,

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,980
I'll read a little bit about her first
and then we will just dive right into it.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,670
Um, Krista Tippett is a Peabody
award winning broadcaster,

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,680
national humanities medal list and the
New York Times bestselling author she

5
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:26,920
founded and leads the on
being project hosts globally,

6
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:30,880
esteemed on being public radio show
and podcast and curates the civil

7
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:34,780
conversations project and emergent
approach to conversation and relationship

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,610
across the differences of our age.

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,090
Her books include my
favorite becoming wise,

10
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:45,091
an inquiry into the mystery and art of
living and Einstein's God conversations

11
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:46,780
about science and the human spirit.

12
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,150
And I think literally even
just with those two titles,

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,840
you see this beautiful and vast
spectrum that Christa covers.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,870
And that is so kind of
perfect for us here at Google,

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,470
literally from mystery and spirit to
the human spirit to Einstein. Like it's,

16
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:04,150
it's just so perfect to have her here
in conversation here. We're so lucky.

17
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,760
And I think really we were talking
the other evening about, um,

18
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,350
what it means to inquire and the
idea of asking these questions,

19
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,640
these fundamental questions,

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,270
questions that get to the essence
of what does it mean to be human?

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,670
What does it mean to be human together?

22
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,630
And kind of what are the lessons we can
learn in this practice with everyone.

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,100
So we'll look at that today.

24
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:27,400
But first I'll just share a quick
funny little moment, which was,

25
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,020
as I was preparing for this,

26
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:32,830
I've been listening to Christopher years
a couple of years ago as I was actually

27
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:36,550
founding the lab, I found myself
listening to Krista. I'd, I'd, uh,

28
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:41,350
I'd discovered her then rediscovered her
and the project. And every day I was,

29
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,280
it was kind of over break. I was
listening to one a day or even two a day,

30
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:47,330
sometimes her podcasts.

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,520
And what I found is they
were so enlivening and they
really helped birth the

32
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:54,070
empathy lab. So I feel like I
wouldn't be, it wasn't for her.

33
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:56,580
So it's a treat to have you here.
But what was,

34
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,690
is thinking about preparing for this.
And I was like,

35
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:02,090
should I go back and listen to every
podcast and find my favorite moments? And,

36
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,740
and then it just would have been like
this incredible mountain of beauty that I

37
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:06,640
would have,
you know,

38
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,540
clearly like fallen under because
there was just too much there.

39
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,260
So what was beautiful was
actually reflecting on the
thing that touches me most

40
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:18,700
about her conversations
and these beautiful moments
that unfold between her and

41
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:22,160
other people even across distances.
Um,

42
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,440
or just this in the moment that you're
listening, what comes alive in you,

43
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,260
what echoes in you in
the days, weeks, months,

44
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:32,890
years to follow and how these
kind of sparks come alive in us.

45
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,240
So that leads us to this form of listening
that I feel like I really learned to

46
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:41,230
listen even just in being presence
with her before knowing her.

47
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,470
And I feel like we're all so lucky to
have her speaking to us about listening

48
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:44,861
today.

49
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:47,770
And so I'll just start with one of her
quotes that really I feel touched as the

50
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:50,260
core of what this art is all about,

51
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,730
which is listening is about
being actively present.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,370
It's not just about being quiet.

53
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,590
I meet with others with a life, right?
I meet others with the life I've lived,

54
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,930
not just with my questions.

55
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,090
So let's welcome Krista with open minds
and hearts and of course our ears and

56
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:12,100
share more for gracious wisdom with us.

57
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,100
And of course we are trying something a
little different today with this kind of

58
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:18,070
intimate gathering. So what we'll
do is crystal, we'll share a bit,

59
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:21,880
we'll probably go back and forth and
then we'd love to open it up as a real

60
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,720
conversation for all of us to live in
together. So if you have any questions,

61
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,790
definitely listen.
Don't think about them the whole time,

62
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,450
but as they rise up in the room,
please feel brave and courageous.

63
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:35,080
This is what this moment is about. So
thank you and welcome Krista. Yeah.

64
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,740
[inaudible]

65
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,390
well, it's exciting to be here. Um,

66
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,040
I love this invitation. I feel like
I made too many notes and so we just,

67
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,190
so Danielle and I just liked, cause I
really loved our conversation and I,

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,190
the more I do this, the longer
I live, the more I trust that.

69
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,400
And I liked being on both sides of it.
So I've just said to her,

70
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:01,820
I want her to interrupt me and ask
questions and that I really would like to

71
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:06,410
open it up and be in conversation
with you. Um, the question,

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,400
the kind of requests was to talk a little
bit about the art of listening and you

73
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:13,370
know, I'm a person who listens
for a living, but you know,

74
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:18,371
one of the things what you were saying
about that experience of the podcast of

75
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:20,600
listening to the podcast,
I mean I

76
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,580
listening is about presence,
which I'm going to say again,

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,240
but what's so fascinating and you and
I talked about this the other night,

78
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:33,290
is that, I mean, I am usually
not in the room. In fact,

79
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:37,850
I'm often halfway across the world from
the people I'm in conversation with.

80
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,430
And, um, the technology
of radio of podcast.

81
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,690
I mean, so, you know, these are
not physical experiences but,

82
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,570
but my conversations,
um,

83
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,140
because of the topic and then because
the medium allows for this are very,

84
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,300
very intimate and they're intimate between
me and the person I was speaking with.

85
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,550
And then it's an intimate experience,
you know,

86
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:08,360
one of the kind of the magic of radio
and of course that's just the old

87
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:11,630
fashioned word for podcasting, um, is, uh,

88
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,590
is that it is profoundly individual and
also absolutely communal at the same

89
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:22,430
time. And there's also kind of a
time shift that goes on, right?

90
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:26,900
It defies time because,
because in the moment that you listen,

91
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:30,740
you're in that room when it happened.
And you know,

92
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:32,540
I think of a conversation,

93
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,460
what I hope for every conversation I
have is that it is an adventure and that

94
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:43,370
something will happen that
will surprise both of us.

95
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,690
And if you, as a listener, you also
are there for that moment of surprise.

96
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,150
Um,
so that's,

97
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,360
I was thinking a lot about that actually
as I was thinking about being here

98
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:57,530
because, because we're talking
about human presence and,

99
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,480
and there is this miracle,

100
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:04,040
but it's absolutely possible with
and through and in technology.

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,760
And I think that what you're about is
figuring out how to amplify that and to

102
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:14,240
explore all the possibilities in that.
Um,

103
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,620
so I think of listening
as a basic social art.

104
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,103
Um,

105
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,280
I think of social art and virtues
as spiritual technologies.

106
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,780
Um,

107
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,780
and that assists to just a tool for the
art and craft of living and have it for

108
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:37,830
a deep end more generative,
which is a nuance on productive father.

109
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,570
It can be productive,
but a more deepened generative,

110
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,560
higher quality human experience. And, um,

111
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,920
the interesting thing,
so it is a basic social art.

112
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,100
I think it's something we know how
to do or we've known how to do,

113
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:56,150
but we've actually unlearned. Um, uh,

114
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,260
I think that growing up in this culture,

115
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,880
we learn to that listening is,

116
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,380
or the experience we have,

117
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,930
which we internalize to be
about what listening is about,

118
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:13,931
is to be quiet while the other person
says what they have to say until it's time

119
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:19,550
for me to say what I have
to say. But actually, um,

120
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,370
listening is not about being quiet,

121
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,280
being quiet as a side effect.
Um,

122
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,330
listening is about being present.
Um,

123
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,920
and as I just said, interestingly,
you can be present online as well.

124
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,680
Um, and so because we've kind
of unlearned this thing, um,

125
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,260
I think it's interesting
to think about what era.

126
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:46,970
It's really basic component
parts. Um, for me,

127
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,170
um,
listening

128
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,260
brings a quality musters equality
of generous generosity. You know,

129
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:59,120
and in a spiritual technology is always,
is always working in two directions.

130
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,900
It's inner work as much
as it's outer work. Um,

131
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,880
so especially in this world,

132
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:09,881
we can have it now and there's so many
things we're fighting about in so many

133
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:13,040
things were fearful about.
Um,

134
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,960
this is not as easy as it sounds. Right?
In fact, it's not very instinctive.

135
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,770
Um, you know, to me a generous listener,

136
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,070
it definition of that would be wanting
to understand the humanity behind the

137
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,490
war,
the words of the other.

138
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:34,610
So it's not just about the words that
are going to pass between us and wanting

139
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:39,611
to bring your own best words and your
best ideas into the conversation you have

140
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:45,110
to muster.
Also in yourself.

141
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,370
A real curiosity to bring that
kind of generosity to bear.

142
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,700
And again,
this is really kind of a wizard muscle.

143
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,180
The thing about curiosity,
you can't actually fake it.

144
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,160
And again, whether we're
online or offline, um,

145
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,070
we add an animal level when we
encounter another human being,

146
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:13,071
absolutely know whether they're really
curious or whether they're just asking us

147
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:17,760
a question. We know
that in our bodies. Um,

148
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,970
so really like even just this basic,

149
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,560
this basic component of the art
of living, of being curious, uh,

150
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,690
becomes kind of a spiritual discipline.
Or if you don't like that language,

151
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:35,640
it becomes a muscle that we need to
flex and flex so that it again, um,

152
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,150
starts to feel like instinct
starts to feel natural. Um,

153
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,080
listening involves, um, vulnerability.

154
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:49,590
I mean one litmus test,
um,

155
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,770
about whether you have actually gotten
yourself to a curious place that you can

156
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:59,490
ask whether you go into a room, whether
that's a virtual room or a physical room,

157
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:02,610
is are you willing to be surprised?

158
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,310
And again,
we walk into all of our spaces these days,

159
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,230
so guarded,
so clear about what we have to say,

160
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,020
what we have to present,
what we have to protect.

161
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,580
And also so clear about what we
think those other people stand for.

162
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,010
Um,
so to,

163
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,350
to be willing to be surprised as
it is an unnatural move right now.

164
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,190
And then,

165
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,060
and then the final piece of this that I
want to add is that we actually have to

166
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,920
be that actually in,

167
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,850
in many of the spaces we are currently
working with and living in and meeting

168
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:39,301
each other.

169
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:44,301
And it wouldn't actually be reasonable
to ask other people to surprise

170
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,000
themselves, their surprise us. Um, so, so,

171
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,240
so there's a piece of this I
think that get the, that the,

172
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:56,490
that the social art of listening is
intimately connected with the virtue of

173
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,760
hospitality. Uh, another
spiritual technology.

174
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:02,280
One thing I love about hospitality,

175
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:05,490
it's kind of a gateway to
all the other great virtues,

176
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:08,080
compassion or love.
Um,

177
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,950
you actually though it's much easier.
It's an easier entry point.

178
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:17,970
You don't actually have to love
someone to be hospitable towards them.

179
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,010
You don't have to agree with them
to be hospitable towards them.

180
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:24,480
You don't even have to like them
to be hospitable towards them.

181
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,750
But we know in our analog lives,
um,

182
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,930
and I think maybe we're learning in our
online lives that have the space you

183
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,280
create,
um,

184
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,340
absolutely limits or expands what
is possible that will happen there.

185
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:49,341
There is a difference between creating
a space with a welcome and an ethos or

186
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:56,290
just opening the door so
that anything can happen.

187
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,563
Um,

188
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,390
something that's very clear to me that
I think a lot about that it's fun to say

189
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,980
in this room is that,
uh, you know, to me, uh,

190
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,051
the,

191
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:16,051
the digital world is just a new
canvas for the old human condition.

192
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,070
There's nothing that happens online
that doesn't have an offline,

193
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:25,510
although things can absolutely
get amplified. You know,

194
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,360
it's the good, the bad and
the ugly we're encountering,

195
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,580
you know, but trolls, like we have,

196
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,750
we all walk around with
trollish places in our psyches.

197
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:43,030
Now they have this public,
this public room to run around and write.

198
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,900
Um, that's like visuals, just like,

199
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,230
um, but so, so, so there's this,

200
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,100
so this has always been true, um, that,

201
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,720
that the quality of the encounter of
the listening, of the relationship,

202
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,780
of the possibility of what
can happen between two people,

203
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:07,870
whether they agree with each
other or don't or similar don't.

204
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,550
It's very much effected by the, by
the spirit, by creating the space.

205
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:17,880
Um, and so, and I think
there's just a real need it in,

206
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,900
again,
in the physical world,

207
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:24,220
as much as in the online world
to create alternative spaces.

208
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,180
And I'll say it again,

209
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:30,181
where it would be reasonable to ask
any of us to walk in and bring our best

210
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:35,430
selves and, and be looking for
the good and the other, um,

211
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,020
and be willing to surprise ourselves
and be truly inviting other people to

212
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,960
surprise us. Um, so that's, those are,

213
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,480
I guess the other thing I would want to
just mention that I absolutely think of,

214
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,430
um, in terms of a companion
to, to listening is the,

215
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,260
um,
the art of asking better questions.

216
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,820
Um, in, in American life, we,

217
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,940
we mostly trade in the answers and we
actually mostly trade in competing answers

218
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,660
and a lot of what,
uh,

219
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,810
calls itself a question or
presents as a question is actually,

220
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,790
or is actually art,
not questioning.

221
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:26,791
It's kind of tools or weapons
to incite or corner or catch,

222
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,530
you know,
or at least entertain.

223
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,980
And this is certainly true in
my field of journalism. The,

224
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:37,690
the question is often about how it
makes the journalist look and not really

225
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:41,890
about what it's going to elicit.

226
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,290
What I want to point out
and that spectacle, which
we're all very familiar with,

227
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,830
is how powerful a form
of words a question is.

228
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,223
Um,

229
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,660
the way I've come to experience it as
that questions elicit answers in their

230
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,190
likeness,

231
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,510
answers rise or fall to
the questions they meet.

232
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,120
And in then in the negative,
uh, expression of that,

233
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:15,950
which we're very familiar
with from media. Um, you know,

234
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,270
it's very,

235
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,300
it's almost impossible to meet a
simplistic question with anything but a

236
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:24,230
simplistic answer.

237
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,140
It's almost impossible to
transcend a combative question.

238
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,810
But the positive,

239
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,260
the positive side of that is that it's
almost impossible to resist a generous

240
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,993
question.

241
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,490
And we've all had that experience that
there is something life giving about

242
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,100
asking a better question.
Um, can I ask you? Yeah,

243
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,230
yes, yes, yes. You May. Yeah,

244
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,820
I know, right? You're like, if it's a
good one. Yeah. Cause it generous. Yeah.

245
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,860
So what I'm hearing is you're speaking is,
um,

246
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,100
is there's this sense of an opening
that happens when there is a generous

247
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,420
presence.
There is an opening in the question.

248
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,680
There's an opening in the space
between you or things can be put there.

249
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,790
I'm so curious.
Um,

250
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,530
you mentioned that the other night with
the word you set an intention before you

251
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:25,550
go in and the listening before the
listening and I'm just curious how,

252
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,910
how does that work for you? How do you
cultivate that opening in yourself?

253
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:29,900
That invitation?

254
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:34,901
Because it is that first
step of hospitality is open
the door and come into this

255
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,800
space that we can be in together.
I'm just,

256
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,650
when I'm having a conversation
or an interview when you're
having a conversation.

257
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,470
Yeah. And when you're figuring
out the right questions,

258
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:46,880
the questions that have the
opening in them. Yeah. Um,

259
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,100
well I do actually think in terms of
hospitality and the work I do so and,

260
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,440
and so I think of the preparation
I do for an interview as inactive,

261
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,090
as work of hospitality.
Um, because you know,

262
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:02,924
again,
we,

263
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,110
we so much is determined about how an
encounter is going to go in the initial

264
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,160
moments before words are spoken.

265
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,920
So just kind of like setting that table.

266
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,103
MMM.

267
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,990
Which is an image of a certain kind of
hospitality, but it's the same idea.

268
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,263
MMM.

269
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,470
When we don't do that,

270
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,980
then the most obvious things about us
that we're all carrying out front right

271
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:39,510
now just to define what's,
just define what's possible.

272
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,900
And so what I'm interested in is how can
we not solve all the problems or make

273
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:45,990
it that way?

274
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,380
Because I really want to be in rooms with
people I disagree with and who are and

275
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:53,550
who I, who I need to learn from and
who I know I want to share life with,

276
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:57,060
even if I really don't understand them.
Not Violent people,

277
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:58,200
but most people aren't violent.

278
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:02,400
There's this huge swath in
the middle where those, those
fellow humans are there.

279
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,360
Um, so what I want to do is
create the space so that,

280
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,170
so that the things that we
already know are problematic, um,

281
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,490
are certainly present that they don't
define what becomes possible between us.

282
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,220
Um, in my interviews, you know, when you
just asked me that intuitively, you know,

283
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:22,980
what comes to mind is I get excited.

284
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,660
I'm just excited about the
conversation and, and the,

285
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,950
and I want to prepare,
um,

286
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,460
because I want them to be able to relax
as quickly as possible so that we can

287
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:43,440
really go deep.
And one way I do that is by,

288
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,000
by knowing about them,
by honoring them,

289
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:52,950
by reading their books, if they've
written books or knowing what they do.

290
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,220
Um, I mean I do a lot of, you know,

291
00:18:56,221 --> 00:19:00,780
I will also read other interviews they've
given. I would say. So I think of my, um,

292
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,020
interview preparation mode as the
Vulcan mind meld mode of interview

293
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:10,560
preparation. It's like, you know, um,

294
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,670
my mind to your mind,
your thoughts to my thoughts because my,

295
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,430
my goal in preparing, it's not that I, um,

296
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,833
no what,

297
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,780
what they think as much
as how they think and,

298
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,030
and so that then,

299
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,330
and again this works if they're halfway
across the world and I'm in a studio in

300
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:34,680
there, in a studio that we all
know what this experience is.

301
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,680
If you meet someone new
and you know very quickly,

302
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,730
if you're going to have
to explain yourself,

303
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,970
defend yourself,
be on guard,

304
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,770
and then that's what your
whole body gears up to do.

305
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,340
And then that just write that,
then you're, then you're off. So,

306
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,970
but what I'm aiming for is this
other experience we've all also had,

307
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,230
you meet somebody and you're
just know that they get you.

308
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,980
And even when I say that to you right now,

309
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:12,981
like my body relaxes and there was a
lot more possibility and it's a much,

310
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,970
it's a soft right.

311
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,150
It's a soft space in which
just going to happen.

312
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,610
And I think it's a more playful,

313
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:28,140
adventurous space for the same reason I
interrupt to do with my question. No, no,

314
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:32,730
I love that. I, I didn't, um,
I did want to, you know, um,

315
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,710
one of the things you
said to me is that you,

316
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,010
you also wanted to invite me here at
Google to just say whatever was on my mind

317
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:48,350
that, that I would want to stay and, um,

318
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,700
to you. And, um, actually, I mean,

319
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:54,990
I have a fair number of
conversations about, you know,

320
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,980
not about technology per se,
but about our lives with technology and,

321
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,600
um, and do think about this
a great deal. And I, I mean,

322
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:08,620
one thing I want to say is that I,
um,

323
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,260
and I know you all are, you know, we're,

324
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:16,261
we're now having this kind of reckoning
culturally with the civilizational

325
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:19,540
effect of the work you do,

326
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,890
the work that happened in this
industry and we've all created that

327
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:28,870
civilizational effect who we've all
cocreated it and it's so new and these

328
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,610
technologies, there's so much
in their infancy. And, uh,

329
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,510
I think one of the messages that's
come through so clearly is, um,

330
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,310
with wise people in my
conversations is that, you know,

331
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:44,620
that we forget that all of this is in
its infancy because it is so powerful and

332
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:47,980
it has so quickly kind of feels
like taken over our lives. But,

333
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,870
but there is the opportunity and
the challenge is, is to continue,

334
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:57,250
is to shape our lives with technology
and the technologist to human to human

335
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:01,270
purpose. And, and I'm also aware of, um,

336
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,610
I do think this is also true
in journalism. Like culturally,

337
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,710
we're so much more skill
that sophisticated analysis
and criticism of what is

338
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:16,711
flawed and failing and destructive
and terrifying and catastrophic,

339
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,091
right?
Like,

340
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:24,091
we're really good at that and
we're not as sophisticated at,

341
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,840
at seeing and analyzing and working with
and they're buying nurturing what is

342
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,290
generative and beautiful and humane.
And,

343
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,790
and I think that you, I know,
you know this cause that I,

344
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:47,791
there's so much that it's human and
beautiful at humane and generative in our

345
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:53,020
lives with technology as well. Um, just,

346
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:58,021
I would just say one of the things that's
so clear to me in the sphere I'm in

347
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:03,300
is, is the abundance
of poetry, um, that is,

348
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,920
that has this whole new life online,
um,

349
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,310
and how people are making
poetry and, and, and,

350
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,990
and putting it up there and sharing it.
Um,

351
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,830
and I think this is also a
civilizational move. I mean, poetry does,

352
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:25,780
in fact in human societies rise up when
we are in these moments of cultural and

353
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:30,640
political disarray. It
does. Um, it's, it's,

354
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:30,970
uh,

355
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,970
it's something we are turning to as our
official forms of language and discourse

356
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:40,960
are so broken and failing
us so badly. And it, it,

357
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,990
it gives us ways to give voice
to the best of ourselves.

358
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,930
And actually also it
gives us ways to throw,

359
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,660
to put questions into the room.
And I just,

360
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,330
I mean the room and a
very expansive sense,

361
00:23:56,331 --> 00:24:00,650
the public room that aren't,
that we,

362
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,850
that are there for us to live
rather than answer or fight about.

363
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,990
Um, uh, one of those,

364
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:13,730
and one of those questions by way of
poetry that I work with a lot is from

365
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,900
Elizabeth Alexander,

366
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:18,790
who was the poet of the
first Obama Administration.

367
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,520
And she has this poem which ends,
you know,

368
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:27,521
poetry is the human voice and are
we not of interest to each other.

369
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,220
And to me that is,
that is a question that refrains like,

370
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,730
can we get along or are you
a Republican or a democrat?

371
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:40,490
Like if that's a question
that could help reframe,

372
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,830
are grappling with all the things
we want to grapple with. Um,

373
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,290
and then I'm sure many of you are aware
that Mary Oliver died last week and I

374
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,110
was so,
so privileged to have,

375
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,320
I think the last big interview she
gave in 2015 in which I will share,

376
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:59,360
she smoked the entire

377
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:06,170
c only interview I've ever had where my
producer texted me before I arrived and

378
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:09,550
said, she wants to smoke.
Are you okay with that?

379
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,020
It's like she never gives interviews.
Of course I'm okay with that.

380
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:16,180
But it was so perfect because I knew

381
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,920
it wasn't remote smoking.
It was in my face and it was,

382
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:23,410
I was privileged.
Um,

383
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,220
and she was wearing a new England
patriots sweatshirt and, and it was just,

384
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:32,270
it made her so much more perfect that
she's so three dimensional because,

385
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:33,320
you know,
very Oliver,

386
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,520
her critics think that she's like poetry
light because she writes beautiful

387
00:25:37,521 --> 00:25:40,170
things about the natural world.
Um,

388
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,020
and I think some of the people who love
her most put her up on a pedestal and

389
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:45,950
turn her into a saint.

390
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:50,420
And the truth is like if you think about
a sophisticated analysis of goodness

391
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:51,530
and beauty,
but you know,

392
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:56,531
she fled to the woods and started writing
poetry because she was living in an

393
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:02,750
abusive household. And the poet, you know,

394
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:07,751
she spent years in young
adulthood gathering berries
because that's what she had

395
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,034
to eat.

396
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,710
And it was that three
dimensionality of her and that,

397
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,590
that's what gives her poems about
beauty and goodness, such heft.

398
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,420
And actually I took,
you know,

399
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,800
so here a question she put out into the
world that is now rippling through it

400
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:29,450
again. And it's one of these
transformative questions
we can live. Tell me,

401
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:33,770
what is it you plan to do with
your one wild and precious life?

402
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,430
And something, another gift she gave me
in that interview was to just, you know,

403
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,980
bring the six plus is the,
the phrase,

404
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,750
I like the phrase generous listening.

405
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,950
Mary Oliver used the
phrase convivial listening.

406
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,670
There's like a bubbling and that's
really I being the protests that she is.

407
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm glad you brought Marriott
because I actually, um,

408
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,000
when I saw that and I thought immediately
of view because I listened to that

409
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:04,920
interview and um,

410
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,070
the thing that touched me the most in
that interview with Mary was how she

411
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:12,150
talked about her poetry
being being a moving thing.

412
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:15,150
That she would walk to have the poetry
come through her and then she'd have to

413
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:16,080
run home and get the,

414
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,880
and what I loved about that was just
that it was the living the questions.

415
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:21,541
It isn't the,

416
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:25,140
I sit down in this things come stuffs
and I think something that you were

417
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:28,140
talking about a few minutes
ago with journalism,

418
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:30,570
which is the nature of
the questions again,

419
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:34,530
you can go so easily to the
places of, um, you know,

420
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,730
the darker spaces, the shadow
we spaces because it, it works.

421
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,050
There's a lot of edge there to work with.

422
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:44,400
I think design and journalism is
very similar in terms of there's a,

423
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,770
there's a curiosity. It's, it's funny,

424
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:51,771
you can almost say like search poetry
and replace like design or art or all

425
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,310
these things. It's all
inquiry into that, that thing.

426
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:59,430
At the core of something that you're
going to bring out and make felt and move

427
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:02,520
everything else away.
And when I look at design or journalism,

428
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:07,080
I think about this deep curiosity that
rises up into us and do we want to just

429
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,090
look for the problems we want to solve?

430
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:12,330
The itchy seems that drive us crazy or
the things that feel like they're not

431
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:15,660
right. Or is there actually
something even deeper than that?

432
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,950
It's more kind of unifying them
that that is this place of beauty.

433
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:22,950
And the way you describe beauty as,
actually,

434
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,860
I don't want to misquote you
like right here. So let me,

435
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,780
let me make sure I get this
right. Um, in my notes,

436
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:33,900
I literally have the hippies code
on beauty, which is always my,

437
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,380
like my touchstone, which is state
of the world is hopelessly reeling.

438
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:42,120
Stay close to the sounds that bring
you alive. And your quote is beauty,

439
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:45,330
is that in the presence of
which we feel more alive.

440
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,960
So this vitality or speaking
about, yeah, and that was,

441
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,160
that's actually a language of John
O'donoghue was another poet and theologian

442
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:57,630
and philosopher. Um, and I, so he,

443
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,570
he was talking, we were
actually talking about, um,

444
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,940
how a lot of the words that we need them
most and love the most also get ruined.

445
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,683
Um,

446
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,240
and I think that's true of words like
peace and justice and love, you know,

447
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,390
and kindness.

448
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:23,330
They get on bumper stickers or they get
partisan affiliations and, and so we,

449
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,990
so I think sometimes we have to,

450
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,280
we have to put them to one side and use
them less and kind of say what we're

451
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:32,310
saying and use a universe of words,
um,

452
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,580
and not expect those words
to do the work for us. Um,

453
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,340
but sometimes we just really
have to claim a word and say, no,

454
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:41,230
we're not gonna let this die. We
have to resurrect it. And Yeah,

455
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,360
I'm trying to do that
with the word civility.

456
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,050
But he used the word
beauty and I said to him,

457
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,563
well,

458
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,190
you know, beauty is another one
of those words. I said, like,

459
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,390
if you just throw the word beauty and
to many conversations, I said, you know,

460
00:29:56,391 --> 00:30:01,391
maybe were where my mind would go is
to the flawless face on the cover of a

461
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:05,690
magazine. Right? And he
said, no, no, that's glamour.

462
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,860
And they said,

463
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,860
beauty is that in the presence
of which we feel more aligned.

464
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,293
Okay.

465
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,660
And what you just said,

466
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,610
um,
about,

467
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,480
you know,
the inquiry.

468
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,783
Okay.

469
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,680
If we're,
if we're focused on solving the problems,

470
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:29,640
do we then end up being
orienting towards the problems?

471
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,620
And I, and I, and I,
and you know, I think,

472
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:37,040
I don't think we have to do one or the
other, right? I think we can, I think we,

473
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,830
we do to some extent need
to focus on the problems.

474
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,740
Um,
and

475
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,180
it's also just as serious
and robust a question to ask,

476
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,863
uh,

477
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,350
what do we want to amplify?
Because it is good for us

478
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,200
because it,

479
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,200
because it speaks to and elicits the
best of which our species is capable.

480
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,160
I think that's so much
of the conversation.

481
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,280
Just make her Google
not to speak for myself.

482
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:09,600
And as part of the community of Google.
Um,

483
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,520
I think that's part of what's so
fascinating about this braces phase,

484
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:17,000
awkward adolescent moment we are in
with technology right now. You're right,

485
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:20,660
the power is what has brought
us along so far, so fast,

486
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,900
but there's so much more to be done.
There's so much expansion,

487
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:26,240
there's so much support,
there's so much positivity.

488
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,870
It's easy to focus on the fear part
of it because that's real and that's

489
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:31,850
happening and things must shift.

490
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,440
But there's so much potential if you
focus on what are the things that we want

491
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,990
to expand in people,
what are the ways we can support,

492
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,350
how can we look not just at the
functional and productive needs,

493
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:47,000
but at the generative spacious needs of
people. How was the whole person welcome?

494
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,930
And I think what's so curious and part
of why this listening conversation,

495
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:56,150
it's so wonderful to have everyone in
the room here is we are really trying to

496
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,650
go back to these core skills that are
so easy to forget what the speed with

497
00:32:00,651 --> 00:32:02,660
which we all live and,

498
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:07,661
and remember what does it mean to in our
process open up moments where we have

499
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:09,710
spaces for better listening,

500
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,570
where we are practicing some of
these skills in a different way. Um,

501
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,570
working with the design
process so that it's not, um,

502
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,690
it's not kind of the normal
way that we make things,

503
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:25,230
but that we ourselves more
of us as welcome in that
room and at the white board

504
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,960
that there is kind of,
you know,

505
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,110
for the humans on this side and the way
that it touches people on the outside

506
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:32,390
and the way that all kind of circles,
um,

507
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,520
what does it mean to work with new models
and open spaces and these places that

508
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:40,160
we all create in this. Also
kind of where, you know,

509
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:43,940
you think about that as an intersection
of design and the hospitality virtue.

510
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,530
Absolutely. Yeah. Um,

511
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:55,030
I'm very clear that as much as we are,

512
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,590
again seeing the,
the dark well,

513
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:05,130
we're seeing the dark side of
ourselves on this great big canvas. Um,

514
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,930
and we're seeing this very young industry,

515
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,040
which one of the things I've learned here
is it's not really an industry, right?

516
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,440
It's a bunch of companies
competing with each other,

517
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,210
but the world actually needs
you all to be an industry. Um,

518
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,680
um, this industry that
ha that it, you know, I,

519
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,110
I spent my twenties in divided Berlin and,
um,

520
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,950
I keep thinking about that this
out here in silicon valley because

521
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,740
as much as we are riveted by what's
happening in Washington DC or in London,

522
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,060
um, your, the, your company,

523
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:52,060
these companies are the
superpowers of this century.

524
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,040
And that's huge now.
And I,

525
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,750
and we're all now aware of the
perils of that and all the,

526
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,650
all the pieces that need to be in place
for that to be true and to be good for

527
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:07,480
humanity.
But I also see that,

528
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,020
uh, you know, every,

529
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,390
every generation,

530
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:18,670
every century has had it's life
altering technologies, right?

531
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,240
The railroad changed everything.
The telephone changed everything.

532
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:25,840
Electricity Change, everything.
Fire change everything. But,

533
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,740
but what is new about our technologies?

534
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,660
Of course the pace is different,

535
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:35,860
but I don't think that's really it because
I think in other generations the pace

536
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:39,760
of those things was,
was equally completely disorienting.

537
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,340
It is the intimacy,

538
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,810
our technologies are woven
into the fabric of our days,

539
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,640
into the fabric of our lives.

540
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:56,670
They are shifting the way we
make and lead and learn and La,

541
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,840
they're woven into the human enterprise.

542
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,250
And,

543
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:11,250
and what I also see is that
these technologies and the
interconnected world and

544
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:19,021
economies they've given us have actually
given us the tools for the first time

545
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,020
as a species to think
and act as a species.

546
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:28,810
Yeah. We are not anywhere living
up to that right now. Right.

547
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:32,410
Like that's not the picture
that this is the reality.

548
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,360
This is the potential.

549
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,200
I love articulation of it.
I've never heard it quite like that,

550
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:44,940
but indeed it is. Um, the, yeah,
the ability to be interconnected.

551
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:48,120
It is actually, when you say
woven, it's interconnected.

552
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,340
Not just in kind of our humanity,

553
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,520
but actually in the way
that we are connected.

554
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:58,150
And I think the inside and outside,
yes. But that inner and outer is,

555
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,920
is so critical. And actually
it's, it's perfectly, you
said that because there was,

556
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:05,460
um, there was a moment that
you had, that you reflected on,

557
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:09,450
in your book with Dr Rachel
Naomi [inaudible] Rehman
where you talk about Tikkun

558
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,190
Olam and, and what's interesting
is I actually had a moment
where I was like, oh,

559
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:18,150
shall I talk about spirituality had
Google and I was like, absolutely, yes.

560
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,900
This is the human heart we're talking
about. The language is almost, you can,

561
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,530
you can use whatever language you want.
The thing that we were speaking about,

562
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,390
the thing that breeds all of our hearts,

563
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:31,050
the thing that connects all of us is
always the same. So that is what this is.

564
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:35,130
But, um, sometime early in the life of
the world, something happened to shatter.

565
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:36,150
He knows origin myth,

566
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,290
the light of the universe and the
countless pieces they lodged a sparks and

567
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:44,490
every part of creation or highest human
calling is to help repair the part of

568
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:47,280
the world that we can see and touch.

569
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,920
And I just immediately thought,

570
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:54,810
what if everything we designed had that
beauty and service and your version of

571
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:58,020
beauty, you and John's, um, to it,

572
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,950
this idea that we can repair the parts
of the world that we see in touch,

573
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,480
that is a pretty incredible fabric when
we think about what filament is at our

574
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:09,870
fingers here at Google, what
a great mission, you know,

575
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:14,610
to organize and organize
the world's information to
light it up and repair it as

576
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:18,180
well. I think that's where no one else
gets. Also at the one in the same time,

577
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:22,160
it's audacious and it's doable, right?
Because that, you know, that's the,

578
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,610
that's the Jewish, the
story behind the, it's,

579
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,660
it's called the birthday of the world
and it's behind the moral commandment to

580
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:33,150
repair the world.
And I really love,

581
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:36,270
like that's another piece of
language that I think is so useful,

582
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,770
so much better than save the world,
which was what the 20th century was about.

583
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,460
And so much damage was done in
the name of saving the world.

584
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,230
And it also made people, it
actually alienated people
from their sense of agency,

585
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,940
um,
but repair the world and you know,

586
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,090
ever since 2016 it's just like all the,

587
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:01,530
like all the images that come to mind
about what we have to do in our countries

588
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,360
like weaving, stitching. So
these mending, repairing,

589
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,240
you know, one and, and the
thing is, it's a big picture,

590
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:11,640
but it's one relationship at
the time and the at a time.

591
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,880
And that's what she said
to repair the world, um,

592
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,720
is the highest human calling. But you
start with what you can see and touch.

593
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,790
That's, that's what you're called
to. I love that pragmatism.

594
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,110
And it also, um, what I feel like is
rising up in the conversation too,

595
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:33,720
is this save the world.

596
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:38,560
It made me think there is this really
beautiful intention we have in the valley

597
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:42,820
and in technology. Um, how can we
solve these audacious human problems,

598
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,310
these large scale massive things?
How can we,

599
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,380
the intention of that is so beautiful.
Um, the results of that are not always,

600
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,970
um, when you speak about intentionality
and hospitality and this whole space that

601
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:58,210
we've started to kind of
unroll in our conversation,

602
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,550
what's your advice for
us with that? Um, yeah,

603
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:08,050
well that's, that's all I'm going
to know it. Solve it for you.

604
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,920
But what I, what I will say, I think the
intentionality, your question is so good.

605
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,020
You know,
that's my highest compliment that

606
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,510
it is my birthday. And I thought
that was officially the best friend.

607
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:28,570
Um,
we all know,

608
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,290
we know in our lives,

609
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:35,800
we know in the lives of
companies and organizations,

610
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,870
um, the intentionality at
the beginning of something,

611
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:45,871
the intentionality that's embedded in it
has this mysterious power to be in the

612
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:50,380
DNA forever. Right? Um,

613
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:56,970
but culturally and I think especially in
the realm of like productivity of every

614
00:39:57,881 --> 00:39:58,714
kind,

615
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,380
we really privilege the what and the when
questions and not the how and the why.

616
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,163
Hmm.

617
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,640
And I actually think if,
um,

618
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,500
actually believe that if we are going
to wrap our arms around these big

619
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:22,180
civilizational, these intimate and
civilizational challenges, we have,

620
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:27,190
um, you know, the end, the
problem is as we also know,

621
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,760
if you,
if you rush to do something,

622
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,790
if you rush to a solution,
you often waste time.

623
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,140
You often end up setting something loose.

624
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,770
The didn't have the
intentionality that it needed,

625
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,460
that you then spend time rolling
back and dismantling and solving for,

626
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,620
um, which is, which is
all by way of saying, um,

627
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,830
it would be who of us now.
And I,

628
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,170
and I mean in every aspect of our
lives and in everything we do,

629
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,760
whatever our work is, um, because,

630
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,570
because this is a critical moment,
um,

631
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,700
to really invest our time,
our creativity,

632
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,480
um, our attention, uh,

633
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:25,040
a sophisticate,
the sophistication we would give to,

634
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,950
to solving a problem to, to, to
this, to the, to the why, the,

635
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:32,280
and the how of it.
Um,

636
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,390
yeah,
and what that means and it,

637
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:43,160
but that has some trade offs that
are culturally, uh, difficult.

638
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,000
Right?

639
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,540
That means you would spend a lot more
time on something that doesn't look like

640
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:48,470
you're being busy.

641
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,720
So like there's a culture shift that
has to happen around this though.

642
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,270
Langue language I love
that actually comes from,

643
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,560
from spiritual traditions is
the language of discernment. Um,

644
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,130
you know,
I mean,

645
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:09,270
I know like these industries you're in
are all that innovation and we actually

646
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:12,690
have to hoist in that a
lot of the problems, mag,

647
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,950
the massive prompts we're dealing with
now are the result of innovations,

648
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,390
you know, and, and also just like
what we did with food 50 years ago,

649
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,403
um,

650
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,120
where we created convenience and
we have actually like w I mean,

651
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,401
could,

652
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:33,750
do you know what an innovation it was to
have food coming out of boxes and cams,

653
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:38,400
like, you know, life changing,
amazing, so bad for us,

654
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,100
very lucrative,

655
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,520
so bad for us.
And so now we are like h and then the,

656
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,270
you know, our, our, our
government policies followed it,

657
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:54,480
agriculture followed it,
all of these things followed it.

658
00:42:54,481 --> 00:42:59,481
But now we're now are implicated in
this massive complex of things around

659
00:42:59,671 --> 00:43:04,671
climate and and Helson and economies
that we have to like take apart and saw

660
00:43:04,951 --> 00:43:05,431
four,
right?

661
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:10,431
So innovation is not in itself a good
like innovation is not necessarily

662
00:43:11,671 --> 00:43:14,100
progress.
And so that's something to ponder.

663
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,880
And I think if you say
if, if, if these, if,

664
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:22,040
if our technologies and our lives with
them or in their adolescence, if art, if,

665
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,320
if these super power companies
are also, you know, very young,

666
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,110
I think that discernment
muscle like you know,

667
00:43:28,111 --> 00:43:30,090
of course innovation
has been a core value,

668
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:34,920
but in the next stage asking
will it be good for the world,

669
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:36,270
will it be good for humanity?

670
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:40,190
And that's going to look like
wasting time being discerning. Yeah.

671
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:45,390
You use the word imagination
a lot to describe that
generative, spacious process.

672
00:43:45,391 --> 00:43:48,660
And in the end I think imagination and
discern my go really beautifully together

673
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:50,700
towards that.
I must pick up.

674
00:43:50,701 --> 00:43:54,570
So you mentioned that civility is a word
that means a lot to you now and just

675
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,800
talking about these civil,

676
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:59,520
I love saying that these are civilization
level problems because it includes the

677
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:03,360
humanity and the culture and you
can just all things at once. Um,

678
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:07,830
please share your definition.
No, I'm disability. Yes. Um,

679
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,990
well I know it's a problematic word
and I always add other adjectives,

680
00:44:12,991 --> 00:44:17,230
like I say, adventurous civility
or muscular civility. Um,

681
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,660
it's not about, I think we have to
get past the idea that, uh, you know,

682
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,290
it's not, to me it's not,
again, like what is it not,

683
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,280
it's not being nice kind and tame.

684
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,213
Um,

685
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:40,970
those aren't big enough
qualities to need this moment.

686
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,370
I'm not saying there's
not a place for them,

687
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,030
but that's not what civility is about.
I want to say,

688
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,540
I want to say that civility,
that the intention,

689
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:54,650
the intentionality behind it is
this repair of our lives together.

690
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,700
Um,
I think,

691
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,350
I think there are these, um, kind of,

692
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:06,510
there's the questions that have,
um,

693
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:12,870
that had been with humanity and animated
humanity and I think animated at us,

694
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,810
at us, at our best, that are
ancient and enduring or you know,

695
00:45:16,811 --> 00:45:20,680
what does it mean to be human
and how do we want to live? Um,

696
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,810
and the third question is
who will we be to each other?

697
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,680
And that question across history
has been optional in many settings.

698
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:36,340
And I think actually the technologies
you created make that question

699
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:40,230
inextricable now for,
for humans.

700
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:45,750
It inextricable from the question
of what it means to be human and,

701
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,390
and how we want to live.
Absolutely. And civility,

702
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,200
civility in my mind we're,
we're also like,

703
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,570
there's so many different
things happening at once,

704
00:45:55,571 --> 00:45:57,580
which is part of what
makes this moment dizzying.

705
00:45:57,581 --> 00:45:59,850
And we're very focused on
what's going wrong, but

706
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:06,690
there's so many ways that
we're understanding the
fullness of what it means to

707
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:08,800
be human. And, um,

708
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:14,010
understanding our bodies and our brains
in the interaction between them and also

709
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,460
in,
in our,

710
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:22,590
in culture fit fully in,

711
00:46:22,591 --> 00:46:25,780
perfectly to slowly.
But,

712
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,580
but gaining a sense of
the fullness of like,

713
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,800
you know, I wa I want, I don't, I don't,

714
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:39,090
I think these words like diversity
and tolerance are like way too small

715
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,150
inclusion like still is.

716
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,150
There's an INCIRCL but I think
we're really moving beyond us.

717
00:46:45,151 --> 00:46:49,770
We want the full array of humanity
in the room to have its place.

718
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,460
I mean we,

719
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,460
we have such a newly robust understanding
just of the matter of identity.

720
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:03,110
We are the generation that
is redefining gender. Um,

721
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,920
so I think, you know,

722
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,760
one of the things that happened with the
notion of civility that was that it was

723
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:15,780
about like these, these phrases like
we would all get on the same page,

724
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,770
right? Or the thing we do
like the democratic instinct,

725
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:22,920
well you've got some people that think
that smelled like take a vote, move on.

726
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,770
But these intimate civilizational
questions of how we're going to live,

727
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,530
we all have a stake in them.
So to me,

728
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:37,531
civility in this generation
is about knowing that we
walk into the room or ended

729
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,370
the discussion with deep,

730
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:42,820
profound differences that are
meaningful and important to us.

731
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,000
And the point is not agreeing.

732
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,700
Um,
the point is getting into relationship.

733
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,910
The point is coming to know each other
and that thing of opening up what is not

734
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:02,410
letting those things we disagree on
define what is possible between us opening

735
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:07,411
up a new space where perhaps what
we have in common are questions.

736
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,090
Absolutely.
Yeah.

737
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:13,610
And in that opening of the space that's
a bigger than the differences. Yeah.

738
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,260
It allows for all of the
questions, all of the voices. Um,

739
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:21,970
something that you were speaking with
Pico I hear about and that recent

740
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:24,700
interview was, um, how
he talked about how,

741
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,270
what was it in the
institutions of skepticism.

742
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,220
He's kind to all of these
incredibly decorated universities,

743
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,280
which he refers to as the
institutions of skepticism.

744
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,030
And he says that we learned how
to talk but not how to listen,

745
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,980
how to put ourselves forward,
but not how to actually erase ourselves.

746
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,430
And so much of that is this
the living of the listening,

747
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,180
the living of the questions.
If we do that in an artful way,

748
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,610
there really is space for all of that.

749
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,980
Whereas the way kind
of currently it works,

750
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:56,680
like maybe there isn't always space for
it because it feels like there's not

751
00:48:56,681 --> 00:49:01,420
enough space for us because all
of us isn't there. Um, but this,

752
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:03,010
this idea of seeking,

753
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:08,380
I think he also said that everything
important he lived or everything important

754
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:12,220
in his life that he's learned has come
through his heart and not for his mind.

755
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,320
And I think that's something
that we, um, you know, as,

756
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:18,160
as good souls here at Google doing,
you know,

757
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,350
what we want to do good
work for the world.

758
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,100
There's this tension between the things
that we feel and the things that we know,

759
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,980
the things we can prove and
the things that we intuit.

760
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,320
And I'm just curious as well in this,

761
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:33,490
in this listening and in the allowing
of all things for this greater sense of

762
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:36,460
stability, um, how does one navigate that,

763
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,240
navigate the, this, this space?

764
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:43,600
And I think he'd do it so beautifully
with your work because you sit with,

765
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,800
you sit in conversation
with everyone. Yeah. Um,

766
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,490
well we were going to have to innovate
some new forms for that, right?

767
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:56,950
Because we don't reward
the time or the energy

768
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,960
or the, we don't, we, you
know, we don't, yeah. We,

769
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,070
we reward what comes from the mind and
not from the heart. Unless you can cry,

770
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,280
you can pitch it as somebody they can
write. And that's what we do actually.

771
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:11,800
Cause most of it is,
you know,

772
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:15,700
all this language we've always
used about your gut, you know,

773
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,120
and now we basically learned that
what they're calling the biome,

774
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:23,980
the second brain, right. Like we've
actually known that we knew somewhere.

775
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,900
So I don't think science is our,
in being able to make a rational,

776
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,120
serious argument about this.

777
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,273
MMM.

778
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,740
But yeah, that's, and so I think right
now all of the structures we have,

779
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,353
mmm.

780
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:45,620
They're, they're inadequate. I mean, I,

781
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:50,110
and I mean that in all of our workplaces
and all of our institutions. Um,

782
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,043
they haven't,

783
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,880
they're behind on what we're learning
and actually they're behind on how

784
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:57,830
actually the world really works

785
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,190
and how change really happened.

786
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,973
MMM.

787
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,790
And on the difference between what is,
you know,

788
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:14,330
innovative and transformative
generatively transformative.

789
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:19,320
Yeah. So that's part of
the task. And there's no,

790
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,220
there's no one size fits all solution.
Like,

791
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,030
and I think that that is one of these
things where the repair is going to have

792
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:28,260
to be, everybody's starting like
very close to home. What, you know,

793
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:32,790
what you touch the immediate
people and structures around you.

794
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:36,000
How do you make space for
that to be rewarded? Yeah.

795
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,110
That's interesting. The idea of, um,

796
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:45,150
of how to reward the how
and the why. Yeah. Um,

797
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,380
if anybody has a question for Krista,
uh,

798
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,310
my question is what is your thought
behind always asking someone at the

799
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:55,510
beginning of your podcast? Yeah. Um,

800
00:51:55,890 --> 00:52:00,720
what is something from their childhood
that is spiritually important to them?

801
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:01,680
Yeah.
So,

802
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,090
so almost always as some version of
the question of what is their religion?

803
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:10,200
Was there a religious or spiritual
background, your childhood? So, uh,

804
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,010
the truth is that just about everybody
has a really interesting story there. It,

805
00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:17,400
whether it's a story of
absence or presence or
something that was good or bad,

806
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:22,350
but, but, um, the reason I, the, the,

807
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:27,240
the strategic reason I ask it is because
of where plants the question. So again,

808
00:52:27,241 --> 00:52:31,050
it's like the beginning is everything,
right? If you get the beginning right,

809
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,640
uh, you can go places and if
you don't, you're working,

810
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,180
you're always working really hard
to get it, get it on the rails.

811
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:45,030
What I,
so what I've learned about that place,

812
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:49,380
it's true of other questions about
childhood or origin. So sometimes I'm,

813
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,730
if I'm in a, like a, uh, if I'm in
a particular setting with a theme,

814
00:52:53,731 --> 00:52:55,980
I might ask,
uh,

815
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,060
let's say it's a conversation about
compassion or I don't know. And I,

816
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:02,100
I might say, can you, what,

817
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,490
can you remember the very
first time that you did that?

818
00:53:05,491 --> 00:53:09,210
That word meant something to you? Or
what, what is your memory of the earliest,

819
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,380
earliest understanding of what
you think of as compassionate?

820
00:53:13,381 --> 00:53:18,090
Now the thing about asking somebody
a question that takes them,

821
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:22,350
um, what I don't want to do is
start with the, where we all always,

822
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,380
how we present generally we in with our
credentials and what we know and what

823
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:31,530
we've done.
And it's very chin up and it's,

824
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,030
and it's performative and the, and
that's what we're asked to do. Um,

825
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:41,400
that question takes it plants people.

826
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:46,110
It's not a question that anybody feels
defensive about because I'm not asking

827
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,440
you also, and I would never ask somebody,
tell me about your spiritual life.

828
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,730
Like are you religious? I mean that
question would be designed to just,

829
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:59,250
uh, make everybody uptight, including
me. If you ask somebody that question,

830
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:04,910
it takes them to a very soft searching
place and their memory and therefore in

831
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:10,620
their body. Um, it's also interestingly,

832
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,270
as much as we think of religion
culturally as a matter of convictions and

833
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:20,130
beliefs that answers, it's a place
where beautiful questions reside.

834
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,450
And it's,

835
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:25,950
it's interesting to me how many people
when they start reflecting on that part

836
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:27,270
of their life,

837
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:31,070
it turns out that there's some question
they asked when they were four,

838
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,760
seven or nine that they end, that it ended
up influencing the rest of their life.

839
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:40,380
Like some of their life has been some
trajectory on the course of that question.

840
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,850
Um, so, so that's it. It's
where to start so that,

841
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,300
and then everything follows from there.
I can get,

842
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,540
if I can invite people to be soft and
searching right up there and then,

843
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,970
then we probably are going
to stay soft and searching.

844
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,040
Um,

845
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,550
I used to work for the wealth bank as
an economist and you talked about saving

846
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:03,990
the world and um,

847
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,780
then I moved to Silicon Valley and here
people have the same intentions and it

848
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:14,130
seems that the intentionality is right
and speaking for the world. Thank you.

849
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:16,290
Wouldn't believe that. But it's
the same. The same is true.

850
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:20,220
People truly believe in what they're
doing is doing good in the world.

851
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:24,150
So if it's not intentionality,
why did we go wrong?

852
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:28,500
Is it that we think it's intentionality
is right, but it's really not an,

853
00:55:28,501 --> 00:55:30,690
it's our ego or what is it?

854
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:34,680
Where do we go wrong and how can we
fix this that we start off with good

855
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:39,570
intentions and end up with bad
results? Right. Well that's
a good question. I mean,

856
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,410
maladies,
not everything.

857
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:45,250
I think then I would want to come
back to this discernment piece. And I,

858
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:48,580
and I do think that, um, yeah,

859
00:55:48,581 --> 00:55:50,290
the question of ego,

860
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:57,070
which is often this very often is,
you know, and of course we are,

861
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,110
our egos are part of us. It's
not you get rid of that, but, um,

862
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,070
it resides so intimately
with intentionality.

863
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,920
Um, and so I think part of, um,

864
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:14,410
spiritual life of interior of
a cultivated interior life,

865
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:20,080
um,
is to grow in knowing the difference.

866
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,440
Because if they often do feel like the
same thing and actually to grow these

867
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:30,630
other muscles around discernment and
asking the how and the why question. And,

868
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,490
and, and I mean, you know,

869
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:38,491
the scale of what the World Bank is
working with or the scale of what Silicon

870
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,320
Valley is working with is tremendous.
But

871
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,600
I do think that there's something
we're waking up to a little late,

872
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,030
um,
about how,

873
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:54,720
about how disconnected our view of the
problems and therefore the solutions is.

874
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:58,210
Right. And the, and this
is something about the post
enlightenment world. I mean, I,

875
00:56:58,211 --> 00:57:02,430
I, we, we, we, we turned, we were
fascinated with the parts, right?

876
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:06,240
And then we created this world of parts.
So in every discipline,

877
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:08,830
there's this challenge in medicine,
there's this challenge. We, you know,

878
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:11,130
we have specialists for
every part of your body.

879
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:14,190
And we didn't learn how to see the
whole and all the interactions.

880
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:19,050
And there's a corollary to that in
everything we do in, in the economy,

881
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:24,480
in politics, um, in social policies. And,

882
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,900
um, so in some ways,
like this is kind of a,

883
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,840
this is kind of a civilizational,
uh, muscle of discernment, right?

884
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:38,841
Like we actually have to start to think
outside the frames that we inherited,

885
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,630
um,
and see in a new way

886
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,760
that I think I,
you know,

887
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:51,820
another piece of language that's really
important to me now is thinking about

888
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:55,240
having, not just imagination,
but moral imagination.

889
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,540
MMM.
MMM.

890
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:01,270
Yeah. And then again, like discernment.

891
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,320
Yeah.

892
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,480
Is there's, there's no prescription.
It's going to be different in every,

893
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,600
in every setting.
But I think,

894
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:13,870
I think there are muscles we can build
up and also ways we can help hold each

895
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:18,460
other accountable. So in my role here, my,

896
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:23,461
I served the manager and leader
community and my intention and goal is to

897
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:25,270
support them through,
um,

898
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,900
actually through asking them
questions rather what community,

899
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,040
the community of leaders
at Google. Okay. And, um,

900
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:38,041
so I'm always on the lookout for really
solid questions and of course your full

901
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:40,620
of them. Both of you are, and I,

902
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:45,060
it's obviously very difficult time to
be a leader here or anywhere, but I'm,

903
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:46,630
I'm seeing,
uh,

904
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:51,660
leaders struggle with how to listen to
questions that are sometimes just they're

905
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,070
so loaded,
right?

906
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,670
And the leaders don't have the answers
necessarily and they're not necessarily

907
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:02,110
responsible for the causes and they have
their own questions about what's going

908
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:05,950
on and the struggles. So,
um, my question for you is,

909
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:10,390
what advice potentially in the form
of some questions do you have for our

910
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:14,380
leaders to, for how to
listen, respond, be with,

911
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:19,510
with what's being asked of them right
now? Yeah, you're right. I mean,

912
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:22,700
I think when you're talking about loaded
questions then are not really questions

913
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:25,370
right there. Their arguments
that are presented as question,

914
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:31,010
I mean that just feels, feels like a huge
responsibility to answer that question.

915
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:32,810
I, I, I do,

916
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,920
I do think that

917
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:44,250
what the world needs leaders
in this sphere to be asking is

918
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,940
how will we shape,
um,

919
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:55,100
these technologies to,
to human purpose,

920
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,880
um, to be, to be good
for us. And, and if, if,

921
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:03,170
if I say audaciously that,
that these,

922
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:06,500
these are the tool you
have created the tools to,

923
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:08,893
um,

924
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:14,280
whereby we could just start to
think and to act as a species and,

925
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,930
and we must, if we're going to
tackle something like climate change,

926
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,930
just to name one of our big challenges,

927
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:24,140
but perhaps the one that
had the ultimate one, um,

928
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:31,130
how can that, I mean, how to rap like,
I don't want to say it as a problem.

929
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:33,740
Like how to rise to that challenge.

930
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:37,250
Let me take that on as a design question.

931
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,690
Um,
disrupt our,

932
01:00:42,691 --> 01:00:44,280
all the compartmentalization,

933
01:00:44,281 --> 01:00:48,930
disrupt all these barriers and walls
between all the different disciplines.

934
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:53,250
We need to be talking to each other to
wrap our arms around some of these big

935
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,233
challenges.

936
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,030
I think I'd add to that as well
cause I just wholeheartedly agree,

937
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:01,043
um,

938
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:06,320
is we tend to think very fast and we tend
to be very reactive because there's so

939
01:01:07,981 --> 01:01:10,620
much at stake and it's all happening
right now and there's a lot of them,

940
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,420
you know,
to kind of say the steak thing,

941
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,530
there's so much on the
line and really this, the,

942
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,050
the listening aspect of silence aspect,

943
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:23,490
the patient's aspect of this I think is
how do we know there are things about

944
01:01:23,491 --> 01:01:25,830
humanity that will never change.
They are,

945
01:01:25,831 --> 01:01:28,530
the things that are wired
inside of us are always be true.

946
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:33,830
How do we think is a slow as we can to
the things that never change because

947
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,270
that's where the real responses will come.

948
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,130
The fast answers are so challenging and
loaded as loaded as the questions and is

949
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:42,750
dangerous for individuals too.

950
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:47,010
There's just so much going on in that
moment when really when we stop and think

951
01:01:47,011 --> 01:01:51,270
about the way that we are as people and
the way that we are as people together

952
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:55,140
and what it means to live in a particular
way that we can all be proud of.

953
01:01:55,141 --> 01:01:59,910
And it feels like it is
about human flourishing and
civility and the space that

954
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:04,530
includes all of us. Um, those are harder
questions. Those are feeling questions.

955
01:02:04,531 --> 01:02:07,620
We're not all necessarily in the
practice of that. Even personally.

956
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:12,090
Just encouraging and having those
conversations here, making space for that.

957
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,680
That's the beginning of all of it.

958
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:18,480
So I thank you for doing your
work and for asking the questions,

959
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,210
you know, somebody else
or might say is, um,

960
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,320
given that like,

961
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,600
I don't think anybody who started any of
these companies want it to be changing

962
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:33,900
human nature,
like interwoven into people's bodies,

963
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,890
brains and psyches, right? I mean,
that's not what anybody set out to do,

964
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:41,700
but that's what's happened.
Um,

965
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,620
a lot of the,

966
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:48,040
the terrible reckonings we're having now,

967
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:51,670
even around things that we thought
we'd make great progress on socially,

968
01:02:51,671 --> 01:02:55,180
like racial dynamics and,
and,

969
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,850
and gender dynamics.
You know,

970
01:02:57,851 --> 01:03:02,851
50 years ago there were beautiful
movements and a lot of laws changed and we

971
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:08,320
kind of came into the 21st century
thinking we, you know, we cracked this,

972
01:03:08,321 --> 01:03:12,280
we can keep getting better at it,
but we basically did this and we hadn't.

973
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:17,950
And one way I analyze that is that we,
you know,

974
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:21,730
we have this idea that like if
you, you know, if you know history,

975
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:22,690
it won't repeat itself,

976
01:03:22,691 --> 01:03:26,080
but the truth is actually that history
always repeats itself until you know

977
01:03:26,081 --> 01:03:28,420
yourself.
And,

978
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:33,630
and we changed laws but we
didn't change ourselves.

979
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:39,370
And now again, with science as our
companion, we learn about implicit bias,

980
01:03:39,371 --> 01:03:39,730
right?

981
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:44,440
Like we learn how our brains were
hardwares and we didn't know how to affect

982
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:46,810
that.
The beautiful thing.

983
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,170
So it's terrible to wake up to the
fact that we were so much farther,

984
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,120
less farther along than we,
than we thought.

985
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:56,020
But the beautiful thing is we actually
now, no, we have not knowledge.

986
01:03:56,021 --> 01:03:57,160
That can be a form of power.

987
01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:02,370
And you are working in a sphere that
is actively engaging our brains,

988
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:07,270
right? Actively involved in our inner
lives as well as our outer lines.

989
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:12,220
Um, so again, I would say take
that as a creative challenge,

990
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:17,020
a generative challenge, and
it's uncomfortable, right?

991
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:19,900
I know it's not what anybody wanted,
but there it is.

992
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:24,580
I'm going to sneak a question in between
you and Peter who will be our last

993
01:04:24,581 --> 01:04:26,050
question.
Um,

994
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:31,570
one of the things that's come up a
few times here is like the poetry art,

995
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:34,000
the space of the heart,
the wisdom traditions.

996
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:38,950
These are things that I think live very
much in the spirits of many people that

997
01:04:38,951 --> 01:04:41,050
are in all of these places.
Um,

998
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:45,340
what do you think that we all have to
learn from those traditions explicitly?

999
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:49,510
Not necessarily in our own homes
and the doors of our heart.

1000
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,180
That's where it all begins.
But what do the wisdom traditions,

1001
01:04:52,181 --> 01:04:56,860
what do all of these ancient
human languages of our souls? Um,

1002
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,970
ha ha. What place do they have in
this space? How can we invite them in?

1003
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,860
We'll there potentially or they're just,
they're there.

1004
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:06,970
This is the part of the
human enterprise where we,

1005
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:12,960
where we tried to think about what
our soul is and what our heart is and,

1006
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,960
and actually what the fullness
of argument consists there.

1007
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:19,720
Also the parts of the human enterprise
where we were actually honest about how

1008
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:22,330
complicated and messy we are,
right?

1009
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:26,350
Like are the technocratic 20th century
wanted to think that we could just

1010
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:30,370
bracket those things out and you could
check your personal life at the door and

1011
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:31,481
you know,

1012
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:36,481
we wouldn't bring messy things into the
public sphere and it didn't work that

1013
01:05:37,871 --> 01:05:42,670
way. Um, and now all of that, you
know, now we're in this moment,

1014
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:47,710
I think this has something to do also
with technology and the just how rapidly

1015
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:48,700
things have shifted,

1016
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:54,600
that everything that we have been
thinking was such a rational discipline,

1017
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:58,840
our politics,
our economics data,

1018
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:04,150
these are just the thinnest of
veneers over the human drama.

1019
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,700
And again, it's really messy and
uncomfortable to say, oh my God,

1020
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:10,690
that's what we have to do.

1021
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:15,691
But I actually think that we have to
address in order to do all the other work.

1022
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:20,590
And these are the parts of the
human enterprise where that has been

1023
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:23,500
investigated. And we're, again,

1024
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:28,501
spiritual technologies have been
developed and that's there for us.

1025
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:30,910
Whatever, you know, there,

1026
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,640
there are these great institutions
which came out of that.

1027
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:37,600
There's the history of religion,
but that's not all it is.

1028
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,310
I love how in, um, in
your book he's habit. Um,

1029
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,510
it was comforting to you as you spoke to
all of these kinds of great scientists

1030
01:06:46,511 --> 01:06:51,430
in minds to know that everyone is equally
as like are basically the black holes

1031
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:56,431
are easy and humans and
the human condition is
perplexing and astrophysicists

1032
01:06:56,981 --> 01:07:00,980
will tell you that are nothing
they're working with. Um,

1033
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,360
no black hole is as complex
as any living organism,

1034
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:08,440
not just human beings that
love that. Yeah. Peter,

1035
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:10,030
when I take us home,

1036
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:15,750
thank you so much for sharing and being
generous with your wisdom experience.

1037
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:20,570
There's so much what you said.
I'm a, I'm a disciple of, um,

1038
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:26,250
uh, actually strategy to look at how we
can use the lens of empathy and emotional

1039
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:30,580
intelligence and behavioral science to
help guide perhaps a better future. Um,

1040
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,590
but on that note, like there's the things
you're saying like repair versus safe,

1041
01:07:34,591 --> 01:07:36,150
which I thought was
wonderful because that's it.

1042
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:41,580
It's a admission that we were
responsible and you have to admit that to

1043
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:42,870
participate in the healing.

1044
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,500
So I think the stuff that you're giving
us and partying us is really going to

1045
01:07:48,871 --> 01:07:53,460
help us. Um, I asked, I
wants to ask because um,

1046
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:58,700
you have in your own sense the mastery
of listening and interviewing and you say

1047
01:08:00,841 --> 01:08:05,250
you prepare and you do the ritual
of being a spendable and, and um,

1048
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:09,150
vulnerability. All of these
things are very to your point,

1049
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,080
dynamic study in gender, uh, uh,

1050
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:15,730
reciprocal of vulnerability
and generosity. Um,

1051
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:21,450
but when you prepare, like you, you
kind of stopped the person, right?

1052
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:24,350
And so you,
you come and,

1053
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,330
and then you say you're creating an
atmosphere of, uh, a safe place. Yeah.

1054
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:34,400
And it's interesting cause I'm curious
about the correlation with things like

1055
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:39,401
trust and how what you believe in
genders trust and what you believe are

1056
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,150
actually builds rapport.

1057
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,730
What are the human things that
you've found that the report,

1058
01:08:43,731 --> 01:08:47,750
because Google knows stuff about
you. In our next session. Yeah.

1059
01:08:47,751 --> 01:08:50,630
So why aren't you creepy essentially?

1060
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,420
And what makes your art form of
Rapport Building essentially?

1061
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,160
I'm curious.
Okay.

1062
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:00,130
So interesting. Well, yeah, and I have,
I have actually thought about, um,

1063
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:06,470
how the Internet has changed the work I
do because actually when I first started

1064
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:09,780
15 years ago,
I was spending a lot of time in libraries,

1065
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,120
just like public libraries.
Um, and honestly,

1066
01:09:15,121 --> 01:09:18,300
I don't know how else I was
finding things. So it was possible.

1067
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:19,590
But of course now it's just,

1068
01:09:19,591 --> 01:09:22,650
there's an abundance of
information on anybody as you say.

1069
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,670
And I can also find things
which is sometimes find like
I can find things people

1070
01:09:26,671 --> 01:09:29,580
said 20 years ago that they
totally forgot that they said.

1071
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:33,510
And that is a really great moment in an
interview where you kind of take them to

1072
01:09:33,511 --> 01:09:37,230
a place in themselves they haven't
been for a while. Yeah. Yeah.

1073
01:09:37,231 --> 01:09:40,320
Why does it not feel like stalking?
Because it's appreciative.

1074
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:43,500
It's appreciative and um,

1075
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,450
such an interesting question.
I mean,

1076
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:58,010
people often say or sometimes say
after our interviews that they,

1077
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:06,720
that death, that it was kind of like
a, gave them a gift of themselves.

1078
01:10:06,721 --> 01:10:11,721
Like I gave them an opportunity to say
things they never even said to themselves

1079
01:10:12,901 --> 01:10:15,600
before. And I, and I, that I do that by,

1080
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:21,340
by being, by knowing so well
kind of how they think and uh,

1081
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,970
and honoring that,

1082
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:27,830
that then we can start in a really
deep place and go from there.

1083
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:30,510
I think the,

1084
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:35,170
maybe the honoring word is
important and that deep,

1085
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:40,380
that deep place that you hold for them
to return to and share and open up

1086
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:41,651
themselves.

1087
01:10:41,651 --> 01:10:46,570
I think that that human
quality of creating that space,

1088
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,730
that genuine curiosity,

1089
01:10:48,731 --> 01:10:53,731
that that authentic moment that's
being created out of hospitality,

1090
01:10:54,341 --> 01:10:56,050
like she said it,

1091
01:10:56,350 --> 01:11:00,520
it would be curious to see what changes
when those values come alive in the

1092
01:11:00,521 --> 01:11:03,070
space with technology.
Yeah.

1093
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,020
So we will see that is all of our work
to share here today. Thank you so much.

1094
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:08,790
Thank you.
