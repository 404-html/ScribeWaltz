1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,500
Thanks.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,600
Thanks very much.
And thanks for inviting me.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,520
I should say I'm no longer the chief has
story and although I still do some work

4
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:19,040
with the Foreign Office,
but that is a bit relevant.

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,830
So I'm just going to say a little bit
about where I'm coming from on this before

6
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:24,890
I talk about the subject of the book.
Um,

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,950
the Foreign Office these days is the only
major department to state that employs

8
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:32,390
a Kadra professional historians within it.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,300
And other departments used to have them,
but they didn't have them anymore,

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,070
which some of it I'm so sorry about.
And the historians have two main roles.

11
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:41,870
One is to publish a series of books,

12
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:44,420
which are the official history
of British foreign policy,

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,920
but the other is something called
historical advice to ministers and senior

14
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:53,540
officials. Now that can be absolutely
anything. It can be a very small thing.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,200
Like I'm in this to wanting a
joke for a speech. Not very often.

16
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:58,930
They're not usually very funny.
Um,

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,240
or else they think they can make their
own jokes, which is very dangerous,

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,260
but it can be major pieces of research.

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,510
And really the the principal role of
the historian says that when there is a

20
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:16,460
current policy issue that has some kind
of historical controversy behind it and

21
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:19,490
there are an awful lot of
those as you would appreciate.

22
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,940
That's when the historians come in.
Now,

23
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,460
I joined the phone office at very,
very,

24
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:30,461
very long time ago and even when I
joined there's an obvious letter was all

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:30,980
ready.

26
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,980
One of those things that kept coming back
and kept coming back and because it's

27
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:39,320
one of those things that a
lot of people have heard of,

28
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:41,570
but very few people know what it is.

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,960
I'm going to just say a little bit about
it in a moment to just finish my own

30
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:51,350
social did a bio graphical bit while
I was working as chief historian,

31
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,360
I got more and more drawn
into intelligence history
and that's not really what I

32
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:59,270
special that was in various aspects of it.

33
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:04,270
So obviously isn't over yet is an
intelligence story though these days it's

34
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:08,110
better known as what they call a
classic case of disinformation,

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,900
which is something that I hope it's of
interest to all of you here in the sorts

36
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:16,250
of business who are in. So, um, let me
say a little bit about the lecture itself.

37
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:16,820
Now,

38
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,820
this document was the letter supposedly
written by a man called [inaudible] who

39
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:27,371
was the head of the Bolshevik propaganda
organization in Soviet Russia after the

40
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,480
revolution in 1917.
Uh,

41
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,890
and it was written to the
British Communist Party,

42
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,520
basically telling them to up their
game a bit in kind of agitation, uh,

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,800
and to lobby on behalf of a
treaty which had been negotiated,

44
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,180
which would mean a for Soviet Union.

45
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,890
We don't need to go into
too much detail here,

46
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:53,000
but the point about this latter is it
normally if it was always sending letters

47
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,210
to communist parties all over the world,
um,

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,800
exhorting them to greater
revolutionary fervor.

49
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,320
I said there's nothing particularly
special about the APP. What makes it,

50
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:05,890
this is an you have letter of
special is when it arrived,

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,110
which is in 1924 or nine,

52
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:13,111
1924 saw the first ever Labour government
in London took office in January,

53
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,090
1924. Uh, one of the first things it
did was to recognize the Soviet Union.

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,170
There you are as opposed
to de facto said it was a,

55
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,180
it was a big deal for the Soviet Union
to have official recognition and then the

56
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:32,470
government among other things was involved
in negotiating these treaties with

57
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,250
Russia,

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,250
which by the summer of 1924 had been
signed in draft but had not yet gone

59
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,680
through parliament.
Now the,

60
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,130
the traditional ruling parties
or Britain at the time,

61
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:48,280
the Conservatives and the
liberals on the other side,

62
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,490
they both thought it would be a good
idea to let labor take office for a while

63
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:57,160
and basically bugger things up.
Perhaps I shouldn't say that on Youtube.

64
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm sure I can. Um, so that they could
show that they were unfit to Gavin.

65
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,050
Actually, they done far
better than anybody expected.

66
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,510
And by the summer of 1920 fourth,

67
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:10,110
both the other parties were getting
a bit restive and everything.

68
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:13,720
It was about time to get rid of
them and there was a scandal, uh,

69
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,680
which involved a threat to prosecutor,
a certain writer,

70
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:18,760
and then they withdrew it.
I mean,

71
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,900
we won't go into all of that
when we can talk about stuff.

72
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,930
It was essentially during the summer
of 1924 the evidence suggest that the

73
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:31,870
Russians were not sending inflammatory
letters because they didn't want the

74
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,240
Labor government to fall.
However,

75
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,830
the Labor government
did resign in October,

76
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,210
the beginning of October, 1924 over a
vote, losing a vote of no confidence.

77
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,830
So you're going to have
a general election.

78
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,610
It's at this point that
the letter arrives.

79
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,830
Now I should point out that one of the
disinformation factors in this whole

80
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:58,831
story is that nobody has ever seen
what you might call an original of this

81
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,274
document.

82
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,460
There's no letter in any paper for the
only text we really have is a text that

83
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:12,631
was sent in a telegram from the Secret
Intelligence Services Station in Riga in

84
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:18,901
Latvia to secret intelligence
headquarters in London at the beginning of

85
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:21,180
October,

86
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,570
1924 and although a lot of
people afterwards claiming
to have alternative texts,

87
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,870
the evidence all indicates that they are
all read translations of that original

88
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,770
telegram. Uh, as, as a complicated story,
we don't need to have all the details,

89
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,170
but the point is when it arrived,

90
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,870
the government resigns and that
the, uh, the wraps and Mcdonald,

91
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:47,830
the prime minister asked the king to
dissolve parliament and corn elections who

92
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,220
called an election on the 8th of October,

93
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,930
1924 on the 9th of October.

94
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,380
This telegram comes in to the
secret intelligence service,

95
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:59,150
which is what book you now
might think of as they're,

96
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,800
my sex was called at that time. And my
sex is the second world war termination.

97
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:08,600
But it's sis is what it was in
the usual way of these things.

98
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,250
Any kind of report that it was taught,
it was taught entailed.

99
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,350
It was the,

100
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,110
the things that could identify it as an
intelligence report where it moved from

101
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,430
it and then it was circulated to the
Foreign Office and to certain other white

102
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,360
taught apartments.

103
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,020
At the same time rumors began circulating
in London that there was some kind of

104
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,090
inflammatory document around,
nobody quite knew what it was.

105
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,960
Certain people started claiming there.
Got It even though they didn't have it,

106
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,180
but essentially it one way or another
it was leaked to the press a bit to the

107
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:47,420
right wing press in particularly
and to conservative central office.

108
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,150
So that during the
general election campaign,

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,300
the whole letter,
uh,

110
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,150
became a big labor bashing instrument.

111
00:06:56,151 --> 00:07:01,100
And the reason for that was that the right
wing interest claimed that the letter

112
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:06,101
showed clearly that Labour was in thrall
to the reds in Moscow and that they

113
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:09,530
could not be trusted.
And therefore, uh, now,

114
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,780
so all through the campaign,

115
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,610
there are rumors about this letter and
it was eventually published by the Daily

116
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,240
Mail. Who else one might
say on the 25th of October,

117
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,260
the election was taking place on the 29th.
Now,

118
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:27,620
there are all sorts of
complicating factors in this.

119
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:32,450
One of which is the official
response to the letter. As I said,

120
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,820
it's an obvious, I've sent lots
of documents like this and that.

121
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,420
First nobody seemed to pay
too much attention to it.

122
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,600
They didn't think it was
different to anything else,

123
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,980
but then they started to worry about it
in the foreign office because partly of

124
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:49,040
there being a general election campaign
and because they felt it was so

125
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,903
outrageous,

126
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,800
there had to be some kind of official
response because if the letter where to

127
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:59,480
believed and spread around and it looked
as if they hadn't done anything about

128
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,670
it,
that would look reflect badly.

129
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,980
So our response was drafted in
the Foreign Office and the draft,

130
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,220
sorry, follow me on this cause
this, this bit of it is important.

131
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:15,221
That slightly obscure the draft note of
protest from Britain to Soviet Russia

132
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,300
was sent from the
Foreign Office two ramps.

133
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:23,330
We Mcdonald who was both foreign secretary
and prime minister at this point.

134
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,980
He's in Wales campaigning
for the general election.

135
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:32,630
So he's not in London. He's actually
by himself. It's not like it is today.

136
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:36,740
He was on his own with just a typist, no
advisors, no secretaries know nothing.

137
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,600
He gets the draft,

138
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,950
he amends it quite extensively and he
sends it back to the Foreign Office.

139
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,620
At this point,
the permanent under secretary,

140
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:48,080
which is the top official
in the Foreign Office,

141
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,350
decides that the amended version must
be what Mcdonald really wants to send,

142
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,080
and he gives that version to the press
and he also gives the text of it does not

143
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:04,851
have left it to the press so that they
are both published on that fateful 25th

144
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,031
of October.
Now,

145
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:10,710
McDonald claimed that he had lots of tall
intended that his amended draft should

146
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,690
be sent out and published.

147
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,770
He wanted it to come back again so
that he could sign off on the revision.

148
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,570
This has never been satisfactory because
later on there are some documents

149
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,390
missing from the file.

150
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,740
Good old stories and mystery stories says
that it's impossible to be absolutely

151
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,600
sure,
but whatever happened,

152
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,910
it's not actually the content of this
document. It's what was done with it,

153
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,090
which makes it important
and which qualifies it as a
a disinformation document.

154
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:48,120
Now the difficulty is you can say,
okay, is this information, but by whom,

155
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,330
against whom and for what purpose is
much more difficult gauge because it very

156
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:58,530
soon began to be suspected that this
document was not actually from synovium at

157
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:03,130
all, that it had been forged.
Some people said Labor,

158
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,340
the believer party
having lost the election,

159
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,700
although this didn't lose the election
for them, that they lost the election.

160
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,490
They then accused the,

161
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,480
when everybody really the
Conservative Party civil service,

162
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:19,950
the intelligence services, everybody
they regarded as the establishment,

163
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,010
they accused them of concocting this
document in order to damage Labor's

164
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,950
prospects in the campaign then,

165
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,880
but the question is who did actually
forge it and we still absolute,

166
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:37,140
you don't have a definitive answer there.
There are lots of possible candidates,

167
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,430
indeed it could conceivably have
been concocted in this country.

168
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,320
That is less likely I think, but there
are very many different constituencies,

169
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:51,150
all of whom had an interest in causing
trouble in the British political

170
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,690
establishment or indeed
causing trouble in Moscow.

171
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,470
Because it is possible that even if so,
Navea didn't write it,

172
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,280
it might've been forged, um, as part of a,

173
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,110
at in trouble Shimik power
struggle because at this
point we knew that starling

174
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,950
was trying to discredits and
IVF who was one of his rivals.

175
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,010
And so there's a possibility that it
was actually done to disrupt Bolshevik

176
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,003
politics.

177
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,200
It may have been forged by what
we call white Russian interests.

178
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:26,100
That is the people who were against
the Bolsheviks, but who were Russians,

179
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,740
a lot of whom were in exile and
in Germany or in France, uh,

180
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,370
and in the Baltic states,

181
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,850
busily intriguing and trying to get
rid of the Bolshevik regime in Russia.

182
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,533
And then of course,

183
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,650
you've got the whole convoluted
state of British politics as well.

184
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,980
So everybody was accusing everybody else
without ever being able to quite get to

185
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:50,154
the bottom of it.

186
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,130
But it became known as a
political dirty tricks, uh,

187
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,150
example that was raised in
successive elections time after time.

188
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,751
In fact,

189
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:06,220
there isn't a decade since the light to
twenties when there's an Avia of letter

190
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,240
has not been raised in the media or in
politics or in the course of an election

191
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,710
in 2017 during the election campaign
in 2017 you may remember there were all

192
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:23,551
kinds of things in the press about how
some remarks made by European Commission

193
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:28,621
officials might've been deliberately
placed in water to interfere with the

194
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:33,320
electoral process. I mean, you know, uh,

195
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,740
it was just like there's
an Avia have led to this.

196
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,930
It's one of those things
that people bring up.

197
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,470
The real truth of it is very difficult
to ascertain because you know,

198
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:49,220
it is a very long time ago now. I came
into this story. Well, it, as I said,

199
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,650
when I joined the Foreign Office,
it was already one of those countries,

200
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:53,260
cities that never quite went to bed.

201
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,190
But then in the 1990s when
the Labor government came in,

202
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:01,450
when the Blair government came in,
uh, it came up again with a vengeance.

203
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,770
And in 1998 a book was published.

204
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,510
This book was written by Nigel West,
which is the pen name of a,

205
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:11,860
a former Tory MP,

206
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:16,260
Rupert Talison and a former
KGB colonel called Alexander.

207
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,330
Off this book was called the crown jewels.

208
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,660
And the crown jewels was the codename
for information given to the Russians by

209
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,280
the so called Cambridge spies,
you know,

210
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:29,500
Philby Burgess and Clayton
and lunch and so on.

211
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,310
And this book purported to have all sorts
of stories about British history based

212
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:40,591
on that information that was
held in Russia having been
transmitted by traitors.

213
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,820
There was a chapter in this book
on the [inaudible] of letter,

214
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,270
which said it had definitely been
written by a man called per Croskey,

215
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,810
Yvan Procroft Ski, who was
a former Cyrus officer. Uh,

216
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,610
the, the book caused quite
a stir in this country.

217
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,860
There were questions in parliament on
the lines of why do we have to read about

218
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,920
our history on the basis of what traitors
have given to Russia and the Foreign

219
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,800
Secretary who was then Robin Cook.
At first,

220
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:18,730
he was absolutely astonished that anybody
could get exercised about something

221
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:23,731
that had happened in 1924 but then you
soon realized that in the Labour party

222
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:28,510
there's an obvious letter was still
very much a sore point and a hot issue.

223
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,690
And so he ordered an investigation.

224
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,760
Now the complicating factor of course is
that the real evidence on all this lies

225
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:40,690
in the archives of the UKS
intelligence agencies. Um,

226
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,670
and in particularly in sis archives
which are not open to the public.

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,650
And this is how I came into it because
he stood up in the House of Commons over

228
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:51,484
my,

229
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,980
there have been a number of occasions
when a minister has stood up in parliament

230
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:59,360
and said, I have ordered
investigation from my historians.

231
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:02,460
They never tell you this beforehand.
You just find out afterwards,

232
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,100
however he said precisely this.
And so my role was,

233
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:09,740
cause I have privileged
access to these archives,

234
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,620
was to go in and to try
and find out the truth.

235
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,450
He still didn't really believe that
anybody could be terribly exercise to pass

236
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,590
something that happened so long ago.
But he was sitting disabused of that.

237
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,030
And when the official report at the end
of my investigation was published in

238
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:27,170
1999,

239
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,660
there were lots of messages that came in
to the Foreign Office saying that their

240
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:36,200
relations or somebody had been
involved in it all. They all wasn't it.

241
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,310
There was one particular guy who was
a very, uh, if you do read this book,

242
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,340
there's a very strange guy called Donald
in Thorne who despite his name was

243
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:49,100
actually British conservative.
Uh,

244
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,190
his son got in touch with me after the
report was published to say my father

245
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:57,140
wouldn't never have been
involved in anything like this.

246
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,940
His grandson who was living in Italy
at the time sent me a fax saying,

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,340
I always knew my grandfather
was involved in this. So,

248
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,750
so even Robin Kolbe was convinced that
you can't quite put this knob here of

249
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,730
data to bed. Now we didn't manage to
get to the bottom. Everything could.

250
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:20,540
I did go to Moscow as part of this
investigation, which was very interesting.

251
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:25,541
This was actually in the fairly brief
ish period between the end of the Cold

252
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:25,670
War.

253
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,080
And when things didn't go quite so well
when actually relations with Russia were

254
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:35,030
pretty good. Uh, they cooperated in, in
our investigations and they were very,

255
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,240
uh, very helpful to me. And so, you know,

256
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,350
it was all absolutely fine at the time
because they have an interest too.

257
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,530
And you are often, you
know, ever since I did this,

258
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,930
I keep an alert on my name on Google,
on hold. You'll be glad to know part,

259
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,180
not just to be being Darrious I showed
you because you get particularly ration

260
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,260
websites saying,
Jill Bennett has said x or y.

261
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,380
I mean, I never have, and there's
nothing I can do about it,

262
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,950
but I like to know that somebody said it,
if you see what I mean,

263
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:09,360
because you never know when you're
going to be ambushed. It's part,

264
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,730
it's just kind of the fixture. And it's
partly to do with this particular story,

265
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:18,170
which remains inflammatory
nearly a hundred years later.

266
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,600
There has,

267
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,710
there were definite accusations that
the British intelligence community were

268
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,570
involved in this whole thing.
And that indeed they concocted the letter.

269
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:33,350
I think the idea of them concocting
their letter is unlikely.

270
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I think it's entirely possible
that some members of the sis,

271
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,520
including a man called Desmond Morton,

272
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:44,730
whom I also wrote a book about who
was a very, very secret squirrel, um,

273
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:50,050
that he knew this letter was forged a
and he and certain other people in the

274
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:55,380
told you this community what absolutely
have no time for the Labour party smooth

275
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:57,450
just on its way into the public domain,
shall we say.

276
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,160
And we're not displeased at
the way it was used, but it is,

277
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,590
it is certainly a case
of just information.

278
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:08,640
It was smearing the Labour party in a
way that was unfair because actually they

279
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:12,360
were absolutely not in thrall.
They were very anticommunist. Uh,

280
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:16,370
they will not in thrall to Moscow,
but of course, even in the 1920s,

281
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,240
and this is actually one
of the contemporary lessons
of this episode today.

282
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,860
Everybody talks now about disinformation,
fake news, whatever you want to call it,

283
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,240
going around the world in seconds
because of the Internet and digital

284
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,910
communications generally.
Of course that's true.

285
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,360
But even in the 1920s as story could get
around pretty damn quickly and it only

286
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:45,051
had to be mentioned in the press and
it had legs and those legs could run an

287
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,250
offer on way.
So it's not,

288
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,580
there's no kind of enormous change it and
how you might deal with disinformation

289
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,660
is not that different.
Um,

290
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,040
the kind of techniques that were developed
at the time to try and how do you

291
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:02,910
counter this?

292
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,180
How do you look at stories which you
think might be false and the techniques

293
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:13,110
that are used in the
intelligence services. First
of all, you look at the source,

294
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,700
what do you think the source was, but also
you tried to look at intent, you know,

295
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:22,701
in the military parlance capability
plus intent equals threat.

296
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,953
If you,
you know,

297
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,800
look at where your think the story
is coming from and what interest,

298
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,950
whoever it is you think it might be,
might have.

299
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,220
And that does help a to try and identify
this information and be to try and

300
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:41,370
think how you might be able to respond
to it. And actually they perhaps didn't,

301
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,920
we certainly didn't use
those terms in the 1920s,

302
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:47,600
but there were people who were
trying to do that. Then, um,

303
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,650
I just want to mention one,

304
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,710
particularly a tricky character and all
the story who illustrates the kind of

305
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:59,550
problems that they were faced. There
is a man called Vladimir all off. Now,

306
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,580
all of how the distinction of having
worked in the Cyrus to see police in the

307
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:10,191
Bolshevik secret police and then for
white trashing organizations in exile,

308
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,670
he set up a forgery bureau in Berlin in
the 1920s he was given accomodation and

309
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:21,420
facilities by German intelligence.

310
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,160
He was paid money by French intelligence,
by SIS,

311
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,050
by Red Russians,
and by white trash bins.

312
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,600
And he and his colleagues
manufactured documents to order.

313
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,730
It doesn't mean they were all
absolutely false, but they were expert.

314
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,470
And so trying to find out whether a
document like there's an Avia of letter

315
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,400
really was true. It was almost
impossible because after all,

316
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,170
you know, Bolshevik Rachios is routed
in, in a, it's my secret state.

317
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:57,940
They're not going to tell you much about
it and it's an Avia abs own reaction to

318
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,280
it was why I didn't
actually write that one,

319
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:03,070
but then somebody put it in front of me,
I would have signed it.

320
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,570
It was not terribly reassuring.

321
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,660
Wedding Orloff characters like all
off and he was not the only one.

322
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,420
Make the whole story pretty tricky and
make it difficult to really get to the

323
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:20,050
bottom of this and all through
the decades it comes up,

324
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:24,340
as I said in general elections,
it came up during a Labour government,

325
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:28,750
Harold Wilson's two governments when
of course Harold Wilson already rather

326
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:32,680
paranoid about the activities
of the intelligence agencies.

327
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,430
You know in the background of
labor is Nothi of letter is,

328
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,740
it's very much something
to come to you with.

329
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,430
As I was just saying to one of you
beforehand, Jack Straw, foreign secretary,

330
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,850
former foreign secretary with whom I
work quite closely when he was there,

331
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,110
he says it's an OBF letter
is mother's milk to him.

332
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,320
His father who had been a plumber and who
was a labor activist and a trade union

333
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,140
is his father had taught him about the
an you have letter when he was a little

334
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:01,983
boy,

335
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,340
as a classic example of the kind of
things that the establishment does to do

336
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:10,450
labor down. Well, you know, he's not
the only one who takes that view.

337
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,830
Another factor, the fact, I'll
stop for a moment for questions,

338
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:18,940
but another person I need to bring
you to this story is Kim Philby,

339
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,960
who I'm sure you all know about it.
Of course he's one of the Cambridge spies,

340
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,260
but there was a major investigation across
my tall investigation in the 60s that

341
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:34,900
was done, um, as a direct result
of the defection of Philby. Now,

342
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,700
Philby of course, had been suspected
in the 50s and indeed left eye size,

343
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:42,550
but he'd been exonerated.
He bluffed it out.

344
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:47,551
Essentially they couldn't get the
evidence and sis kept on defending him and

345
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,590
saying they were sure
he was not a traitor.

346
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,130
So that when he did
actually defect in 1963,

347
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,670
it was an enormous shock and normal
shop to the whole of the intelligence

348
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:02,320
establishment. And they got together the
different agencies and they said, look,

349
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,210
if this can have happened and we
didn't know what else might there be.

350
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,810
So they formed a committee to try and go
back through the history of operations

351
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,620
of the intelligence services,

352
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,630
to look at other cases where there
might've been disinformation,

353
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,800
uh, you know, something trip
treachery that they have not detected.

354
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,250
And one of the cases they looked at
was this is an awfully of letter.

355
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,880
And they commissioned a formidable
lady called Millicent Baggott,

356
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,540
who just retired from her,
my five to run this, uh,

357
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,430
inter into departmental
organization and inquiry.

358
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:43,450
And she did very much what Jairus
to do. 30 years later, she went,

359
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,610
looked in all the intelligence
archives and so on.

360
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,900
But of course in the 1960
is you couldn't admit that,

361
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,320
am I six or am I five or
GCHQ actually existed.

362
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,010
They were not yet on the legislative 14.
They hadn't been allowed.

363
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,440
You weren't allowed to talk about,

364
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,570
you weren't allowed to release a document
that referred to any of the agencies

365
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:11,450
by name or that indeed
referred to their activities.

366
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,660
So everything that she did was under
wraps and indeed her report has never been

367
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:17,331
published.

368
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:21,770
Although I was lucky enough to be able to
draw on it extensively when I came out.

369
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,610
Now the camp I do mine, um, investigation,

370
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:29,990
of course the whole legislative framework
has changed and all the agencies were

371
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:32,150
on a legislative 14.

372
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,180
You were allowed to
know that they existed.

373
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:37,430
You are allowed even
to mention their heads.

374
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,560
And so it was much easier to then be
able to talk about in our report to talk

375
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:47,561
about what sis or am I five and really
have been doing in the years beforehand.

376
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,290
Now it's still hasn't gotten away.
Um,

377
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,060
I was asked if I would like to write a
book about this because it kept coming

378
00:24:56,061 --> 00:25:01,040
back. I mean, we didn't put it to bed
in 1999. It comes up again and again.

379
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,810
It came up in the referendum campaign.
Um, when there was a, an article,

380
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:06,710
for example,

381
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,980
criticizing the way that the daily mail
were laying into David Cameron during

382
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:16,520
the, um, during the referendum,
the referendum campaign
because of him, you know,

383
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,200
obviously, um, campaigning that
perhaps not very hard for remaining.

384
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,810
This is just like what they did to
Ramsey Mcdonald's over this offering of

385
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,830
letters said it comes back when I actually
started looking for mentions of it,

386
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,520
I found they were, they
were everywhere. Um,

387
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,730
and so it is literally the
conspiracy that never dies.

388
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:41,930
And although I've moved,
I hope the debate on a bit in that,

389
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:42,764
in the end,

390
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,450
I do think that Perkowski who
was fingered in the 1998 book,

391
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,120
it's certainly a very credible candidate,

392
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,950
but who asked him to do it,
I don't know.

393
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,680
And there are still any
number of candidates,

394
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,520
which means that although I've been able
to bring a lot more stuff out into the

395
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:03,560
open,
it's not dead yet.

396
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,150
And the message of the book really
is that good conspiracies never die.

397
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,290
How going to stop there
and take questions. Okay.
