1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Okay.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,310
Thanks so much.
That was quite the introduction.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,740
Thanks everyone for coming today and
thank you to Google for hosting us and Sam

4
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:18,650
for being our host today.
We really appreciate it. Um,

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,880
as many of you are probably aware,
um,

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,290
since 1990 over a billion people
have moved out of poverty globally,

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,590
which is really exciting and I think
gives us all the idea that it's possible.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,860
Um, and that we can make significant
progress on our goals towards any global

9
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:32,330
poverty.
At the same time,

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,740
nearly a million people still live in
poverty and many more than that live

11
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:40,130
without access to financial services
live without access to health and live in

12
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:42,270
chronic and acute hunger.
Um,

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,190
and those people are disproportionately
women and people living in rural areas.

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,630
And so Grameen Foundation,

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,360
we're really committed to continuing
to find solutions that work for those

16
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:55,310
people. Um, many of the advances
that have driven global growth, um,

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,670
that have driven the in the reduction
of poverty have been global growth.

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,320
But there are also many advances
that have been due to investments and

19
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:06,260
development initiatives.
So, for example, in India,

20
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,740
some of you may know the unheard
system, which is the, um,

21
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,120
the new national identity and
biometric system in India.

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,790
Maybe some of you may have worked on it.
Um,

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,450
but India has made a
significant investment in
making sure that every person in

24
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:22,760
India has a national id and that,

25
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:26,540
that national ID is connected to their
biometrics so that they're able to access

26
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,640
that at any time.
Um,

27
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,750
national identity is a
significant issue for poor people.

28
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:35,750
Many of them don't have identity,
they don't have a birth certificate,

29
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,780
they don't have any sort of government
documentation. And without that,

30
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:42,680
they're significantly limited in their
ability to open a bank account in their

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,400
ability to access government services
and their ability to be recognized in

32
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:50,120
their ability to vote.
Um, and so for India,

33
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:53,510
making the commitments to establish this
national identity and connecting it to

34
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:58,160
bio metrics has been a significant
investment and a significant advancement

35
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:00,380
towards their end to poverty.
Once people are in the system,

36
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:03,140
they're able to access their
government benefits. Um,

37
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,660
they all automatically have a
bank account that's open for them.

38
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:08,720
So they're government benefits transfer
directly from the government into their

39
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:11,270
accounts without having to pass
through other hands what's making,

40
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,580
which makes sure that they
receive all of their benefits.

41
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,470
And the development of that system
was a development initiative.

42
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,240
It was funded by the gates foundation
and collaboration with the Indian

43
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:24,530
government, um, and many other
development initiatives. So, um,

44
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,820
another one which many of you may have
heard of is in Pesa in east Africa,

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,600
which is a mobile money system
connected to the Vodafone system there.

46
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,890
So although only 15% of
Kenyans have a bank account,

47
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,900
over 90% of Kenyans use a mobile money
account connected to their mobile phone.

48
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,710
Um,

49
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,250
and randomized controlled trials have
verified that over six per cent of people

50
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:51,251
annually move out of poverty because
of their access to mobile money.

51
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:56,150
And there's several reasons for that.
One is that it increases their resilience.

52
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,060
Um, if somebody has a health
emergency, for example,

53
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,160
able to reach out to friends and family
near and far to see if they can gather

54
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:06,250
resources to cover that health emergency
rather than having to sell off,

55
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:09,130
say a productive asset in their household,
having to sell a cow,

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,870
which may be worth $100 just to pay
for $6 a health emergency, you know,

57
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,730
needing malaria medication for example.

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,090
So they're able to increase their
resilience through their social networks,

59
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:23,600
through the mobile money platform, um, and
able to retain more of their assets. Um,

60
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,570
for women it's an important resource to,

61
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:30,190
they're able to save and save somewhere
often that is more private, um,

62
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,570
and away from say their husband or other
family members who may want access to

63
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,520
their resources.
So for women in particular,

64
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,580
having a safe and private place to save
is a very important part of their, um,

65
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,690
ability to have more control
over their own resources.

66
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,680
We live in amazing times and
with this technology development,

67
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,010
much of it happening here at Google and
many of you so hopefully involved in

68
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:55,640
some of it, we're seeing big
data, the use of cell phones, um,

69
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,411
being part of this,

70
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,440
the host of disruptive technologies that
are transforming the way we work in the

71
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:03,160
developing community, the way
that we engage with partners, um,

72
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,850
and giving us really unprecedented
opportunities to make impacts on poverty.

73
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,780
Grameen Foundation, we're
really passionate about
disrupting global poverty.

74
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,200
We're working to create breakthroughs
that will reach many of those still living

75
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:16,034
in poverty.

76
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,820
We just design strategies that women
and their families with knowledge and

77
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:23,840
services. We really look at how
we engage with frontline workers,

78
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:27,260
people who are already engaged with poor
households to improve their ability to

79
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:29,060
deliver products and services to them.

80
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,880
And we bring together
partners in an ecosystem.

81
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:36,650
So we work primarily with software
companies, with private sector entities,

82
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:41,240
with governments to ensure that solutions
we develop our embedded in sustainable

83
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,380
delivery mechanisms,

84
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:45,770
whether that's sustainable private sector
initiatives or sustainable governance

85
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,633
initiatives.

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,150
Okay.

87
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,830
Many of you may know Grameen Foundation.
See,

88
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,230
I think I got ahead of myself on
the slides. Um, through our history,

89
00:04:55,231 --> 00:05:00,231
we were founded in 1997 through the work
of Muhammad Yunus Nobel laureate for

90
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:05,430
his work as the father of micro finance.
His breakthrough idea was really that,

91
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,210
that for women were someone you could
invest in, that you could lend to them,

92
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,510
they would invest that money in their
businesses and that they would repay it.

93
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,930
And we really have grown
on the back of that, um,

94
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,430
idea that poor households
are good investments and
someone you can do business

95
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,020
with.
In our first 10 years,

96
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,590
we really focused on micro finance and
developing micro finance institutions

97
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,330
globally. But in the last 10 years,
we have built on that foundation.

98
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,270
We've really focused on using digital
technology to develop sustainable

99
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:37,820
solutions to reach the poor,
especially women. Today,

100
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:40,940
our mission is both
urgent but also hopeful.

101
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,200
It's urgent because 60% of the chronically
hungry people are still women and

102
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:49,250
girls. They are disproportionately
affected by poverty and global hunger.

103
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,090
Though global poverty is on the decline.
Global hunger is on the rise.

104
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,441
2 billion people.

105
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,960
More than half of them women have
no access to formal financial,

106
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,060
which is a key enabler to life.

107
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,780
More than a hundred million people are
driven into poverty every year because of

108
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,140
a health crisis and that's not a
developing country phenomenon alone.

109
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,160
That's a phenomenon here,

110
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:10,850
right here in the U S and
maternal mortality rates in
Africa remained virtually

111
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,770
unchanged over the last three decades,

112
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,150
so there is an urgent need to continue
to invest in finding solutions to global

113
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,010
poverty.
At the same time,

114
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,850
we're hopeful digital technologies
are offering unprecedented solutions,

115
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,740
things like human centered design and
private sectors to increased focus on

116
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,120
working with the extremely poor,

117
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,640
provide opportunities that
we've never had before.

118
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,340
Looking forward to Grameen Foundation is
looking to reach 25 million people over

119
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:41,540
the next 25 years and move them
sustainably out of poverty.

120
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,180
Today we work in three main areas.

121
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,790
We work in digital financial
services for women.

122
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,810
We work in a digital innovations in
agriculture, and then we worth in health,

123
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,340
health financing and access.

124
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,730
Health financing and access is
primarily connected to our work,

125
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,460
particularly around financial
services and agriculture.

126
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,880
I wanted to highlight a
couple of our programs.

127
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,220
I thought you guys might be
particularly interested in.

128
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,600
The first one is called the can network,

129
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,650
the community agent
network in the Philippines.

130
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,080
I think everybody's familiar
with the Philippines.

131
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:15,740
It's an island nation is made
up of over 7,000 islands,

132
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:20,170
which it makes it extremely
expensive and time consuming, um,

133
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,070
for people to access financial services.

134
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:25,250
And it makes it extremely expensive for
financial service providers to build out

135
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:30,080
infrastructure across all of those 7,000
small islands. So we have worked with,

136
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,390
um, women like this with
Joan who are small, uh,

137
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,940
what are called, sorry, sorry.
Shop owners, kiosk owners.

138
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:41,960
They run little small businesses. They
smell, they sell daily household items.

139
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,180
And we have worked with a technology
provider to equip these women with a will

140
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:52,181
be called a point of sale or pos device
that enables them to PR to do mobile

141
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,340
money and digital payment transactions
for members of their community.

142
00:07:56,341 --> 00:08:00,800
So now Joan who was on a small island
in the Philippines is able to be the

143
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,440
intersection point for her
island and for her community,

144
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,130
for people to pay their electricity
bill for people to make a deposit or

145
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:09,040
withdrawal into their bank account.
Um,

146
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,730
and this is enabling financial inclusion
to reach these small islands and people

147
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,980
who've never had access to it before.
Um,

148
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,150
to today we've trained over
18,000 or sorry, 1800 agents,

149
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:23,920
75% of them women like Joan.
Um,

150
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,170
we cater to 423 low income
neighborhoods across this island nation.

151
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,380
We facilitated over 4.3
million transactions,

152
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,540
valued at 1.3 billion pesos.

153
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,050
So there was a huge unmet demand for
these types of digital financial services.

154
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,670
And as soon as we were able to put an
access point in these communities, um,

155
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,601
you saw the,

156
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:49,601
the amount of people who were using
digital mobile money really ramp up the

157
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:52,260
other project we're engaged in,

158
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:55,020
which I thought you guys might find
interesting as a project we call sat for.

159
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,700
It's a project that just launched
this year and it's part of our global

160
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:03,060
partnership with Mars, which
is the chocolate company, um,

161
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,150
makes most of our candy bars these days.
Um,

162
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,180
and in this project we use satellite
digital imagery and data to reach 240,000

163
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:16,200
smallholder cocoa farmers across Ghana.
It's helped them increase their yields,

164
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,710
um, improve their incomes and
build stronger businesses.

165
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:22,980
And what we do this the way we do this
as taking some of the precision farming

166
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:27,590
techniques that have been developed in
the developed world for use on large, uh,

167
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,350
large scale farms and large industrial
farms and try and take some of those

168
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:34,710
technologies and those techniques and
make them work for smallholder farmers.

169
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,130
So things like satellite imagery
to help understand whether,

170
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,800
sorry, um, soil conditions and weather,
soil needs, additional nutrients, um,

171
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,720
to understand if soil, um, needs,

172
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,430
if you're farm needs more or less water
drain any particular point of view. Um,

173
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:56,820
you can use satellite data imagery to
understand whether the pruning on a

174
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:00,360
particular farm has been done correctly.
And weirdly,

175
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:04,890
pruning is very important for cacau trees
and helps improve their productivity.

176
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:08,160
So making sure that it's done
correctly is, is an important thing.

177
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,220
So we work with, um, Mars and,

178
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:15,810
and some of the partners on the
ground who have these field agents,

179
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,380
extension agents, we call them who already
go out and interact with the farmers.

180
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:23,820
So we're able to use satellite imagery
and satellite data to provide information

181
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,170
to the extension agents so that
when they go out and visit a farmer,

182
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,250
they can tell them you need to improve
your pruning techniques. We can see that,

183
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,260
that your trees need to be pruned
more. Um, we can see that, uh,

184
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,860
your soil is low in nitrogen and you need
to plant additional plants in order to

185
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,400
increase the nitrogen, um,
nitrogen in your plants.

186
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:45,540
And so it's really taking that technology
that's already in use for these large

187
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:49,530
scale farms and figuring out how we can
use it to increase small scale farmers

188
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,870
productivity and that their income.

189
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,160
And many people don't realize that cocoa
farmers are some of the poorest people

190
00:10:56,161 --> 00:10:59,670
in the world, even though
they're connected to this
global chocolate value chain.

191
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,030
There are high levels of child
labor in chocolate globally.

192
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,290
And so part of this work that we do is
not only improving their productivity,

193
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,560
but bringing these farmers
into a global digital system.

194
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,820
So their information gets, um,
gets into our system for each farm,

195
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,930
their farming practices, um, et cetera.
And then we are able to work with them,

196
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:23,010
did become fair trade certified to
become organic certified if that's what

197
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:23,880
they're looking for.

198
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,960
So it's a system that gives both
greater profitability to the farmer,

199
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:32,040
but also greater visibility of all of us
into the global chocolate value chain.

200
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,230
And, um, it's something that
we're working with Mars and, um,

201
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,740
and looking at blockchain is the kind of
next part of that so that as consumers,

202
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,820
everybody can have visibility into how
your chocolate products through Mars are

203
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,880
being produced and whether
they're fair trade certified,

204
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,860
whether they're apps and of child labor,
et Cetera.

205
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,990
So I know that that's something that,
um,

206
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,130
kind of both sides of the
coin can benefit from.

207
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,680
One cornerstone that's consistent across
all of our projects is our desire to

208
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:04,030
really use data and information
to track our programs were, uh,

209
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,180
I think in the developing
community still at the,

210
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,710
at the nascent stage of figuring out how
to use big data and some of these big

211
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:15,220
data sources to really bring to the
fight against poverty and hunger.

212
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,870
But we're trying to use the smart tools
and the data and the information that we

213
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,470
have on smallholder farmers to bring them
more fully into market systems and to

214
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:27,460
overcome some of their, their
challenges. Um, one of the things,

215
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,720
for example that we're
looking at doing now, uh,

216
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,950
we have worked with hundreds of thousands
of small holder farmers globally.

217
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:36,940
One of the biggest constraints that they
all have is access to finance because

218
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:40,720
they don't have a financial history. Many
of them don't have bank accounts. Um,

219
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,780
many of them have worked with a,

220
00:12:42,781 --> 00:12:45,370
a mainstream or large
financial institution before.

221
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:49,420
They may do all of their lending and
borrowing locally through their community

222
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:52,060
or through, um, money lenders. Um,

223
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:54,850
so how can we help this data that
they've built up in our system?

224
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:58,810
We may have three to four years
worth of their farming data. Um,

225
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,350
we made a know exactly how much they've
spent. I'm invested in their farm.

226
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:05,170
We may know exactly how much they've
produced and what they've earned off of

227
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,480
that production for two or three years.

228
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:11,740
So how can we help them take that data
and turn it into a credit profile or a

229
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:14,270
credit score that they can then use,
um,

230
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,180
with the mainstream financial institution.

231
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:20,050
So we've already done some of that in
Columbia with coffee farmers and we're

232
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:23,050
looking to replicated
in, uh, Ghana with sorry,

233
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:27,820
and Uganda with coffee farmers and then
in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire with these

234
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:28,654
cow farmers.

235
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,190
So we think that's something very exciting
and a real growth area for us in an

236
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:36,910
area where we can really use the data
that we already have to really make an

237
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:39,200
impact.
Um,

238
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,580
I think there's other exciting ways we
can start to think about using technology

239
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:46,010
globally to alleviate poverty.
I talked about blockchain. Um,

240
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:49,120
it's something that we're all trying to
figure out what the best way to use is

241
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,290
this new technology and ways
that it can help impact poverty.

242
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:57,250
One of the ways that we're thinking
about Grameen Foundation is particularly

243
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:01,080
with refugees as they cross borders
and are receiving healthcare,

244
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,860
say in a country that is not their own.

245
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:06,250
How can they develop a health record
on something like blockchain that helps

246
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:07,930
them as they,
as they move globally,

247
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,290
whether they repatriate to their home
country or whether they're moved on to a

248
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,540
third country, how can they take
their health records with them?

249
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,260
Something like blockchain is something
that can really be very helpful with that.

250
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,230
Um, we're experimenting with artificial
intelligence and augmented reality. Um,

251
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,760
particularly in our India office,

252
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:28,060
we've been working with Accenture
development partners, um,

253
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,370
and using artificial intelligence,
for example,

254
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,590
we do a lot of financial
literacy training.

255
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,460
So using artificial intelligence to
help us understand how much women have

256
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,330
understood and internalized the training
that they've received and where women

257
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:44,830
need additional support, uh, to
ensure that they, they understand,

258
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,360
uh, how to use financial
services appropriately. So
I've actually done it myself,

259
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:53,400
done the little Q and. A. Um, and
it's very interesting to get the,

260
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,340
the readout in the reports on,
uh,

261
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,400
on how you're doing and how well you're
understanding of the lessons that you've

262
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:01,100
just received. So it's, it's exciting. Um,

263
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,460
and another exciting area we're looking
at is remote sensing for agricultural

264
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,770
irrigation.
So again,

265
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:10,880
it's something that's that's being used
by large scale industrial farms and

266
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:14,140
developing countries about
can we use remote sensing, um,

267
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,780
to help smallholder farmers in India,
um,

268
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,880
use water more efficiently
and water more effectively.

269
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,610
So that's a project that we're
just at the beginning of.

270
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Okay.

271
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,060
So I'm going to end it with that.
Um,

272
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,080
and I'm really happy to answer any
questions anybody has or talk a little bit

273
00:15:29,081 --> 00:15:30,100
more about our work.

274
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,030
We at Grameen are very excited about
the ability to use technology, um,

275
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,200
and information, uh, to end
extreme poverty and hunger.

276
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,260
We think these can help
create the breakthroughs
that will move women in their

277
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:43,480
communities out of poverty
in a sustainable way.

278
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,990
And we think it can be helped
with the work that you know,

279
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,440
people at Google are doing.

280
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:50,650
So we're really excited to talk with
you guys today more about the work we're

281
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:51,484
doing,
um,

282
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,030
and hear more about if you guys think
you're working on anything that's,

283
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,600
that's relevant or could be adapted. Um,
we're really excited to hear about it.

284
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,210
I will say that my
colleague be is over here,

285
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:05,020
so if you want to sign up for a
newsletter to learn more about Grameen

286
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,810
Foundation, she's the one to see. Um,

287
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,040
but with that I'll end and see
if anybody has any questions.

288
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,200
I'm just curious about where are you see
the intersections of Google's work and

289
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,600
um,
development.

290
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,660
So antipoverty or anti hunger
efforts or job training or other,

291
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,990
uh, you know, significant efforts
that'll have an impact on,

292
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,630
on social wellbeing.

293
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,760
Yeah, I feel probably, you know,

294
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,990
you got google.org our philanthropic arm
because they work with non profits and

295
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,960
Jacqueline pooler. I mean she
really understand a lot about that.

296
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:48,950
I think that this,
actually,

297
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,890
I met with Jacqueline
in a renal last week.

298
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,960
So I think that they definitely
are a good point to one of contact.

299
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,490
The other thing is that we are working
my cell like working Google developer

300
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:04,151
relations.

301
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:08,850
We deal technology and we
work with developers and uh,

302
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,890
we have these trainings around the world
with the book focused on social impact

303
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,140
because of course we
work with big companies,

304
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,400
but this is based on social impact
and we are part of grow with Google,

305
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:26,140
which is becoming a global
initiative in the u s Europe,

306
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,130
India, Indonesia recently launch
in Africa as well in Nigeria,

307
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,870
in a Google for urea.
So in addition to this developer trainees,

308
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:38,620
we do like a internet in railway stations,

309
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,480
the skills training, many of the
things that you were talking about,

310
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:48,481
I mean just getting people increase
their ability to get employed and that's,

311
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,980
we do.

312
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,480
So of course we are part
of Google cloud platform,

313
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,110
which all the technology is
there. And then so, uh, whatever,

314
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,260
I mean we have the cloud.
So interesting. I mean,

315
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:06,261
we can probably follow up and see if we
can figure out if we can collaborate in

316
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,690
some way or another.
Thank you.

317
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,490
Yeah, thanks. That would be very exciting.

318
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,520
I think especially with some
of the skills training pieces,

319
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:19,510
that's something that we're always
being asked for. Uh, so, uh,

320
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,490
do you see any, do you see the problem
of global poverty getting worse with like

321
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:26,230
desertification,
desertification,

322
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,650
and the loss of variable land basically
due to global warming and climate change?

323
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,710
Absolutely. And I think it's, it's
very geographically specific, so,

324
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,220
and there are parts of the world
that are being impacted differently.

325
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:40,380
So for example,

326
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:45,240
you see areas like Mozambique or the
Philippines that are being subjected to

327
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,060
much more frequent natural disasters.
So Mozambique for example, yeah, mmm.

328
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,431
Is,

329
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:57,431
is much more frequently being hit by
typhoons or significant rains that are

330
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,950
causing flooding that are causing crop
loss, that are causing loss of life.

331
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,040
So we're seeing those issues hit
some countries at the same time.

332
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,330
We're seeing other countries,

333
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,990
particularly kind of the [inaudible]
region countries were increasing.

334
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,110
Desertification, um, is impact, you know,

335
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:15,320
encroaching on areas that
were former breadbaskets. Um,

336
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,300
and that we're producing
significant amounts of food.

337
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,880
So there are different impacts everywhere,

338
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:23,040
but without a doubt,

339
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,480
particularly the developing world is
being disproportionately impacted by

340
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,400
climate change and they
are disproportionately not
contributing to climate

341
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:35,930
change. I guess. I guess the actual, uh,

342
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,560
the question to the foundation is a,

343
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,980
are you doing anything to try to
prevent that from happening? Like,

344
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,990
is it easier to prevent people getting
into poverty because of those then try to

345
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,080
pull them out of it afterwards?
Oh yeah, absolutely.

346
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,660
So one of the projects we've initiated,

347
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:53,630
for example in the Philippines
is an early warning system.

348
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,630
So it's both a weather and
a pest early warning system.

349
00:19:56,631 --> 00:20:00,560
So one of the things we're seeing with
climate change is very different pest

350
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:04,620
patterns globally, right? Because, um, uh,

351
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:08,090
mosquitoes or one that a lot of people,
it's not a, it's not a crop pest,

352
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:08,871
but you know,

353
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:11,600
mosquitoes are coming into areas that
they've never been before because the

354
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:15,170
climate in that area has changed.
So similarly with crop related pests,

355
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,540
they are coming into areas
where they've never been before.

356
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,840
We're farmers don't know
how to deal with them. Um,

357
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,090
and as well as weather related risks,
particularly in the Philippines.

358
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:27,390
So in the Philippines we've worked with
both the Ministry of Agriculture and a

359
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,040
local university that has a,

360
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,180
that runs the weather
stations in the country, um,

361
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,680
to develop an early warning system.

362
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:38,730
So that early warning system sends
information to farmers if there's an

363
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:42,150
inclement weather event or if there
is a pest outbreak in their area.

364
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,780
And not only does it tell them about the
event, but it gives them instructions.

365
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:46,980
So for example,
if there's,

366
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,080
there's a typhoon coming at may
tell farmers you need to cover your,

367
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,600
your trees and burlap and
may tell them you need to,

368
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,570
you need to harvest early because
there'll be total crop loss.

369
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,000
You should harvest what you can.
Now at the same time,

370
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:01,330
it allows for two way communication.

371
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:04,990
So say a farmer finds a pest in their
crop, if they're not familiar with,

372
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:07,180
they can take a picture of it,
they can send it into the system,

373
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,060
they can receive information
pack on what to do about it.

374
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,560
But at the same time he will triangulate.

375
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,590
So several farmers in in an
area report the same pest.

376
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,500
It will then send out a warning to all
farmers in the area that the pest has

377
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,840
been spotted in their area and
how they should treat for it.

378
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,280
So early warning system is something that
we're working on that we've piloted in

379
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:28,900
the Philippines. We're working on in ag,
integrating it into the scanner project.

380
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:31,240
I was talking about another project.
So yes.

381
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,523
Thank you.

382
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,070
So that may have been way more
detailed than you want it.

383
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,880
Yeah.
Can I add to that a little course as well.

384
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,670
So farmers are,
the majority of the world's poor,

385
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,160
70% of the extreme poor are farmers.

386
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,510
So a lot of what we do is in terms of
helping those farmers increase their

387
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:54,110
productivity and the
sustainability of what they do,

388
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,790
which is part and parcel of
adjusting to climate change.

389
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,340
So I don't know if you want to maybe talk
a little bit about the savings groups

390
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:05,930
work like in,

391
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,880
in Burkina Faso and how
we're directly doing that.

392
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,480
Yeah, absolutely. I think climate
adaptation is, is a big issue. Um,

393
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,600
and it's, it's both a financial
issue. And it's an agricultural issue.

394
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:21,710
So when Burkina Faso,

395
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,380
we work with women who in a lot of times,
particularly in Africa,

396
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:29,990
you'll see that men are often
engaged in what we call cash crops.

397
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,340
So they grow a crop crop that can be
sold at market and women are engaged in

398
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:35,330
household food crops.

399
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,580
And so we engage women and
working a Faso in savings groups.

400
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:43,730
So they get together on a regular basis.
They save weekly,

401
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:48,230
usually a very small amount, um, and
they, they're able to pull that savings,

402
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:51,500
then they can borrow from it if
they need for an investment. Um,

403
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,400
but at the end of the year,

404
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:54,740
then they receive their savings back
and they're able to invest in it.

405
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,450
So as part of that project,

406
00:22:56,451 --> 00:23:00,080
we worked with those
women on understanding the
impacts of climate change in

407
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:04,280
their region and helping
them to modify or adopt,

408
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:08,030
adapt what crops they're growing. So we
worked with a lot of wind, for example,

409
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:11,550
to start growing cow peas or cassava or,

410
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,210
and different kinds of, um, orange yams,

411
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:16,820
which are much more drought
resistance and tolerance.

412
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,890
Given the changes that are having,

413
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:22,400
a lot of times what happens particularly
in these rural communities is that

414
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,900
people have been engaged for generations
in farming a certain type of crop and

415
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:29,990
they really understand that crop and as
climate change happens and they need to

416
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:34,190
move into crops that are going to be
more appropriate given what their new

417
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:35,120
climate reality is,

418
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:38,970
they don't have that level of skill
and understanding of that crop. Um,

419
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:42,770
and so helping them have the information
on what crops are going to work for

420
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:46,190
them now and how they should grow it
and how to it et Cetera is an important

421
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:50,330
part of our work. And then making sure
they have the resources to invest in it.

422
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,890
It's very risky for smallholder
farmers. You know, um, I,

423
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,070
cassava is one of my, the things
I dislike most in this world, um,

424
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,990
because it's a very drought resistant
crop and it grows almost everywhere.

425
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:07,040
So a lot of people have a lot of
incentive to grow cassava because um,

426
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,980
it will come in no matter what and you,

427
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,660
you will be able to
feed your family on it.

428
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:17,250
It is a very low nutrient cause office,
like a Yam kind of yellow. Yeah.

429
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,210
But it doesn't have the
nutrients that yams do. Um,

430
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,480
and particularly for young
children it's hard to digest.

431
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:27,200
So you see young children who eat a
lot of cassava actually tend to be more

432
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,510
malnourished then even though they're,

433
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,690
they're getting a lot of calories
because they can't digest them very well.

434
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:34,250
They tend to be extremely malnourished.

435
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,980
But people planted
because it fills Belize.

436
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,300
And so if we can give people
the information they need
on other crops that we'll

437
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:42,620
do as well as cassava,

438
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,410
but we'll have much more nutritional
benefit for the household,

439
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,240
like yellow and orange, sweet
potatoes, um, like cow peas,

440
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,830
which are extremely drought resistant.

441
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,980
If we can help them to understand
these new crops that they can be using,

442
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:58,340
which are readily available in
their areas and how to harvest them,

443
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,330
not only will they potentially
have a better harvest,

444
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:04,460
but it will be more
nutrient rich food for them.

445
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,130
Um, I was wondering about mobile financial
services and, and device security.

446
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:14,131
Like a lot of these cheaper android
devices basically never get security

447
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:15,880
updates.
Um,

448
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,510
have you found any practices that help
protect people if they're acting as like

449
00:25:19,511 --> 00:25:23,200
the financial agent for
their whole village of, of
keeping their device secure?

450
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,460
Yes.
Um,

451
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,380
I would say the device security is
probably pretty low on a lot of people's

452
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:33,590
priority lists.
Um,

453
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,930
what is high and where I think we're
seeing a lot of momentum is moving people

454
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:43,780
towards a better, more and
better smartphones. Um,

455
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,360
so you see a lot of people,
still,

456
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,170
most people particularly in Africa
are still using, well Africa, India,

457
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,570
most developing countries are
still using feature phones.

458
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,920
So the big push is to try and get
people on to smart phones, um,

459
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,240
and to get people more access to data.
Um,

460
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,610
because even when people moved to smart
phones, data can be very expensive still.

461
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:06,900
So the short answer to your question is
not really doing a lot on device security

462
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,710
feature phones,

463
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,780
like more resistant to malware
then typical smartphone.

464
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,270
I don't know the answer to that.
My guess would be yes.

465
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:21,480
Only because it doesn't have
very many features. You know,

466
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,710
they don't have very many features
for people to mess with. Um,

467
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,580
and usually then when you're
using a feature phone,

468
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:31,581
you're using USSD or SMS technology
to access your accounts or to do your

469
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:35,890
transactions so high. I was curious
about something you said about uh,

470
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,280
using blockchain for a medical records.

471
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:42,750
I was curious what makes that
specifically about technology specifically

472
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,480
suitable that purpose versus,
you know,

473
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,550
some other database platform
or some other system. Yeah,

474
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:50,400
I think one of the things that makes
blockchain interesting in that particular

475
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,070
use case, and it's one we're still
exploring, we haven't implemented yet,

476
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,690
is the ability for those records to be
transferable across borders and to be

477
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:02,550
accessible through biometrics.

478
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,710
So if a person, um, you know,
returns to their home country,

479
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,070
a lot of times when people, uh,
when refugees cross borders,

480
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:12,020
they don't take their national,

481
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,670
they don't have documentation with them
so they don't have their national ids,

482
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:15,330
et Cetera.

483
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:19,140
So the ability to build biometrics into
that and to make it accessible when

484
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:21,810
people cross borders are what makes
blockchain particularly interesting.

485
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,190
In a lot of these cases, I'm sort
of a, like the, you should only,

486
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,550
I think a lot of people are very bullish
on blockchain and I'm also bullish on

487
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:29,910
blockchain,

488
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,330
but I think people want to use it a
lot of times when you could just use a

489
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:38,100
regular database. And so, and
there there's, so there is,

490
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,220
um, and so, you know,
I've heard people tell me,

491
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,320
even if it's just a regular database,

492
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:47,270
go ahead and put it in blockchain because
that's where the world is moving. Um,

493
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,510
and then other people have said, you
know, it's, it's a complicated technology.

494
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:53,760
If you could just use a database,
just use the database.

495
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,940
So we're probably still on the,
just use the database side of things,

496
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,510
but people are throwing me up. So I'm
just, I'm hoping that's the right answer.

497
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,263
Let's

498
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,563
help

499
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,050
you gain insights from Yep.

500
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,760
So I'll just repeat it in
case the question was what,

501
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,500
because we have such a
large amount of data,

502
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,650
what our position is on
sharing that publicly. Um,

503
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,730
which is a good question and I have a
good answer because I was just meeting

504
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:33,010
with our tech person this
morning. Um, so we are in,

505
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,310
we have a huge amount of
data in different systems.

506
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:37,680
So we're going through a process
right now of cleaning that data.

507
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,750
I think we're very open to sharing
it. Um, in a couple of ways. One,

508
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,570
we're open to anonymizing it and
sharing it widely so that people can do

509
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:47,030
research with it.
Um,

510
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,450
we're also open to sharing it and in ways
that allow people to provide services

511
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:53,550
to Pacific specific farmers.
So for example,

512
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:58,551
we have a lot of farm data in Uganda and
we are working now actively on making

513
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:03,840
that accessible to financial institutions
so that they can identify farmers who

514
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:08,400
need to invest in their farms
and lend to them. What we are,

515
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:13,080
um, quite specific on is that that needs
to be a relationship that the farmer

516
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:17,210
understands and agrees to. So say, um,

517
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,380
centenary bank is one of
our partners in Uganda,

518
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,060
which is a large bank national bank.

519
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,350
So say centenary bank wants to access
a farmer's data to see if they want to

520
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:29,610
make a loan to them, that
the farmer either needs to
receive an SMS and say, yes,

521
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:33,720
I consent to centenary or the farmer
needs to be able to push their data.

522
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:35,640
So they,
the farmers talked to the centenary bank.

523
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,340
If they want to send them their data,
they can push it from the system. So the,

524
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,850
there needs to be a consent process
where the end user is able to consent.

525
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:49,390
Because when we originally collected
their data, we didn't understand, uh,

526
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,160
you know, some of them may have started
five years ago. We didn't know what,

527
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:53,770
what we could be doing with it.

528
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,700
They didn't consent at that
time to sharing it widely. Um,

529
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,930
going forward, um, you know, we may have
different kinds of consent protocols,

530
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:02,860
but I think it's important.

531
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,580
And this gets back to the
blockchain thing a little bit. Um,

532
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,600
for people don't understand all of the
things you could be doing with their data

533
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:15,130
and where their data could be
going. And, um, even if you,

534
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:16,410
if they sign a consent form,
does,

535
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,840
is that really meaningful consent if
they don't understand what we're all

536
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:21,370
talking about with this big data stuff.

537
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:25,360
And so how can you make
their data available but
still give them some level of

538
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:28,360
control over it. We talk a lot about
particularly because, you know,

539
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:32,530
we work sometimes in refugee situations,
what are people's rights to anonymity,

540
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,780
right? To be forgotten. Um,

541
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,950
and what are the dangers that go along
with people's state of being publicly

542
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:42,280
available. So, um, anyway, it's
something we think along well.

543
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,370
Um, so I grew up in farming in Florida
and a lot of the industrialized techniques

544
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:52,750
that we had were kind of makes sense
because of economy of scale and heavy

545
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,540
equipment and stuff like that.
Um,

546
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,700
how much of of that
industrialized techniques,

547
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:04,550
how many of those apply? And
have you looked into, uh,

548
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,980
any sort of research with more specific
techniques, smaller techniques?

549
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,040
So that all depends. Um, and I'm going
to say I'm not an agriculture expert. Um,

550
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,900
but so things like data for farming is
something that you could parse out pretty

551
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:25,880
easily and cheaply. Um,
other technologies like, um,

552
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,330
I don't know. I'm trying to think. Um,

553
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,800
like there's a lot of work that's
been done, not necessarily by us,

554
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,140
but like around cooperative
ownership of technology,

555
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:41,930
whether that technology is a large,
um,

556
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,160
what's the word I'm looking for? Harvest
or harvest or there we go. Thank you. Um,

557
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,840
or you know, other machinery, you know,

558
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:54,140
cooperative ownership and cooperative
movements are big in developing countries

559
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,840
as well as in the u s um,

560
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,190
but data I think is something that can
be parsed out to the individual farmers

561
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:04,460
so that they can take action on it.
So to add onto that,

562
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:06,380
I do think even in the developing world,

563
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,900
farm fragmentation is an
issue we deal with, um,

564
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,290
particularly because of climate change as,

565
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,240
as arable land is shrinking in some
areas. Um, you know, you have a farmer,

566
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:20,630
he has so much land, he has three sons.
It gets divided among the three sons.

567
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:21,980
They have three sons,
it gets divided.

568
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,910
And so there is a consolidation process
that needs to happen in the developing

569
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:29,610
world. Um, and it's a lot
of what we talk about. Um,

570
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,810
it gets to maybe some of the skills
training opportunities because there needs

571
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:37,811
to be off farm rural enterprise
that can pull labor off of farms,

572
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:43,040
allow for farm consolidation in a lot of
countries to make smallholding farming

573
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,870
more profitable
as somebody,

574
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,330
as somebody at Google who
mostly spends time, you know,

575
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:56,290
thinking about consumer technologies
and sometimes enterprise technologies in

576
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,290
the development world.
Um,

577
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,410
I am curious what you've
seen ouch. You know, in,

578
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:07,411
in the developing world
as far as interesting or
surprising uses of technologies

579
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:12,400
that we've developed here. You know, big
products like, like Gmail or you know,

580
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,690
android phones or you know, contacts
and address book is, is the,

581
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:19,130
the area where I work now, what have
you seen out there? You know, them,

582
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,890
them using the products
that we've developed in
interesting and surprising ways.

583
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:28,530
Good question. Um, I
think it's interesting.

584
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:30,510
I lived for seven years in Tanzania.

585
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,540
I came home about two or three years ago
and I was amazed how many people here

586
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:37,350
don't use what's up.
Like in the W in east Africa,

587
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:42,120
what's up is the primary
mode of communication and
what's up is now being used

588
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:45,840
and piloted for mobile
money transfers. So, um,

589
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,650
so I think there's a lot of interesting
things that are happening in developing

590
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:53,280
countries that aren't happening here.
It's interesting. I went to, um,

591
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,080
one of those like,
Aha moments for me.

592
00:33:55,081 --> 00:33:58,140
I went to one of these women's
savings groups in Kenya, um,

593
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,610
and we had worked with them with a
partner bank. Um, and so they were,

594
00:34:02,611 --> 00:34:05,250
they had a savings account, um, on their,

595
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,620
on their mobile phone that
they could deposit into.

596
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:12,120
And so I was asking the woman, um,
one of the women in this group, okay,

597
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:14,400
you have a savings account. What's
the account you want to, you know,

598
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:17,460
what type of financial product do you
want next on your phone? You know,

599
00:34:17,461 --> 00:34:19,980
do you want access to credit?
Do you want to insurance?

600
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:21,780
Do you want Agricultural Credit?
She said,

601
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:24,720
just put them all on my phone and I'll
decide what, you know, what I want to use.

602
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:29,430
So the hunger for these tech solutions
is really, is really, really high.

603
00:34:29,431 --> 00:34:33,590
I talked to a woman same day, um,
in a different group who said, God,

604
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,620
I had to turn Facebook off on my phone
because, um, I was just using it too much.

605
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,310
And this was, I had flown on an
airplane to a secondary city.

606
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,750
I had driven an hour.

607
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:46,200
I had taken a boat across the lake
and gotten to this rural community.

608
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:48,870
It was like a four hour trek to get there.
Um,

609
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,300
and here's a woman telling
me I use Facebook too much.

610
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:53,040
I have to turn it off
because it's distracting me.

611
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:57,750
So the hunger for technology is really,
really high in these communities.

612
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,890
Um,
and there's,

613
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,460
I think sort of this myth that a lot of
these communities aren't very tech savvy,

614
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:06,750
but, um, they're really, um,
taking up a lot of this technology.

615
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,820
Thanks. And I, and I have
a another question too. As
long as I'm up here you go.

616
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:16,260
Google is full of idealistic people
with software engineering skills. Um,

617
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,910
if one of those people,
you know,

618
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,670
hypothetically wanted to put those skills
to work and the growth and the growth

619
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:26,480
number or poverty, um, what
are the opportunities that
are out there, you know,

620
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,920
on either volunteer or
fulltime basis or whatever.

621
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,080
One of my colleagues will be
so excited that you asked. Um,

622
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,440
we have a program in Grameen Foundation,

623
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,450
inappropriately named
Bankers Without Borders. Um,

624
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,130
because it started in our early days
when we were focused primarily on micro

625
00:35:43,131 --> 00:35:43,964
finance,

626
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,340
but it is a volunteer program that lets
working professionals volunteer their

627
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:48,510
time,
um,

628
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,400
either here from the u s providing kind
of remote assistance or traveling to a

629
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:58,230
developing country to work with a local
partner for, you know, two to three weeks.

630
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,550
Um, and so it's a volunteer program and
we work with our partners in developing

631
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:06,990
countries who have needs for assistance
and with professionals here to try and

632
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:09,660
match them up. So, um, if you see be,

633
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:12,300
she'll get you some information and
anyone else who wants to volunteer their

634
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:16,470
time and get you some information on
the banker's without Borders program and

635
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:19,620
you can sign up. And
some of it's as, um, as,

636
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:24,450
and time consuming as say we're working
with a small business in east Africa

637
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,370
that,
um,

638
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,520
is thinking about using the technology
in a certain way and they just want to

639
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,460
have a brainstorm
session with some people.

640
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,350
And so they'll set up an ideation session,
Grameen Bank, so that board as well. Um,

641
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,760
and maybe try and find,
you know,

642
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:43,761
five or six professionals here in the US
or in Europe who can just sit and on a,

643
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,281
you know,

644
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:49,281
a Skype call or a Webex and talk through
with the CEO kind of what technology

645
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:52,950
might fit his needs. Um, and
then it could be everything from,

646
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:54,600
we have people who do, do, you know,

647
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:59,250
year long fellowships funded by their
employers, um, you know, to sit,

648
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,390
um,
you know,

649
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:03,690
in a partner and really work with them
in depth over the course of a year and

650
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:07,320
then everything kind of in between.
So if you're interested in volunteering,

651
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,560
definitely look at that PR program
and sign up for it. It's really,

652
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:14,310
it's really amazing. Great.
Thank you. Thanks so much.

653
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,830
I'm going to let the Google guy go first.

654
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,970
Uh, I want to understand how, uh, what
kind of parameters that you look at,

655
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:28,220
um, you know, on deciding do you want to
service this country or this area or not?

656
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,370
Cause I'm sure there's like a lot of
areas that need, you know, your service.

657
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:32,510
So how do you decide that?

658
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,510
That's a very good question.
Um,

659
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:40,570
I think one of the things for Grameen
Foundation is that we are really looking

660
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,120
at sustainable solutions.

661
00:37:43,121 --> 00:37:48,121
So we often have opportunities to work
on initiatives that we think can benefit,

662
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,220
um, you know, maybe 10, 15,000 people,

663
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:57,110
but we don't understand long term how
we would make that sustainable. Um,

664
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,890
could we,

665
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,100
could we embed it in a government could
be embedded in a private sector for us.

666
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:05,110
If we can't understand the
longterm sustainability, um,

667
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,680
it's a project that we would probably
pass up on. Um, it's just not,

668
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,301
and,

669
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:13,550
and there are other groups who could do
that and maybe do a good job and it has

670
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:13,911
a benefit.

671
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:17,570
But our longterm DNA is to
look for something that can
be long term sustainable.

672
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:22,640
We are an organization that
has a heavy tech history.

673
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,420
Um,

674
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,420
and so primarily we're
looking at opportunities
where we can identify ways to

675
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:32,980
use technology, um, in ways that can
maybe leapfrog or our fine, you know,

676
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,410
disruptive innovations to solutions.
So that being said, you know, it's,

677
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:39,530
it's sort of a case by case basis.
Um,

678
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,870
we almost always want a local
partner on the ground, um,

679
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:46,860
be that private sector or government
or a, or a local entity, um,

680
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,940
who can do the implementation and
who can be the long term owner of it.

681
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,430
The local partners reach out to you as
do they initiate the first contact or do

682
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:56,930
you use kind of see opportunities
and then reach out to the,

683
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,390
that really can depend. Um,
you know, sometimes if we,
if we have an opportunity,

684
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:05,200
if you stayed puts out a call, we may go
out and look for a particular partner.

685
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:10,360
Um, other times somebody
might come to us and say,

686
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,060
um, so Mussolini is, is a
good example of that there.

687
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,460
The first all digital micro
finance institution in Kenya.
And so they came to us,

688
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,720
um, saying, uh, you know,
we're looking at [inaudible],

689
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,240
we really want to build out an
agricultural financing products.

690
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,230
So can you help us think through
that? So we worked with them, um,

691
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,050
and we had some EWB volunteers who worked
with them to help think through what

692
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:33,490
an agriculture finance project,

693
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,720
a product would look like I'm enrolled
and how they could roll that out across

694
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:40,270
the organization and it's now become
their most profitable product.

695
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,540
So it works both ways a
little bit. Thank you. Thanks.

696
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,420
Thanks you guys so much for coming.
I was really a worry.

697
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:48,520
Nobody would come and then we're,
nobody would ask any questions.

698
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:52,330
So I really appreciate it. Appreciate
your time and the work Google is doing.

699
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,060
Cause I know many things that you guys
do are really contributing to the work

700
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:56,470
that we'd oversee.
So thanks so much.
