1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,270
A former dancer, Mary studied
structural integration with Ida Rolf.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,540
She has taught movement in bodywork
classes since 1994 and was chair of the

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,060
Movement Faculty of the Rolf Institute
of structural integration in Boulder,

4
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:23,320
Colorado. The new rules of posture
is the second of three books.

5
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:28,000
Mary has published along with numerous
articles in magazines including massage

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,890
shape,
men's fitness,

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,720
somatics journey journal and massage
and bodywork. Her newest book,

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,080
your Bali Body Mount.

9
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:40,270
Our posture as a path to presence is
coming out at the end of the year.

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,950
You can look at it, look for it
on her website or on Amazon. Uh,

11
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,900
she has videos, a blog, and much
more on her website, which is www.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,310
Heal your posture.com. Ladies
and gentlemen, Merry Bond.

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,810
Thank you all so much for coming.

14
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:09,460
I know we had an eclipse and there were
other exciting things going on today and

15
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:12,700
here you are.
So sitting,

16
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:16,360
standing and moving in the modern
world is not always comfortable,

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,460
but we get used to it.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,600
A lot of times we don't
notice our discomfort until
it becomes full blown pain.

19
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,200
So you folks are Google,
you're known for innovation.

20
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,620
And what I hope to do today is to inspire
you to help redesign the way the world

21
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:38,260
works so it could be more body friendly.

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,530
So,
um,

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,240
because I want you to feel what
I'm talking about in your bodies.

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,020
I'm going to ask you to stand
up and do things every so often.

25
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,580
So now is one of those times, if you
would just stand up, it would be great.

26
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,090
Okay? So bring your arms way high,
make fists, tighten your elbows,

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,570
tighten your knees,
push down in the floor,

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,640
stretch your spine as high as possible.
And then go side to side. Just a little.

29
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,050
So notice your stretching,
but you're contracting at the same time.

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,460
That's important. Really
stretch, really reach. Okay,

31
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:21,520
now open your hand.
Scrunch up your eyes.

32
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,070
Open your mouth like you're yawning.
A more stretch, more and more.

33
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,200
Okay.
Now you could let go

34
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,950
and feel your body right now.

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,830
Something a little something, a
little energy moving through it. Yeah.

36
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,640
So what you just did is Pandic.

37
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:47,020
Culation and most mammals
do this many times a day,

38
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:49,090
sometimes up to 50 times.

39
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,260
But humans feel a little
sheepish doing it in public.

40
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,690
Nonetheless, you felt there was an
effect, I think nod your head. Yeah,

41
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,040
there was an effect.

42
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,080
So what might be news is that that
affect matters. It's important.

43
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,010
So we'll talk a little more about
Penn [inaudible] as we go forward.

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,240
This is cover art for the
book you just picked up.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,820
And the gist of that book is
that posture isn't a position.

46
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:23,410
It's not what you do with your shoulders
or your head or your gut posture is

47
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,940
your response to this moment and
the next moment and the next,

48
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,710
every succeeding moment
requires you to respond.

49
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,720
We don't, we're not aware of it
and we get habits about doing it.

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,800
But basically posture is how you feel
stable and safe in a pretty unstable

51
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:50,500
world.
And so changing,

52
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:55,501
transforming your posture amounts to
creating different strategies for how you

53
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,810
feel safe inside to meet the world.

54
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,180
So it's in involves body awareness,
self awareness. It's not a quick fix.

55
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,840
So this book is not something
you're going to, um,

56
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,040
benefit from tomorrow.
It takes a little patience.

57
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,870
So how do we sit,

58
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:18,871
stand and move in this crazy modern world
in a world that increasingly ignores

59
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,930
what the body is made to do,
which is to move.

60
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,750
Um,
all organisms move in order to survive.

61
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,180
We know that there's a doctor
Scholls ad on television right now.

62
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,220
It says,
born to move.

63
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,640
So we have this in our consciousness
and yet we don't really embody it in our

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,413
being.

65
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,330
So how many of you have standing desks?
Yeah.

66
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,990
Do you stand at them? They
will. That help? It's helpful.

67
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,360
Sometimes you do sometimes.
Yeah.

68
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:03,050
So standing desks and Ergonomic
chairs are good ideas. Um,

69
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,970
but they're external fixes to the problem
of our ancient bodies in this modern

70
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,684
world.

71
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,450
So I want to dig a little deeper
into the nature of your bodies.

72
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,380
I want to talk about what you're made
of the ground substance of your body and

73
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,090
how to take care of that.

74
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,840
I want to talk about the architectural
principle that holds you together and

75
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:39,781
about perception and what
perception has to do with posture.

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,130
And then I'll give you some advice about
sitting since you're insist on doing

77
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:49,960
that. And we'll talk about in the end, uh,

78
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:53,620
exercise and movement and
the future of the human body.

79
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,560
So that's my plan for this little talk.

80
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,830
And I wanted to share with you a
little about where I'm coming from.

81
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,120
This is my teacher,

82
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,680
her name was Ida Rolf
and she was a biochemist,

83
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,670
but her passionate interest
was in human structures.

84
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,100
So she developed a manual therapy.
She called structural integration.

85
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,810
And so her students and her
clients nicknamed it Raul thing.

86
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,490
She didn't much like that.

87
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:26,930
But now most of you have
heard of Raul thing. Yes.

88
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,400
Okay.

89
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,350
So this therapy looks at the
body as living architecture,

90
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,860
which has been distorted and diminished
by accidents and compensations and poor

91
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,390
use,
like sitting all day without moving.

92
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,260
She viewed pain as the product,

93
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,590
mostly the product of imbalance structure.

94
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,480
She had to kind of revolutionary ideas
for the sixties this expresses one of

95
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,930
them. It's her logo. And
she thought that the body,

96
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,280
she taught that the body
is organized by gravity,

97
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,190
just like this building
is organized by gravity.

98
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,820
So if the body could be balanced,

99
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,450
then gravity wouldn't tear the body down,

100
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,990
but would in fact actually
contribute to health.

101
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,510
So that was her first idea.

102
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,790
Or second idea is that the body's
connective tissue is plastic.

103
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,050
It's able to change.
So through manipulation,

104
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:38,051
she found that she could restore balance
to structures that had become distorted

105
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,074
and twisted.

106
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,110
She was the first to recognize the
importance of connective tissue,

107
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,880
what we now call Fascia.
And she died in 1979.

108
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,040
Uh, but the first research
conference about Fascia,

109
00:07:55,041 --> 00:08:00,040
the Fascia congress wasn't
held until 2006. Uh,

110
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,530
it happened at Harvard,
which was exciting for us body workers.

111
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,720
But it was also attended by many
researchers from around the world who had

112
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,750
become interested in this aspect of
the body that had mostly been ignored.

113
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,210
So this is a simple
metaphor to share with you.

114
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:23,300
How fascia pervades your body.

115
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,350
The rind of the orange is like,
um,

116
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,780
an all over body suit just under your
skin. If we peeled off all the skin,

117
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:37,670
we would see a fascicle layer.
It's, it's literally a body suit.

118
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,160
It contains everything else.

119
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,830
And underneath that are these,
the segments of the orange, um,

120
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,820
represent the various organs and muscles
and larger structures that each have a

121
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:56,600
containing membrane as, as, um,

122
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,670
blood vessels and nerves and bones all
have a wrapping of Fascia around them.

123
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,580
And all of this Fascia is continuous
and the little orange bits inside the

124
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:12,540
segments, you know how your fingers
get sticky when you eat an orange.

125
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,660
So those little bits represent cells.

126
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,140
So each cell in your body has
its own fashional membrane.

127
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,020
So it's been suggested that if you took
out everything else from the body except

128
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:31,320
the Fascia, you'd still have
a recognizable human shape.

129
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,800
This is an 18th century
painting of a dissection.

130
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,010
It hangs in the Wellcome
library in London.

131
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,470
So until recently,

132
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,560
anatomists stripped away the Fascia and
discarded it so they could look at the

133
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:50,940
interesting thing.

134
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:55,930
So the liver and the brain and
the circulatory system and so on.

135
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,570
And that was good.
We needed that.

136
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:04,090
But what it did was perpetuate the
idea that your body is made up of an

137
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:08,530
assemblage of parts.
Rather than that it becomes,

138
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,990
develops out of wholeness,
which I'll talk about a little more later.

139
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,710
Yeah.

140
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,630
This photo is an endoscopic
image of living Fascia.

141
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,190
It's magnified 130 times and it's
the work of a man named John Claude.

142
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:31,760
Gene Bartow.
He's a French micro surgeon.

143
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,950
He uses endoscopy in his work.

144
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,080
So this means putting little cameras
and lights and micros scopes inside the

145
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:39,950
living tissue.

146
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,420
So he has been so odd by what he saw
that he's developed a collection of these

147
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:49,484
images.

148
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,720
And I can give you his
website after the talk.

149
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,190
Appreciate these geometric forms.

150
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,280
Uh, immune system. Uh, sorry.

151
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:09,281
The fascist system is now being studied
at the same way that the immune system

152
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:14,300
and the circulatory system and all
the other systems are being studied.

153
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,370
So there are three main
constituents of Fascia.

154
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,120
One is Collagen.
It's like protein fibers,

155
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,430
which when they're woven tightly
together have the strength of steel.

156
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,180
There are also elastic fibers that you
could stretch to 100% of their capacity

157
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,170
and then they could relax back
without deforming their shape.

158
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,170
And the third constituent is a watery
matrix, something like egg white,

159
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,900
uh,
kind of mucousy stuff.

160
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,380
And there's swimming in cells like immune
cells and fat cells and nerve cells.

161
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,840
So this was very interesting to us in
the bodywork world that there were nerve

162
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:05,410
cells in Fascia.

163
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:10,411
We we knew from doing doctor Rovs work
that there was some kind of communication

164
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,750
through the Fascia, but we had all
kinds of other ideas about what, what,

165
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,840
what was doing it.

166
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,150
And they're actually sensory nerve
fibers in the fashion. In fact,

167
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,440
six times estimated six
times as many nerve fascists,

168
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,920
neuro fibers in Fascia as in muscle.

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,190
So when you think you're
moving through the,

170
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:37,150
your neuromuscular system,

171
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:42,151
it's actually the fashion system that
is allowing that to come into full

172
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:44,044
expression.

173
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,173
Yeah.

174
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,880
A lot of these nerves,

175
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,580
sensors in the fascia
are called intro sectors.

176
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,900
That means they tell you what's
going on inside your body.

177
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,380
So when you feel bloated or you have
a tickle or an itch or you have sexual

178
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,320
arousal or air hunger,

179
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,830
all of these kinds of sensations in your
body are because of the intro sectors

180
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,880
in your Fascia. So you
might think that, uh,

181
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,870
interoception is a way,
you know that you have a body.

182
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,673
Okay.

183
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,120
Lot of different textures.

184
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:31,990
Fascia can assume it can have
the transparency of glass.

185
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,270
So your corneas are Fascia,

186
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,950
your breasts are Fascia
full of lots of fat cells.

187
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,940
Um, there's um, when you,

188
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,860
when you have a scar that's the Collagen
fibers woven tightly together to

189
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,800
protect the wound.
Um,

190
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,440
it's also very fluid gelatin
like slidey slippery slidey.

191
00:13:56,471 --> 00:14:00,760
So when we watch our most
beautiful athletes and dancers,

192
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,450
what we're seeing is not just
their superb neuromuscular system,

193
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,430
but also the health of their fashion
system. Note, the last point,

194
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,240
stress and immobility dehydrates your
Fascia and makes it stiff and makes you

195
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,174
stiff.

196
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,570
So stress in a mobility are the
characteristics of the modern workplace.

197
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,290
The powerful leaping of a kangaroo is
do not just to its powerful leg muscles,

198
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,700
but to the high percentage
of Fascia in its body.

199
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,260
So when those elastic fibers
stretch through movement,

200
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,310
uh, the, its stores, kinetic energy,

201
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:48,730
which is then released
and the kangaroo rebounds.

202
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,510
Interesting thing here is that our bodies,

203
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:58,511
human bodies have the same high percentage
of fashion in them as the kangaroo.

204
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,300
So if you think about that,

205
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,570
it's clear that we're made for leaping
and running and not for sitting.

206
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,180
This is a video,

207
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:15,560
one of gene bertos videos of
living Fascia. You'll see,

208
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,900
um,
the yellow fat cells along the bottom,

209
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,030
tendonous material,

210
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:28,031
the collagen across the middle of the
slide and the blood cell blood vessel.

211
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,350
You might be able to see moving.

212
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,950
So where that's happening is just
below your elbow on your forearms.

213
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:46,540
So find that place on yourself.
I'm going to play the video again,

214
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,640
but um, if you make just a pinch
of skin with your finger pads,

215
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,300
just a gentle pinch of
skin and pull up on it.

216
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,460
And when the video starts,

217
00:15:57,461 --> 00:16:02,461
you could slowly let down on the pinch
and then draw up again as the video goes

218
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:06,154
up.

219
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,510
Now it's coming down,
you're letting go of your pinch,

220
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
and then you're pulling up.

221
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,880
Images are so amazing.
Yeah.

222
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,940
So that kind of shape shifting is going
on inside your body with every movement

223
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:36,340
that you make while you're breathing.

224
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,420
While you're brushing your teeth
while you're rolling over in bed.

225
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,750
Okay,

226
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,640
this is another one of gene Bertos,
um,

227
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,110
videos and it takes place in the same
place, but it's a little different.

228
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:56,730
It's magnified 10 times.
The other one was magnified 20 times.

229
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,820
And this one is also a
deeper place in the forearm.

230
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:04,821
So take the palm of one hand and press
it lightly against the skin just below

231
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:10,521
your elbow as if those two layers of
skin where move or adhered to each other.

232
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,490
And then what you do is just a gentle
pulling down of this skin toward your

233
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:20,940
wrist. And you might be able to feel
that you're not just pulling on skin,

234
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:25,941
but other layers are moving underneath
and then draw up toward your elbow with

235
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,910
that same thing.

236
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,230
So that's what's going on here.

237
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,340
The bubbles that you see are because
of the difference in pressure between

238
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:51,810
what's going on,
the incision and the air outside

239
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,760
pressure differential.

240
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,240
Notice that changing direction
of these microfibers,

241
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,710
how they keep reorienting themselves,

242
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,080
changing their polarities.

243
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,320
It's like a crystal and
kaleidoscope inside you.

244
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,410
So you keep your fascia healthy by moving.

245
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,940
And the important thing is
movement in many directions.

246
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:34,980
So multidirectional movement,

247
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,460
not forward movement that's repetitive.

248
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,760
So if you had the choice between going
to a dance jam or working out on an

249
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,960
exercycle for the benefit of your Fascia,

250
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,710
you need to go dancing
probably for other reasons to

251
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,840
whole body stretches are
good for the fascist.

252
00:18:57,841 --> 00:19:01,080
So that Pandic culation
that we did before,

253
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,410
as long as it's a whole body
stretch and not just, you know,

254
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:07,860
this kind of stretch of
isolated muscles that people do,

255
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,590
that's a different thing.
Gentle bouncing movements.

256
00:19:12,591 --> 00:19:16,890
So if you went folk dancing,
that would be good for your Fascia.

257
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,210
Not Big leaps,

258
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:22,470
but just gentle bouncing
a micro movements.

259
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:24,900
We'll be doing some micro
movements in a few minutes.

260
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,700
These are small movements that
you can barely, barely see.

261
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:34,080
Certainly you can feel
the massage can help. Uh,

262
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:39,081
all of these suggestions don't cover
strength training or aerobic training.

263
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:43,290
You need that too. Of course,
this is fascist specific.

264
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:49,430
This image of an Mbr embryo is a
development about four to five weeks.

265
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But fascia emerges in
embryonic development earlier
than this and about two

266
00:19:57,301 --> 00:20:02,280
weeks. So fascia. Researchers
suggest that muscles,

267
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,590
bones, organs, in fact,

268
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,620
all other living tissue may in fact be
specializations within the unified medium

269
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,800
of Fascia.

270
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,110
So that's a very different way
of thinking about how we evolve.

271
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,340
Then the idea that we're just a
bunch of parts stuck together.

272
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,620
Everything in the fashion system is
interconnected and fluid and you can feel

273
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:35,190
this when you breathe.
So let's try.

274
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,710
So if you would just be comfortable
and if you feel like closing your eyes,

275
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:44,100
sometimes that helps you
feel your body more readily.

276
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,850
It's just go inside and feel the sort of
swelling and settling of your chest as

277
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:53,710
you inhale and exhale,

278
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,690
just a little expansion
and then diminishment

279
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,480
and you could feel it
probably also in your belly,

280
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:10,320
a little puffing up and letting go

281
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,470
and then turn your attention to your
shoulder blades and see if you can feel

282
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:24,100
them sliding maybe apart from each other,

283
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,410
maybe up a little bit.
As you inhale and resting down,

284
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,950
shoulder blades move apart
so the rib cage can expand

285
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,620
and then drop your awareness
down into your forearms.

286
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:48,790
There are two bones in your forearms
and he in each forearm and there's a

287
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:50,840
membrane in between.

288
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:55,841
So imagine that membrane swelling and
settling as you breathe in and out,

289
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,363
and then

290
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,400
come down into your lower legs.

291
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:13,401
See if you can go that far down and feel
your fascia moving as you breathe in

292
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,850
between the lower leg bones.

293
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,610
It's interesting that

294
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,260
the place where you feel a sensation in
your brain is the same place that you

295
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,870
imagine a sensation.
It's a sensory cortex,

296
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,760
so it doesn't matter if you think you're
only imagining it, it's good enough.

297
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,240
Drop down into your souls.

298
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,570
See if you can feel that when you inhale,

299
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:51,920
there's the slightest
pressure down into your shoes.

300
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,993
Yeah,

301
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,650
and let yourself imagine that
tensile matrix that we saw earlier.

302
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,020
Imagine it throughout your whole body,

303
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,980
all those little fibers
changing their orientation.

304
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,030
Thank you. You can open your
eyes. Could you feel a bit?

305
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,190
Imagine you felt,

306
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,200
but it will be a while before our culture
learns to see the body as continuous

307
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:36,450
and connected.
We think of the body and bits and pieces.

308
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,740
When we have a pain, we blame
it. On an isolated part.

309
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,470
We exercise isolated separate muscles.

310
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,960
We do lat pulls,
an Ab crunches.

311
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:49,940
Okay.

312
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,500
And when we want to
portray images of power,

313
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:57,470
we just add more and stiffer parts.

314
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,490
Okay?

315
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:07,490
This model suggests a way of conceiving
how the body is held together.

316
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,660
So it is you seeing struts held
in place by a network of tension.

317
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,150
Okay?

318
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,470
In terms of the body,

319
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:23,471
the elastic lines are your soft
tissues and the struts are your bones.

320
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,680
Ideally, your bones are floating
in a network of soft tissue.

321
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,450
This architectural principle is
called tensional tensional integrity,

322
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,870
or as Buckminster Fuller
called it 10 Segretti.

323
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,910
And you can see that if you change the
tension in just one of those strings,

324
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,890
the whole structure
would change its shape,

325
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,320
change its orientation a little bit,

326
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,670
and that's true inside us.
That's how we work too.

327
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,790
Even the vertebrae,

328
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,300
the Individual Vertebra in your spine
can float and respond inside this network

329
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,020
of tension,
but we don't think of it that way.

330
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:18,850
We talk about the spine as a column.
On the right,

331
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,040
you see a 10 Segretti tower.

332
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,510
It's a sculpture by a man
named Kenneth Snelson.

333
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,750
It's in the Washington
National Mall in Washington,

334
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,520
and you can see that it's more
similar in quality to the spine.

335
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,160
Then the Washington monument is,

336
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,240
okay,

337
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,240
so how do we learn to behave more like
bio 10 secretaries and less like stacks

338
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:49,070
of bricks?
Well,

339
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:54,071
it's helpful to think or imagine back
to prehistoric times how the body might

340
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,710
have functioned in those days.

341
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,200
So our prehistoric ancestors had to
move their bodies in order to survive.

342
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,780
So you could imagine what kind of
movements they might've had to do to kill

343
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:14,240
their breakfast or heard their cattle.

344
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:20,050
So they'd be crouching or
throwing or digging or lifting,

345
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,040
carrying stuff. And none of that
would be predictable or repetitive,

346
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,270
constantly changing movement,
large body movements.

347
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,523
Also,

348
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,820
they would be traveling
in bare feet or skins,

349
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,700
uh,
on uneven terrain,

350
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,320
which had a pebbles and foreigns in it.
So their,

351
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,740
their feet had to be extremely
mobile to navigate the ground

352
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,610
and that mobility and the feet would
play up through the whole fascist system.

353
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,880
So every joint in the body would have
to respond to the movements of the feet.

354
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,270
So that's an example of micro movement.
In a sense,

355
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,840
and these movements, large and
small, must have kept their fashion.

356
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:13,070
I healthy,
I like to think that anyway.

357
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,300
And they had to have a panoramic
view of their surroundings.

358
00:27:19,301 --> 00:27:24,301
They had to have 360 degree awareness
through their all their senses,

359
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:29,970
through hearing sight.
All the factory 10th,

360
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,780
uh,
sent felt feeling sense

361
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,790
and it's as if they had eyes
in the backs of their heads.

362
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,650
But with us, we're always
looking forward just this way,

363
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,390
this way forward. So let's
practice something. Uh,

364
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:54,391
I want to see if you can feel the
benefit of having a more broad peripheral

365
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,761
awareness.

366
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:02,761
So you need to stand up again so you
could [inaudible] it's a good idea.

367
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,290
There's certain noises
that go with [inaudible].

368
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,880
Yeah,
it could be louder.

369
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,560
Okay. So find a detail somewhere
around you. Not a person,

370
00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:22,420
but something you could look at.

371
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:27,421
Could be the screen or it could
be exit sign or a Thermostat,

372
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:30,760
some detail that you could gaze that with.

373
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:35,761
A lot of intensity of vision that you
have to write a report about this thing

374
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:41,860
and it's due tomorrow and your job
depends on it. So really look, look hard.

375
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,970
Keep that. Keep that intensity.
And notice your breathing.

376
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,030
Notice where it's located in your body.

377
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Notice the relationship between your
torso and your neck and jaw and head.

378
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,660
Notice the sensation in your eyes.

379
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,130
Notice where your weight is on your feet

380
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,800
and how big you feel in
general. Okay, so relax that.

381
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,740
Just shake it out.
Yeah,

382
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:26,100
just we want to neutralize ourselves
so we can do something else.

383
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,990
Thank you.
So now put your fingers out like this.

384
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:35,991
Wiggle your fingers and you can see
peripherally without still looking at me.

385
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:38,340
You can still see what's
beyond your fingers.

386
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:41,350
You could put your hands down
now and just keep looking

387
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,390
so that you have a sense of
the periphery of the room.

388
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,400
And you also notice something about
what's above your head. You can feel it.

389
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,470
And because you walked in here,
you know what's behind you.

390
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,610
You have a kinesthetic
memory of what's behind you.

391
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,610
So you have a broad perceptual awareness.

392
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:08,291
Yeah.

393
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:13,180
So I want you to see if you can keep
that and then turn and look at your same

394
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,490
object that you looked at before.

395
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,620
And I'd like to suggest some things
that may or may not be different.

396
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,920
There are different when I
teach this to different people.

397
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:29,921
So I think it's possible that your
breathing lower in your rib cage,

398
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,650
not so high in your upper chest.

399
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,940
Uh,
I think your eyes feel softer

400
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:43,340
and that you feel less
merged with that object.

401
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,720
There's more of a sense of you
being here and it being over there.

402
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,160
Also, it's possible that you
see the object in its context.

403
00:30:55,161 --> 00:30:58,280
So your report is going
to be more interesting.

404
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,363
Okay.

405
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,630
So great.
Thank you very much.

406
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,840
I like to think of this as
10 Segretti of perception.

407
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,480
So what I mean by that is by having these
little feelers out in all directions,

408
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,710
you establish a virtual
network in the space,

409
00:31:21,711 --> 00:31:26,711
a virtual network of potential directions
of movement through the space that

410
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:30,500
actually helps support your body.

411
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,420
And I think you felt that you had
better posture the second time. Yes,

412
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,500
you will. You are bigger. Yeah.

413
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:44,530
And so this awareness of our surroundings
helps our bodies open up on the inside

414
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:52,160
as well as on the outside.
So we have better posture.

415
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,620
We actually have more strength,

416
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:59,060
which if you stay for the little
class afterwards, I can show you that.

417
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,100
So picture the movements
you make to get to work,

418
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:06,200
to get up, get your breakfast, go to work,

419
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,020
and the movements that you
make while you're at work.

420
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,980
I might be different at Google
than it is other places,

421
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:17,981
but generally in offices
your movements are curtailed.

422
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,840
You don't have a lot of movement.

423
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Most of it is in the forward plane
and your perceptions are narrowed.

424
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,440
So I think it's important for us
humans to acknowledge that the amazing

425
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:40,061
conveniences that were living with in
this time may be diminishing our body's

426
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:45,620
natural capacity for
movement and perception.

427
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,440
So we want to change that.
I think

428
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,940
what can we do about sitting and
standing and moving in the workplace now?

429
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,040
So an expensive ergonomic chair is not
the answer because it's doesn't guarantee

430
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,440
that you're going to sit in a,
in a balanced way. This chair,

431
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:13,130
like many has a dip towards
the back of the seat.

432
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,640
So that dip tends to roll the pelvis back
and invite your spine to lean against

433
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:24,300
the backrest.
Most modern chairs are like this.

434
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:29,190
You slide back,
car seats are the worst.

435
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:32,730
Those buckets,
seats are designed to prevent movement.

436
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,273
Um,

437
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,580
if human spines don't need back
support when we're standing up,

438
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,990
why would we need them when we're seated?
While we don't,

439
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,780
as long as the pelvis is sitting
at the right inclination.

440
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,380
So that inclination
involves having a 45 degree,

441
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:02,770
a greater than 45 degree angle
between the hip and the thigh.

442
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:05,810
Yeah.

443
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,810
So this is Charles and you can see that
he's sitting more upright and on the

444
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,880
left and his weight,

445
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,560
some of his weight is being born
through his feet and his legs,

446
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:23,360
about maybe 40% of his weight
is born through legs and feet.

447
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:29,140
And so he has a broader base of support
and when his thighs are slanting down

448
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,480
hill that way,

449
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,020
and that forward inclination of the pelvis
creates an automatic lift through the

450
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,284
spine.

451
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:45,370
In the other picture where he's in
sitting in a lower chair that invites his

452
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,650
pelvis to roll back.
Like I was describing,

453
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,880
modern chairs are inviting you
to do in these chairs right here.

454
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,800
And so he's sitting on his
tailbone, on his buttocks, flesh.

455
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,190
His whole torso is compressed.

456
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,410
He looks Duller, his head
is poking forward, you know?

457
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,550
So let's practice this.

458
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,990
So unfortunately these chairs don't
raise and lower, but we can make,

459
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:19,640
do I think you can feel something if you
don't mind sitting more forward on them.

460
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,020
So imagine that's a bench or a stool,

461
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,950
not a chair with a back.
Yeah, already. That's better.

462
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,390
See, you can do it. All right.

463
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:36,560
So on purpose,
I'd like you to roll back this role,

464
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,250
this of your anatomy back like Charles
is doing in the right hand picture.

465
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,690
And notice what happened
to your spine and torso.

466
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,800
You compress these stay there.
I want you to really feel it.

467
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,350
So you're sitting on your buttocks
flash, right? Maybe on your tailbone.

468
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,860
Take a nice full easy breath.

469
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,620
Yeah. So it's like really not
easy to do that, you know?

470
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,090
But we get used to this.

471
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,290
We drank a lot of coffee because we're
not getting enough oxygen. All right,

472
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:16,420
stay there one more time.
One more thing.

473
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:21,421
I'd like you to notice how
creative you feel in that position.

474
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,720
And then just from there,
roll your pelvis forward.

475
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:34,090
So you can think of it different ways
you can think of having your pubic bone

476
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:38,440
farther from your belly button.
You can think of having, uh,

477
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,800
your tail moving more in back behind you.

478
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,400
And you're sitting now on the flesh of
your thighs rather than the flesh of your

479
00:36:47,711 --> 00:36:48,544
buttocks.

480
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,150
So it make sense and you feel there's
more weight on your feet so you have more

481
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:57,340
support.
Yeah.

482
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,970
So I'd like to take this
a little bit farther.

483
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:05,650
If you don't mind reaching underneath
yourself. Find your left sit bone.

484
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:10,660
It's just in front of the gluteal
flesh. And you're right. Sit Bone.

485
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,590
Yeah.

486
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,950
And while you're back there,
find your coxix.

487
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:21,530
Just touch it so you really,
really know where it is. Okay.

488
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:26,531
So now stay seated on your thighs
and look down inside yourself.

489
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:30,320
You'll see that those three
points make a triangle.

490
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,140
So that makes sense. You feel that? Nod
your head. It's, these lights are glaring.

491
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:39,230
I can't see.
All right,

492
00:37:39,231 --> 00:37:44,231
so that triangle is called the post
steer or triangle of your pelvic floor or

493
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:48,830
the anal triangle of the
pelvic floor. And notice. Now,

494
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:53,480
if you roll back and sit
more towards the buttocks,

495
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,770
that that anal triangle got smaller,
more compressed.

496
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:03,340
So that area is at the bottom of your
gut tube that connects all the way up to

497
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:04,994
your throat.

498
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:11,050
So how well can you can digest your
lunch when you're in that compressed

499
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,590
position?
Let's,

500
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,380
uh,
roll forward now once more.

501
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,310
And going to take this
still a little bit farther.

502
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,120
This is a female pelvic floor,

503
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:33,121
but the anatomy of the muscular
apparatus is pretty much the same for all

504
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:37,900
genders.
And you notice that triangle I outlined,

505
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:41,020
the anal triangle.

506
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,640
And notice at the bottom,
the Anal Cox, a GL ligament.

507
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,080
That's a little tiny slip
of Fascia between your anal
sphincter and your coxix.

508
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,210
So we're going to experiment
with a micro movement of that.

509
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,310
So you need to be sitting
comfortably upright on your thighs,

510
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:09,090
not leaning back on this backrest and
see if you can draw your coxix just a few

511
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:18,061
millimeters closer to your anal sphincter
without disturbing anything else.

512
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,760
That's good. You're
doing it. All right. So,

513
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,670
okay,

514
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:30,360
let's undo it.
So go back the other way.

515
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:35,361
See if you can just imagine that
ligament lengthening your coxix link

516
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,070
lengthening back.
Okay,

517
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:41,130
so I wish you could see
yourselves because there's this,

518
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:45,960
you're all sitting with nice posture,
but there's this diminishing.

519
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,860
Maybe you could feel it inside
yourself deep inside your anybody.

520
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,820
Let's do it again. You
might, you might feel it.

521
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:01,980
So be open and big and on your thighs,
on your feet.

522
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,290
Just move the coccsyx forward
towards the anal sphincter

523
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,290
and there's just a slight
shriveling up inside.

524
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,020
And then reverse it and go the other way.

525
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,103
Yeah,

526
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,343
so

527
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:33,790
there's a difference in the and what
happens inside your body when there's

528
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:35,950
tension around this area.

529
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Most of us have fallen on our coxix or
had some kind of injury to the pelvic

530
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:46,601
floor sometime in our life and yet we
don't speak of it except jokes on late

531
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,280
night TV. You know, it's
important to think about it.

532
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:58,330
The intro sectors in your Fascia help
you feel that subtle change in your

533
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:03,500
posture that happens
because of your tail space.

534
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:10,690
So I can't resist talking about this.

535
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,050
It's in the news, right? This thing

536
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,880
I've been teaching
sitting for a long time,

537
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,910
and I've wondered why it is that it's
harder for men to comfortably be seated

538
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,350
upright in the pelvis,
harder for men and women.

539
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,740
So I've been asking around and what people
have told me is that there can be an

540
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:40,880
uncomfortable friction between
the skin of the scrotum,

541
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,060
the underwear,
and the genes.

542
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,470
So all of that kind of rubs
together like layers of Fascia.

543
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,760
So in order to sit upright,

544
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,680
it would require a manual adjustment
you're not going to make in public, right?

545
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,670
So I've also,

546
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,270
men have also told me that underwear
that supports the genital sooner,

547
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,920
more forward position makes it
easier to sit upright in the pelvis.

548
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,900
So I'm not gonna tell you what kind of
underwear to wear it guys, I'm really not.

549
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,440
But I will tell you that the orientation
of your pelvis makes a huge difference

550
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,090
to the decompression of your
spine and to your posture

551
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,030
going forward.
So take a look at old men

552
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,930
walking down the street and
notice they have no tail space.

553
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,180
I promise you they don't.

554
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,460
Okay.
So here,

555
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,360
if you can see there's a blue cushion
that Melanie is about to sit down on.

556
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:56,830
It's a desk about this big
and you blow it up with air,

557
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,820
but not very much so it's not bouncy.
It's more like sitting on a water bed.

558
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,100
So when she sits on it,

559
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
there can be a subtle reverberation.

560
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,630
You might see a subtle reverberation
of her spine as her pelvis just sort of

561
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:20,180
floats on that cushion.

562
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,440
So that's actually helping to pump
fluids into those micro fibers.

563
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:34,080
It's qualifies as a micro movement and
micro movements are good for your Fascia.

564
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,500
There are new articles every day about
the kind of exercise that you can do to

565
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:53,720
maintain your heart health, your
brain health, your longevity.

566
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,760
I'm talking about your fashion health
and sitting as particularly detrimental

567
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,193
for Fascia.

568
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,220
The hip joint is a ball and socket joint
like this and that's great for movement

569
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,340
is terrible for stability.

570
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:19,010
So when you sit with your legs at
that angle for long, long hours,

571
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:20,150
without much movement,

572
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,720
the Fascia around your hip and down
through your legs and thighs gets tighter

573
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:30,050
and matted and, and you
know, more uncomfortable.

574
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,070
So

575
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:37,070
it would be great if
when you take a break,

576
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,280
no, it's recommended that, uh,

577
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,120
people who sit go five
minutes every hour moving.

578
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:45,890
Do you have you,

579
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:50,010
have you heard that every hour you're
supposed to get up and move for five

580
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:52,410
minutes?
I think it's probably hard to do,

581
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,740
but if you did it,

582
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,090
it would be better to do this right,
to do this,

583
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,320
than to just walk around because
it's nondirectional movement.

584
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:05,790
It's innovative movement.

585
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:10,170
So think about what if people
did this around Google.

586
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:14,310
It would be just like taking
a coffee break, you know,

587
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,850
it's not shameful to move your body.

588
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:22,080
It's not embarrassing to
do what your body needs.

589
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,070
You just simply have to recognize
that your body needs it.

590
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,720
And I think you need to take perception
breaks because looking at I'm focused

591
00:45:35,771 --> 00:45:40,771
object for a long time induces us sort
of a hypnotic trance and you know that

592
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:47,200
you work. And Work and you think, well,
just one more thing and then I'll get up,

593
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,720
right?
Just have to keep going.

594
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,060
So you need to purposefully
break the trance every so often.

595
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:59,560
One way is to put attention
into the soles of your feet.

596
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:03,820
So you could do that right now.
Just drop your attention down there.

597
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:07,450
Feel the skin of your
feet inside your shoes.

598
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,950
You could even feel your feet
breathing like you did before.

599
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,720
You could feel the little
cleavages in between your toes.

600
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,720
Feel your toenails,
but you're still listening to me,

601
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,400
right? But you're also present
in the lower part of your body.

602
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,570
I think what happens with
computers and technology so,

603
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:36,870
so often is that the energy of the
being gets drawn up into this part,

604
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,423
upper body.

605
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:45,750
I also recommend using urgency as a
trigger to widen your perceptual field.

606
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:52,450
So you know how you develop that
broad perceptual field earlier.

607
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:57,670
Okay? So let's, let's try something. If
you just take out your phone right now,

608
00:46:57,671 --> 00:46:59,560
just reach it down and get your phone.

609
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:10,080
Okay? So notice your state the minute
you have the phone in your hand.

610
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,500
All right? Can you feel what I'm
talking about? It's like you go there,

611
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,440
it's like you disappear into the phone.

612
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:23,190
So the phone could be a queue.

613
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,800
A device could be a queue.
So keep the phone in your hand,

614
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,590
but take a moment to widen
your perceptual field.

615
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,270
So however you do that,

616
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:39,100
especially think of the space
behind your body that really helps

617
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:44,350
and keep that space and then
check Twitter. You can do it.

618
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:49,300
Okay.

619
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,200
It might slow you down a nanosecond.
I don't think that's bad,

620
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:59,550
but it's a way of being present with your
device rather than present inside your

621
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:01,834
device.

622
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:10,940
So when you're not at work, or maybe
even when you are, because you're here,

623
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:16,790
you could sit on the floor and the
benefit of that is it opens up those hip

624
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:21,791
joints that have been compressed and
restricted by sitting on too many chairs.

625
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,800
You could have lunch sitting on the floor,
you could watch a movie,

626
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,960
and unless you override the impulse,

627
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:40,600
you Pandic you late every
morning when you wake up,

628
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,210
it primes your body and primes
your Fascia for the day ahead.

629
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:52,120
So it's good.
Don't override it.

630
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:55,120
If we're going to persist
doing sedentary work,

631
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,520
we need to become less self
conscious about our need to move.

632
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,110
So here,

633
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:12,970
see if you can see the way the movement
translates through her legs and hips up

634
00:49:14,931 --> 00:49:16,070
into her spine.

635
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:20,993
All of them,

636
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:25,170
the burdens on their heads
help decompress the spine.

637
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,960
So spinal movement is more accessible,

638
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:32,310
but notice the harmony in
the rhythm of these people.

639
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,870
And there's us.

640
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,540
I think we need to create a culture,

641
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:59,330
environments and designs that are kinder
to the human body than the hard flat

642
00:50:00,921 --> 00:50:05,240
surfaces and square rooms that
we've boxed ourselves into.

643
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,620
Google is known for innovation.

644
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,620
So I'd like to leave you with a challenge.

645
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:17,750
I hope you can use your design thinking,

646
00:50:17,751 --> 00:50:22,751
your engineering to help redesign the
way the world works so that people might

647
00:50:25,461 --> 00:50:28,880
have to move more in to do their work.

648
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,360
I don't know how this could happen,
but I think you do.

649
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,310
And if you move more,
two things will happen.

650
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:41,300
It generates creative ideas
and it improves your posture.

651
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,960
So the last screen is
just, uh, some websites.

652
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,470
For more information you can
learn about fashion fitness.

653
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:56,390
I just briefly glossed over it.
The man's name, Robert Slide,

654
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:58,880
this one of,
he's a Rolfer in Germany.

655
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:02,660
He's also one of the
foremost Fascia researchers.

656
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:08,000
So he's developed a program.
Then there's junk call gene Bartos,

657
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,510
a website in case you're
interested in those images.

658
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,440
The International Association
of structural integrators
lists about 17 different

659
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:21,950
schools,
which teach the legacy of Ida Rolf.

660
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:27,190
She could learn more about that and my
website will tell you when my new book is

661
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,800
happening and I have a

662
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,380
newsletter but it,

663
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,300
I don't send it out very often so you
don't get inundated by stuff by me.

664
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,940
So thank you so much.

665
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,190
Thank you.

666
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,000
Oh, there's a question. That's great.
So you know when you said sit forward,

667
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:55,030
you know I did that and
I feel good and it's up,

668
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:59,020
but I get tired and then when I leaned
back I feel like I'm resting again.

669
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,010
So how do I not feel like I'm using
all my muscles or something to sit?

670
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:03,981
Right? Well, you all,

671
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:08,360
you will be using muscles that you
don't use because you're leaning back

672
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,230
habitually and you know, I don't know
how long you've been leaning back

673
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,360
many decades, but a decade
or two, right? Yeah.

674
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:20,270
And so you need to work
through that little by little,

675
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:22,040
I think of titration,
you know,

676
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:27,041
when you just go drop by drop to make a
change rather than expecting yourself to

677
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:30,950
sit upright all the time. But
it really will help. Help,

678
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:35,970
help to open up that tail
space and to get a broad uh,

679
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,853
support.

680
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,820
I should just practice a little
bit to do it a little. Yeah,

681
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,070
bet.
And sit back.

682
00:52:41,071 --> 00:52:46,071
Maybe you could associate sitting upright
with certain tasks and leaning back

683
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:47,760
with other kinds of tasks.

684
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,650
Okay. And then try and buy us
myself more towards sitting up

685
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,760
of course. Okay. And exercise. Go dancing.

686
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,190
All right.
Can I have a prescription for that?

687
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:03,570
Yeah, I'm glad you felt it. You know,

688
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,890
and it does take a little bit of,

689
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:10,330
of a sincere desire to make that change.

690
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:15,930
And also in movie theaters you have to
just lean back because otherwise no one

691
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:21,250
can see around you. Yeah. There's one,

692
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,380
one trend behind,
I still use the ball.

693
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:25,710
It's just curious what you think
about that. Sitting on a ball.

694
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:26,550
Yeah.

695
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:31,500
Well that cushion I showed you that
cushion that's available, you know,

696
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:32,970
you search for it,
you'll find it.

697
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,680
So that was my solution because the
problem with the sitting on a ball is it

698
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:41,580
makes you sit like this.
Right? So I think it's,

699
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,560
it's better for the hip joints not
to be stuck in that wide position.

700
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:51,090
And also the ball tends to
roll back a little too much.

701
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:56,130
So I really like that Christian idea
cause it's almost like sitting on a ball.

702
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:01,380
What's the, yeah. Uh,
it's called disc. Oh sit.

703
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,340
And it's on Amazon disco said.
Yeah,

704
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:07,230
it's a disk on which you sit.

705
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:13,590
You are talking about having peripheral
vision and as a glasses where I wonder

706
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:19,231
if you have any thoughts or insights on
contacts versus glasses being like I've

707
00:54:20,171 --> 00:54:25,171
definitely find my awareness is much
more like when this is all blurry.

708
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:30,570
Um, so I wonder if you had feelings
on that. For sure. I wear glasses too,

709
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,430
but I noticed that and this thing that I
taught you is one of the most important

710
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:39,390
things I ever teach anybody is
this awareness of the space,

711
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:41,010
especially the space behind you.

712
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:46,011
There's something magical about
that that makes you feel supported.

713
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:51,870
And it has, uh, I don't think it
matters whether you wear glasses or not.

714
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,291
I mean,

715
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:57,291
the fact the glasses do focus our
attention towards that a forward gaze.

716
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,420
But that doesn't mean we can't be
aware when you felt the effect. Right?

717
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,150
Yeah, yeah. There's an effect.
That's what matters. Okay. Yeah.

718
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,780
Yeah. Oh my gosh. Lots of question.
I'm going to go over here first.

719
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,860
All right.

720
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,860
So I heard over the year it's sort of
to a competing notions of posture and,

721
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:23,740
and you touched on one very nicely,

722
00:55:23,741 --> 00:55:28,741
which is this tensegrity idea that the
body is a dynamic system supported by the

723
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:35,680
last density and by structure.
And then a second one that talks about,

724
00:55:35,681 --> 00:55:35,981
you know,

725
00:55:35,981 --> 00:55:40,981
this kind of rootedness where your
stacks of blocks stacking your bones and

726
00:55:41,711 --> 00:55:42,970
trying to make sure that you're,

727
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:47,260
you're well supported through
your skeleton or there's
actually contradictory,

728
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:51,340
or is there if there was some
underlying principle behind them? Both.

729
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:53,493
I don't,

730
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,900
I like to think that they're both work.

731
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:04,890
But if you could have a stack of blocks
that was floating in a 10 sea grill

732
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:06,130
apparatus,

733
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,160
wouldn't that be better than just
compression block upon block upon block?

734
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:16,690
So I think I to Ralph's idea was stacks
of blocks that you saw it in her logo.

735
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:22,290
And she also talked a lot about
Buckminster fuller and tensegrity.

736
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:25,690
So she had both things
happening when she taught us.

737
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:30,970
And I think she just had it both
ways and hadn't integrated them.

738
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,570
And I think that's still true.

739
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:39,190
And I know that there are times when I'm
a stack of blocks and I can't help it,

740
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,650
you know.
But if you,

741
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,680
if you just move more
towards the conception that
you're a 10 Segretti I think

742
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:53,161
already that makes a change
in how you embody this flush.

743
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,480
And maybe I'm being too poetic.

744
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:04,700
I think this is hard and I've
wrestled with it myself. So yeah,

745
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,910
so both and is what I'd say.

746
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:12,090
But go towards the 10 Segretti
side as much as you can. And you,

747
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,720
did you understand what I said about
the awareness of space being a way of

748
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,980
perceiving 10 seg? Really?
Does that make sense to you?

749
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:27,230
I can't see you very well. You're
nodding your heads. Okay, great. Thanks.

750
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,830
So you've made me feel a little
hostile towards my desk chair. Could

751
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,910
is just adding a cushion sufficient
if it's tipped back like that or,

752
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,770
or what else should I get?

753
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:47,490
Well I like those cushions.
It doesn't work for everybody,

754
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:52,491
but I've tried every kind of little
chair thing you could find cause I write

755
00:57:52,621 --> 00:57:56,590
books, you know, and I
found that having that,

756
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:00,690
that cushion that moves a
little bit, uh, is beneficial.

757
00:58:00,691 --> 00:58:03,630
There are chairs that move,
they're very expensive.

758
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:08,850
They are later on like a
spring and you can find them.

759
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:10,163
You know

760
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,500
what else you should do is

761
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,580
bring your headphones and jam
for five minutes once an hour.

762
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,960
I'm serious. Like, look, look
for a chair that's flat or, well,

763
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:30,160
the chair should be at a height.
If I can pantomime this,

764
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:35,370
that your hips are higher than your
knees and the more high the better.

765
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:41,910
So the more you perch rather than sit
the better because that invites your

766
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:44,170
pelvis to roll forward,

767
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,500
which gives you a lift through your
lumbar spine and on up through the rest of

768
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:54,190
you. You could email me, you know,

769
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,960
send me a picture of your
chair and I answer emails.

770
00:58:57,961 --> 00:59:02,920
So if you're struggling and you've,
you say, should I buy this chair?

771
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,970
You know? Thanks. Yeah.

772
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:13,320
Uh, so it's just standing
all day at your desk.

773
00:59:13,321 --> 00:59:18,240
A healthier than sitting at your
desk all day with no motion.

774
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:22,530
You're going to move more if standing,
I think,

775
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,920
hmm,
maybe not.

776
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,330
You know what I have at my kitchen sink,

777
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,070
which is the place where I stand the
most if I'm, and also I have a staff,

778
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:38,630
I have a platform for my
computer that's on a shelf.

779
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:43,490
So it's like a standing desk. And both
of those places I've put a pebble bath,

780
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,630
a doormat. Have you seen those
doormat? Made of pebbles.

781
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,640
So that allows your feed a
little sensory experience,

782
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,230
gives you a little movement there.

783
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,960
More and more things coming through
the internet of standing desks with

784
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:04,160
different kinds of wobble boards. And
there's one that looks like a skateboard.

785
01:00:04,161 --> 01:00:08,390
So you're like going like this. I don't
know how it would be. You have to tell me

786
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,873
thanks.

787
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:17,400
Um, having, uh, stood extensively
as well as using miniatures, um,

788
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:18,743
uh,

789
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:23,840
the chair is keeping you from your
normal fidgeting effectively. Yeah.

790
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:28,841
And I think that's why standing work so
well because so many of us tend to shift

791
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:33,300
from one leg to another lean one way
and then the other and the chair largely

792
01:00:33,301 --> 01:00:36,700
prevents that movement while
standing allows it just stand

793
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,850
otherwise, you know? Yeah. So fidget away.

794
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:44,370
Thank you.
That's really true about fidgeting,

795
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,320
um, about those last two
videos you showed. Yeah.

796
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:52,420
What I observed most distinctively
between them is the earlier video,

797
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:56,330
the developing world video with the
women carrying things on their head. Um,

798
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,350
besides the fact that they may have
been functioning more efficiently just

799
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:03,200
because they had to because
of the weights on their heads.

800
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:08,150
They were walking in, in what
you might call, you know,
Caribbean time. They there,

801
01:01:08,151 --> 01:01:11,450
they were walking at the rate that
was comfortable for their body.

802
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:16,520
So their body resonated naturally.
The, the people in the urban video,

803
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,300
we're rushing but not jogging.

804
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:24,070
So they were accelerating
a normal walk beyond the,

805
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:28,300
the natural speed of a normal walk,
at which point the bodies, um,

806
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,590
resonant frequency
doesn't match it anymore.

807
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:35,980
We are embarrassed to jog
because people will get upset.

808
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,420
They will think that something is wrong.

809
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:42,530
Yet we feel the need to get somewhere
faster because we're on the clock.

810
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:46,600
That is what I, I feel like
his is what drives that though?

811
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:48,590
Some of the people clearly
had health problems.

812
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,390
Well sure.
Well sure.

813
01:01:50,391 --> 01:01:54,950
But I showed the difference because
just so you see that, you know,

814
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:57,110
quality of experience,

815
01:01:57,111 --> 01:02:01,640
your mirror neurons pickup on
the movement that you look at.

816
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:04,970
[inaudible] so first
about the first video,

817
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,930
I have a hunch that it
was slowed down slightly.

818
01:02:08,931 --> 01:02:13,490
It was a little bit in slow motion,
so it wasn't quite accurate. Um,

819
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,540
and the other one,
if any of those people jog do,

820
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:22,320
they would be jogging on hard surfaces.
So there's no rebound,

821
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,120
no gift from the earth.

822
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,400
So it would be jarring to the
spine and the whole body, you know?

823
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:31,620
So I'm all for it,

824
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:34,830
for more of us running to do things,

825
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,500
but we've paved paradise,
you know?

826
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,620
So I don't know the answer,

827
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:45,060
but I'm suggesting that
you do collectively.

828
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,733
Yeah.

829
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,760
Thank you so much for those questions.

830
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:53,350
Great.
