1
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,870
Thank you.

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,440
Thank you. No, thank you.

3
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,320
Well, Secretary Clinton, welcome back
to Google. It's great to be here. Eric,

4
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,590
thank you. Grown a little bit
since I've been here. Last

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,660
just a little,
are you talking about my weight?

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,050
I knew I gained some pounds here.
No,

7
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,490
the company is much larger
and even more successful.

8
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:50,690
And thank you for your first visit.
We're here to talk about your book, um,

9
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,470
which you know, I've actually read.
Thank you. I did want to present you,

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,470
I did want to present you
with my book and I won.

11
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,190
It's entitled how Google Works and I
want you to notice something that's

12
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:05,750
different between your book and my book.
Now your book,

13
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,990
your book is 600 pages in very,
uh, lots of, lots of words.

14
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,020
My book is 37 pages and it uses big type
and my book has black and white photos

15
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:19,580
and yours has color photos.
So on a pound for pound basis,

16
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:21,620
my book is more valuable.

17
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:24,431
Well,

18
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:27,310
but there are many things you can do
with my book that you can't do with this

19
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:31,090
book such as well you can work out. So
you know, you can work out with my book,

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,360
you can work out with your boss,
a lovely and,

21
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:37,960
and if you get two copies you'll be
balanced while you're working out.

22
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,680
You can use it as a doorstop.
This would just wipe under the door.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,690
Imagine using that as a doorstop. So
I don't know. I think it's kind of

24
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,040
a Justin draw,
don't you think?

25
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,850
Well at some point we're going
to be talking about book,

26
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,980
but I want you to notice that my book,
my book is so short,

27
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,630
you can read it during this interview.

28
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,060
Well I have to say there is a particularly
attractive picture of you on page 31

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,150
wearing some kind of ridiculous hat,
um,

30
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,050
with some model of an airplane and
a picture of Bill Gates in the back.

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,420
Let's get to work.

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,240
So Secretary Clinton,
your book is entitled hard choices.

33
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:21,810
And what we're going to do is
when I have some questions, Jimmy,

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,490
we have some dory questions
that is submitted from the
audience and we have some

35
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:28,160
live questions as well. And, um,

36
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,610
the first one is want to ask you is
that you and I had a very dear friend,

37
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:36,230
Richard Holbrook who died unexpectedly
of a heart attack and you had appointed

38
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:39,980
him to do the negotiation and Afghanistan.

39
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,050
Do you think that his death affected the
outcome and Afghanistan as a brilliant

40
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:46,760
negotiator?
Did we miss him that much?

41
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:51,080
Did we end up in roughly the right place
in Afghanistan at the end of it all?

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,220
There's two parts to that
question. Let me address. Um,

43
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,040
our friend Richard Holbrooke.
First he was in my view, uh,

44
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,270
the premier diplomat of our generation.

45
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:06,070
He was dramatic when called for,
he was persistent,

46
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,630
he was tough minded,

47
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,990
but he believed passionately that you
couldn't end a war if you didn't talk to

48
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:17,770
the people on the other side. Now
that may sound simplistic, but indeed,

49
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:22,060
that's a huge obstacle for
many in diplomacy, politics,

50
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:25,360
governments to get over.
How do you end a war? Uh,

51
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,790
if you talk to the people you despise,

52
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,960
who you view as the troublemakers,

53
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,290
the instigators and Richard came at a,

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,900
the assignment I asked him to take on
behalf of the president and myself, uh,

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,120
with that strong conviction born
out of as many years of experience.

56
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,600
And in particular his ending
of the wars in the Balkans.

57
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,560
When my husband was president,
he spent a lot of time with Milosevic,

58
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,540
a most unsavory character.
He drank with him.

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,180
He yelled at him,
he bullied him,

60
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,280
he listened to him and eventually was
able to get to the date and peace accords,

61
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:08,281
which ended the war even though it didn't
end all of the political and ethnic

62
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:12,640
and other problems that are unfortunately,
I'm still prevalent.

63
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,620
When I asked him to take on the
task in Afghanistan and Pakistan,

64
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,310
he went at it with his same level
of commitment, even relish. Uh,

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,310
and as I write in the book,

66
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,270
we were beginning a process of,
uh,

67
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,050
reaching out to and responding
to outreach from the Taliban.

68
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,680
And I gave a speech that tried to make
the case that that might be distasteful.

69
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:42,580
It certainly was to me for many reasons
as to how they treat people in general

70
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,870
and women in particular.

71
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,580
But there had to be a political
negotiation in order to
try to end the conflict.

72
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,040
And literally the day he died, uh, in, uh,

73
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,140
was he ha he suffered a terrible,
um,

74
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,340
attack in my office.

75
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,290
We were talking about the first meeting
that we had engineered between a,

76
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,500
an American diplomat, one of
Richard's lieutenants, uh, and, uh,

77
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:13,990
a representative of Moolah Omar.
I guess the short answer, Eric,

78
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:17,800
is that Richard would never
take no for an answer.

79
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,100
We had a lot of difficulties both with
President Karzai because he didn't want

80
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,590
us talking to the Taliban and we had
problems with the Taliban because they

81
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,270
didn't want to talk to President Karzai.

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,370
So we were playing a kind of multilevel
chess game and trying to move the

83
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:38,040
parties closer to talking to each
other. Uh, and unfortunately, uh,

84
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,530
with Richard's death,
we kept up the initiative,

85
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:46,531
but we didn't have that same overpowering
presence that he brought to it now

86
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:51,580
where we are with Afghanistan and
Pakistan because we looked at them,

87
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,200
uh, very much as presenting
similar challenges, uh,

88
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,830
to a lasting, uh, and to threats
first of all to the region.

89
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,800
And even beyond, uh, is, uh, a,
an election that was held, uh,

90
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,840
that has been criticized for
irregularities that now finally,

91
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:17,240
and I give an secretary
Kerry credit for going there,

92
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:22,190
there's no substitute for going to
these places and staying and trying to

93
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,220
engineer some kind of solution that there
will now be a total audit of all the

94
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:30,380
votes in Afghanistan to determine
who the next president is.

95
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:33,610
And things are kind of on
hold until we know that. Uh,

96
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,310
what I think of as the three
biggest challenges is number one,

97
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,000
getting a new president in who
could keep Afghanistan unified. Uh,

98
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:46,310
despite all of the problems that
many of us had with President Karzai,

99
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,780
that was his primary goal,

100
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:52,170
to try to keep the country
unified and not fly off, uh,

101
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,200
in different ethnic directions.
Um,

102
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,330
and we need to support whoever that next
president is and do our best to give

103
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:04,100
him the authority that he needs to try
to keep the country unified. Secondly,

104
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,470
continuing to work with the
Afghan security forces, uh,

105
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,290
they have proven to be much
more dependable, effective, uh,

106
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,360
fighters,
uh,

107
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,620
taking the fight to the Taliban because
the Taliban is very clear that they

108
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,990
intend to reoccupied territory.

109
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:25,991
They lost to a coalition troops in the
last several years following the surge

110
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:29,080
that President Obama ordered a,

111
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,530
so continuing to work and support the
Afghan security forces and then finally

112
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,600
being well aware that so many of the
problems in Afghanistan are incubated in

113
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:43,430
Pakistan and the Pakistani government
is now facing some of the most serious

114
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:45,740
threats that it historically has.

115
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:48,860
Because as I say in the book,

116
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:53,170
they had an idea that was never going
to be workable for the longterm,

117
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,350
which is you can keep poisonous snakes
in your backyard and expect them only to

118
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,310
bite your neighbors.

119
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,170
And the Pakistani military
and intelligence establishment
have unfortunately

120
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:07,250
over years, uh, worked with supported, uh,

121
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,730
lots of the terrorist groups,
extremist groups for their own purposes,

122
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:14,660
some of which was to keep
Afghanistan, uh, kind of off kilter.

123
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,310
So there has to be a lot of, uh, effort
made to work with the Pakistanis,

124
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:20,990
as difficult as that is.

125
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,400
And that's something that I spent some
time on in the book because I worked very

126
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:28,990
hard to try to have as I'm effective,

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
a relationship as we could.
But at the end of the day,

128
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:36,440
the Pakistanis have to stand
up to the threat from within,

129
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,850
which is also a threat to, uh,
Afghanistan. And by the way,

130
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:44,900
a continuing threat to India.
So it's a, we've made progress,

131
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,550
but not nearly enough.

132
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,190
I was in fact seen a little bit after you
were an I sounded incredibly confusing

133
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:55,740
to figure out is that while I was there,
the President I met with was

134
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,640
gotten rid of by the supreme court over
something involving financial and this

135
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:04,320
child and his child. Um, in the book
you spent a fair amount of time on,

136
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:07,800
I think one of the significant foreign
policy achievements during your tenure

137
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,640
involving the pivot to Asia. Right?
And when I lay it out, right,

138
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,020
we've got the Pec San problems.

139
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:17,430
You were the first person to really open
up Burma, Myanmar met with an sung g, g,

140
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:22,370
et cetera. Um, but you start looking
at like the is an example of the,

141
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,070
that the Spratly islands and
this line called line nine, nine,

142
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,980
I in Japan and the others, it's
getting more confusing to an outsider.

143
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,690
You talk about the pivot.

144
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,740
Do you think that we understand
how to navigate now between these,

145
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,600
each of these countries is becoming more
nationalistic as it becomes stronger?

146
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,410
Right. Well, that is a trend that, um, uh,

147
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,440
I saw really beginning to take off and
it has a number of implications both for

148
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:59,050
the region, uh, but also for us
and the rest of the world. Um,

149
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,920
as China has gotten much
more economically powerful,

150
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:07,600
it's understandable that they,
um, want to project their power,

151
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,070
uh, but it's, uh, quite a threatening
to the rest of the region.

152
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,470
And what I saw as a,
uh,

153
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,530
a growing threat was the increasing a
budgetary resources going to the People's

154
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,450
Liberation Army,
uh,

155
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,440
to build up their naval capacity so
that they could project power, uh,

156
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,560
on the seas. Now the United States, uh,

157
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,570
primarily has kept the peace, uh, in, uh,

158
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,050
Asia on in navigable waters,
uh,

159
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,700
for the protection of commerce.

160
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,230
And our navy has been
a very positive force,

161
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:52,231
but it's clear to me that the Chinese
intend to challenge a American naval

162
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,310
superiority. That's their
perfect right to do. So.

163
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,240
There they are a sovereign country.
They get to make those decisions.

164
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,190
But the problems that Eric alluded to
are having a rebound effect around the

165
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:11,191
region so that if you see China developing
its first aircraft carrier with plans

166
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:14,980
for a number of more carriers,

167
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,390
and you see China being quite
aggressive on territorial claims,

168
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,600
not that they're willing
to arbitrate those claims,

169
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:27,601
but they're merely asserting them against
the Philippines and Vietnam and Japan

170
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,730
primarily. Now, um,

171
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,010
and you see that this could lead to
increasing tension and maybe even conflict

172
00:11:36,641 --> 00:11:39,370
in the region. Then we have, uh,

173
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:44,371
an opportunity but also a responsibility
to work closely with number one,

174
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,880
our allies because we have neutral
defense treaties with five nations in the

175
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:52,300
region. Obviously Japan and South
Korea and the Philippines, Australia,

176
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:53,650
but also Thailand.

177
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,010
So we our treaty bound to
work with and if necessary,

178
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,080
protect our allies.

179
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,470
Nobody wants to see any kind
of conflict that erupts.

180
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,320
Uh,

181
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,320
but when you look at what's happening
between China and Vietnam and China and

182
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,300
Japan and China and the Philippines,

183
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,080
this is going to take some
very careful management.

184
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:25,081
And so it's takes a combination of
America continuing to assert itself as a

185
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:30,151
Pacific power but intensive diplomacy
to try to send the message to China.

186
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,270
Why would you want to
disrupt 40% of global trade?

187
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,650
Why would you want to skirt the
edges of potential conflict?

188
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:43,300
And you see what it's happening in Japan.

189
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:48,301
Japan is getting much more nationalistic
and aggressive in response to that.

190
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:53,371
So this is going to be a
primary obligation and area
of concern for the United

191
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,293
States going forward.

192
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,020
It's very important that China is
ultimately does not become China.

193
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,460
And the people who are opposed to China,
yes,

194
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,520
you could set up for another hundred
years, some sort of, uh, uh, of a,

195
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,840
of a real contest. Well, you
know, one of the things, and I,

196
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:11,140
and I write about this because I
became aware, you know, China had,

197
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,440
when I became secretary of state to
issues that they repeatedly stressed as

198
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:21,640
their core interests,
Tibet and Taiwan. I mean,

199
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:25,000
that was every time you met with a
Chinese official what you would hear in

200
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:28,870
addition to everything else. And
you know, they were confused. Um,

201
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,640
by our support for the Tibetans
are openness to the Dalai Lama.

202
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,350
I had a,
uh,

203
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,740
a really vigorous disagreement with Jiang
men who was present at the end of the

204
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,110
nineties over Tibet because I kept
saying, China's a great country. I mean,

205
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:48,340
you're growing at 10 plus
percent at though in those years.

206
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,820
Why are you so obsessed with Tibet?
And he said,

207
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:56,020
why are you so obsessed with Tibet?
And we had this big back and forth,

208
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:56,831
and I said,
my goodness,

209
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,680
somebody meets with the Dalai Lama
and you want to write them out of the,

210
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,050
you know,
the global order practically.

211
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,240
But it's very deeply felt by the
Chinese and on Taiwan, obviously,

212
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:12,241
you all know starting in 2010 I'm in
one of these very long meetings that are

213
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:17,050
made longer because you have to have
consecutive translation in many of them.

214
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,440
Some of you have done business on behalf
of Google in China, you know that.

215
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,000
And all of a sudden it was Tibet,
Taiwan, and the South China Sea.

216
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:29,140
And I just sat up straight and I thought,
what do you mean the South China Sea?

217
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,530
So I began to engage with my counterparts.

218
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,620
I heard you mentioned the south China
Sea. What did you mean? Oh, what? Well,

219
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,050
what we meant was of course that we claim
the south China Sea. I said all of it.

220
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,330
I mean, this enormous body of water.
Absolutely it is China's. And then,

221
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:46,661
you know,

222
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:51,380
they began telling me why it was China
as they found pottery shards on this or

223
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:55,780
this a toll or this rocky reef
that went back to the Ming Dynasty,

224
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,930
therefore was China. I said,
really? Now let me, let me say this,

225
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,430
the United States.
And I asked him,

226
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,560
I actually had a map drawn up where
the United States claimed the entire

227
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:16,400
Pacific. And I said, look,
you know, you are our ally,

228
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:19,370
but you couldn't have beaten
the Japanese back and,

229
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:24,371
and you couldn't have had the kind of
economic rise without American power.

230
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,460
And we have, you know, we have
camp old cans of food everywhere.

231
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,790
You may have pottery shards,
but we've left our debris too.

232
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:36,560
And so we're claiming the entire Pacific.
I said, this is an absurd argument.

233
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,870
Oh No. Very serious. And not only that,

234
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,800
we're climbing the east China Sea and
we're going after this and Kakuma,

235
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,910
which the Japanese have a claimed that
we're going after the territorial waters

236
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,410
of Vietnam because obviously they want
to drill to see what might be off their

237
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:52,244
coast.

238
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,460
This was a very well thought out
introduction of a third core interest.

239
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,440
And therefore we have to take it
very seriously. And what I've argued,

240
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:05,240
and I made this very clear
to our Chinese friends,

241
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,680
the United States doesn't take positions
on these islands and who should govern

242
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:15,530
them or who they belong to,
but where there are disputes,

243
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:20,531
we have dispute resolution mechanisms
that China as a great nation should be

244
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:24,500
part of taking advantage of.

245
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,530
And so this is going to be an ongoing
debate between us and within the region.

246
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:30,720
So

247
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,570
is it to show you how good this book is,

248
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:36,490
there's a lengthy conversation
about the origins of this and um,

249
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,650
the secretary talks about the original
hide and bide strategy that a Dung Dung

250
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
Dung chicken had and how much has changed.

251
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:50,030
Do you also spend a fair amount of time
talking about a genuine hero in the

252
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:51,830
world, uh, Ang century cheap, right?

253
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,970
And you describe her as there
was a quiet dignity about her,

254
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,980
the coiled intensity of a vibrant mind
inside of a long imprisoned to body,

255
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,550
right? They sort of glimpses
of the way you started,

256
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,260
I found absolutely fascinating. I'd like
to move to an area where you know, you,

257
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,350
you say hard choices.

258
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:14,351
I personally see no choices and that's
Syria and you're famously known for

259
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,770
having been, or at least allegedly
being in favor of earlier intervention.

260
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:24,040
And I just want to review
where we are now. Um,

261
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,050
170,000 deaths,

262
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,240
a 11 and a half million internally
dislocated people, 3 million refugees,

263
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,240
one out of six people in Lebanon,

264
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:38,150
one out of five people in
Jordan are now refugees.

265
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:41,780
Imagine if that happened from Canada
and Mexico to the United States.

266
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:45,530
The impact on the economy. Uh,
and if that's not bad enough,

267
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,170
it's the biggest humanitarian
conflict in the world today.

268
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,770
There's obvious groups to support fi
it's a proxy war involving Russia,

269
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,020
Iran, Syria, et cetera.

270
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,170
And now the latest is of
course this isis group,

271
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:05,110
which should manage to get to some
number of miles to Baghdad. Um,

272
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,690
it's not, not clear what to do, you
know, do you do a no fly zone? Well,

273
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:13,050
who do you protect, right? If you're
an arm, somebody who are going to arm.

274
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,040
When you think about it,
had we followed what you wanted to do,

275
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,700
what would we have done and what
should we do now or what can we do now?

276
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,020
You talk about this in the book,

277
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,460
but obviously you don't talk about the
current isis situation. It's uh, it's,

278
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,210
I think it's the biggest current problem
in the world in terms of just mass

279
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,590
death and problems.

280
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,500
Well, Eric, I label that, um,
chapter a wicked problem, uh,

281
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:41,020
which is, uh, yeah, futurist concept, uh,

282
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,330
because there really
weren't any, uh, clear, uh,

283
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,420
decisions with a straight
line to consequences.

284
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,600
Even if you made account
for unintended consequences,

285
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,390
it was always going to be a hard choice.

286
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,780
What I argued back at the beginning
of the conflict was that in,

287
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,840
uh,

288
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,840
looking at Assad's crackdown
and his alliances with Iran,

289
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,020
uh, Russia and Iran is
proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon.

290
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,690
There would be a very
serious, uh, issue. Uh,

291
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,210
somebody needs some help back
there. Can we, can we help?

292
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,710
How about some water?
There's somebody pass out.

293
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,800
Yeah. Okay. I think we're fine. We got
somebody back there to help. Okay, let's,

294
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,560
let's continue. Okay.
Um, if you looked at the,

295
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,850
the,
um,

296
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,290
level of violence that Assad was willing
to use and I was pretty sure from the

297
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:47,970
beginning he would do whatever it took
to beat back the demonstrators and to

298
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,550
hold on to territory. His father had done
it before him. Some of you might recall,

299
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,310
um,
in leveling the city of Hama,

300
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,340
which had been a hotbed of opposition
and a particular home for Muslim

301
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,690
Brotherhood opponents to the prior
regime. So I had no doubt, in fact,

302
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,450
one of the stories I tell in the book,

303
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,100
I asked the Foreign
Minister of Saudi Arabia,

304
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:18,420
so Al Faisal,

305
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:22,890
who had been in that
position for many years, um,

306
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,950
whether he thought there was any way to
change the calculation of a Assad and

307
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,630
have him either,
uh,

308
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,770
began to tamp down the violence or look
for a political settlement and no sewed,

309
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:41,460
said no because his mother
would never let him. Uh,

310
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,670
and that I thought was very telling
that there was this family obligation in

311
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:50,890
forced by his mother who
would say to him every day,

312
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,960
here's what your father would have done.

313
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,480
So given that lineup of
character's history in the,

314
00:20:58,481 --> 00:20:59,260
like,

315
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,260
I believe that if we had gone in to
identify and properly vet members of the

316
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,320
original opposition, which were
not al Qaeda, we're not isis,

317
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,350
they may have been a pharmacists or
doctors or lawyers or students before the

318
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:19,900
opposition,

319
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,090
a rose up against Assad's brutal crackdown
that we would get to know who the

320
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:28,780
likely hard men on the other side were.

321
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:34,290
And perhaps we could help to build from
that a viable opposition force that

322
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:40,470
could hold ground against
Assad. And at the same time, uh,

323
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,950
be the anchor for developing a
more effective political arm.

324
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,870
You know, I could sit here
today and say I was right,

325
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,100
but I can't say that because we don't
know what would have happened had we

326
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,530
followed that particular approach.

327
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,960
There were very good
arguments on the other side.

328
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,380
But what I know now is that what I worried
about has happened that Assad has not

329
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,330
moderated his behavior.

330
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:12,310
The only good thing that has come out of
the last two years is the removal of at

331
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:15,850
least the known stockpiles of
chemical and biological weapons,

332
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,770
which I do think was a, an
important, uh, accomplishment.

333
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,190
But we know that territory is
being taken by extremist groups.

334
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:30,880
Isis being the most audacious,
uh,

335
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:35,881
with their claim of a caliphate that
crosses the border between Syria and Iraq.

336
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,280
And I think we have a pretty
good idea what that would mean,

337
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:41,470
what that would mean for the region,
uh,

338
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:46,430
where you could possibly
have a very extreme, uh,

339
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,150
organized territory.
Uh,

340
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:53,830
that was a safe haven and a launching
ground. We saw this in Afghanistan.

341
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:54,491
I mean,

342
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:59,491
that's what happened in the border areas
when al Qaeda decided to ally itself

343
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,440
with the Taliban and set up shop there.

344
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,390
And it doesn't necessarily
mean just misery for Sunni's,

345
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,523
uh,

346
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,850
who are not of their extreme
nature and others within Iraq.

347
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,380
And the same within Syria.

348
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,360
It can lead to problems in Europe
where we think at least 2000, uh,

349
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,130
Europeans, uh, with passports have gone
to fight, uh, with extremist groups.

350
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,630
And it certainly can mean a more
threats to us. So what to do now?

351
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:32,330
I think part of what we have to do is,
uh,

352
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,400
what we're trying to do and
that is to restabilize Iraq.

353
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:41,430
And the reason it's so difficult is that
Prime Minister Maliki basically reneged

354
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,280
on every commitment he made to the
United States as well as his own people.

355
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,190
Uh, when, uh, he was
legitimately elected, um,

356
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,700
he was able to form a government the
first time he was just reelected.

357
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,240
And the problem is that he began
governing in an exclusive sectarian way,

358
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,190
cutting the Sunni's out of power,

359
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,250
refusing to pay the Sunni fighters that
the United States had recruited to get

360
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:10,910
rid of al Qaeda in Iraq,

361
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:15,911
which was one of our major achievements
on behalf of the Rockies before we left.

362
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,930
And refusing to have a fair deal
over oil revenues with the Kurds,

363
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:21,951
the Kurds,

364
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:26,330
and a lot of the Sunni tribal leaders
are basically of the mind that you can't

365
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,390
trust Maliki. You can't, uh,

366
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,170
work with him and we're not going to
support him as he tries to take back

367
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,004
territory.

368
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,140
So it's a political negotiation that we
and others are engaged in because unless

369
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:44,141
you can get the local Sunni leaders once
again to throw their lot in on behalf

370
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,310
of a unified Iraq,

371
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:50,580
you cannot drive isis out of Mosul
and other places that it has seized.

372
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,630
This is very dangerous.
Well, they're, they're,

373
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:57,620
they're very dangerous.
There kind of a, a,

374
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,180
a follow on to the original al Qaeda,
but not as,

375
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,260
um, uh, based in, uh,

376
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,170
the leadership of a bin
Ladin Ans hour hearing.

377
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:13,700
It's now younger people, they're more
violent, they're more aggressive.

378
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,900
They're trying to do what
has been the dream of, uh,

379
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,130
extremist Sunni's, uh,
caught up in terrorism, uh,

380
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,660
for a number of years now. And that
is to establish, or in their mind,

381
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:28,850
reestablish Kayla,
uh,

382
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,090
Kayla fate and put one of
their own in charge. So, yeah,

383
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:36,980
they're very dangerous and they will
not be satisfied in just governing

384
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:39,380
territory.
They will believe it's their,

385
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,040
both their religious duty and their
desire for greater power that they have to

386
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:47,330
take this further a field.
So,

387
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,050
um, what I do is ask you a little bit
about the Israeli Palestinian situation.

388
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,020
I'd like to talk to you a little bit
about what you've been working on since

389
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:56,940
leaving office and,
uh,

390
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,190
and then we'll go to questions and we
have thousands of questions. Uh, it,

391
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,050
it in Google. So, um,

392
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,260
in the book you talk at some length about
negotiating and getting to know Bibi

393
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,440
Netanyahu, um, charismatic leader by,

394
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,910
by any standard and the challenges he's
faced from the terrorism and of the book.

395
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:22,350
You talk a lot about Hezbollah and the
Lebanon war and those sorts of things.

396
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,820
Israel is today confronting, um, the Gaza,

397
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,960
the Gaza rockets, Hamas and
so forth. Looking at it,

398
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:33,580
I was just there who has
a big presence there. Um,

399
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,300
it's to some degree in Hamas has
interest to have this cycle continue.

400
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:42,600
They get money, they get resources,
they're getting rockets out of Syria,

401
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:46,470
et cetera. Um, and the rockets
can now reach the entire country.

402
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:48,970
And I was thinking about it,
if you think about, uh, our,

403
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,520
our good friends in Canada,
right?

404
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:54,510
So Imagine Canada was different
and somehow was raining
rockets on us or Mexico

405
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:57,840
or whatever, people here would
go crazy. Right? Right, right.

406
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,360
And so you can really understand,
in fact,

407
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,220
the Israelis have built
this thing called Iron Dome,

408
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,860
which actually has intercepted
80 or 90% of the rockets,

409
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:08,130
which is a remarkable technical
achievement and good for them.

410
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,780
Do you have a reading of what's going to
happen next because it doesn't seem to

411
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:13,770
be getting better?

412
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:19,380
Well, you know, you might've
seen the president, um, doing a,

413
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,530
a live press statement,
uh,

414
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:26,320
this morning from the White House and
he's asked a secretary Kerry to go to the

415
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:30,880
region to try to reestablish the November,

416
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,880
2012 cease fire that I negotiated back
at the time when rockets were raining,

417
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,430
uh, on Israel. And, uh,

418
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:44,431
I went from Cambodia to
Israel to negotiate what the
Israelis would accept and

419
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:50,020
then to go to Cairo to negotiate
with then president Morsi, um,

420
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,940
and we were able to reach,
uh,

421
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:55,180
a cease fire that held until this month.

422
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,180
And I'd make three points.

423
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,160
One Hamas really does have its back
against the wall and that's always

424
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:04,630
dangerous.
You know,

425
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:09,631
they were basically driven out of Damascus
because that's where they had taken

426
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:12,700
up their headquarters for years.

427
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,940
But when Assad consolidated the Alawite
a minority to go after the majority of

428
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:23,230
the population,
which are Sunni's,

429
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,210
it became impossible for Hamas to
maintain its headquarters there.

430
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,820
They moved to Cairo, uh,
because at the time, you know,

431
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,970
the Muslim Brotherhood candidate
Morsi was the president.

432
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:39,580
There was a lot of sympathy there.
Um,

433
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,640
and they began to try to,
uh,

434
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:47,730
maneuver to control splinter groups
within gossip because it's not just Tomas,

435
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:52,820
there are some even harder
core extremist groups, uh,

436
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:53,681
within Gaza.

437
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:58,540
So you have a couple of different
groups led by Hamas gathering up more

438
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:03,310
sophisticated weaponry. So when I
negotiated the cease fire with Morsi,

439
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,340
he had never done anything like that,

440
00:29:06,341 --> 00:29:10,000
but he did have a
relationship, uh, with Hamas.

441
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,030
So we were able to come up with a written
agreement where Israel made certain

442
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,120
commitments,
Hamas made certain commitments.

443
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,120
And thankfully it was before
there was an invasion.

444
00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:25,870
We were about 48 hours from an invasion.
So what has happened since,

445
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:30,340
well Morrissey's gone,
um, LCC is the president.

446
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,470
He basically has declared the Muslim
Brotherhood and everyone associated with

447
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:39,280
them, which would include Hamas,
are threats to the Egyptian state.

448
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,630
So ammas no longer has
a, in Cairo, uh, the, uh,

449
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:48,631
Westbank has remained fairly secure and
stable and part because of the attitudes

450
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:54,700
still in the West Bank that they'd
rather have a negotiation then go back to

451
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:58,090
resistance. So Hamas and it's, um,

452
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,180
allies who have really brought about the
importation of more long range rockets,

453
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,350
um,

454
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:13,350
has for whatever combination of
calculations decided that it's in their

455
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:17,610
interest, as Eric said, to
once again attack Israel. Uh,

456
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,710
maybe because they believe
they will get more support,

457
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:24,190
they will get more financial resources.
Uh,

458
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,210
maybe they think that they will cause
an uprising in the West Bank that would

459
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:33,190
join with them. They have a number of
different reasons why they might do this.

460
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,320
So once they began firing the rockets
and the rockets have longer range and

461
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:40,420
there's somewhat more accurate,
but the iron dome,

462
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:44,260
which the United States funded but
which is Israeli technology has worked

463
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,430
surprisingly well and intercepting 80,

464
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,870
90% of the rockets.

465
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,000
But there was also the increasing
threat from tunnels. You know,

466
00:30:55,030 --> 00:31:00,030
it used to be that Hamas had tunnels
going into the Sinai and those were both

467
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:03,870
for smuggling weapons, but
also smuggling goods, uh,

468
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
that would escape the Israeli embargo.

469
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,270
The Egyptians have done a
much more thorough job of
shutting those tunnels down,

470
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:10,810
but,
uh,

471
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:15,250
Hamas has been busy building tunnels
into Israel with the primary purpose of

472
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:19,160
attacking Israelis and trying to spark a,

473
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,980
a very violent response.

474
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,670
I can't believe that the current Hamas
leadership did not know that if they kept

475
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:32,320
up their attacks, Netanyahu
would be forced to respond. Uh,

476
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:36,550
as I said, when I got to Jerusalem for
the first part of the negotiations,

477
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,470
they were already sending
out notices, uh, for, uh,

478
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,460
reserve soldiers to begin mustering
up and that they were going to have to

479
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:45,911
invade.

480
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:50,911
So I believe that Hamas wanted
to provoke this reaction.

481
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,500
Uh, and I believe that Netanyahu,
at the end of the day, uh,

482
00:31:55,510 --> 00:32:00,170
the Canadian Mexican example is, you know,
not so far fetched. I mean, any country,

483
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:04,990
your first obligation is to protect your
citizens. And I believe Netanyahu, um,

484
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,430
knew that he had to take action and
he has an Israel has the right to self

485
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:09,851
defense.

486
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:14,851
So now we're into a not
only a very unfortunate,

487
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,980
um, clash, but a propaganda
war. Uh, you know, the terrible,

488
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,960
horrible pictures of
children, uh, who are, uh,

489
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,380
the victims of Israeli military action,
uh,

490
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,850
which is re Israel is right
to say is in large measure,

491
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:34,780
not completely,

492
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:39,781
but in large measure because of the way
Hamas has cited it's rockets and set up.

493
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,360
It's operating centers in neighborhoods
surrounded by civilians in houses.

494
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:52,190
Uh, the tunnels where there
was a firefight with Hamas,

495
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:56,880
a fighters coming out of one
of the tunnels and Israeli
soldiers to Americans do,

496
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,640
you know, dual citizens to young American
men serving in the IDF, uh, killed.

497
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,120
So we have to try,
if we can,

498
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,490
to negotiate another ceasefire.

499
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,680
I've Egypt declared a ceasefire.
Israel accepted it.

500
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,740
Hamas rejected it in part because I do
think they want to provoke what we're now

501
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:22,040
seeing and it's deeply distressing.
But unfortunately,

502
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,140
unless there's a mutual cease fire,

503
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,380
I think Israel will continue
with their military objectives,

504
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,480
which are defined and destroy the tunnels,

505
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,360
find and destroy as many of
the rockets as they can. Uh,

506
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,590
and there will continue to
be a terrible loss of life.

507
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,140
I agree. And it's very sad. The,
let's make a context switch.

508
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,200
Um,
since you left office,

509
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:51,060
you've spent a great deal of time
on empowerment, entrepreneurship,

510
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,480
the role of women and children.
Uh,

511
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,980
Google has partnered with
you a little bit on that. Um,

512
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,610
and I think people will be interested in

513
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:06,420
what do you think needs to be done? You've
given a series of speeches about this,

514
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:10,030
the role of women and so forth. Uh,
you're obviously committed to a tech.

515
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,100
Take us through your thinking.

516
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,760
Well, I, I do want to thank Google and
being one of our partners in this effort.

517
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,770
Uh,
when I got out of the State Department,

518
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,360
I joined my husband and my
daughter at the Clinton Foundation.

519
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,870
My husband had started it and
I'm very proud of what he built.

520
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:27,860
I had nothing to do with it.

521
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:31,700
I was in the Senate and in the
State Department for those 12 years,

522
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:36,701
but he came up with the OnApproach that
I think is fairly called entrepreneurial

523
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:40,530
philanthropy, where you
bring people together, uh,

524
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,200
through the foundation and through
the Clinton Global Initiative, uh,

525
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,490
to partner to solve problems.

526
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,020
And we have very clear metrics.
Are you making progress or not?

527
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:54,140
And if you're not, then we're not
going to keep doing what doesn't work.

528
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:55,760
And we're going to do
more of what does work.

529
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,770
And we think we're all in this together.

530
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:00,980
So both internationally and
domestically, uh, there's a,

531
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:03,770
a number of really important projects.

532
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:08,660
Bill has just left a Borneo where we're
doing one of our climate initiatives,

533
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,810
trying to save the rain
forest in Indonesia,

534
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:15,230
partnering with a number of
other governments and businesses.

535
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,150
So when I got out,

536
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:22,151
in addition to wanting to work on the
foundation priorities and CGI priorities,

537
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,290
I added three. I added something
we call too small to fail.

538
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,740
And that is um,
a programmed,

539
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,540
aimed at persuading a families to read,

540
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,010
talk and sing to their babies.

541
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,410
Because what we know is if you come,
if you're our daughter,

542
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,590
uh,
Chelsea or our new grandchild,

543
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,690
you are going to be talked to and read
two and sung to until probably you just

544
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,640
want us to go away.
Um,

545
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,860
and we're doing it both because it's great
to build relationships and connection,

546
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:02,250
but we now know from brain research,
it builds brains.

547
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,580
And when a child from a family,

548
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,700
like one of ours goes to kindergarten,

549
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,290
that child will have already heard 30
million more words than a child from a

550
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,760
poor family.
Now,

551
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:18,030
that does not mean the child from
the poor family is any less loved,

552
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,800
any less treasured,

553
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,220
but there's not the time or understanding
often so that parents know they can be

554
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:30,300
their child's first teachers.
So we are partnering with, uh,

555
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,410
the next generation foundation in San
Francisco and a number of other groups

556
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:37,170
like sesame street to get
this message out. Secondly,

557
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,890
we rolled out at the Clinton Global
Initiative America meeting in Denver, uh,

558
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,833
last month,

559
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,800
a program that is aimed at trying
to work with companies like Google.

560
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:51,900
We'd love to talk to
you about this, but, uh,

561
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:55,950
to create ladders of opportunity
for unemployed young people,

562
00:36:55,951 --> 00:37:00,951
we have 6 million young people in America
between the ages of 18 and 24 who are

563
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:03,480
neither in school nor at work.

564
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,020
And that's terrible for them and
it's terrible for us in our economy.

565
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,510
And then finally I took with me
my commitment to women and girls,

566
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:15,150
their empowerment, uh,
their full participation.

567
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,370
And my jumping off point is the
speech that I gave in 1995 in Beijing,

568
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,960
uh,
which was intended to make it very clear,

569
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,730
a statement of the global priority that
a human rights are women's rights and

570
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:31,140
women's rights are human rights.

571
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:36,470
But accompanying that was a platform
for action signed by 189 countries about

572
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:42,540
what they would do to move toward
full participation of women and girls.

573
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,570
And we've made progress
but not nearly enough.

574
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,670
So we started a program called no
ceilings and it's got three purposes.

575
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,533
Number one,

576
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,840
we want to be able with Google's help
and others to get the best data possible

577
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,250
so that we understand where the
gaps are. We know, for example,

578
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:05,640
we've made tremendous progress in
getting girls into primary education,

579
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,600
not so good in secondary education.
So what are the gaps?

580
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,590
How do we describe that
and how do we visualize it?

581
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:18,590
So people who may not the experts or
advocates in this field can look and see

582
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,680
what the remaining business is.

583
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:26,760
I have a chapter called
unfinished business and it's
really about what more we

584
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:27,360
need to do.

585
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,500
Now there are big differences between
the developing world and the developed

586
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,630
world and developing world.
You know,

587
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:36,850
we still have some very
clear obstacles to overcome.

588
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:40,810
We still have countries that don't even
give birth certificates to girl babies

589
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:43,000
because they're just not
important enough to register.

590
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,750
So when we say to ourselves, well, how
many girls are in school and you know,

591
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:50,650
a significant percentage don't even have
birth certificates and there's not a

592
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:53,830
good census, how do we measure
that? Or when we look at Asia,

593
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,040
there are 3 million fewer girls and
women than there are boys and men because

594
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,910
they just don't,

595
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,800
they're not born or they don't live to
their fifth birthday or they are victims

596
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:10,600
of violence and neglect.
And we have this huge gap.

597
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:15,490
And I think one of the problems that
China and India are facing and will face

598
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:19,720
even more is the big gap between
marriageable men and marriageable women.

599
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,020
And some of the violence against women
is a result of what is a very big

600
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,400
imbalance. Now in the so
called developed world, um,

601
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,620
we've changed our laws, but what
we have left our cultural problems.

602
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,970
And so in addition to getting the data,
where are the gaps,

603
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,870
we want to look at what are the solutions
and they will vary from country to

604
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:45,250
country,
region to region.

605
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,910
One of the efforts I made in the State
Department was to do an began to do with

606
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:52,930
the IMF,
the World Bank and others,

607
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,200
an economic analysis of what
it means for girls and women,

608
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,060
uh,
to be left out of economies.

609
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,420
Now we know girls and women
are in the informal economy,

610
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:06,130
but that's not counted in GDP.

611
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,000
I remember going to Africa in the
90s and all I saw were women working.

612
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,200
They were carrying water,
they were carrying firewood,
they were tending fields,

613
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,410
they were, you know, in the marketplaces.
And I asked an economist, I said,

614
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:20,560
how do you take account of all this
economic activity? And they said,

615
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:23,230
we don't get this in the informal economy.

616
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,860
So what I wanted was an analysis about
what difference it would make if we had

617
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,500
girls and women in the formal economy.

618
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,660
And it makes a huge GDP difference.
And the person in the,

619
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,140
in the world who has jumped on this more
than anybody is Prime Minister Abi of

620
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:43,840
Japan because when he took office,
he took office on the promise.

621
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:47,110
He was going to get the economy going
and he looked at trade barriers.

622
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,670
He looked at the lack of immigration,

623
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,140
but one of the biggest problems was
educated Japanese women were not in the

624
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:57,040
economy and that in fact,
if they had greater participation,

625
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,820
the projection was the Japanese
economy could go up to GDP.

626
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,660
[inaudible] economy is to use the talents
you already have, the talent you have

627
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,380
and raise the talent base of women
and girls in places where they're not

628
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:15,380
educated and take advantage of those
talents in places where they are.

629
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,750
It seems so obvious. Why
don't we just do it? Ah, yeah.

630
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,880
I want to try to figure out and with
Google's help we get the best analysis to

631
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,610
make the recommendation.
I really agree with.

632
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,610
I want to finish up with a book
with the last, the last paragraph.

633
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:34,430
You talk about the memorial service for
your mom passed recently and you said,

634
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,540
I looked at Chelsea and I
thought how much, how proud mom,

635
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:40,580
your mom was of her mom,

636
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:44,450
measured her own life by how much she
was able to help us and serve others.

637
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,890
I knew that if she was still with us,
she would be urging us to do the same.

638
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,920
Never rest on your laurels.
Never quit.

639
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,010
Never stopped working to make
the world a better place.

640
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,330
That's our unfinished business.
Is that why you work so hard?

641
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:04,320
It really is. Um, I don't want to
get all of psychobabble Lee, but, um,

642
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,960
it's okay. Uh, you know, uh,

643
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,030
I so admire my mother,
um,

644
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,480
because she had a miserable
childhood. I mean, just horrible,

645
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:21,790
abused, neglected, abandoned, um,

646
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,340
sent by herself at the
age of, you know, seven,

647
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:28,940
eight in charge of her younger
sister who was about six,

648
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,880
pulled on a train by
themselves in Chicago,

649
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:35,480
sent to California to live
with her paternal grandparents
who did not want her.

650
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,830
And, um, just a terrible experience.

651
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:44,380
And finally having to leave that home
at the age of 13 to get a job, uh,

652
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,190
working in another family's home,

653
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:50,150
taking care of their children and return
for room and board and the opportunity

654
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,120
if she could get her chores done
in the morning to go to school,

655
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:57,440
if she could get back, uh, in the
afternoon. So, I mean, when I was a child,

656
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,820
I didn't know any of this about my mother.

657
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,900
I just knew that she was a great mom
and she was fun and she, you know,

658
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:07,120
took wonderful care of us. But as
I learned more about her life, uh,

659
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,620
upon becoming a teenager
and a young adult,

660
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,420
I was just astonished because I thought,
you know,

661
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,310
so many things could have gone
wrong. I mean, she could've given up.

662
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:21,020
She could've been embittered.
She could, could've,

663
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,450
even if she'd gotten
married and have children,

664
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:27,200
she could have been as mean spirited
or neglectful as her mother and her

665
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:29,930
grandmother were to her.
But instead,

666
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:34,931
she works so hard to be a better person
and she never got to go to college.

667
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:40,460
But she was always studying and trying
to learn and believed passionately in

668
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:41,294
education.

669
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:46,810
And I think it did have a lot
to do with my sense of service,

670
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,160
uh,
because you know,

671
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:53,810
I remember going to Babysit for the
children of migrant farm workers, um,

672
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,580
who in Chicago, you know, they would come
up from Mexico and they'd pick crops,

673
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:00,920
they'd go through Illinois
that go into Michigan.

674
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,900
And our church had a babysitting program
for the youngest children on Saturday

675
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,680
morning so that the school age children
who went to school with us would be able

676
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:10,580
to go out into the fields.

677
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:15,410
And so I remember babysitting these
adorable little kids and my mother, um,

678
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,650
learning that one of the little girls
was going to have her first communion.

679
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:22,400
And of course I didn't have money for a
dress and my mother took the mother of

680
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:24,320
the little girl and you know,
bought a dress.

681
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:28,550
And My mother was always trying to
think of ways that just through her own

682
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:33,551
efforts she could help somebody else
and encouraging me to do the same.

683
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:38,040
So there's no doubt in my mind that
she was my biggest inspiration.

684
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,570
And her example, uh, was a, a great, uh,

685
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:46,530
continuing reminder of what can
happen because I'd end with this.

686
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,540
I asked her once, I said, with
all of your really suffering,

687
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,590
what made the difference, how did you turn
out the way you did? And she said to me

688
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,100
at so many points along the way,
somebody was kind to me.

689
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:07,810
It wasn't my family, but it was somebody
else. And she told me about, uh,

690
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,850
literally when she was like four years
old and her parents were teenagers,

691
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:16,500
totally irresponsible. They'd leave
her for days, they give her, you know,

692
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,860
a little bit of money and she'd have
to get herself down the stairs of the

693
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:24,720
tenement they lived in and go next door
to a restaurant and ask for food, uh,

694
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,270
with a little bit of money. And
she said, looking back to that,

695
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:31,950
I know they gave me more food than I could
pay for or when she was in school and

696
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:35,460
she would never have any lunch and
never had any money to buy lunch.

697
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,960
And the teacher noticed it. So the
teacher without embarrassing her, uh,

698
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:41,760
would bring an extra piece of fruit,

699
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,810
would bring an extra carton of milk and
would say, oh, I brought too much food.

700
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:49,710
Dorothy, would you like something?
Because I just can't eat all this. Again,

701
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:51,210
not humiliating her,

702
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,960
but making it possible for
her to receive that kindness.

703
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,950
And the family that she moved in to work
for was the first time she was ever in

704
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:03,951
an intact family that loved each other
and cared about each other and had plans

705
00:46:05,011 --> 00:46:07,260
for the future.
And she could see all of that.

706
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:12,261
So it was just a great reminder when
you don't have to go into full time

707
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:17,130
philanthropy or charitable work
or faith based work or politics,

708
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:21,840
but there's always something
you can do that helps somebody.

709
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,160
And if you do it in a way that preserves
their dignity and gives them the

710
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:31,161
feeling that it was kindness
as opposed to arrogance,

711
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:37,470
it can make a huge difference. So I
think that, uh, left a great impression.

712
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,060
There isn't very nice picture of,
of you and your mom,

713
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:44,260
Chelsea and mark in the book. Yeah.
We have questions from the audience.

714
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:48,220
Let's get some folks lined up here.
Uh, but, uh, the overwhelming,

715
00:46:48,221 --> 00:46:53,000
there's a ranking system that we use of
questioning and the overwhelming ranking

716
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:55,270
throughout the company. And this is
being watched all around the world.

717
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:59,980
And Google, um, he has a question
about the NSA and as you know,

718
00:46:59,981 --> 00:47:03,700
Google is quite opposed along with the
other tech companies to what we see is

719
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:06,850
overreach by the NSA. Right.
And we all think, for example,

720
00:47:06,851 --> 00:47:10,540
that bugging Angela Merkel's phone is,
you know, pretty stupid if I can be blunt.

721
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:11,943
Um,

722
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:17,620
what is your opinion of NSA's spying
surveillance, the domestic violence,

723
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,260
but this occurred I think
after you were there, right?

724
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:22,540
You have an opinion about this
number one question from Google.

725
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,410
Yeah. I mean, don't do stupid things. Um,

726
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,160
and that doesn't mean we don't need to
have a system of surveillance because we

727
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:33,040
do, I mean, I think
that has to be accepted,

728
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,160
but how we do it and how we explain
it and what we tell our partners is

729
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:44,650
incredibly important. I was just in
Berlin on my book tour in Europe,

730
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,730
and of course that was the number
one issue. And I, I said, look,

731
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:52,750
Angle Merkel is a friend of mine and
I apologize to her. It was wrong.

732
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:53,450
It shouldn't have been

733
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,530
Washington. You know, I had dinner
with her and she looked at me, he said,

734
00:47:55,531 --> 00:47:58,180
what are they doing? Listening to my
conversations with my mother. Yeah,

735
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,390
I mean people will remember that.

736
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,610
Absolutely. And look, I think we were,

737
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:07,611
we were beginning to take a hard
look at what we did post nine 11.

738
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:10,140
Um,
and that was happening.

739
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:13,780
The president had actually
given a speech before, um,

740
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:18,270
the Snowden disclosures about the need
to take a hard look at the legislation

741
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,230
and how it was being implemented.
Um,

742
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:25,230
so we had to do that because I voted for
things and then I voted against things

743
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:30,030
trying to figure out how to get the
right balance in a security and liberty,

744
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:32,370
the age old question.
And we have to do,

745
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,790
we have to do a much better job and
we have to do it in a way that doesn't

746
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:40,791
affect our great companies like Google
because clearly that would be unfortunate

747
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:42,984
for us.

748
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,980
Let's go, uh, here, go ahead
for your first question and
then we'll go over here.

749
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:49,130
Sorry Clinton. Thank you
for joining us today. Um,

750
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,800
I want it to get your take on the state
of Congress and internal politics within

751
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:58,420
the US. It seems like things are getting
increasingly polarized to the point of

752
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:01,390
dysfunction. You know,
I think that the kick,

753
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:05,170
the can economic policies that we're
building is really hurting our country.

754
00:49:05,171 --> 00:49:09,490
So I'm wondering what you think needs
to be done to fix it and who the right

755
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:10,990
people are to lead that effort.

756
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,500
Well, I think your question
is exactly on point. Um,

757
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,020
I think we have two crises
right now in our country.

758
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:21,800
We have an economic crisis that has to
do with both growth and inequality. Uh,

759
00:49:21,801 --> 00:49:25,410
you may not feel it here at Google,
but it's real in the lives of,

760
00:49:25,411 --> 00:49:26,420
of many Americans.

761
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:31,421
And we need to get back to doing smarter
things in terms of economic policies.

762
00:49:31,521 --> 00:49:33,800
And we have a political crisis.

763
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:38,750
I would even argue it's a crisis of our
democracy because it's not functioning.

764
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,590
And I would make three
quick points. First, um,

765
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:48,140
having been in and around
politics for a long time. Um,

766
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,680
please don't get indifferent or disgusted
and walk away from it because truly

767
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,860
the best way of changing what's
going on is through voting.

768
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,970
I mean, that may sound simplistic,
but I've been there, I've seen it.

769
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,650
I know it can work and I would
have just a few pieces of advice.

770
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,600
Don't vote for anyone who says he or
she will never compromise. Um, and,

771
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,690
and does it proudly, you know,
they, they have all the answers.

772
00:50:17,691 --> 00:50:22,100
They may even have a direct channel to
the divine so they know what should be

773
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:26,140
done. Uh, and therefore they're going to
Washington or they're going to Sacramento

774
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,340
wherever they're going.
And they will never compromise.

775
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:30,710
That is death to a democracy.

776
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,720
I don't know if any of you saw the Great
Steven Spielberg movie about Lincoln

777
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:37,640
and trying to get the
13th amendment passed.

778
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,630
There was just a great a movie I made
a great play in New York called all the

779
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:44,150
way about Lbj trying to
get civil rights past.

780
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,590
You've got to compromise if
you're going to make progress.

781
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:53,540
And so don't vote for people. Don't give
them money, don't encourage them. Uh,

782
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:54,710
you can be conservative,

783
00:50:54,711 --> 00:50:59,510
but find people who understand the meeting
of conservative. It's not radicalism.

784
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,620
It's a conserving a and
trying to build on, uh,

785
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,190
institutions that work.
And then finally to go to your,

786
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,860
you're the final part of your question.

787
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,960
It's not only what citizens should do
in terms of voting and contributing and

788
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:19,010
trying to pick people who will be
better partners in solving our problems,

789
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:22,250
but it's what leaders
themselves have to do. Uh,

790
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:26,300
and Washington is now
set up for dysfunction.

791
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:32,170
People are elected often with the best
intentions and then they get there and

792
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:33,170
they spend all their money,

793
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:36,590
their time raising money so that they
can be reelected the next time instead of

794
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:39,050
doing the work that they were
elected to do the first time.

795
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:43,910
And they also are rarely with each other.
Uh,

796
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:48,780
it didn't use to be that way. You
met across the aisle, you met, uh,

797
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,580
across the ideological divide.
And we're not doing that,

798
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:56,720
so people don't get to know each other.
And so I think you,

799
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:59,060
if you are running for
one of these offices,

800
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,740
you just have to be absolutely committed
to spending a lot of time trying to

801
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:06,890
build relationships because at the end
of the day, that's what it's about.

802
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:08,180
You have to have enough trust,

803
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,470
enough understanding to be able
to make decisions and you know,

804
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,580
that's what we're missing right now.

805
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,060
I would also have, I have to bring
your book back and quote in general,

806
00:52:18,061 --> 00:52:21,510
I was surprised at how many people in
Washington operated in an evidence free

807
00:52:21,511 --> 00:52:25,920
zone where we're data and
science are disregarded.

808
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,540
You then go on and quote an unnamed senior
Bush administration official who I'm

809
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:34,070
dying to figure out who this is,
who said the reality based community.

810
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,020
People who believe that solutions
emerged from your judicious study of

811
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:38,190
discernible reality.

812
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,620
I've always thought that's exactly how
to solve problems the bush way when it

813
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:45,330
went on. That's not the way
the world really works anymore.

814
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:48,780
We're an empire now and when we act,
we create our own reality.

815
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:54,070
That attitude helps explain it a lot of
what went wrong during those years. So,

816
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,090
so maybe the answer is also,
let's, let's go back to the,

817
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,430
we can debate the principles and so forth,

818
00:52:59,431 --> 00:53:00,880
but let's make sure the data's correct.
Correct.

819
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:04,730
Well, and what a place to talk about
this. I mean, that's exactly, I mean,

820
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:08,360
I used to give speeches about
being in an evidence free zone, uh,

821
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:13,361
in the Senate and we've got to figure
out a better way of breaking down the

822
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:19,710
intellectual barriers that exist between
people of different political beliefs.

823
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,500
There's some recent
research has been done,

824
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:29,370
and I would welcome any of your thoughts
on this that shows if you hold an

825
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:32,700
opinion strongly, like let's
just pick supply side economics,

826
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:36,150
trickle down economics, which don't
work. There's no evidence that it works,

827
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:39,270
but it is deeply believed by people,
um,

828
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,490
or the immigration is bad
for the United States.

829
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:45,900
Totally wrong evidence to the contrary
going, can we just pause for miles?

830
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,570
Isn't that amazing?
We just heard this.

831
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:49,303
No,

832
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:54,520
this country was built on immigration
hundred percent and, and so

833
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,180
we,
we know we have evidence,

834
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:02,490
but oftentimes it's difficult to break
through the psychological barriers to

835
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:05,460
hearing that.
So we've got to do a better job.

836
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:07,860
And I think about this a lot
because of the dysfunction.

837
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:14,090
Some people deny climate change because
they think they are doing it to protect

838
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:18,150
industries they make money from
or they get contributions from.

839
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,560
Some people deny it because they don't
understand the science and they kind of

840
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:27,360
just throw up their hands and it's easier
to say, oh well all workout. Some of it,

841
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,000
some people deny it for religious reasons,
whatever.

842
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,650
That's just one example of an issue
that we are gridlocked over and thank

843
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:38,910
goodness for President Obama beginning
to do things that will deal with climate

844
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:41,430
change, um, through executive action.

845
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,630
But how do we begin to have a conversation
again where we actually listened to

846
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:49,200
each other because the, you
know, we are much less sexist,

847
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:54,150
much less racist, much less homophobic
than we were a decade or two ago.

848
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,201
But boy,

849
00:54:55,201 --> 00:54:59,880
the one remaining bias we have is we
don't want to be around people who share a

850
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:04,530
different political opinion. You know,
we just don't want to argue with them.

851
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:07,500
We don't want to listen to them.
And it's on both sides of the divide.

852
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:10,500
So we've got to do a better job of
question over here. Yeah, sorry.

853
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:15,690
Thank you Secretary Clinton.
Um, I was hoping we could, uh,

854
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:20,380
use some of your experience and dealing
with rather difficult international

855
00:55:20,381 --> 00:55:24,790
crises and controversies with one of
the deep controversies affecting us.

856
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:29,560
What do you think it will take to
resolve the tension between advocates of

857
00:55:29,561 --> 00:55:31,720
synchronous and asynchronous programming?
Ronnel's

858
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:37,460
um, all right. Are you,

859
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,470
are you saying, oh, would
you like to wow. Good.

860
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,020
Yeah. Well, I mean, I, I'm no expert,

861
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:50,021
but clearly no synchronous models
require lightweight threads.

862
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,450
Have you been, have you been
spending some time in Silicon Valley?

863
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,780
I've been thinking a lot
about silicon valley.

864
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:11,670
Did you actually have a real question?
Well, actually that was the right answer,

865
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:13,920
I guess, right? Yeah. Hey,
since we're so good at this,

866
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,230
I'm wondering if maybe I could
even ask you another one.

867
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,080
Given there,

868
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:26,140
there is a suggestion that increases in
productivity over the past few decades,

869
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,460
that the total number of jobs that
the American economy can even have,

870
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:34,900
maybe structurally less than the number
of people who are in need of jobs and

871
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:39,010
even more so for jobs that can actually
pay enough for someone to live on, right?

872
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,950
If this is really a
fundamental structural reality,

873
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:44,470
we're going to have to deal with
how do we adjust to such a world?

874
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:45,351
Well,

875
00:56:45,351 --> 00:56:49,730
I I really glad you asked that because
I don't have a quick Glib answer to give

876
00:56:49,731 --> 00:56:49,941
you,

877
00:56:49,941 --> 00:56:54,941
but I can tell you that I would love
to have any thoughts from all of you

878
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,530
because you are making this new world.
I mean,

879
00:56:57,531 --> 00:57:02,120
Google is a part of the future that
is out there. And as I look around,

880
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:07,010
you know, it's a very diverse crowd.
A lot of young and youngest people,

881
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:12,290
uh, who have, uh, uh, I think
they all look young. They do,

882
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:13,930
uh,
who,

883
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:18,930
who have skills and abilities that are
really required in this new future.

884
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:27,020
There is a serious political
and economic dimension to that.

885
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:32,360
And I don't think it's enough to basically
say everybody else just going to have

886
00:57:32,361 --> 00:57:33,290
to get used to it,

887
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:38,320
live with it because that is a recipe
for not only increasing inequality,

888
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,500
but what inequality does to social
cohesion to democratic institutions.

889
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:45,911
Uh,

890
00:57:45,911 --> 00:57:49,220
so I think it's one of the most serious
questions we have to figure out how to

891
00:57:49,221 --> 00:57:53,780
answer. Now, you know, there
are some obvious quick answers,

892
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:56,780
like you have subsidized employment
for people in certain areas,

893
00:57:56,781 --> 00:58:00,600
or at least they have something
to do all day, every day. Um,

894
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:05,650
you try to figure out how you create
incentives for companies to keep people

895
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:09,200
employed instead of making
them unemployed. You know,

896
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:10,820
the German system where you're,

897
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:14,390
the government basically
subsidizes you to avoid layoffs,

898
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:16,040
but then you gotta figure out
what to do with people. I mean,

899
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:21,041
there are no easy answers and given
the intellectual brainpower in here,

900
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,221
uh,

901
00:58:22,221 --> 00:58:25,790
the United States may be getting to this
sooner than other parts of the world.

902
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,840
Everybody is going to get to it.
So,

903
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,180
I mean right now the Chinese are trying
to figure out how they continue taking

904
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,060
tens of millions of
people out of rural areas,

905
00:58:35,061 --> 00:58:40,061
bringing them to urban areas and putting
them to work when wages are gonna rise,

906
00:58:42,021 --> 00:58:46,370
when their economic advantage then maybe
diminished. So this is a huge social,

907
00:58:46,371 --> 00:58:49,520
political, economic issue. And if you've
got any thoughts, I'd love to hear them.

908
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,860
Let's have a quick question over here.

909
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,170
Sicker essentially continents
and honor to have you here.

910
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,820
I saw you on the daily show recently where
a John Stewart preemptively announced

911
00:58:57,821 --> 00:58:58,960
your candidacy for.

912
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:01,490
Okay.

913
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:01,731
No,

914
00:59:01,731 --> 00:59:06,410
I took my daughter about six years ago
to the Democratic primaries to vote for

915
00:59:06,411 --> 00:59:10,480
you in the face.
She would be interested.

916
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:15,440
She above 82. She's old enough to
vote. That is she, she came to be with.

917
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:20,870
I love that. Um, how do you, I mean
I, I thought you handled it quite,

918
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,440
but um, how are you going to handle when
there's so many people who are obviously

919
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:27,500
interested in having you,
uh, in this next election?

920
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,660
Thank you. Well, John
Stewart was a lot of it.

921
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,440
[inaudible]

922
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,650
and, and I love the story of taking your
daughter. We always took Chelsea to vote.

923
00:59:41,651 --> 00:59:42,371
I mean,
really,

924
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:45,670
I think every 18 year old should be
automatically registered to vote upon

925
00:59:45,671 --> 00:59:47,200
turning 18.
I think we need to get,

926
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,043
um,

927
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:56,230
this is a very personal decision for me.
Um,

928
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,430
and I don't take it at all lightly.

929
00:59:58,431 --> 01:00:02,320
I'm sort of feeling my way
through it and toward it. Uh,

930
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,733
I,

931
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:09,470
I think we face some very
serious hard choices as a nation.

932
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:14,500
And I have no illusions about what a
president alone can do because it's a

933
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:20,060
necessary to bring the congress to bring
the private sector to get people from

934
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:21,560
all walks of life involve.

935
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:26,990
But I think we're at a real juncture.
Uh,

936
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:31,070
and I'm well aware that I
have a lot of experience.

937
01:00:31,071 --> 01:00:35,840
I've seen the presidency up
close now over 20 years. Uh,

938
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:39,890
both because of my husband and,
and also I worked closely with George W.

939
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:43,910
Bush after nine 11 because I was a senator
from New York and we had to rebuild,

940
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:48,110
you know, lower Manhattan and then
obviously working closely and becoming a,

941
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,470
not just a partner but a
friend of President Obama. Um,

942
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:56,471
so I am going to take my time because I
know that once I decide if I am going to

943
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,890
run,

944
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:02,890
it's nonstop and the campaigns are even
more demanding than they were four years

945
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:06,110
ago. Um, and so,

946
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,560
I mean I've talked with people in the
Obama campaign and they basically say,

947
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:10,251
you know,

948
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:15,251
2012 was so much more
advanced technologically and
in voters in terms of voter

949
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:16,454
outreach,

950
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:20,990
then 2008 and we don't even know
what's going to be required in 2016.

951
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:25,250
And I'm sure you know a lot of you because
of what you work on and bent and the

952
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:26,720
light will be part of that.

953
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,960
So I want to be sure that it's the right
decision for me and that I will not

954
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:36,530
just, I say in the book,
you shouldn't ask somebody,

955
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:40,310
in my opinion whether they're going
to run or if they think they can win.

956
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:43,340
Those are the easy questions and
most people run for president,

957
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:46,700
no matter what you think, think they
can win or they wouldn't do it. Um,

958
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,870
but really what's your vision for
America and can you lead us there?

959
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,120
And I think that's going to require,

960
01:01:53,121 --> 01:01:55,910
and it goes to the great question that
was asked over here that's going to

961
01:01:55,911 --> 01:02:00,911
require some really careful analysis
and agenda setting because you,

962
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,470
in my opinion, whoever runs,
and certainly if I were to run,

963
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:10,700
I would want to run on a specific and
agenda as possible because I don't want

964
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:15,080
there to be any illusions. You know,
we're, we don't have time for people to,

965
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:15,590
you know,

966
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:20,590
just think in very general terms because
we have to get a consensus coming out

967
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,650
of this next election about what we're
going to do to solve these problems and

968
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:29,610
hopefully bring some people
into the congress on both
sides of the aisle who are

969
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:32,370
willing to compromise and
make those tough calls.

970
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:36,390
So I'm thinking about it and I hope
you'll say hello to your daughter for me.

971
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,320
Yes.

972
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,153
So Secretary Clinton,

973
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,850
we have a way,
we have a way of asking

974
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:49,540
during the audience what the
most important question is.

975
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,170
And when you became first lady,

976
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:58,330
you're name was determined by
the tradition of first lady Tru,

977
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,020
Tru and Googlers want to
know the following question.

978
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:08,940
They want to know the name of President
Clinton in a scenario where there's

979
01:03:10,481 --> 01:03:11,650
another president,
clinic,

980
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,580
Googlers have indicated that there are two

981
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:20,160
choices.
The first one is bill.

982
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:22,360
Okay.

983
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,940
So it would be MS president and bill,

984
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,620
which would have a certain,
yeah,

985
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:31,260
gender equality,
you know Mr. Clinton and the first lady.

986
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,520
And the second one is first latee

987
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:41,180
Google. Google does things by,
by consensus. And by votes.

988
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:43,610
So we're going to
determine this for you now.

989
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,500
So I need a sign of hands,
like all those are your two choices.

990
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,630
She should call him bill.

991
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,823
Okay.

992
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:58,110
She should call him first.
Laddie the decision is made.

993
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:02,160
We're announcing it today. Mrs Button.
He's going to be called first lady.

994
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,390
Would you like to respond? Oh, this not,

995
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,760
okay, good. Eric. Oh,

996
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:15,220
I have to say bill, I
would've voted for bill. Yeah,

997
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,310
I, you know, I, I, there was one
choice that I'm more partial to,

998
01:04:18,311 --> 01:04:20,080
not that this is a hypothetical.

999
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:27,820
Okay.

1000
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,640
And that's first mate.
I kind of liked her first day,

1001
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:36,220
Miss Glynn and first mate, come
on it. We were better than that.

1002
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:41,920
Well, we have to see, I
think you can see first place

1003
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:46,760
we're going to have a book signing after
this in Tunis. I think you can see in,

1004
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,540
in Secretary Clinton's, Senator
Clinton, first lady Clinton,

1005
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,660
a person of enormous impact on our world.

1006
01:04:52,661 --> 01:04:57,661
Somebody who has spent her entire life
with his prodigious mind trying to serve

1007
01:04:58,151 --> 01:05:01,780
us. I'm, I'm proud to be your friend and
I admire everything that you've done.

1008
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:06,130
And I know people in this audience feel
the same way. Thank you all so very much.

1009
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:16,300
Right.
