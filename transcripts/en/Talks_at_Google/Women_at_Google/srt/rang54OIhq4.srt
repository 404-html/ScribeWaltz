1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,660
All right. Well hello everyone.
Thank you so much for joining today.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,140
My name is Helen Riley and I work in
finance and I support Lorraine on global

3
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:14,690
marketing as well as uh,
Patrick and David [inaudible].

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,161
And I am,

5
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:20,840
but one of the best things about my job
is that I head up developments together

6
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:23,480
with Lisa Give Elba,
uh, for women at Google.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,030
And one of the new things that we
decided to launch this year was a speaker

8
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:33,540
series. And so I reached
out to my colleagues and the
People Dev Organization. Um,

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,780
and actually one of the first names that
came up was, um, Sally Helgeson. Um,

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,660
and so I'm delighted to have
Sally come talk to us today.

11
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:46,250
So Sally is a, an internationally
acclaimed author and speaker.

12
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:50,660
She's done a number of
corporate leadership events
with a number of corporations,

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,690
a well known IBM, Microsoft,J
and J. HP among others. Um,

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,550
and she's also the author of six books.
Um, and her latest book is called the,

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,400
the feminine, the female female vision.
Yeah, he was mixed up feminine female,

16
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,690
the female vision. So she's here
today to talk to us about some of the,

17
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,940
some of the lessons from,
from that book.

18
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,710
I'm talking about what it is to
articulate a clear vision, you know,

19
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,610
how do we build a allegiances within
an organization, how do we, you know,

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,210
project presence and, and a
half, um, executive presence.

21
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:25,100
So a number of things she's
going to be talking about. Um,

22
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:28,190
so I'm delighted to hand over to Sally.
Thank you so much for joining us.

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,340
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

24
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,930
It is a pleasure to be here and I want
to thank Helen and women at Google.

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,740
Uh, it's my first visit to the
campus and I love being here.

26
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,420
I love seeing all the dogs around.

27
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:48,710
It just puts you in a great mood
and all the bikes. Um, so it's, uh,

28
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,730
it's a real pleasure and what I want to
do today is to share some of what I have

29
00:01:56,061 --> 00:02:01,061
learned over 25 years of researching
and working with women leaders in

30
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:05,810
organizations all around the world.

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,560
And I want to focus that on things that
you as women can do to develop your own

32
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:17,000
leadership style. And for the men in the
audience, both in the room and out there,

33
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,590
uh,
and uh,

34
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,620
different locations to also give you
some insights in ways that you can,

35
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,963
uh,

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,920
drive some of the best talents
from the women that you manage.

37
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,510
Um, so I'm going to be drawing
a lot of information here.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,250
I'm going to be focusing on some of the
things that I learned both in writing my

39
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:44,750
most recent book, the female
vision, women's real power at work.

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,620
Uh, and the, some of the things that
I've learned in the years since,

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,870
because I've worked with that material
to help women in hands on workshop and

42
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,340
coaching situations,

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,760
use the insights and the research in that
book to their own leadership style and

44
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:05,680
position themselves well
in their organizations.

45
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,360
So that's what I'll be doing.

46
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm going to do this in pretty
much three parts briefly.

47
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:15,700
I want to give you a bit of background
so you can understand where this focus

48
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:19,480
comes from, the kinds of
experiences that drove it. A,

49
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:24,481
then I want to share with you what I
think of as two really red hot insights

50
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,000
from the book,
the female vision.

51
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,550
And then I want to have a real
discussion about how that,

52
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,090
those insights can be applied to you
in the management of your own careers.

53
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,590
So let me start by giving you a
bit of background. Uh, as I said,

54
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,310
I've been doing this for 25 years,
uh,

55
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,340
and my journey working with women leaders
and research and women leaders began,

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,330
uh,

57
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,330
when I did the research that became the
book published in 1990 called the female

58
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:05,780
advantage women's ways of
leadership, uh, books still,

59
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:08,560
it has been continuously in print and was,

60
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:13,561
I'm very proud to say the first book
that focused on what women had to

61
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,710
contribute to organizations rather than
how they needed to change and adapt that

62
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:24,280
had not been out there before.
Uh,

63
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,520
like many books that really
hit a nerve with people.

64
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,800
I've never spoken.

65
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,460
I once had an Elvis impersonator
in the next room in Las Vegas,

66
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,850
but there's nothing we can do.
We've just got the music. Okay.

67
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,770
I'll try to groove with it. Um, um, I, uh,

68
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,590
the book came from my very
personal experience. Uh,

69
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,820
I had made a career shift in the mid,
late eighties.

70
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,380
I had moved from being an independent
journalist and writer to working with

71
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:00,340
corporate executives and helping them
writing their speeches and working with

72
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,710
them to deliver their
speeches more effectively.

73
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,380
And in making that change,

74
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,390
I was concerned about how I was going
to be perceived in the organization.

75
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:12,670
I felt like a double outside.
There were very,

76
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:17,500
very few women at the level that I
was operating at. So I did two things.

77
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,020
I studied the men around me and I also
read a lot of books because there were

78
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:27,850
books that were being written at that
time for women coming into organizations

79
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:30,130
about what they needed
to do to be successful.

80
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,590
And I got a lot from what I was reading.
It was quite helpful to me,

81
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,340
but I noticed that every single thing
I read focused on how women needed to

82
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:48,361
change their leadership style in
order to adapt to the workplace.

83
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,980
There was nothing,

84
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,100
there was no acknowledgement that women
might have something to contribute or

85
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,010
that what they might have to contribute.

86
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:03,011
It could be valuable to organizations
in helping them change and,

87
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,800
and, and thrive in a rapidly
changing environment.

88
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,690
One thing I've learned is
women are, are really, uh,

89
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,990
avid consumers of books about
what is wrong with them.

90
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,380
But it seemed to be that there was room
to look at what women could contribute

91
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,610
and that that would be helpful. So I
decided to really on my own initiative,

92
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,280
uh, to start interviewing
and then doing diary studies.

93
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:32,230
So as shadowing,
uh,

94
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,300
some of America's best women leaders to
try to define what it was that they did

95
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,850
that w could be powerful for other
women to learn from and they could be

96
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:47,720
powerful for organizations to
understand what they had to contribute.

97
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,480
The women I studied were very
different, uh, ethnically,

98
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,650
geographically in terms of what sector
they were in. There was a big range,

99
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,860
but what I found was that there were five
characteristics that these women often

100
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:07,250
very different had in common.
First,

101
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,180
the women placed a very high value on the
quality of the relationships that they

102
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:15,440
built,

103
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,420
but also the relationships that women
generally in there or that people

104
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,440
generally in their organizations
were able to build with one another.

105
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:27,080
So there were very relationship focused.

106
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,590
The women had a bias for
direct communication rather
than communication up and

107
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,660
down a chain of command.

108
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,340
They wanted to talk directly to
whomever something concerned.

109
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,910
The women like to put themselves in
the center of things and lead from the

110
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,660
center rather than the top.

111
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:52,661
Some of them even put their offices in
the center of their organizations and

112
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:58,661
create what I called Webs of inclusion
to draw people in around the women.

113
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,990
Ha we're comfortable with as
opposed to tolerant of diversity.

114
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,960
They themselves have been outsiders
and had fresh eyes for understanding,

115
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,100
uh, the kinds of things, the
kind of value that outsiders,

116
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,920
an outsider perspective could provide.

117
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,160
And they also knew from
personal experience what
condescending behavior felt

118
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,120
like.
And finally,

119
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:31,121
the women were skilled at integrating
their personal and their professional

120
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:36,020
lives. And drawing on. A number of them
said to me, made a point of saying,

121
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:38,570
you know,
I'm the same person at work,

122
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,640
that I am at home as a mother,
as a sister, as a wife,

123
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,990
as a member of my community. And that
gives me a real source of strength.

124
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:52,880
And they were good at drawing information
from their private lives and using it

125
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,590
at work and vice versa.

126
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Now what has been really extraordinary
in my experience is to watch over the

127
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:08,961
last that was put out there in 1990
and those characteristics are now have

128
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:14,181
become in the years since really
thought of and often defined as women's

129
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,710
leadership characteristics.

130
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,860
But what has been amazing is to watch
the way in which those characteristics

131
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,400
have become much more mainstream and
recognized as characteristics of excellent

132
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:35,190
leaders in general that I've
been able to witness that.

133
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:40,020
And it has been really extraordinary.
And it is because the environment,

134
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
the economic environment that we're part
of technology and of course demographic

135
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:50,400
change have all supported the,

136
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,460
the recognition of those leadership
characteristics as important as

137
00:09:55,921 --> 00:10:00,540
organizations have had to connect more
directly with customers and clients.

138
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,090
They've gotten more
focused on relationships.

139
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,740
Tell you when the female advantage
came out and I talked about that value,

140
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,360
the woman placed on relationships,
I was told don't,

141
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,390
don't go there because talking about
relationships makes it sound very soft and

142
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,600
it's not good for women. Now every bank
wants to have a relationship with you.

143
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,610
There's a real emphasis on
the value of relationships.

144
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,860
Obviously comfort with diversity.

145
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,720
More and more important as we have
more diverse and globalized workforce,

146
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,230
the ability to put yourself in the
center of things rather than the top.

147
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,360
More adaptive as more work
gets done in teams and webs.

148
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,950
Uh, the ability to integrate
personal and professional. Again,

149
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:48,450
more important,
more adaptive as we move into a 24,

150
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,650
seven environment.

151
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,980
And obviously a bias for
direct communication is
more and more of a necessary

152
00:10:56,221 --> 00:11:00,060
skill given the nature of
networked technologies.

153
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,480
So it has been extraordinary to watch
this sort of confluence between what I

154
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:07,351
saw.

155
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:12,351
Women often bringing two organizations
where these characteristics had not been

156
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:17,481
defined as leadership characteristics
and the way in which the environment was

157
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:21,360
demanding these qualities. In fact, um,

158
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,580
it was so interesting to me a
couple months ago, Tom Friedman,

159
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:28,050
the New York Times columnists,

160
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,490
did a series called what it
takes to work at Google, uh,

161
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,870
in which he interviewed Laszlo Bock
and talked about what leadership

162
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:39,240
characteristics Google was looking for.

163
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,890
And I wrote a blog about it
cause I blogged for strategy
and business magazine,

164
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,130
the extraordinary overlap between
what Bach was describing as desirable

165
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:54,670
characteristics for leaders,
especially skill,

166
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,410
relationship building,

167
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,590
the ability to work seamlessly in webs
and teams and assume different positions

168
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,510
within them,
putting yourself in the middle.

169
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,020
And I thought it is extraordinary that
what Bach is describing 25 years ago,

170
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:16,240
20 years ago were really considered
women's leadership strengths.

171
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,220
And I think that has,
uh,

172
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,420
been very much to the advantage
not only of many women,

173
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:27,421
but it has also freed many men to
explore other sides of themselves and

174
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:32,710
recognize that they could be strong
leaders while doing that. Um,

175
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,210
so I think it has been a very
good thing that said, um,

176
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,450
about 2006 or 2007 even I tend to be
a glass half full type person began to

177
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,770
think now there's something amiss here.

178
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,370
If women are bringing these skills often
to organizations and these skills are

179
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:02,791
becoming recognized more as mainstream
leadership skills and organizations are

180
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:09,181
often hiring women at 50% and women are
becoming a increasingly represented at

181
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:15,190
the top in terms of business
and professional schools.

182
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Why aren't there more women at the very
top where they're making the kinds of

183
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:26,581
decisions that have the real strategic
influence on the direction of their

184
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:30,700
organizations and on
our society as a whole?

185
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:36,090
Why is there a leadership
barrier or gap still in place,

186
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,370
especially given this confluence between
what women bring and what organizations

187
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,840
increasingly need and what
caught my eye as I try,

188
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,550
as I pondered this and a lot of other
people who who are in this field generally

189
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:53,800
we're thinking about
that then and still are.

190
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,170
What struck me were two studies that
I came across, one done in Madrid,

191
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,670
one done in at NC add the
sort of the HBS of uh,

192
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,020
of France and Europe generally.
Um,

193
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,170
both of which were big global studies
and both of which showed the same thing.

194
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,020
What they showed is that when interviewing
senior leaders in organizations about

195
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:23,240
what,

196
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,240
where they saw women's strengths
and women's weaknesses,

197
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,100
the kinds of characteristics we've
been talking about, collaboration,

198
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:37,540
relationship building, direct
communication, negotiation, uh,

199
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,010
the senior leaders felt that the women
really demo that the women that in their

200
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:45,910
organizations demonstrated
them but demonstrated them,

201
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:50,911
but consistently what
those senior leaders sad,

202
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,350
the point where they felt women had
a weakness or needed to develop more

203
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:00,440
strength was around
the question of vision,

204
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,670
big picture thinking,
longterm focus.

205
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,030
So the executives in these two huge global
studies or critical of their women in

206
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:16,280
terms of their capacity for vision.

207
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,670
And this was an impediment to women's
perception of being ready for leadership.

208
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,190
And I,
what was fascinating also in the study,

209
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,580
because women often routinely tend to
under assess themselves and their skills

210
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,250
based on how they're perceived by others,

211
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,440
is the women didn't see this gap at all.

212
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,860
The women felt that they had a strong
vision that they have longterm.

213
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,950
Uh,

214
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,950
th th they were represented longterm
thinking and big picture focus very well.

215
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,640
So I thought something
isn't translating here.

216
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,110
Maybe it's time to explore what vision
really is in organizations and where

217
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:10,031
there may be a gap where women's vision
may not be translating in organizations

218
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,340
so that it can be understood
and recognized and valued
by senior leaders doing

219
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:25,511
that seemed to me an extremely
worthwhile project because in doing so,

220
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,260
I thought there's an opportunity to,
on one hand,

221
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:35,261
help women to better understand the nature
of their vision and articulate it in

222
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,610
a way that can be heard.
And at the same time,

223
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:45,611
there's an opportunity to
help organizations recognize
the power of vision that

224
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:50,720
women have the capacity to bring.

225
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,540
So this became my quest.

226
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,600
This became sort of in my view,

227
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,840
the next frontier that we
needed to research and get
some ideas and some answers

228
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:06,010
for in terms of what the,

229
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:11,070
the next area think about development
of leadership capacity for women.

230
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,180
So that's what I began focusing on and
I want to very briefly share to insights

231
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,480
from the really huge research
project that I undertook with a team,

232
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,200
uh,

233
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,200
to identify and articulate what
the female vision is and what its,

234
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,310
where its power could reside.

235
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,180
And then we'll open it up and start to
look at what does this mean for you next

236
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,870
Monday morning in terms of building a
leadership style that can lead you to make

237
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:48,950
a contribution that really
reflects your best talents,

238
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,740
your true talents,
and create a career for yourself.

239
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:56,040
That's very satisfying in
the course of doing that.

240
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,300
The two insights, so I want to
do this briefly. The first one,

241
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,170
and this I think is really a big deal.

242
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,450
What we learned not just from
doing interviews and case studies,

243
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:14,451
but also from working with
some neuroscientific labs
at Ucla and Columbia that

244
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:20,631
were doing research on what happens
when people's brains are operating.

245
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,360
What we learned is that,
and of course we're humans,

246
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:26,040
so there's always a spectrum here.

247
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,380
It's not all men are this way
and all women are that way,

248
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,600
but what we learned is that in general

249
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,310
women's attention tends to
operate in some distinctive ways.

250
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,900
What women notice,
which is a building block of vision.

251
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,990
Think about what is vision.
Vision is what you notice.

252
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,120
Then it's what you value about what you
notice and then it's the story you tell

253
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:54,750
yourself about why what
you're noticing is important.

254
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:58,320
So notice is really the
building block of vision,

255
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,470
this primary building block and what
we found is that women's women tend to

256
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:11,661
notice a lot of things at once and this
is verifiable in neuroscientific labs.

257
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,590
When they hook up people up to
functional Mris and watch the brain and

258
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:19,740
operation,
women are noticing all the time.

259
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,110
They're noticing different things at once.

260
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,430
They're attention is scanning
and operating kind of light,

261
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:31,431
a radar and they're processing
and parallel a lot of
information from different

262
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:32,844
sources.

263
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Whereas men tend to have a much
more focused style of noticing,

264
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,460
looking at one thing at a time,

265
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,400
focusing in on it with their attention,

266
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:48,660
operating more like a
laser rather than a radar.

267
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,520
And this matters,

268
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,300
this matters when we think
about leadership because
in many organizations in

269
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:02,631
many organizations focused
notice is perceived of and
privileged as a leadership

270
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,473
style.

271
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,870
And those who have a more broad spectrum
notice as we called it in the book,

272
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,350
are thought of sometimes as being all
over the place by those who have very

273
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:21,180
focused notice.
I can give you an example,

274
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:26,330
a day to day example of how this operates
and what some of the consequences are.

275
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,170
Right here in the bay area, uh,
spent some time with a woman,

276
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,510
Susan Bernstein. She gotten her Mba,
she joined a hot shot consulting firm.

277
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,800
And uh, when she came in
she was told, you know,

278
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:45,360
your first big client case, your first
big meeting. Want you to go to that?

279
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,850
Don't say anything.
Just notice.

280
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,190
Just notice what is going on in that room.

281
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,670
So Susan went to the meeting and she
noticed and what she noticed was that the

282
00:20:57,101 --> 00:21:02,101
two chief clients on this project
couldn't stand one another,

283
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,760
nor could their staffs that it
was there and their body language.

284
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,220
There was a real feeling
of tension in the room.

285
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,840
And when she came back to a meeting and
she was asked, what? What did you notice?

286
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,420
She said that she said,
what I noticed,

287
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:20,230
the big thing I noticed is that these
two guys seem to be at one another's

288
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:23,260
throats.
And what she was told was,

289
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,710
that's not what you
were supposed to notice.

290
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,260
You're not there as an HR consultant.
You are there as a business consultant.

291
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,430
What you were supposed to notice was
the presentation and the numbers.

292
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,060
How did you think they added up?
And she said,

293
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,350
I went away from that meeting
thinking, boy, did I blow it.

294
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,670
I will never do that again.
And she said,

295
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:53,671
I spent the next seven years in that
organization suppressing my capacity to

296
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:01,291
notice what was going on among people
so that I could better fit the mold.

297
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,780
She said in the result of that,

298
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,210
the result of that was that I lost my
passion for what I was doing because I

299
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,380
felt inauthentic.

300
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,740
I felt as if I was constantly using energy
to suppress what my best observations

301
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:22,720
were. Uh, and she said,
and Oh, by the way,

302
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,060
six months after I joined that team,
that project blew up and it blew up.

303
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,770
Not because the numbers were poor,

304
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,240
but because these two guys were at one
another's throats and ended up in a

305
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:38,140
lawsuit that in fact involved us.
He said,

306
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:41,500
so there was a real consequence
for me suppressing that,

307
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,900
but I still knew and I understood and
I was given to understand that that

308
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:50,350
information was not what my
company wanted me to here.

309
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,960
So there's an example of the,

310
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,120
the cost of suppressing the
power of what you notice. Um,

311
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,040
it seemed very,

312
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,720
very clear to me and one of the
things that I have come to believe

313
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,250
is that this capacity for Broadspectrum
notice is something that in 10 or 15

314
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:20,671
years we will really recognize
as a leadership attribute
in the same way that we

315
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:25,750
have come to recognize
skill at collaboration,

316
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,960
relationship building and
direct communication as a
strong leadership attribute.

317
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,583
Um,

318
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,830
I think that because organizations are
changing so rapidly and innovation is so

319
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:43,870
much apart of where
organizational value gets defined,

320
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,530
that that capacity broad spectrum
notice will become more important.

321
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,770
And the more prepared we are to recognize
what it is and articulate its value in

322
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:59,030
a way. And this what we'll be getting to
in the sort of how to part of this, uh,

323
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:04,031
that laser light noticers can understand
the more opportunity we'll have to

324
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:10,961
position ourselves for
really for leadership and for
being able to leverage the

325
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:17,780
power of that. I think that's
going to happen after I'd, um,

326
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,770
about a couple of months after
the female vision came out,

327
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:24,300
I read an interview with Jeff Immelt,

328
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:29,310
the chair and CEO of Ge and he was
asked what is the number one leadership

329
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,070
capability that Ge is going to be
hiring for and training for in the years

330
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,270
ahead.

331
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:43,270
And what he said was the capacity to
see around the corners because that's

332
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:47,150
what's needed in today's environment.
And I thought,

333
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,070
how are you going to see
around the corners unless
you're skilled at harnessing

334
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,570
both broad spectrum and
focus notice when they,

335
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,640
when they work together,

336
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:03,670
you've got an opportunity to get more
information than you would if it were

337
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,540
alone.
So I'm going to stop for a moment and um,

338
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,160
cause that's a certain amount of material.

339
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,120
I do have one other insight
from the book and then we'll,

340
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,580
we'll drill down more on to,
uh,

341
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,940
asking you to think about
how this might apply to you.

342
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,970
But are there any questions here on,
uh,

343
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:27,260
the question of notice or on the
leadership capabilities that we've been

344
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:31,780
discussing or the way in which,
uh,

345
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,850
those have become more
recognized as mainstream?

346
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,290
Has that been your experience?
Uh,

347
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,230
do you have anything that you can
share on that? Uh, it's actually, um,

348
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:47,410
rather enlightening for you to say that
that broad spectrum notice or the women

349
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:53,240
aren't considered to have much vision is
one of the things you want to point out.

350
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:56,870
Because actually I left my
last role because my manager,

351
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,310
a male manager said I didn't have any
strategy or vision. And I said, well,

352
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:04,370
you're ignoring the project.
I've been spending most of my time doing,

353
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:06,500
which is a strategic
vision for the next step.

354
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,040
And I came over here to Google in order
to work for a woman who I think thinks I

355
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:17,080
have strategy and vision. But I think, um,

356
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,770
my question then is if you feel
that you do a strategy and vision,

357
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,890
how do you express that to so many things?
You don't.

358
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,720
Someone who'd thinks you're dumb. So
this will get us a little more. We can,

359
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,410
we can do this move into what some of the,
um,

360
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:36,200
some of the practices that
have been talking about, uh,

361
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,730
that we'll be focusing on here.

362
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,140
So let me get into that in answer to
your question because I think that's sort

363
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:45,030
of the key question.
How do you,

364
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,060
if you think like the
women in the studies,

365
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,570
if you think you've got strong vision
and a strategic way of thinking,

366
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,950
how do you,
as it were,

367
00:26:55,951 --> 00:27:00,951
translate that to somebody who may
have a very narrow noticing style and

368
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:08,211
therefore is judging you as someone who
doesn't because you're not articulating

369
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:12,870
it in ways that they're comfortable
with. How do you do that? Um,

370
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,640
and most of this I've really learned
since the book came out working with women

371
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,820
to develop their capacity to articulate
and translate what their vision is.

372
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,390
A couple of things that I
think are important and some
of them come from talking

373
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:31,650
to Susan Bernstein afterwards,
seven, eight years afterwards.

374
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,140
One of the questions I asked her is,

375
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,560
what would you have done differently
when you came into that meeting and said,

376
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:43,650
I noticed these two guys were at
one another's throats, is there,

377
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,260
is there a different way
you would have handled that?

378
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,890
And she said a couple of things that
I think are really helpful in thinking

379
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:51,600
about how to do this,
how to,

380
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,820
how to translate this capacity.
She said, first of all,

381
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,290
these are real data guys. You
know their Mbas, they got,

382
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:05,460
they think live, breathe, eat numbers.

383
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,800
She said,
first of all,

384
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,270
I would have gone in and the first thing
I would have done would be to address

385
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,560
what they were interested and show
them, you know, I saw the numbers.

386
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,220
This is how I perceive them.
Rather than saying,

387
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:22,650
this is the main thing I noticed.
She said,

388
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:27,651
because right away what I learned with
them is they were going to see that as to

389
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:31,200
some degree off topic.
So getting out of the way,

390
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:36,120
addressing what I understood was important
to them would have been helpful to me.

391
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,770
She said.
Secondly,

392
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I should have been more data like in my
presentation of what I noticed rather

393
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:51,150
than just saying and I noticed this
and then trying to give the details,

394
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:56,040
you know, so and so's um, uh, ad men, uh,

395
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,870
seem to sit in a place that
the other admin was, you know,

396
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,590
all these kind of little details that
she was giving to justify or explain what

397
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:06,180
she noticed.
She said,

398
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,390
I wish I had presented that more as
data going in and saying something like,

399
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,830
here's what I noticed about the numbers.

400
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,980
Here's what I think is
important about that. I,

401
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,160
I will say that in order for this to
happen and that to happen and that to

402
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:24,054
happen,

403
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,240
we need to have a real strong commitment
from the two principals because here's

404
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:35,370
one way that could fall apart.
Here's another way that could fall apart.

405
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,580
So that I was really explaining to them
why I thought it was important for them

406
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,060
for their bottom line,

407
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,650
but what they were concerned
about that these two principles,

408
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,110
we're on the same page she said.

409
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:55,111
And then if I had sad and I have concerns
about how long term their commitment

410
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,390
to one another is,

411
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,610
and I can share with you the reasons
for those concerns offline. She said,

412
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:08,050
because in a way there these guys were a
little bit uncomfortable with that kind

413
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:09,430
of material,
you know,

414
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:13,810
so I can explain that to you
when we're offline if you'd like,

415
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,140
but I have concerns and here I think are
some of the potential consequences for

416
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:22,930
us for our division.

417
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,300
If there are problems down the line.
Here are a couple of scenarios.

418
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,480
She said I could have even had a slide
or two about what these scenarios were.

419
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,140
She said,
in other words,

420
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,320
if I had really translated that into
a style of presentation that they were

421
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:48,271
comfortable with rather than presenting
it as very contextual and almost as they

422
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:52,840
would see it subjective,

423
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,230
I think I would have had
a better shot she said.

424
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,860
But the other thing I learned is the,

425
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,970
the big mistake I made was to
back off and to immediately think,

426
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,010
oh boy, I blew it. Um, and, and to,

427
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,670
to take that to heart and
pull away from it, she said,

428
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,530
because what she said,

429
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,560
I should have gone in there really
prepared to not argue the case,

430
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:25,321
but present the case for why this was
important and represent that she said,

431
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,320
because that's really the vision part.
She said,

432
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:34,321
my vision here is we needed
to address this issue.

433
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,630
We needed to recognize this issue.

434
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,780
We needed to be prepared for the kinds
of things that could go wrong because of

435
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:47,800
this issue. Uh, that was my
vision. That's what I saw.

436
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,760
She said,
Anne,

437
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,760
I needed to explain it in terms that
they understood and I needed to,

438
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,830
to be prepared to defend myself
instead of just quickly backing off.

439
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,670
So I think that's,
that's sort of the, the,

440
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:08,671
the takeaway here is be prepared to,

441
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,010
I don't want to use the word defend it,

442
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,180
but be prepared to back it
up and stand your ground.

443
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,440
But know that in presenting
what you have to present,

444
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,430
if you're presenting
to a very bottom line,

445
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,820
get to the point,
um,

446
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,090
focused notice boss or someone you,

447
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,690
you want to be able to articulate that
in a way that they are comfortable with

448
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,650
and where they're not being asked to
imagine a situation that they're not very

449
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:49,550
good at noticing or judging because
that's going to them. Make them feel like,

450
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,270
how did I miss that? Is, is
something wrong with me? Clearly not.

451
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,370
She's one of these touchy feely women.

452
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,990
It was all concerned about what people's
relationships are with one another.

453
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,430
That's not really what we're here for.
We're business consultants.

454
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:08,510
So she said she could have
really handled that differently.

455
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,590
Um,

456
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:14,590
and understood that bringing both
perspectives together could be really

457
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:16,304
valuable.

458
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:21,430
There's one other thing I want to say
because I've gotten very aware of this

459
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:24,230
kind of presentation
since the book came out.

460
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:26,150
And since I've worked with some women,

461
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:30,620
I've worked down in San Diego for awhile
with women in a biotech firm who are

462
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:35,600
having real problems presenting what
some of their research points are because

463
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:39,560
they were getting a critiqued
as being all over the map.

464
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:44,210
So we were really trying to almost
reverse engineer and figure out what,

465
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:48,080
what do you need in this
presentation about this data?

466
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,840
What is going to set these guys at ease?
And in watching, because I would, um,

467
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,990
we did some role playing,
but in watching some of the presentations,

468
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,330
here's one thing I saw over and over.

469
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,930
Women would often start with a kind of
backstory to let their listeners know how

470
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:09,500
they came up with what they came
up with. Said, well, you know,

471
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,580
I am going to tell you how I came to
this research and I'll tell you this

472
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:16,370
research point in a moment.
But let me tell you how I got there.

473
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:19,880
Let me tell you the process by
which I got there. Uh, you know,

474
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:23,330
I was having a conversation with so
and so. You've lost them already.

475
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,660
If you've got a really
tightly focused focus noticer,

476
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,350
a laser light guy,

477
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:35,710
his mind almost clicks off when you
start to tell him what the backstory is.

478
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,690
Much more powerful because
we've gone through this,

479
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,900
we've gone through this
process and watched it work
much more powerful is to be

480
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:52,031
able to present it in a very focused
data like way and then say if you're

481
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:57,380
interested at some point
in how I got to this,

482
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,550
be glad to share it with you
but not do it as the opener.

483
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,730
Because often women use personal stories
to establish relationship as a way of

484
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:11,840
sharing and preparing
to share information.

485
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,850
And often not always, there are men
who are very different than this,

486
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,240
but often with men in
real business situations,

487
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,550
that's not cultural for them and it's
not something they're comfortable with so

488
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:29,180
it can numb.
It can certainly be surmounted.

489
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:33,410
And this was one of my goals in
developing and looking at, you know,

490
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:37,340
what is a female vision?
How can that be incorporated?

491
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,000
Part of it is how do we interpret it?
So, great question. Does that help?

492
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,180
Thank [inaudible] about

493
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,430
describing things,
um,

494
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,670
to an audience that is more laser like
in their focus and starting with data and

495
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:56,790
then offering to tell a personal story
if it would be helpful at the end.

496
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,950
Correct. Um, I feel like striking that
balance is really hard. I know that,

497
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,400
that when I,
you know,

498
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:06,180
in the past have started with telling
a personal story or making a personal

499
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:07,660
connection,
um,

500
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,940
that it has been met at times with
skepticism and then, you know,

501
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:13,890
you lose your audience and
then you can't get it back.

502
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,830
And I feel like I've over corrected now.
Now I feel like I,

503
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,570
I don't talk about myself as often.
I don't make those personal connections.

504
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:25,880
I don't share those stories because
I've over corrected, um, after it had,

505
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,030
you know, having been met with this
skepticism. Yeah. And I do feel like,

506
00:36:30,031 --> 00:36:31,170
especially at Google,

507
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,040
it's helpful to tell those
personal stories and make
those personal connections

508
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,000
even with people with a laser like
focus. Yeah. And so, you know,

509
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:43,350
getting it right here I think has been
a challenge because, uh, you know,

510
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:44,850
I understand what you're talking about,

511
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,970
but I feel like this environment
may be a little unique. Yeah. Um,

512
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,920
at least on the legal team, I
think we're, we're where I work.

513
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,660
Uh Huh. You know, I love that because, um,

514
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,110
I have watched women do this and the,

515
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,960
the biotech team that I was working
with for awhile, that began to happen.

516
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:06,960
They began to, okay, we're going to do
this, we're going to do the data thing.

517
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,520
And suddenly they had lost
their personality. And you know,

518
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,960
women are often very ripe
to be criticized. And it
was like, well, you know,

519
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:20,670
she's a robot. Uh, she doesn't seem
to have any warmth or personality.

520
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:25,740
This is what happened to Susan Bernstein,
the woman up in the bay area when, uh,

521
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:29,700
up in the East Bay when
she said, um, you know,

522
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:31,680
I lost who I was.

523
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,270
I lost what part of what my
authentic value was. And she said,

524
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,340
I began to,
I remember years ago,

525
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:43,341
I bought a fantastic quote from a woman
that just to me epitomized what happens

526
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,170
when you lose your authenticity at work.

527
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:51,170
She said sometimes I feel as if my body
is only vehicle to carry my head to the

528
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:58,491
computer and to me that sort of
encapsulate everything we want to avoid as

529
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:05,841
people and I think that comes when
you suppress what's good in yourself.

530
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,330
So what you're doing,
what your,

531
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,320
your you're noticing,
excuse me,

532
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,710
you're noticing that you overcorrected
is part of a process I believe of coming

533
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,690
to a very strong and authentic way
of being in the world and presenting

534
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:31,050
yourself.
On one hand you,

535
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:36,170
you had the confidence and the humility
to notice that the way you were

536
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:40,480
presenting wasn't necessarily
landing and the way you wanted.

537
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:45,810
So you made corrections but then you're
open to also noticing that you corrected

538
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:50,440
too far and you're searching
to find that balance point.

539
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,740
But you can't search to find that balance
point unless you are aware of what

540
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:59,020
both feel like.
And it sounds as if you are.

541
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:04,350
So I would say that this is really part
of this process to getting toward a very

542
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,660
strong and our authentic way of
presenting what your vision is.

543
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,040
And that one of the things I hope is that
being able to recognize and articulate

544
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:18,790
some of these differences,

545
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:23,791
putting it in the frame of laser and
radar notice and recognize and where your

546
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:29,740
own capabilities and comfort level lies,

547
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,950
that that in itself can be helpful and
identifying what the issue is and then in

548
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,360
coming to understand how to take action.
Okay,

549
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,380
let me go to the one other quick insight
from the book that I'd like to share

550
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,050
and uh, and then we'll,
we'll, we'll do more of this.

551
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:55,690
And in terms of focusing
on what it means to you

552
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,460
talk about vision, this is
what you notice. Then the
next step is what you value.

553
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,720
So one thing we were really wanted
to learn was, are there similar,

554
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:12,750
what are the similarities and differences
in what men and women really value

555
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:14,560
about their work,

556
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:18,460
about their experience in the
organizations they're part of?

557
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,910
Where's that overlap?
How does that happen? Um,

558
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,820
so we ran out a big,
because getting, you know,

559
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:27,940
when you ask a question about what
you value, it can be pretty abstract.

560
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,350
So what we did was we ran out of big
study looking at similarities and

561
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:36,790
differences in how men and women perceive,

562
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,570
define and pursue satisfaction at work.

563
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,300
And what we found that was a big study.

564
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:46,920
We used Harris Interactive to
deliver it to a huge sample of,

565
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:52,030
of people at a variety of levels,
director and above in organizations.

566
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:57,780
And what we found is that there were
some strong similarities between what men

567
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:02,920
and women valued. Uh, they
wanted to be recognized,

568
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,040
they wanted to feel authentic at work.

569
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,270
They want recognized for
the real achievements. They,

570
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,300
they took great satisfaction in being
a part of a team or leading a team and

571
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:20,761
they took great satisfaction in achieving
goals and being able to check those

572
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:21,610
off.

573
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:26,610
But we found two areas of significant
difference in terms of value.

574
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:32,611
And I think this has a real impact in
terms of how you think about your vision

575
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,170
and positioning yourself
in the organization.

576
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,170
The two areas that were different
were, first of all, women tended to

577
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:49,540
define their success based on their own
terms that they had set for themselves.

578
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Whereas the men in the study really
defined success almost exclusively in

579
00:41:55,971 --> 00:42:00,930
competitive terms. I came
out ahead of him, uh,

580
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,330
and therefore I'm satisfied.

581
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,220
So it was very competitive in terms
of how they perceived success,

582
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:11,480
whereas women were more likely to
have their own benchmarks for success.

583
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:17,080
And the other thing was that women were
more focused upon and tended to judge as

584
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:24,101
satisfying the everyday
experience of work that they had.

585
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,173
Um,

586
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,360
whereas the man that we studied were more
likely to perceived satisfaction based

587
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,580
on position and monetary reward
position and monetary reward.

588
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,580
We're important for women not saying that,

589
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:48,910
but they were important to women in
the context of also having a satisfying

590
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:51,860
experience of every day.

591
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,450
And that experience was often defined by,
um,

592
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,430
the ability to develop high quality
relationships and maintain them over time

593
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,450
and by the capacity to some extent,
uh, control their own pace, uh,

594
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,570
at work. And, um,

595
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,860
and these differentials I
think really do matter. Uh,

596
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,660
and when we think about it,

597
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,380
one of the things that we see is that
organizations given this often define

598
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:29,711
motivation or assume motivation
based on primarily male criteria.

599
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:35,300
The idea is competitive ranking
will be a spur to performance,

600
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,410
maybe, maybe not. It's
kind of a diversity issue.

601
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,540
Competitive ranking isn't going to be
a spur to performance for everyone.

602
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,050
Um, and, and yet we see, I mean,

603
00:43:48,051 --> 00:43:52,430
we even see organizations even now
adopting these competitive curves,

604
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,190
uh,
which can be very problematic.

605
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,450
And in this strikes me as
not much of an issue here,

606
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:03,080
which makes my heart sing. I will say, uh,

607
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,430
it seems that there's real attention
here to what the quality of people's

608
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:12,200
experience is, at least from
the, from the optics. Uh,

609
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:16,970
and that that is really important for
creating organizations that really

610
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:20,120
motivate women to develop their best.

611
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,600
That what is the everyday experience.
Um,

612
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:28,930
one thing we found when we interviewed
women who had left high positions that

613
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:33,660
were very monetarily, um, what we found,

614
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:37,380
they tended to say was to do
something else. They'd say,

615
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,750
I decided it just wasn't worth it.

616
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,320
Meaning while the money and
the position were great,

617
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,620
those weren't as profoundly intrinsic to
what my values were because my everyday

618
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:56,330
experience was not fulfilling because I
didn't feel like I had any control over

619
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,020
my pace, for example. Um,

620
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,210
I didn't feel that I could value that.

621
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,510
So I think it's really
important in organizations,

622
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:09,020
and this is something for,
uh,

623
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:13,710
for everybody who's out there to think
about to some extent, you know, we're,

624
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,830
we're looking at diversity
as an issue so often,

625
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,670
but motivation is a
diversity issue as well.

626
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:25,671
People are motivated by different
things and it's really helpful for us as

627
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:31,041
individuals to recognize what really
motivates us and to share that information

628
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,760
because that's helpful
to the organization.

629
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:40,761
It's helpful to our bosses what really
gets us engaged and it's not going to be

630
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,960
the same for everyone. So I think
that's an important point. Any, uh,

631
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,420
any question or observation on this?

632
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,070
So in my old job in public accounting,

633
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,330
I felt like every time there is a happy
hour or like an employee appreciation

634
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:59,720
thing, it was always like, here's a bunch
of food and alcohol. And it was like,

635
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:00,820
that was kind of like what they thought,

636
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,320
like how they felt like they were like
paying people back or thinking them.

637
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,280
And I like tried multiple times kind of
to talk to HR and say like I would much

638
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:11,510
more appreciate like a massage or a
spa day or something like where I could

639
00:46:11,511 --> 00:46:14,420
relax that was so it wouldn't make me
feel appreciated as opposed to like hear

640
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:17,270
like you just worked like 80 hour weeks.

641
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:20,450
So like drink all the alcohol you
aren't like, that's like get your,

642
00:46:20,451 --> 00:46:23,620
get your money back that way. You
know? So I think it was, and I,

643
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:28,040
it was never something that they really
valued or like really tried to change or

644
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,980
like let's do a wine tasting class.
Like even if you want to do alcohol,

645
00:46:30,981 --> 00:46:31,671
like let's look like,

646
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:35,150
let's do something a little bit different
than like greasy food and a happy hour.

647
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,540
So I was just like an observation,
just like for that,

648
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:39,650
like just not listening really.

649
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:44,060
Or like really trying to see like what
would motivate people or make them feel

650
00:46:44,061 --> 00:46:46,850
appreciated. And it sounds like there's
a reason you're not there anymore.

651
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,600
Yes. And that it's a kind of mismatch
of values and I think more and more,

652
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:53,660
I mean this is one of
the gifts that women,

653
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,490
and also I think a younger generation
which is well represented here of workers

654
00:46:58,491 --> 00:47:03,491
upbringing in being more in touch
with what really motivates them.

655
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:08,540
A greater understanding of that
and a willingness to what you do,

656
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:13,220
what you did, which was to try to
tell them, you may find, you know,

657
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:17,360
there are people here who find this
highly motivating and rewarding than there

658
00:47:17,361 --> 00:47:21,020
are people like me who don't
find it that motivating.

659
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:26,230
Why not look more broadly too to think
about what what could engage people and

660
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:32,771
what I see with organizations is more
focus on how do we engage diverse

661
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:40,471
employees but often not thinking of
that in terms of motivation and reward.

662
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,150
And I believe that is something that's
going to be changing over the next 10

663
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:49,870
years. That there's going to be
a much more recognition that,

664
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,570
I mean in the old days,
you know, they, they,

665
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,720
they give recognition to a male executive
would be a mink stole for his wife.

666
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,790
You know, how generic
can you get? So we're,

667
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:04,870
we're moving to something that's
kind of the madman era. Um,

668
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:09,790
we're moving to something that is much
more customized and we're really part of

669
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:12,520
that. So, um,

670
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,400
three things going,

671
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:20,401
looking at what this can mean for those
of you who are here and out there in

672
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:26,950
terms of how you think about
your own leadership capacity,

673
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:32,610
we've talked a bit about how
important it is to articulate,

674
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,590
um,
what you see the power of what you see,

675
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,800
the value of what you notice in a way
that those who have a different spectrum

676
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:50,740
of notice can understand
the, the, if you will,

677
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:55,770
responsibility to think about how you're
going to translate that in order to

678
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:58,000
really stand behind it strongly.

679
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,450
But there's another aspect of the notice,

680
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,900
a duality that I think is important to
understand and it has to do with not

681
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:12,931
expecting those who have a very focused
notice to notice certain things about.

682
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:17,350
You had a great example of
it right here in the valley,

683
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,900
uh,
with a young woman engineer.

684
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:23,740
I said electronic arts or something.

685
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,790
I'm not remembering because it was
a big workshop. Anyway, she, Ellen,

686
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,290
Isaac's,

687
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:34,180
I do remember a name and I remember a
face and we were talking about this notice

688
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:37,780
saying business and what different
people notice. And she said, you know,

689
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:42,070
I had the best example of that.
This really helps me understand something.

690
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,263
She said,

691
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:48,310
I've always thought of myself as a real
goto person in the organization. Uh,

692
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:52,450
people contact me about things that
might not even relate directly to my job.

693
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:57,040
I get lots of calls, lots of
emails, people in and out of
my office. She said, Anne,

694
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:01,720
and a couple of weeks ago,
we went offsite on a, um,

695
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:06,700
a retreat where we had our
performance review done. She said,

696
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,750
and my performance, my boss was there.
My performance review came back.

697
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:15,700
We had a talk about it, she
said, and basically what he
said was, she's terrific.

698
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:20,670
She does very high quality
work, but she does. Um,

699
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,040
she does, she's not broadly enough
connected in the organization.

700
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,710
She seems to spend a lot of
time in her office. She thought,

701
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,300
what the very thing I think I'm best at,

702
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,780
he doesn't notice how
can that be possible?

703
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:41,080
And she said she spent some time
after that really feeling bad,

704
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,860
wondering if she should work for the
guy who she really liked working for.

705
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,880
Um, and just kind of taking
it to heart. She said,

706
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:54,860
I felt like I'd been
punched in the stomach to be
criticized on the thing I felt

707
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:58,490
I was best about. She said, but
listening to this, she said,

708
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:03,491
what I realize is I was expecting him to
notice something that he may not just,

709
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:09,770
is kind of not in his
radar span for noticing.

710
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,790
How would he know how
broadly connected I am?

711
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:19,040
I never told him. He doesn't monitor my
emails, see who comes into my office.

712
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:23,900
Um, he doesn't monitor my phone
calls. I had never told him. She said,

713
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:28,901
so what I realized I had to do was come
up with a way to share this information

714
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:33,910
with him explicitly.
So she began a kind of um,

715
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,590
program for herself where she,
um,

716
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,820
every two weeks she sent
him an email saying,

717
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,650
talk to so and so connected these two
people, et Cetera, et cetera. She said,

718
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:48,680
I felt so nervous about doing that.

719
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:51,950
I felt so frightened about doing that.
I thought he was going to say,

720
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,390
why is she wasting my time with this?
Why is she blowing her own horn?

721
00:51:56,391 --> 00:52:00,170
All of a sudden to me, she
said, his response was,

722
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:05,530
this is information I need to know because
what you're doing is strengthening me

723
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,390
your bit because you work for me.

724
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:12,800
You are building my connections and
I need to know that information.

725
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:17,690
So she had a real recognition of,

726
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:22,850
of the power of handling that well and
getting past this sort of shyness about

727
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,690
articulating what she
was doing to her boss,

728
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,960
but really also recognizing I went in
there expecting he would just notice

729
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:39,221
things that I might notice even though
I had plenty of information to let me

730
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:43,040
know that that's not how he saw
things. He wasn't always, I wonder,

731
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,110
I wonder what Alan's doing.

732
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,680
I wonder if Ellen knows this person
said it wasn't on his radar screen.

733
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,370
It's not really how he thinks. So, um,

734
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,410
that's the other side of the notice.

735
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:00,550
So you thinking about your vision and
I think it's really important for us to

736
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:06,281
articulate and to have in mind really an
idea for describing what our vision is.

737
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,280
Whatever we are in a job,

738
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:15,281
what is my vision for what I could be
doing in this job and how does that fit

739
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,870
with the larger vision I have of what
could be helpful for this organization.

740
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:25,870
The more you can articulate that and
have it almost in your back pocket, um,

741
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,810
the more powerful it will be.

742
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:32,811
But also what's great about doing that
is you can use the vision that you have

743
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:40,430
to begin to build allies in a very
strategic way in organizations today.

744
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:47,940
There's so much emphasis on getting a
mentor and getting a sponsor and all that.

745
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:52,290
And I thought Cheryl Sandberg did a
great job of addressing why that can

746
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:53,820
sometimes be problematic.

747
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:58,080
Certainly I've worked in organizations
where the women who are in very senior

748
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:03,081
positions are besieged with
requests to be mentors and sponsors,

749
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,210
um, in often a way that
somewhat in organic. Uh,

750
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:11,520
and I think that the emphasis on it,
although it's very,

751
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:12,960
very helpful and important.

752
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:17,520
And I've seen organizations where
women's opportunities are transformed by

753
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:21,600
mentoring and sponsor ship programs,
but allies,

754
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:26,601
sponsors and mentors or one kind
of ally and allies can be peers.

755
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,280
They can be people who report to us.

756
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:34,610
They're people who are engaged in
helping you achieve what you want and who

757
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:40,911
recognize that in doing that they
can strengthen themselves as well.

758
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,990
That's what an ally is.
So it's not necessarily a level.

759
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:51,470
And I believe that women can really
strengthen themselves by using the vision

760
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:57,780
that they articulate to enlist allies.

761
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:02,990
Women are great at building
relationships in general,

762
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:08,240
but they're not always as great
at leveraging relationships
as making sure those

763
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:15,291
relationships help them achieve what
they're trying to achieve and helping the

764
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:21,210
people who are allied with them also
achieve what their objectives are.

765
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:25,950
Often we can be shy about saying,

766
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,080
this is what I'm trying to do,

767
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,560
this is how you can help me and this is
how you can benefit from that and oh by

768
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,640
the way, what can I do for
you? One thing I've noticed,

769
00:55:38,641 --> 00:55:42,900
and I've had this discussion often with
people in HR and I had this discussion

770
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:45,450
with hedge with head hunters as well,

771
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,200
is women will come into
a position and think,

772
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,940
I need to get really good at this.

773
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,110
I'm going to keep my head down for the
next six months and I'm going to master

774
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:59,970
this job and then I can look up and
start to bring people in around me.

775
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,780
Whereas often you'll find a
successful male, we'll go into a job.

776
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:08,010
And the his first question is
who do I need to reach out to?

777
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,040
Who can help me make this a success?

778
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:16,370
So right away he's engaging people who
is going to help me be successful at

779
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:18,030
this.

780
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:23,030
And the result is that he has more support
and more visibility for what he does.

781
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:28,350
That keeping your head down and trying
to become an expert can cost you in terms

782
00:56:28,871 --> 00:56:30,370
of visibility and support.

783
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:34,330
So it's something that
I always have urged and,

784
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,890
and the reasons and the techniques
around it change over time.

785
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,480
But for women,

786
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:45,160
it's really important to think once you
have articulated what you're trying to

787
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:49,570
do, who can help me build this?
How can I bring people in?

788
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,180
How can I leverage their skills?

789
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:57,181
I did a program at a huge global
financial institution in DC,

790
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:02,860
DC based a couple of months ago.
Uh, it was a big women's program.

791
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:07,861
There were hundreds of women there and
they were in a place of some degree of

792
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:08,860
discouragement.

793
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:14,430
And what I learned was
that the organization had
recently done a survey on who

794
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:21,901
people preferred as bosses and men and
women both perceived that having a male

795
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:28,240
boss was more desirable.
And I was fascinated by this.

796
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:33,220
So once we'd done our program I said,
can I, can I do some backgrounding here?

797
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:38,221
Can I learn a little more about why this
was what it is in your culture that was

798
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:42,670
responsible for that? What I learned
were two things. First of all,

799
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:46,720
in that environment where there were
very few women who are bosses, women,

800
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:50,770
we're often perceived of as tougher
bosses because they were so invested in

801
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:54,940
doing things kind of perfectly themselves
that they seem to have less tolerant.

802
00:57:55,210 --> 00:58:00,210
But the other thing which relates to
this is that men were perceived to have

803
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,660
better connections in the
organization as a whole.

804
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:09,610
And people wanted to be on a team
where where their boss had a lot of

805
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:14,350
connections because they understood and
recognized that that was going to be

806
00:58:14,351 --> 00:58:16,180
good for them down the line.

807
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:21,420
So to the extent that you're not
building alliances and connections,

808
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:26,560
that's going to have an impact upon
also how your team perceives you.

809
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:30,610
Um, so I think it's something
really important. And again,

810
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,990
building relationships is not always
the same thing as leveraging them.

811
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,140
Remember we talked about
citizen Bernstein saying,

812
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:43,470
I wish I had been able to stand up for
what I saw and standing up I think is

813
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:49,000
something we need to think about.

814
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:55,560
I have been asked for 25 years what
women need to do to build a stronger,

815
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,220
more effective leadership presence.

816
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,890
Do Women need to have a farmer handshake?

817
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:12,550
Is that how we walk what we're wearing?
Should you carry a person to a meeting?

818
00:59:12,551 --> 00:59:16,760
Are you making yourself look weaker if
you're carrying a purse or encumbered and

819
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:21,350
other ways, it's always
cosmetic, what the questions are.

820
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:27,250
But having spent 25 years working
with some of the best women leaders,

821
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,760
best leaders around the world,

822
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:37,510
I've come to the conclusion that what
really builds leadership presence is the

823
00:59:40,431 --> 00:59:43,070
capacity to be present,

824
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:47,720
to be present in the moment
for the person in front of you,

825
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,700
for the task in front of you,

826
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:53,270
for the actual situation that you're in.

827
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:58,270
And there is a reason that the word
presence and present are essentially the

828
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:03,560
same it that those are connected.

829
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:08,870
And what's rather daunting
about this is that in a 24,

830
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,610
seven environment that we're part of
where technology is a part of how we're

831
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:15,290
interacting all the time.

832
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:20,750
It can be difficult to build,
to be responsive,

833
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,560
to do your job,
but in the course of doing that,

834
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:29,590
also build the kind of leadership
presence that gives you real strengths and

835
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,400
makes you perceived of as a leader.

836
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:39,230
Because the environment we're
part of is inherently distracting.

837
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,060
Years ago before I got into this at all.
Um,

838
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:47,000
I said I had done a lot of speech
writing for executives and it was so

839
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:50,780
fascinating because when
I go to conferences and
working with the executives,

840
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,510
you could always tell
that the executive was,

841
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,120
because he never saw
a woman in those days.

842
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,040
He was unencumbered and he didn't
have anything he was worried about.

843
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:03,230
Everybody else was worried
about what was going on,

844
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:07,460
but he didn't need to worry about where
am I notes or what's happening or where

845
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:10,340
is this or what's the right
door or, oh, it's raining.

846
01:01:10,341 --> 01:01:14,840
How am I going to get to the door?
Or carrying a raincoat. Fine.

847
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:19,550
Things were taken care of
and he could be present.

848
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,880
Sometimes he wasn't because sometimes it
was the Kinda guy who couldn't look at

849
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:26,960
anybody, look anybody in the
eye. But he had that capacity.

850
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:32,500
And what's fascinating is to look at the
extent to which the environment we're

851
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:37,580
part of can undermine our
capacity to be present,

852
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,310
but even as it does so it,

853
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:45,140
it weakens our ability to
really manifest presence. Uh,

854
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:50,141
and I do think that it can be harder
for women partly because of our radar,

855
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:56,000
that capacity to be noticing what people,

856
01:01:56,001 --> 01:02:00,740
how things are landing on somebody or
how engaged someone is noticing what's

857
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:04,430
going on in the room.
That radar light capacity,

858
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:09,610
while it has real strength also has the
potential to undermine our ability to be

859
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,880
fully present.

860
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:19,750
So what I've seen are a
number of practices I share
three today that really are

861
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:27,561
helpful in being able to maintain
the capacity to be fully present,

862
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:34,400
which I believe is absolutely essential
for sending a message about your

863
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:39,060
potential as a leader.
People get that.

864
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:42,180
We get it at a level that's
here rather than here.

865
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:47,070
We understand when someone is
present or when they're not. Um,

866
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:50,340
and we understand that across cultures.
That's,

867
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,480
that's something else I think
that's really important.
People can recognize you.

868
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:56,070
We have all these training programs.
You know,

869
01:02:56,071 --> 01:02:59,710
if you're in a meeting and someone's
a Muslim don't show you yet, you know,

870
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,780
the bottom of your shoe and all
these kinds of techniques we get at

871
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,460
communicating across culture.

872
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:11,330
But people understand and recognize
if your present across culture.

873
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:15,060
That's something that really translates.

874
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:20,270
So I believe it is a tremendous advantage
to all of us to think about what do we

875
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:23,910
need to do to be as present as we can.

876
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:26,820
What I've seen work is number one,

877
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,310
be your own HR department.

878
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:34,270
And by that I mean think
through what policies, uh,

879
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,440
what practices do you need to incorporate
into how you do things that protect

880
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:46,041
your ability to be thoughtful
and effective rather than
constantly responding

881
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,200
what works for you.

882
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:53,790
We're all different in this way and
that's why I say be your own HR department

883
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:56,910
because this isn't something that
can be handed down as policy.

884
01:03:57,150 --> 01:04:01,080
If we're really starting from the point
of what is going to help me be present

885
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:03,360
and be effective and be thoughtful,

886
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:07,050
what do I need to do to
enable that to happen?

887
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:12,230
How do I need to use my time
and my technology and my
interactions in a way that

888
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:14,520
will really support that?

889
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,930
So some real mindfulness and
intention around doing that.

890
01:04:18,931 --> 01:04:22,320
When we're going into a new project,
negotiate our time,

891
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:27,030
needs in advance as much as we can.
It's not an ideal world,

892
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:31,260
but negotiate that in time and,
and sell,

893
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:32,610
maybe sell up.

894
01:04:32,611 --> 01:04:37,380
I did some work at Microsoft and this
woman that was a general manager there

895
01:04:37,381 --> 01:04:39,360
talk, when I was talking about
this, she said, you know,

896
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:44,630
what I did is I realized that the constant
stream of text was really undermining

897
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:48,030
me.
And I talked to my boss and said,

898
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:53,031
I'm going to do an experiment where I
turn this off for a certain number of

899
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:58,530
hours a day and I will not be able
to necessarily respond. She said,

900
01:04:58,531 --> 01:05:02,280
and I was able to kind of sell
that to him and then I was able to,

901
01:05:02,281 --> 01:05:06,360
speaking of data document how
it improved my effectiveness.

902
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,590
So that became part of my policy
for how I managed my time.

903
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,180
So I think that's setting policies is,
is really important.

904
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:19,870
The second thing, and I think this
is particularly important for women,

905
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:20,830
uh,

906
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:25,830
in my experience is to recognize
and address compulsive or addicting

907
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,460
multitasking.

908
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:35,560
Women often take pride in
their capacity to multitask.

909
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:39,610
Um, and the world we live
in, we all multitask.

910
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:42,070
I'm not advocating,
I'm sometimes I've talked,

911
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:46,240
I've given this talk and I get into
the elevator and some woman's in the

912
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:50,890
elevator on her cell phone. She says,
Oh, I, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know,

913
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:55,240
she's almost defending me
because she feels like, oh,

914
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,560
she thinks I'm multitasking.

915
01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:00,400
We live in a world that requires
a certain degree of multitasking,

916
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:04,360
but it is important to recognize
that while it is efficient,

917
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,690
there is always a cost.

918
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:11,470
Because if you are doing
two things at once,

919
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:16,740
you by definition cannot be
present for both of them.

920
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,580
Your attention is divided,
your attention is fractured,

921
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:26,910
you're more likely to make mistakes and
it is inherently more stressful because

922
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:30,850
stress is produced when
our attention is divided,

923
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:35,820
not when we're working hard. That's what
is stressful. I've got to do this, oh,

924
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:38,110
hung under the what time
is a plane going to come?

925
01:06:38,111 --> 01:06:40,600
And then I've got to get there
and maybe I should recalculate.

926
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,130
That's where stress lives.

927
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,460
Stress lives in divided attention
and the more present one can be,

928
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:49,361
and again,

929
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:54,361
I feel that I've watched this and
witnessed this by being exposed to highly

930
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:57,670
effective senior executives.

931
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:03,120
They have the resources that help
them to be present because they're not

932
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:07,810
worrying about the details.
Most of us don't have that luxury.

933
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:10,870
We have to worry,
we have to sweat the details,

934
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:16,260
but the more we can do that in a way
where we're mindful of where is this

935
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:19,240
addictive,
whereas this habitual,

936
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:23,170
how important is it that I
respond to this right now?

937
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,900
And the more we can
protect our effectiveness,

938
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:31,530
the more leadership presence we will
be able to a fact and the more we'll be

939
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:38,851
able to represent and gain
respect for an understanding of,

940
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,060
of what our vision is.
And the final thing is,

941
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:47,920
as Buddhists recognize,
presence is a practice.

942
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:53,430
Being present is a practice and that's
what meditation and meditational pursuits

943
01:07:56,441 --> 01:07:57,221
are about.

944
01:07:57,221 --> 01:08:02,221
Their way of practicing being present and
it's presence is not something you can

945
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:08,590
just tell yourself, I'm going to be
present. I've decided starting now,

946
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,470
I'm going to be fully present.
It doesn't work that way.

947
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:16,830
It's something that you incorporate into
being and you do that through practice

948
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:19,940
that you're not hung.

949
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:24,941
The Vietnamese monk has a wonderful
practice that he uses when he works with

950
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:27,050
people in offices.
He says,

951
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:31,250
every time that phone rings,

952
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:36,020
every time you hear that bell,
use it like monks in a monastery.

953
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:39,230
Use a month a monastery bell.

954
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,800
Take one second to call yourself
to attention and depressants.

955
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,220
Take a breath.
When you hear it.

956
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,180
Let your practice be to remind you.

957
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:57,110
When you hear a bell, when you hear
the text, Peng, whatever it is,

958
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,080
I'm here now, I'm present.
I'm in the moment, I am here.

959
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,640
And if you can do that,

960
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:09,641
you can begin to develop that muscle
that enables you to be present.

961
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,910
And by the way,

962
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:14,530
you'll be a lot more effective when you
pick up the phone rather than, yeah,

963
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:18,950
you'll be,
can I help you?

964
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:23,690
That's much more present.
So thinking of it in terms of presence,

965
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:28,040
and I think this is something
that's very powerful. I said, um,

966
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:31,370
the presence translates across culture.

967
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:35,480
It even translates against across species,
which is a big deal.

968
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:39,680
If anybody watched, say czar the
dog whisperer, that's all he does.

969
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,030
You know the other,
the,

970
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:43,910
the dog owners walk into their
house and the dog goes nuts.

971
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:48,920
Say's our Walk Sen dog is
total attention and all it is,

972
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:52,010
is he as fully present and aware.

973
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:55,100
So if that can translate across species,

974
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,030
anybody who's tried to ride a horse
knows how that effective is if you're

975
01:09:59,031 --> 01:10:01,040
thinking about 10
different things at once.

976
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:05,870
So being able to bring that practice
into what you do is going to help you

977
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:10,871
represent your vision with real
power and authority and influence.

978
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:12,560
And Oh,
by the way,

979
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:17,480
you'll be much less stressed
and distracted in the process.

980
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,650
So you mentioned Sheryl Sandberg.
I'm curious what are,

981
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:26,000
you mentioned Bud Sheryl Sandberg's book
and was actually curious your thoughts

982
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:30,260
in terms of the lien in kind of
decree for women. Well, first of all,

983
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,270
I think Sheryl's book was one of the
great contributions of the last 10 years.

984
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,470
It,

985
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:41,470
what I see is it has gotten
companies thinking much more,

986
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,053
um,

987
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:49,390
at a much higher level about what they
need to do to engage women and it's made

988
01:10:50,631 --> 01:10:51,381
it acceptable.

989
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:56,381
I did a program at a big energy company
that was very traditional and top down

990
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,040
and they had a male panel,

991
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:03,041
which I was moderating and all four men
on the panel showed up carrying her book

992
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:06,620
to kind of show how on board they were.
So it's kind of given man,

993
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:11,830
I think because of her status permission
to be interested in this issue,

994
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:15,360
which is extremely important and many,

995
01:11:15,361 --> 01:11:19,440
many of the points she made I
thought were really very important.

996
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:24,000
We do it.
It doesn't just happen leadership,

997
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:28,800
it involves that stepping up and
making that commitment and saying,

998
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:31,860
I really want this to work.

999
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:35,700
This may not be the place I may
need to go to another place,

1000
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:39,780
but I really want to invest in my career.

1001
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,880
And I think that's what she was saying.

1002
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:45,000
And I so dislike the
criticism that you know,

1003
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:48,360
whoa easy for her to say she's
got all these resources. That's,

1004
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,650
that's not the point.

1005
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:54,600
The point is she was encouraging and
saying you can have a richer, fuller,

1006
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,720
more meaningful life if you
invest yourself in your career.

1007
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:02,130
On the other hand,
this

1008
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:08,690
propensity of women to look at the actual
quality of their day is something that

1009
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:13,950
is pretty deeply ingrained.
I don't think it has to be an either or.

1010
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:19,330
On one hand it doesn't have
to be so non strategic lie.

1011
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:21,930
I'm not enjoying this particular job.

1012
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:26,250
I've had five bad days in a row. I think
I'm going to quit. That's, you know,

1013
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:31,170
that is not leaning and that is not
stepping up a, that's getting discouraged.

1014
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:34,050
What we find is that over time,

1015
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,140
if day after day after day,

1016
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:41,250
the experience of work is
profoundly unsatisfying,

1017
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:45,390
women are more likely to say that salary,

1018
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:50,870
that position was not worth it because
I am just not enjoying my life.

1019
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:57,180
I believe this is one of the great
gifts that women have to bring to the

1020
01:12:57,181 --> 01:13:02,181
workplace because I've read a lot of
research about the millennial generation

1021
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,640
and what they value and it's much
more similar to what women value.

1022
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,990
It's that interest in what
is the quality of my life.

1023
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:15,630
I'm moving into organizations.

1024
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:20,250
I know I'm going to be working 60 hours
a week. If I'm going to get anywhere.

1025
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,450
I know how much my job is
going to be all consuming.

1026
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,540
I need to be able to enjoy it.

1027
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:32,460
I need to be able to feel as if
my contribution is really valued.

1028
01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:34,860
I want to feel a part of what I'm doing.

1029
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:40,370
And that's what we hear from the men and
women of that millennial generation who

1030
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,890
come into, you know, people say, oh,
they're so entitled. Well first of all,

1031
01:13:46,891 --> 01:13:51,660
their parents told them good job when
they, you know, picked up a quarter, uh,

1032
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:56,310
they've been told over and over, you're
terrific. You can do anything. Um,

1033
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,030
and so of course they have that attitude
and I happened to believe that attitude

1034
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:05,480
can be very adaptive in today's
workplace because we're so much of his ex

1035
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:09,540
expected of us. But I, one
of the things I often say,

1036
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,370
and I say to executives who are saying,
you know,

1037
01:14:12,371 --> 01:14:15,490
our women seem to feel like
work should be enjoyable.

1038
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:20,140
I say be grateful because you have
an opportunity to think through the

1039
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:24,520
experience of work at this place and
prepare yourself for that next generation,

1040
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:27,580
next generation whose attitude,
excuse me,

1041
01:14:27,581 --> 01:14:32,470
whose attitude is much more likely
to be similar to that of women.

1042
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:34,420
So this is again,

1043
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:39,870
I believe what happened like with those
leadership competencies is women are to

1044
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:45,241
a degree on the cutting edge
of how organizations will
need to adapt to be able

1045
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:53,620
to really engage their
talent at the highest level.

1046
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,900
And that it is helpful.

1047
01:14:55,901 --> 01:15:00,901
It behooves to use an old fashion word
organizations to be able to listen to

1048
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:06,130
that. And it's helpful for us in
terms of really making that case.

1049
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:11,340
I did not see in Sheryl's book
this big divide between um,

1050
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,730
stepping up and valuing the
quality of your everyday.

1051
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:19,810
Obviously every day isn't going to be a
picnic and there are days that are going

1052
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:22,100
to be extremely difficult.
Uh,

1053
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:27,150
it's really over time when you begin
to perceive a misfit or mismatch like

1054
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:30,140
woman,

1055
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:35,140
Susan Bernstein debt as a
result of feeling I cannot
be authentic and this job.

1056
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:40,600
Um, but it's also possible, I mean,
again, that woman Ellen, Isaac's that,

1057
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,740
um,

1058
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:46,270
I met out here in the valley who felt
so discouraged because she felt like her

1059
01:15:46,271 --> 01:15:48,970
boss didn't see what she really had,

1060
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:52,990
what her best qualities were
there ways we can address that.

1061
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:57,460
If we have an awareness of it,
there are ways we can make that better.

1062
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:58,870
And um,

1063
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:04,470
she reported that I made an enormous
difference to her that she felt like her

1064
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:06,580
boss really saw,

1065
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:11,610
really noticed her and noticed what was
best about her and that was profoundly

1066
01:16:12,251 --> 01:16:17,251
rewarding to her and gave her much more
feeling of freedom and much more feeling

1067
01:16:17,981 --> 01:16:21,010
like she really fit
with this organization.

1068
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:24,520
So I think the message is hopeful.

1069
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:29,610
I felt Cheryl's message was very helpful
and very hands on in terms of specific

1070
01:16:31,271 --> 01:16:34,600
advice. And uh, you know, as I said,

1071
01:16:34,601 --> 01:16:39,601
I've been doing this 25 years and one of
the advantages of that is being able to

1072
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:43,240
take a big picture,
long term view.

1073
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,840
And I believe this is the best time I
have ever seen in 25 years for women to be

1074
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:51,640
able to make an impact.

1075
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:56,641
And help their organizations
really use their best talents.

1076
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:57,330
Uh,

1077
01:16:57,330 --> 01:17:02,330
it takes being able to articulate and
understand the power of what those best

1078
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,750
talents are. But, uh,

1079
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:09,130
but I think we're in a time where
organizations are certainly,

1080
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:14,150
in my view, more ready to hear
that than they have been, um,

1081
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:18,830
in decades.
So I wish you luck and I thank you.
