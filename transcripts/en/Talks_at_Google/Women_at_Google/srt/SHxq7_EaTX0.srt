1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,520
Welcome everybody to toxic Google.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,730
It's my great pleasure to
introduce Leslie Stall,

3
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:12,050
one of our country's most
preeminent journalists.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,530
She has been a correspondent
at 60 minutes for 25 years.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,210
And his covered pretty much everything
that's happened in the world in the last

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,980
quarter century for one
ton amount to all the wars,

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,000
to various presidential campaigns,
to technology stories,

8
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:30,880
which is a particular area of
interest of hers to sports. Um,

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,280
she is the winter of 11.
Any awards and prior to joining,

10
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:38,340
60 minutes was a White House
correspondent during the Carter and Reagan

11
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:41,430
administrations and it was a
moderator of face the nation.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,760
She is the author of two books, including
the one that is on sale in the back, um,

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,970
called, um, becoming grammar.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,570
So highly encourage everybody to pick
up a signed copy of the book on your way

15
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,900
out. Great Mother's Day gift.
So get your shopping done early.

16
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:59,310
There's also cards back there,
so feel free to get it done in one stop.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,450
And she is,
is

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,420
the proud grandmother of two girls.
Welcome Leslie. Thank you. So me,

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,800
she neglected to say so many neglected
to say that we're colleagues because Sumi

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,270
worked at 60 minutes till
less than a year ago. Yes.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,080
I was a producer and we worked together
and had the pleasure of working with

22
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:20,370
Leslie on a couple of stories. That's
great. So, um, tell me about the book.

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,360
Did becoming a grandmother surprising?
Well,

24
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,710
I knew I was going to be a grandmother.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,200
What surprised me was the
enormity of that initial emotion,

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,240
this kind of wallop of love that's unlike
any other kind of loving that any that

27
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:45,150
you have for any other creature on the
planet. It's nothing like mother love.

28
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,580
It's its own, it's its own little animal.
And when you become a grandmother,

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,630
you change so dramatically that
your children don't recognize you.

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,840
They run around saying, who is
she? Because you are so mush.

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,080
Bali, you are just a puddle
of, of whatever the kid wants.

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,470
I believe that we are actually,
uh,

33
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,570
that the word no is incapacitated.
We cannot deny them anything.

34
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,520
Um,
but,

35
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,540
but really it was that initial jolt of
elation and emotion that I wanted to

36
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:25,710
explore. What is that? Do
all grandmothers have that?

37
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:30,690
The answer is most of them do.
The grandfathers have it, they do,

38
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:33,270
but it's different.
And uh,

39
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,530
and look into the history,
the biochemistry,

40
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:42,060
the anthropology,
the different kinds of grandmothers step,

41
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,000
grandmother's surrogate,
grandmother's, uh,

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,120
and even when there's tension
in the family with the
daughter-in-law and there's

43
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,200
a lot of tension with the daughter.

44
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,130
I wrote it as much for your
generation as for my generation,

45
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,820
for young parents because
we're in this together,

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,830
young parents and their parents
were the family. And so I,

47
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:13,831
it's as geared for my daughter who is a
young woman with two kids as it is for

48
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:16,054
my friends.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,080
So as I was reading the book, the
thing that was most enlightening to me,

50
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,570
so I'm the mother of a young
daughter who's six years old,

51
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,870
but it really gave me a look into what
my mom must be experiencing and how she

52
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:32,540
comes to it and things that I feel
like can be a little metal somewhere.

53
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,230
I'm like, mom, I'm not going to
do that when you're talking about.

54
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,500
And so it was really a, an interesting
kind of insight. And does sheet metal,

55
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,940
sorry, does your mother metal,
she very carefully it metals.

56
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,170
She's very cautious about it.
Well what, so what do you, I mean,

57
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,730
I don't think of modern parenting.

58
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,990
I'll tell you what I
think of modern parenting.

59
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,290
But first let me say that
most grandmothers I met and
interviewed including me,

60
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,620
we walk on eggshells.
We are so careful.

61
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,070
We don't want our kids to be angry at us
because then we fear they might deny us

62
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:12,120
access to the only thing that really
matters anymore. And it's those babies.

63
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,100
So I had any number of grandmothers I
interviewed and I interviewed a lot,

64
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,560
tell me, you know, my tongue
hurts from biting or uh, I,

65
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,921
he,

66
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:27,921
I won't even lift an eyebrow in
criticism of how they're doing it.

67
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:29,850
And then the minute you leave the house,

68
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,400
you turned to your husband or
he turns to you and you say,

69
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,380
we didn't do it that way. And she turned
out okay. You know, we were good at it.

70
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:41,940
Well, the truth is we weren't as
good at it as your generation is.

71
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,440
That's the truth.
Okay.

72
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,290
But I think that puts more
pressure on parents as well.

73
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,710
Right now you're so concerned
about they can't eat this.

74
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:52,680
They have to go to bed at a certain time.
You have to follow the routine.

75
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,120
It's a lot more, I mean,
how did you manage that? You
had such a demanding career.

76
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,420
How did you manage it when your
daughter was younger? Well, I think

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,500
my generation of women was much more
focused on just getting into the workplace

78
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,730
and it took a lot of energy
and a lot of attention.

79
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,880
We missed a lot with our
children that we regret. Um,

80
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,990
I think we are,
our attention was,

81
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,860
was truly divided and I think
our children, you, my daughter,

82
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,380
um, a lot of the people who work at
Google by the age I'm looking out at here,

83
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,760
um, you learn from us or
maybe resent what we did,

84
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,770
but you're doing it differently. And the
truth is, I admire the way you're doing.

85
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,790
I admire the way my daughter is putting
a lot of emphasis on her family.

86
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,910
Although she has a big job,
but she's still,

87
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,940
she's still is more,

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,350
she's building a better nest than I did.
I admit that.

89
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,070
And what are the things that you noticed
that you have to bite your tongue for?

90
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,210
Not necessarily that your daughter,
but I'm telling you one,

91
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,270
I'll tell you when sleep training,

92
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,010
I don't know how many people
here have children. Have you?
Well, tell us what's, no,

93
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:09,720
I know, but at Google in
general, but, but I did,

94
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,660
I didn't sleep train so
I'd never heard of it.

95
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,580
Apparently it's been around for ages.

96
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,410
So the idea is after a couple of months
you just let the baby scream and yell.

97
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,660
And I just happened to be there when it
happened with my husband and I couldn't

98
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:26,980
stand it. They didn't pick her up, they
just let her scream or little header.

99
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,400
I skin was crawling,
but I didn't say a single word.

100
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,730
I just sat on it.
I was hyperventilating.

101
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,000
I was thought I was having a heart attack,
but I didn't say a word.

102
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,430
We get in the car because
we were staying at a hotel.

103
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,440
I husband turns to me and says,
what was that all about? And I said,

104
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,850
what? I said, I didn't say a
word. I was the Sphinx. He said,

105
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,760
you didn't say a word.
You didn't shut up the whole time.

106
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,620
So out of my mouth was, why are you
punishing her? Why are you making herself?

107
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,300
I swear I didn't think I said a
word and it was just tumbling out.

108
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,320
I didn't hear myself weird.
I know.

109
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,120
But for the most part,

110
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,330
my generation of parents is sitting on
it or trying to sit on it because we want

111
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:18,920
you to think that we think you're
wonderful so that you'll let us have the

112
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,754
babies.

113
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,260
And so tell me a little bit about some
of the signs that you found out about as

114
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:27,020
you were researching this book.
What is the science behind grandparenting?

115
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,300
What is this thing that's
happening? Well, there's,

116
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,830
there's two interesting things above
all the others. One is the biochemistry.

117
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,570
Um,
that enormous wallop that I felt and it,

118
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,400
I felt it all over my body is
actually a biochemical response.

119
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,640
When a mother has a baby,

120
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,670
her brain is completely rewired and all
kinds of different new hormones come

121
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:57,320
into play. Uh, grandmother has
something somewhat similar.

122
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,140
She is on her brain,
is also rewired,

123
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,600
not as extensive knitly
and not as dramatically,

124
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,080
but she also see creates
a bonding hormone.

125
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,970
And so she is physically binding
herself to that little baby.

126
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,710
Just the way parents do.
Well,

127
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,200
it's not the way parents do
because it's not as intense.

128
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:20,201
But we also go through a connection that
holds us to that baby so that when we

129
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:25,550
don't see the baby,
we crave the baby.

130
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,150
And it can happen to a step grandmother.

131
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,550
It can happen to a surrogate grandmother.
It can happen to an aunt, a great aunt.

132
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,300
But when that baby is a little kid and
somebody who thinks of it as somewhat,

133
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:42,770
there's a holds it,

134
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:46,760
there's all kinds of physical changes that
go on within you. So that's one thing.

135
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,370
I thought it was pretty interesting.
Oh, here's another thing.

136
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,230
The circuitry of baby loving in
the brain and in the body, the ser,

137
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:59,670
the wires are exactly the
same wires as romantic love.

138
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,830
They're the same pathway.

139
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,460
So what was happening to me and all other
grandmothers is we're falling in love.

140
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,660
We are literally actually falling
in love and it feels like that.

141
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,990
And it's the, we use language
like that. People say,

142
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:18,720
I fell off a cliff when
I held my grandchild,

143
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:23,580
or you feel just wonderful all over.
Or I crave them when they're not there.

144
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,140
So it is exactly the same animal,
the feelings.

145
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,710
And the other thing I found out was
that most animals on the planet die when

146
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,450
they can no longer reproduce.

147
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,400
So when a female stops being
able to have babies, she,

148
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,020
if she can walk or fly,
whatever,

149
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:47,640
she goes over there and
dies except for elephants,

150
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,030
whales, and humans. So why,

151
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,350
why do we have extended
lives beyond menopause?

152
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:00,120
Why do we even have menopause? Well, the
answer is to take care of the babies.

153
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,620
Grandmothers raise the babies.
Both parents hunted.

154
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,210
They went out into the fields and raise
crops and they left the babies home with

155
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,044
grandma.

156
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,380
And so I think there is in us kind of
atavistic granular need to re to help

157
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:24,420
raise the babies when we don't. We,
we heard. And so you talk about it.

158
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:26,010
I mean it's almost like
we're coming full circle.

159
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,330
You talked about granny nannies.

160
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,070
What her granny nannies tell us granny
nannies are grandmothers who take care of

161
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:34,110
the babies two days a week,

162
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,500
three or four days a
week to help their kids.

163
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,300
And today in this country
now with post recession,

164
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,980
both parents are working and they're
not making as much as my gender.

165
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
One person made my generation.

166
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,430
So you need the help because childcare,

167
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,800
good childcare is exorbitantly expensive.

168
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:59,880
I'm not telling anybody anything they
don't know it can cost as much as college.

169
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,450
So the babysitting function is
needed and my generation is spending.

170
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:10,270
Here's the s statistic I came upon.
My generation is,

171
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,380
is spending seven times
more on grandchildren then
grandparents did 10 years

172
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:20,400
ago. Wow. And we're not,
I'm not talking about toys,

173
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,380
I'm talking about the crib. I'm
talking about the, the car seat.

174
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,720
I mean major items. We're sending the
kids to school, we're paying medical,

175
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,300
we're straightening their teeth.
Um,

176
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,420
grandparents are really
contributing in many ways.

177
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,770
Where does grandpa fit into all
of this? Oh, Grandpa, if you, if,

178
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,910
if grandma's think that we go
through a sea change, which we do,

179
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,210
our personalities change when
we're with those children.

180
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,670
I mean our kids with our kids,

181
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:55,060
we were policemen and with
our grandchildren were
playmates, whatever they want.

182
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,570
Grandfather's also go through this huge
metamorphosis for a grandfather who

183
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,130
worked very hard when the little ones,
his own little ones who are growing up,

184
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,590
they all think about it as a second
chance to watch a child grow up to be in

185
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:14,680
their lives.
And a lot of grandmothers told me,

186
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,360
GRANDPA's a better babysitter than I am.
He's more patient,

187
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,510
he's more playful grandparents.
Grandfathers.

188
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:24,880
I saw this over and over.

189
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,000
Grandfathers are the nanny's,

190
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,650
not grandmothers and many marriages.
The husband is older,

191
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,780
he retires,
grandma's still working.

192
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,890
So he's the one who's taking
care of the babies and um,

193
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,560
he's doing a great job and he loves it.

194
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,260
And if he has health problems,

195
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,780
the children are alleviating them there.
They're getting rid of depression,

196
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,710
they're staving off dementia.
I mean these are,

197
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:58,630
these are actually studies that
show that, that, that, that,

198
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,700
that baby's just have this effect on us,
makes us healthier,

199
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,320
makes us happier. It makes
us younger. Hmm. I know,

200
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,770
um, to segue a little bit, it
is election season after all,

201
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:16,790
and all the presidential candidates
are grandparents. So I have to ask you,

202
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,890
what do you make of the,
uh, the race so far?

203
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,700
Well, one, I actually thought
age was going to be an issue. Um,

204
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,830
when Hillary Clinton announced,

205
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:30,060
I thought that the Republicans were
going to come in with a whole coterie of

206
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:35,061
younger candidates and they were just
going to harp and bang away at her being

207
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:40,200
in her late sixties.
Ah, I mean, Bernie 74,

208
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:43,050
she's only 68, and I think that, uh,

209
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,460
how do we know how all Trump has
to see 69, something like that. Um,

210
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,940
I was very interested in Hillary being
a grandmother because when I started

211
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:58,260
working on the book, she announced
that she was pregnant and we, I mean,

212
00:13:58,261 --> 00:13:58,840
her daughter was,
yeah,

213
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,890
pregnant. Whoa. It's not the
national inquirer. That's a lead.

214
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,460
And so I was curious.
Yes.

215
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,220
Uh, as to whether her being a
grandmother, well, whether she'd use it,

216
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,200
um, and whether it would help her
are not to win the presidency.

217
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,720
So I went with Frank Luntz,

218
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:21,710
who's a Republican pollster
to New Hampshire to sit down,

219
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,880
sit in on a focus group,
and uh,

220
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,820
he tacked on a couple of questions for
me and then let me ask some questions.

221
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,960
So they were all Republicans
and he got up there and he said,

222
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,310
what one word would you use
to describe Hilary Clinton?

223
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,030
Oh, God, this was if Hillary
Clinton had been in the room,

224
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:45,140
she would crawl up in a ball and
go sit in the closet. Dishonest,

225
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,030
liar, cold. Uh, not she did,

226
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:52,340
they didn't say corrupt,
but that's what they're,

227
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,880
that's what Trump is picking up on.
But words like that, all negative,

228
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,200
all having to do with dishonesty.
It was brutal.

229
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,820
Then he let me get up and I asked
what one word comes to mind when I say

230
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,750
grandmother. Oh my gosh. The
words were just, all of them.

231
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:12,980
Nobody had one even remotely
negative thing to say. It was loving,

232
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,480
cozy cookies,
unconditional love lap,

233
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,160
warm. So I asked them. Now
they're all republicans.

234
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,270
If they thought, if Hillary played
up that she's a grandmother,

235
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:29,030
some of those words would
rum up rub off on her.

236
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,590
And I was surprised because they were
all self described as conservative

237
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,690
Republicans.
Several of them,

238
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,130
many of them said they thought it
would help her as long as she didn't.

239
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,100
They said exploit the
child. Meaning, you know,

240
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:45,910
walk around with the kid on her hip.
Um,

241
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,790
I'm sure Hillary's people have
done their own focus groups.

242
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,540
I'm a little surprised she
hasn't made more of it.

243
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,490
It could be that all the other candidates
are also grandparents. I don't know.

244
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,650
But I,

245
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:05,050
that focus group led me to believe that
it would soften her image and she's

246
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:09,470
still having those words come up in all
focus groups, including with Democrats.

247
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,960
So she could use a little, yeah. Yeah.

248
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,400
People never make much out of
grandfathers. Grandmothers.

249
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,630
It's going to be the word in front of
every woman who's ever had a position of

250
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:24,370
authority. She's a grandmother, but
grandfather's don't get that right.

251
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,920
That's kind of vague. I know. What do
you make of Trump? The Trump phenomena.

252
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,150
Oh my goodness. I mean,
I'm like everybody else.

253
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,900
I don't know what to make of it.
I,

254
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,200
it's not that I don't
know what to make of him.

255
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,080
I don't know what to make of
the public reaction to him.

256
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,860
I could go through a litany of things he
has said where I was sure I would have

257
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:49,370
put money down that it was over.
I mean,

258
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:52,490
when he went after John McCain
saying he wasn't a hero.

259
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,200
Now that was really early on.

260
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,560
I knew for sure that was the end.

261
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,780
I knew it well have been
13, 14, 15 of those.

262
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,820
And he always rises from the ashes.
So, uh, I wouldn't dare predict,

263
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,510
and it's even hard to analyze,
but I'm sh I'm,

264
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,590
I know I'm pretty darn sure,

265
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,880
pretty darn sure it's going to
be Hillary versus Trump and, uh,

266
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,570
they're really going to
do jobs on each other.

267
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:25,571
It's really going to be a slug
fest of gigantic proportion who,

268
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,790
who can slime. The other one
more is probably going to win.

269
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,940
Isn't that awful to say about our country?

270
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,990
The other thing that strikes
me about this campaign,

271
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,570
and I think I've been
struck by it in the past,

272
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:42,140
but never so intensely is how few people

273
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,230
give the candidates to us.

274
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,220
If you go out and count all the people
who either went to a caucus or voted in a

275
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:56,340
primary, it's a minute fraction
of the American adult population.

276
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,050
And so the process just doesn't,
it's not working. It's just not,

277
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,830
we have to fix it, just
have to fix it. And I mean,

278
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:09,120
the thing that strikes me as a former
journalist is how do you report on

279
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,210
somebody like Trump when there's no fact
checking? And I know it's 60 minutes,

280
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,870
very particular, every script is
footnoted, everything is back check.

281
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,060
How do you cover a candidate in a
responsible way who really can't be fact

282
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:24,570
checked or doesn't carry, is fact
checked, but the public doesn't care.

283
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,020
There are any number of newspaper
columns written about what he got wrong,

284
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:35,100
television stories written, uh, Don about
what he got wrong. And people don't care.

285
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,370
That's why I say it's the reaction to him.

286
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,770
That's the unfathomable part of it.
Uh,

287
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,690
it's very difficult to
report on him. He, he, I've,

288
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,460
I've studied his
interviews cause you know,

289
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:52,200
I used to do face the nation and I used
to love to try and pin someone down.

290
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,370
If they didn't want to answer,

291
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,840
ask answer the first question you went to
the second question. And then, you know,

292
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,050
if you go to the third year nagging,
but I would knack,

293
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,470
he's unnavigable you,
you can't,

294
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,820
you just can't get him to answer the
question. He, he gets away from it.

295
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:13,760
So it's hard. I mean, and where is the
line between entertainment and journalism?

296
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,840
As you said,
if this is going to turn into a slug fest,

297
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:20,160
it almost feels like a little bit of a,
of, of a horse race, the boxing match,

298
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:24,600
whatever you want to call it.
I mean, how's about standup
comedy? I know, seriously,

299
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,990
have anybody have,

300
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,820
have any of you just sat
and watched a Trump rally?

301
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,610
None of you. He is hilarious.
He is. Seriously hilarious.

302
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,440
It is. It is a standup routine. And, uh,

303
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,260
I always thought that humor was really,

304
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:48,000
really important in politics because I
covered Reagan and he was very funny,

305
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,410
but sweetly funny but funny.
Um,

306
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,410
I also thought likeability was crucial
at certainly crucial to leadership to

307
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:01,110
governing.
Um,

308
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,140
but we are being presented by this tiny
sliver of the country with candidates

309
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:11,421
who are more unlikeable and candidates
I think have ever been as well in,

310
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,910
in time that we know of. Certainly
in modern time the negatives, oop,

311
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,980
trumps are sick.
He's,

312
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:24,981
he has an unfavorable rating of 67% and
Hillary and anybody want to guess 56%

313
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,610
negative. And so as you said, you
covered Reagan for a long time.

314
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,850
What do you make of the almost
deification of Reagan? Yeah.

315
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,990
Um, well he wasn't deified
in the beginning at all.

316
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,510
In fact,
there's a little bit of similarity.

317
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,410
There was a huge chunk of the
country because Reagan was very,

318
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:50,771
very,

319
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:55,771
very conservative for that period of
time in our history who thought Never

320
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:56,440
Reagan.

321
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,890
So there was that huge chunk
of the population out there
though the election was

322
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,724
very close.

323
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Then he was shot early on and he handled
that with such grace and really heroism

324
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,130
that he won everybody's heart and people
stopped and stop looking at him in a

325
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:16,210
two dimensional way.

326
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:20,680
As a guy who stood for these issues and
started to see the human being and he

327
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:24,760
had a quality and it's a quality.

328
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:27,940
We're not seeing this time in anybody.
He had sweetness.

329
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,010
He had a special quality of sweetness.
And when you saw him,

330
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,100
you could disagree with
him 100% and like him.

331
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,320
And it goes a huge long way to govern
when you need to persuade people.

332
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,010
Is the era of sweetness over you think
is there no room left in our, oh,

333
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:50,830
well I would never say that
we're going to, you know,

334
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:54,700
when Jimmy Carter was president, every,
there was so much gloom and doom.

335
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:57,820
Reagan used to run around the country
saying what's with the gloom and doom?

336
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,770
But there was, we were very
pessimistic. Uh, nothing was working.

337
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:06,820
There were gas lines,
there were food lines for people.

338
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,200
People were suffering so much.
They were standing in line to get food.

339
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,810
We had high inflation,
high unemployment,

340
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:18,940
you never thought it was going to turn
around and Reagan came in and pretty

341
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:23,630
soon, you know, we, we were feeling
good again. The economy cranked back up.

342
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,320
So I mean these things are cyclical.

343
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,280
I think we might have sweetness
again when you get home.

344
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,300
I want to bring you back to something
you were saying earlier about Hillary

345
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,170
Clinton being a grandmother.

346
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,450
And one of the interesting things to bring
it back to your book as well was, uh,

347
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,900
when you wrote about how being a
grandmother actually helps women break the

348
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:48,880
glass ceiling. Well, it's a little bit
about that. Okay. Uh, first of all,

349
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:53,370
you, you will observe that women in
high places today, a grandmother's,

350
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,080
uh,
Nancy Pelosi,

351
00:22:56,081 --> 00:23:00,190
when she was a sworn in as
speaker of the house. She's your,

352
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,950
was she your, is she? Yeah.
Do you remember then you,

353
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:05,310
you all remember she,

354
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:10,311
she had all her grandchildren on the
stage with her and I actually did a story

355
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:14,470
on her.
She ruled in a maternal way.

356
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,420
She ruled the house with an iron fist,
but a maternal iron fist. Like the mother,

357
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:21,410
the police woman,
um,

358
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,300
she had an instinct that said the,

359
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,950
that grandmother image can
be a formula for authority.

360
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,520
And so I,

361
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,580
I came to see that while
it's still difficult for the
country as a whole and for

362
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:42,970
men specifically to accept a young
woman in a position of authority,

363
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:48,420
it's not hard to except the grandmother
because very often in our families they

364
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:53,120
were the, they were the tough
one in the family. And um,

365
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,520
so I had a girlfriend
tell me,

366
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,170
she ran a girls school in New York
and for her she was there forever.

367
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,050
She stayed at that school and ran that
school for years and years and years.

368
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,330
She always had trouble with the fathers.

369
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,770
They will always interface telling
her what to do and poking at her.

370
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:17,390
And one day it just stopped.
It just stopped.

371
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,810
And she was able to control the meeting
with the father and everything was

372
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:25,460
wonderful. And then she realized that
he was seeing her not as a young,

373
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:29,840
sexy woman, but as a grandmother.
And so the Cha, you know,

374
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:34,370
his need to fight with her or to
challenge her stand up to her was over.

375
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,650
So grandmothers can be
authoritative in the public's eye.

376
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,630
Um, and again, I'm surprised
Hillary's and playing it up more.

377
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,780
And you know,
grandmothers aren't old anymore.

378
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,090
They're baby boomers and
baby boomers are young.

379
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,400
They think of themselves are young as
themselves, as young. They act young,

380
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,160
they dress young, they look
young. We, I believe me,

381
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:02,240
we're tired and told me that when I chase
after my grandchildren, I'm very tired,

382
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,380
but we put on a good face, another
grandmother in the audience laughing.

383
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,903
And uh,

384
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,190
so I don't think we have the same
image that grandmothers had when I was

385
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:16,310
certainly when I was growing up or
maybe even when you were growing up.

386
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,140
And so here in,

387
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,050
in the valley and we talk a lot about
diversity in tech and um, sort of,

388
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,500
uh,

389
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,500
making sure that there's representation
of women on teams and especially in the

390
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:33,410
more technical fields with a little
bit of distance and perspective.

391
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:38,030
What do you make of that, especially
given your research? Well, I'll tell you,

392
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,090
this happened at 60 minutes
too. While you were there. I,

393
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:43,810
I,

394
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:48,810
I fear so often that women take two
steps forward and a step and a half back.

395
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,240
We take three steps forward and two steps
back and it's been that way ever since

396
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:59,270
the women's movement
in the early seventies.

397
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,590
We think we're making progress in the
workplace and then we find out that we're

398
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:08,210
still only making 79
cents to the man's dollar.

399
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,690
Um, we still don't crash
through the glass ceiling.

400
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,800
We still don't have many CEOs and it's,
it's a bafflement.

401
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,750
It's a bafflement that we don't
have more women in position,

402
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:23,810
a position positions, um, uh,

403
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:28,811
of executive positions where they're
making the big decisions when it's shown

404
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:34,031
that women make better decisions in many
situations and where women are better

405
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:35,840
educated generally speaking,

406
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,200
as many PhDs and so forth.

407
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,880
So it's a bafflement and uh,
it's a like a little lake.

408
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,160
Cause I was there at the beginning of the
women's rights movement where I was so

409
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:51,150
sure,

410
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,500
so sure that women were
just going to sweep into,

411
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,350
into the presidency,
into the boardrooms,

412
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,880
into the executive suites in
huge numbers within 30 years.

413
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,350
And it's more than 40 years ago
that this started. So I don't know,

414
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,620
I keep saying the time will come,
but when's that going to cop?

415
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,430
If there are any questions
in the audience, please feel
free. And in the meantime,

416
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,160
I guess two things. First of all, it
regarding women, I think that, uh,

417
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,110
there was a change, not enough, but there
is a change and maybe I'm an optimist,

418
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:28,340
but, uh, it seems like it's
shifted from end of the wall.

419
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:33,290
Doesn't let women do
anything, uh, to that,

420
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,980
that as well. But also I think
that education back at home,

421
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,240
I think parents should change as well.
Not just, uh, not just the world,

422
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,280
not just a corporation.
Corporations. I think that steel,

423
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:48,610
many homes not even
intentionally are not raising eh,

424
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,580
the, the girls, you know, way that
they even understand that, uh,

425
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,940
there are options other than being
a girl or whatever it means that we

426
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,160
experience.

427
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:04,630
I think we as parents are at least
some of us not doing the best job,

428
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,620
not necessarily because we don't want to,

429
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:11,621
but because we're not aware of it because
we grew up even my generation in a

430
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,490
way, the two women has, uh, you know,

431
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,150
you grow up in Israel and then in
the United States later, but in,

432
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,440
but in Israel than they
think that it's still,

433
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,100
I saw a lot of conservative type of homes.
And again,

434
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:27,920
not because they wanted to
underwrite, eh, in Israel,

435
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:31,920
but also I think that they see it
here that it's conservative in,

436
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,930
in a way that nobody said that
you cannot be an engineer,

437
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,240
but it's not the point. And
I mean, we don't, we don't,

438
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,680
we're not talking about a
girl as an engineer. And

439
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,970
my talking about it being told,

440
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,090
having a girl being told you
can be whatever you want,

441
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:52,110
that should be the message. I can
cheat. It's very common even today.

442
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,060
And not because the parents are
objecting to it, but they still,

443
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,580
it's very conservative that
girls or girls and boys or boys,

444
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,210
and at least what I'm trying to do,
because nobody has a golden, uh,

445
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,220
uh, is girls can be
girls, boys can be girls,

446
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:11,940
but I'm trying to mix and match.
So at this she knows she can do,

447
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,580
she can do whatever she wants.
And

448
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,560
that's hard. I come from
obviously different generation.

449
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,790
I was told I could be anything I want.
Right.

450
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,510
And so I'm a little surprised to hear
you say all these generations later,

451
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,160
you don't think that that message is
still being sent to our kids because that

452
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:37,161
would be a message that comes
down from my generation.

453
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,960
Look at Google, uh, the
numbers that were released,

454
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,020
the public shows that even Google
where we're doing whatever we can to,

455
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,630
to, to, to get as many women as
we can, especially engineers.

456
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,760
There's not enough women graduating
universities in computer science.

457
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:58,440
That's the parents really. I
thought that was odd. The parents,

458
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,840
girls thinking boys won't like them
if they go into science kind of thing.

459
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,530
I think that it's indirect.
And again, I don't think that,

460
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,350
that a lot of the parents
are doing this in purpose.

461
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,350
I think that in many cases
they don't even think about it.

462
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,590
And at least in my case,
I think about that.

463
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:15,970
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing,

464
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,720
but I think about that and if anyone was,

465
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,670
will convey any other
message to my daughter,

466
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,450
that's one of the things that can
really freak me out. So that's,

467
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,590
that's a for everybody
who's listening. Yeah. Um,

468
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,880
thank you.
And if we can go back to television,

469
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,960
but television was always my dream,
especially in youth.

470
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,240
So I wanted to be a newscaster.

471
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:45,280
Always there are in Israel
here. This is the, uh, the mic.

472
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,810
Uh, and I even sometimes I report to
Israeli television, but just as a,

473
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,850
as a, as a side hobby and, but,

474
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,880
but what I did learn from reporting
to radio and television needs,

475
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,210
road foot,
let's say 30 times in my life,

476
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,730
that it's just unbelievable
what happens when something,

477
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,690
something is broadcasted.
No one is watching broadcast television.

478
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,550
Double quote. Nobody old
boy, a video on demand.

479
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:19,150
It's all Hulu or Netflix.
Nobody's watching anything on TV.

480
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:20,410
TV is dead and everything.

481
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:26,190
Once my piece was broadcasted
on television, I mean the, my,

482
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:30,880
my cell phone was drained out of battery
from so many Facebook came. It's just,

483
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:35,800
so my question to you is,
how do when you go into a studio,

484
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,510
not even reporting for, from the
field today, after so many years,

485
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,150
what do you feel when you
record in studio, when,

486
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,920
when you see a piece that you did,

487
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,720
what does it make you feel and what do
you think the impact today versus a few

488
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,933
years ago?

489
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,740
I guess the thing that
I feel is that I'm not,

490
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:04,540
I, I'm not sure I'm having an
impact and it bothers me. Uh,

491
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,070
I, I don't know how many stories you
did for 60 minutes, but I've done a lot,

492
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:14,071
hundreds and hundreds and
many of them important,

493
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:19,330
important information that the public
should know, change should have been made.

494
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,170
And it just sort of evaporates.
I feel it evaporates.

495
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,880
So I guess people have said to me,
Oh, you have so much influence.

496
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,370
I fear that we don't, and I fear
because we're doing serious work.

497
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,010
That's what 60 minutes is really about.

498
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:41,610
So if we uncovers an injustice or if we
show some corruption and then nothing

499
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,060
happens,
it's very discouraging.

500
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,710
Sometimes you have to do,
uh,

501
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,030
you have to have the public
exposed to a story over and over.

502
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:56,300
It has to linger before
it really has an impact.

503
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,130
So 60 minutes does it,

504
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:02,360
and then someone else picks it up and
then maybe a congress woman makes a speech

505
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:07,100
about it and maybe someone tries to
pass a law. It has to go on and on. So,

506
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,240
you know, I sit in the studio and
I say to myself, okay, is this,

507
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,930
it's anybody going to do anything
about this? That's what I think.

508
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,650
But that's it. I mean 60
minutes still is, is, you know,

509
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,070
the news magazine a record,

510
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,840
but it's still average of 15 million
viewers every weekend. And that's, but,

511
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,830
but what happens? Did you ever do
a story the produce change? I did.

512
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,020
You did.
I did one and I was very,

513
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:38,310
very proud of which one was up the sugar
one and it really produce change and

514
00:33:38,311 --> 00:33:39,150
produce some change.

515
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,990
It got the FDA to start really looking
at some of the classifications that they

516
00:33:42,991 --> 00:33:45,510
had done. Um, but no, I
know exactly what you mean.

517
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:48,350
Where you do the story and your jazz
for months going, you know, this is,

518
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:53,220
this is going to be, it's going to blow
the lid off world and the little crack.

519
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:56,680
Maybe. So, I mean, that said,
do you think television news is,

520
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,040
is should we be planning the funeral?

521
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:04,540
Well, first of all, television
news has changed dramatically.

522
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,640
It's interesting that 60 minutes hasn't,
we'd still doing it the old way.

523
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:14,050
We still use the old stopwatch.
Um, the way I did it.

524
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,870
Well, but it's still a stop watch
and think Dick. And, uh, it's, uh,

525
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:24,730
we do, the stories are done
the same way, same ethics,

526
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:29,290
same standards, all of it. But most
news has changed because of the,

527
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:34,470
the shrinking of the time it takes between
the reporter learning something and

528
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:39,070
the reporter getting it out there.
When I started there were,

529
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,300
there was a whole day to think because
we worked in film and film had to be

530
00:34:43,301 --> 00:34:47,620
processed and so you could really make
a hundred phone calls and you could

531
00:34:47,621 --> 00:34:51,580
really suck your thumb for an
hour or two and think it over.

532
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,880
And then when we got videotape that time
was shorter and then we got cable and

533
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:01,870
those reporters had to be on the air
pretty quickly and now there's no time.

534
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,290
And that has changed the
nature of news dramatically.

535
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,120
So whether it's on
television or on the web, uh,

536
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,100
the, the nature of news, uh,

537
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:19,360
by definition is completely,
totally altered. I wouldn't,

538
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:24,010
if I were on doing daily reporting,
say, covering the White House,

539
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,380
I wouldn't begin to
know how to do it today.

540
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,020
And I really needed to make
a lot of phone calls and, uh,

541
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,630
I needed to understand it.
And I don't,

542
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,740
I don't understand how you can
just run out there. I, I wouldn't,

543
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,060
I don't do that at 60 minutes still.
So I'm kind of one of the lucky ones.

544
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,860
But I think that news is morphing,
I'm not saying it's better or worse,

545
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:50,700
actually I shouldn't be judging,
but it's definitely different and,

546
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,970
but I think the appetite
for news is enormous.

547
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:59,570
I think people want to know that they
want to devour and a lot of people want in

548
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:03,040
depth reporting. Oh, I mean our,

549
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,760
our audiences are enormous.

550
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:11,210
And websites that are doing in depth
investigative report it or surviving and

551
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:16,020
are healthy.
So I think people want this kind of work,

552
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,690
but not a lot of Pinot. Not, not enough.

553
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,810
Keeping on the news thing. Um, w
how do you feel about, you know,

554
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:27,040
the trend to so called comedy news?
Like Stuart and Oliver?

555
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,050
Yeah. Um, what,

556
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,990
what do I honestly think between you
and me and 30 800 million people,

557
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,830
I think they're brilliant.
I think they're brilliant.

558
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,650
It's satire and it's a,

559
00:36:39,651 --> 00:36:44,651
it's a form of commentary
that people listen to.

560
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,000
People want to love. We started
out saying that, uh, Trump,

561
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:53,660
one of the reasons I think he's
successful is that he's really funny. Uh,

562
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,690
people want to laugh and if you feed
them the serial was sugar on top.

563
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:03,530
Um, they digest it. Uh,

564
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,450
I did the bill Maher show the other night.
He's brilliant.

565
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:14,330
He's hilarious. Um, I watch, well,
I used to watch the daily show.

566
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,300
I am, I enjoy it. It's, it's, it's
part of our life now. You know,

567
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:22,130
it's part of our society in our life.

568
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,330
It was a little discouraging to find out
that that was the only news some of our

569
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:30,740
children will listening to
that was a little hard to take.

570
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,890
But you know, my, as, as
the kids get a little older,

571
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,190
they start wanting something
a little more serious.

572
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,820
At least that's what I'm seeing
in my family. So I'm all for it.

573
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:45,130
Are you against it? Oh No, you
love it too. Oliver is this, oh,

574
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,490
it's the minutes. Absolutely.
Oliver's brilliant.

575
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,150
But Bill Maher really impressed
me the other night. They all are.

576
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,800
I think they're great.
Yeah.

577
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,470
So talking about the immediacy of news
versus the, the writing of the book, how,

578
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,410
how did the, um, how did
the process differ for you?

579
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:05,180
Were you in playing a lot of the same
skills and techniques, or was it a,

580
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,030
a new patent experience?

581
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,710
It was new, uh, well,
the reporting wasn't new,

582
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:15,711
but the writing was really hard because
the first draft that I showed my husband

583
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:21,060
who's a writer, he said this, this
is a series of 60 minutes pieces.

584
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:26,030
So I could,
I could write about 15 minutes and that,

585
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,110
but I to write long form,

586
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:31,650
like that really took
a lot of work for me.

587
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,160
I had to figure out how to
thread everything together.

588
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,890
I could do it for 15
minutes, and that was it. Uh,

589
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:42,290
but I really loved working on this book.
Um,

590
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:47,430
I met so many different kinds of
grandmothers and grandfathers across the

591
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:52,120
country. And to find out that
we're all in this together,

592
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,770
we grandparents were a society and our
children and how they relate to us,

593
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:57,880
meaning your generation,

594
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:02,881
how you relate to us is a
society where we're so connected.

595
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,330
We're all, we're all in this campaign.
So aware of how different we are,

596
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,070
but we are all the same grandparents.
Believe me, we're all the same.

597
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,040
We all love these kids intensely.

598
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,450
We all change in the way
we grandparent. Uh, we,

599
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,000
none of us can wait to
see those grandchildren.

600
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,370
We annoy our children because even if
we're not saying anything critical,

601
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,600
we are doing a little body language
thing that really irritates them.

602
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,620
And we're trying not to.
So we are one big community.

603
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:41,350
And I found that out and it was
very heartening. But writing was

604
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,660
a challenge. So you mentioned that, um,

605
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:50,970
you're disappointed that women haven't
reached higher levels in professions en

606
00:39:52,251 --> 00:39:54,560
masse on mass.
Um,

607
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,770
and one thing that occurs to me is that
when grandparents are living close by to

608
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:03,230
their children and they're willing
to help out with the childcare,

609
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,300
that that may allow their
daughter to, um, you know,

610
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,770
be it in her profession longer
and reach higher levels.

611
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,420
Um, but it seems like in this world it's
a very international world and we have

612
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:18,254
people,
you know,

613
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:23,270
moving across continents to take jobs
and their parents don't always come with

614
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:23,920
them,

615
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,150
but a lot of them do,
a lot of them do.

616
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:27,770
Um,

617
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:32,770
and so I guess my question is what is
the responsibility of women who have

618
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:38,141
achieved high levels in their profession
to make sure that they mentor other

619
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:45,161
women or create policies in the workplace
to allow other women to rise when they

620
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:53,000
don't have as many advantages?
You know, support perhaps.

621
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,100
Well women should mentor
women, period. It's,

622
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,650
it's almost a given that we need
to help each other. So that is a,

623
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,360
is a necessity. We haven't
solved the problem of child care.

624
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,350
We just haven't. It's,
it's, it's what it's,

625
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,180
it may be one of the main reasons that
women don't achieve cause they break

626
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:20,410
their careers and half because they feel
they have to be home because they don't

627
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,180
trust the childcare situation,
the daycare situation. Um,

628
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,810
it's a conundrum.
I'm not a policy person.

629
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,320
I wish there were more policy people
working on it and more openness from our

630
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,520
elected officials to try
and create a structure,

631
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,260
a grid, some, some way for uh,

632
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:46,610
families to be able to go
to work with peace of mind.

633
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,200
Um, it's, it's,

634
00:41:50,201 --> 00:41:53,840
it's a terrible unsolved
crisis in the country.

635
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,690
Childcare and uh,

636
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:02,620
I do come around at the end of my book
to say that this is the perfect way for

637
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,150
grandparents to,

638
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:10,400
and their extended retirement and
maybe not all grandparents move,

639
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:15,401
but there is a huge trend going on right
now of grandparents moving to be near

640
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:18,230
their grandchildren.
They do it selfishly.

641
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,290
They want to be in the babies' lives.

642
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,260
The smart parents,

643
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:28,910
the smart parents will overlook the
little critical elbowing and say,

644
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,870
we need you because you are a woman.

645
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,930
Going to work will never trust anybody
as much as she'll trust her mother with

646
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:42,420
her children. So, uh, for most,

647
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:47,630
for a lot of women that is the answer for
women whose parents cannot come and be

648
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:51,860
near them. Uh, we need, we need
more government to help us.

649
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:56,240
We do our societies or rotary clubs.

650
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,040
I mean something.
Uh,

651
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,840
so it's something I thought a
lot about when I wrote the book.

652
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,690
I also wrote about sour
get grand mothering, um,

653
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,710
parents who for any number of reasons.

654
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,070
I mean parents my age cannot be
with their own grandchildren.

655
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,510
Maybe they don't have any or maybe their
daughters just aren't or sons aren't

656
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:23,630
going to have them or maybe the daughter
in law is not going to have it but they

657
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:27,650
can sarragut grandparents,
another child somewhere else.

658
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:29,390
So it's a good,

659
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,350
it's a good way to end the take the last
30 years of your life cause we're going

660
00:43:34,351 --> 00:43:37,850
to live a long time and we'll be healthy.
Most of us

661
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,240
and would that great thought. I want to
thank Leslie for coming to Google it.

662
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,303
Thank you.

663
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,000
I know you have to do the dash

664
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,940
cause you have to get up to San
Francisco and Battle Bay area traffic.

665
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:55,300
But we have books in the back. So
please, uh, stop by and grabs him.

666
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,440
And this is the best mother's Day
present you can give your mother.

667
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,543
I'm not kidding.

668
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,080
Grandmothers are adoring this book
because I'm talking about them. Thank you,

669
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:06,340
Leslie.
Thank you so much.
