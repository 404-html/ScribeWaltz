1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,640
All right. Welcome Google New York.
Thank you so much for joining us today.

2
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:13,540
I'm Jessie Haynes. I'm the director
of product for the Google good theme,

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:18,541
which is a team that makes
tech accessories for Google
hardware and I am third

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,740
build it to be joined here
today by Randy Zuckerberg.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,233
Thanks guys.

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,070
I am thrilled to be here and even I'm
wearing polka dots and honor of, uh, my,

7
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,670
my new show. It's just like, oh man,
I can't wait to talk all about it.

8
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:40,510
A brief introduction. Randy
is an entrepreneur, investor,

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,850
bestselling author and media personality.
I'm an early employee at Facebook.

10
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:49,630
She led major marketing initiatives in
the company his formative years and has

11
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:52,180
gone on against my, you
guys. I'm so, I was like,

12
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:55,480
am I allowed in the building when I
signed him? That's good. Thank you.

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,520
But yes,
those,

14
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:01,180
not that she's gone on to
launch Zuckerberg media
with the mission of creating

15
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:03,880
media content that's puts
intelligent tech savvy,

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,630
entrepreneurial women and
girls at the forefront.

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,880
She has published two books.
Dot.

18
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:13,780
Complicated and New York
Times bestseller and dot.

19
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,120
A Children's book about
a tech savvy little girl,

20
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:20,440
which we're going to talk about today
and which you are able to purchase after

21
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:23,980
this session back. Um,
in addition to books,

22
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,460
Randy is an executive producer
on three television shows,

23
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:32,461
all the holds a business talk radio
show on Sirius Xm and has performed on

24
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,040
Broadway, which I think is just
the coolest thing ever. Um,

25
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,810
she is the mother of two boys and a proud
resident of our fair city, New York.

26
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:48,760
So once again, welcome to
Google radio. Thanks. Um,

27
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,790
so as we were talking about before,

28
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:56,680
I was thrilled to read the piece that you
wrote in vogue a couple of months back

29
00:01:56,681 --> 00:02:01,540
where you talked about leaving Silicon
Valley and coming here to New York.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,470
So why don't we start there. Tell us a
little bit about what motivated that move,

31
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,510
um, and what's making you happiest here
in the baker or, well, gosh, it was a,

32
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,580
it's a really tough time.
I grew up here in New York.

33
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,870
I grew up in Westchester and, uh, so
I guess a little bridge and tunnel,

34
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,820
but that's okay. Um, and,
uh, I, I always just,

35
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,330
I was one of those New York
snobs where I thought like, wow,

36
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:28,430
people can be happy outside of New York,
like p,

37
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,470
like people live outside of New York
and not just ironically. Um, and uh,

38
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,360
so then of course I wound up
spending a decade in California.

39
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,640
It wasn't supposed to be a decade.

40
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,480
I thought I'm going to go out and I'm
going to work in silicon valley for a few

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,890
months. And then a few months turned into
a decade, a public company to children.

42
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,290
And, um, I,

43
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,000
I never really put down my roots in
California because I always just assumed I

44
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:58,450
was going back to New York. And finally
I looked at my husband and I was like,

45
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,760
we've been here a decade.

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,580
Like we haven't picked a school for
our kids. We don't have friends.

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,290
Like we keep talking like, we're
going to move to New York any second.

48
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,150
Like we're at a point where you need
to actually pick a path and do it. And,

49
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,984
um,

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,250
I started having kids really
made me take a step back and,

51
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,600
and look a little more at the world
that we lived in. I love Silicon Valley.

52
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,660
It's an increase. I mean, I'm sure all
of us have spent a lot of time out at,

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,680
at headquarters and out there and it's
just this heady place of innovation and

54
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:33,280
excitement and everyone, like,
like, what are we disrupting today?

55
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,610
Whose lunch are reheating?
Yeah. Like it's so fun. But um,

56
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,530
but it's a one industry town.

57
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,160
And what I loved about New York is I love
that you can walk down the street and

58
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,440
see people from every country
speaking every language.

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,090
Like I love that kids can learn about
Picasso in school and then walk to a

60
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,160
museum and see your Picasso and,

61
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,600
and there's so many amazing things you
can hit in one day in the city. And, um,

62
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,260
I, at the end of the day,
juggling between the two, I just,

63
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:06,910
that's what I wanted for my family. That's
what I wanted for myself. I wanted, um,

64
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,630
that, that big city, uh,
not single industry town.

65
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,070
So I'm thrilled to be back.

66
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:17,071
We've been here about a year and I'm
still in the New York honeymoon phase.

67
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,101
So even,
you know,

68
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:21,250
like stepping over the cockroaches on
the street and everything. I'm like,

69
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:25,540
it's a beautiful car garage. So I know
we'll talk about it again in a year.

70
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,160
It's great. Well you're,
you know, it's, it's,

71
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:32,020
it's great to hear your enthusiasm
and passion for this city.

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,290
And I think a lot of us here at Google,
um,

73
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,940
love being New Yorkers and working
at Google New York, but you know,

74
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,260
but the headquarters is in mountain
view and there is always sort of that

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,470
pullback since in your year here,

76
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:51,310
what have been your observations about
the tech scene here in New York and how

77
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:52,840
that differs from,

78
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,890
one of the things that I love is that I
feel like the city itself here is part

79
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:03,400
of the tech scene in silicon valley.
It's very separate.

80
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:07,750
You get on your luxury shuttle bus and
you get busted and then you kind of stay

81
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,730
at headquarters all day and
you have all your meals,

82
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:13,960
they redo everything and then
you go home. Um, but here we all,

83
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:18,280
we ride the subway, we were
pool, you know, we like you,

84
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,640
the city itself is as much a part of
the tech culture as the sites that we're

85
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,270
working on and building,

86
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:29,290
like we come into contact with the
people we are building for every day,

87
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,320
which is not something that always
happens out there in silicon valley.

88
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,400
A lot of times I found that we
had to guess like we, you know,

89
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,460
and often a bunch of times it's early
adopters inside a company that you end up

90
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:45,280
building things that are just for yourself
because you're not spending that time

91
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,370
with people. So that was, that was
what I thought. It was really exciting.

92
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:53,371
I think also because a lot
of the investors and the
VC's out here come from a

93
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:59,450
more traditional finance background.
Like they, they want to fund,

94
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:02,810
I'm not sure how to say this 100% nicely.
The livestream.

95
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,840
They want to fund real businesses and
real businesses that will grow over the

96
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:12,890
long term. Um, so there, I've
found that investors here, they're,

97
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,480
they're okay with companies that take
a decade to build because they're in it

98
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,010
for the long haul.
That's what they've seen.

99
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,880
That's what they've known or is in Silicon
Valley because a lot of the investors

100
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,080
used to be founders, entrepreneurs
themselves. There's that mindset of like,

101
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:30,290
turnaround a company quickly,
create something, sell it, do this.

102
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,490
They're not in it for the long
term as much out here as I see

103
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,680
in New York.
So in that vogue piece,

104
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,640
you talked about how being in New York
has allowed you to bring together tech,

105
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,160
performing arts,
entrepreneurial women,

106
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,390
and even just sort of
seeing your bio again today,

107
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:54,391
I just am dazzled by all
of the fascinating sort of
things that you've got going

108
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:59,860
in your on in your life, TV
show, on oxygen, a radio show,

109
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,770
your books,
and now your children's book.

110
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:07,180
Dot is being turned into a kids show.
Um,

111
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,490
which one of these projects is your
favorite? Or is that just, oh my gosh,

112
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,953
it's really hard to,

113
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,430
but I think, um, it all kind
of stems from the same place.

114
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,750
And after again, uh, being in
Silicon Valley with amazing.

115
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:24,910
But one thing I love about
being here in New York,

116
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,630
like I look out at the same room at all
of these incredible women that are here.

117
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,760
And uh, it was, it got lonely
at times in Silicon Valley.

118
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,180
Uh,

119
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,260
I remember in the early days of working
there I would send emails to people for

120
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:42,400
meetings and I guess they thought Randy
was a guy and I'd show up and people

121
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:47,350
would be visibly disappointed for a
young woman to walk into the room. And,

122
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:47,920
uh,

123
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,920
after I left Facebook and I took some
time to think about what my next step was,

124
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,500
I thought I was going to go right into
building my own social media company.

125
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,390
I think everyone thought I
was going to do that too.

126
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,640
And I took some time to realize,
okay,

127
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:04,780
how do we actually get
more women in the room? Um,

128
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,830
a lot of people have a lot of ideas on
this and the hypothesis I kept coming

129
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:13,030
back to was that maybe it comes from
pop culture. Maybe it comes from media,

130
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:18,031
maybe it comes from young girls seeing
role models to look up to on screen that

131
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:21,220
are tech savvy and
entrepreneurial and smart.

132
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,270
And so instead of diving right into
doing my own social media company,

133
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,980
I created Zuckerberg media. I'm
thinking, how could I put more smart,

134
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,080
intelligent tech savvy women
and girls into pop culture? Um,

135
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,290
and that's why I have my hand in so
many things because as we all know,

136
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,590
our audiences everywhere,
they're not just watching one TV channel,

137
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:46,390
they're not just on one website. So,
um, I felt I needed to be on the radio.

138
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,180
I needed to have my hand in TV
shows on different channels.

139
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:52,270
I needed to be creating
content for online. And uh,

140
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,950
but every morning I wake up and I
think about how infuse more, uh,

141
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,470
women and girls into pop culture.
Tell us a little bit more about the book.

142
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,150
What was obviously that I came
from the same place, but how,

143
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,400
why a children's book and then how did
the TV show happened? I was actually,

144
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,590
I was writing a business book at the time.

145
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,420
I didn't even mean to
write a children's book.

146
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:20,421
I was writing a business book called Dot
complicated because I think what we all

147
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:24,050
understand is that tech has changed
every aspect of our lives. You,

148
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,100
this room is responsible for that.
Um,

149
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,250
in so many wonderful ways.

150
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,020
It's created so much opportunity in
our lives, in our businesses. Um,

151
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,470
but tech also sometimes makes us want
to rip her hair out of our head and

152
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:42,330
frustration. And, uh, it's changed the
way we parent. I feel like here I was,

153
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,290
I was writing a book it from the
perspective of a tech expert.

154
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,380
And yet I was a purely a,

155
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,080
a mature mom when it came to
raising kids in the digital age.

156
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,270
And I looked at my son and how he
was engaging with tech and I thought,

157
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:01,290
oh my gosh, if I wait until people can
read dot complicated, it's too late.

158
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,500
I need to start with a children's book.
So I created dot,

159
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,510
which is about a super techie little girl,
but she learns to find balance.

160
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,520
So in the beginning of the book,
it's like dot.

161
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:14,760
Knows how to swipe and tap and search.
Um,

162
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,570
and then she goes outside and when
she's Swiping, she's finger painting.

163
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:20,910
And when she's tapping,
she's dancing and searching,

164
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,100
just playing hide and go seek. So, um,

165
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,900
it's really important for that was a
really wonderful project for me. And, uh,

166
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,240
when I got the opportunity to collaborate
with the Jim Henson Company and NBC to

167
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:36,360
actually turn the show
from a book, uh, turn,

168
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,080
turn it from a book
into a show 52 episodes,

169
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,270
which is really exciting. So, um, I,

170
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,140
I jumped at the opportunity,

171
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,560
I have crazy respect for like Pixar and
everyone in animation now after seeing

172
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:56,991
how much work it takes to create one 10
minute episode of this show and seeing,

173
00:10:57,481 --> 00:11:01,650
uh, the beautiful animation that
happens in films, but it's, um,

174
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,790
it's just been the coolest experience
that's so exciting. And this,

175
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,930
and it premieres at the 22nd of all, it
does this Saturday. Um, but it's like,

176
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:14,610
imagine walking into a startup like
with the giant screens and everything,

177
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:16,590
but dot.
It's on every screen.

178
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:19,700
Like that's what I felt when I walked
into the animation house. Like I had,

179
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,440
it felt very emotional.
She's the daughter I never had.

180
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,700
And of course here I am doing all this
like feminist content and I have two sons,

181
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:31,050
but it's great. I know me too. But
our boys will like. Dot. Right.

182
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:35,430
Exactly. Oh yeah, man. I mean my son was
two when the book came out. Now he's five.

183
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,610
And so he's basically grown up with dot.

184
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:42,570
He feels real ownership for this
character is, uh, it's pretty exciting.

185
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:46,650
But so just to give you a sense of
the show, like dot and her friends,

186
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,000
they don't do anything the way normal
kids do tech pluses up, everything.

187
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,510
So all the other kids on the block might
be having a lemonade stand buttoned

188
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:59,511
dots and delivers via drone because why
would she forced the customer to come to

189
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:04,860
the lemonade when the, she could scale by
the lemonade going to the customer. Um,

190
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,060
so every episode you see dot.

191
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:11,200
And her group of friends using
technology in a really funny way.

192
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,540
And uh, and it's, it's great.

193
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:17,800
We even have like a Pokemon go
inspired episode, which is fine.

194
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,560
Love that.
Um,

195
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,160
so you do have a lot going on.
Um,

196
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,820
and I think a lot of us here
have a lot going on. Um,

197
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,950
how do you, and you know
sometimes how do you balance it,

198
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,650
balance it all or, or, or do you,

199
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:41,100
and I think I was found a tweet from,
from uh,

200
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,950
a while back where you said
the entrepreneur's dilemma,
maintaining friendships,

201
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,360
building a great company, spending
time with family, staying fit,

202
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,380
getting sleep, pick three. Um,

203
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,440
and I love that because I actually think
that sometimes this focus on balance

204
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,470
sort of sets up unrealistic expectations.

205
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,240
Wait,

206
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,240
and I don't think this is not just a
thing for entrepreneurs or for moms or for

207
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:13,480
women. I mean this is for everyone in
life. Like I talked to my son, I'm like,

208
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:17,320
sorry, you can't play in the sandbox
and eat cake at the same time.

209
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:21,640
Like you have to find balance and picks.
So, but yeah, so that's kind of my mantra.

210
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,320
Every day I wake up and I'm like,
family, friends, fitness, sleep, work,

211
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,010
pick three. And each day you
can only pick three of those.

212
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,780
You can pick a different three each day.

213
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:35,890
So as long as it balances out over
the long run, it's a, it's okay,

214
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,880
but you really, you can't do all
five of those things well in one day.

215
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:42,850
And so I think the key
is just, um, you know,

216
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,090
knowing that it's okay to be well
lopsided in the short term as long as you,

217
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:51,010
you know, are well lopsided the
other direction, the longterm.

218
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,670
And what about technology? Um,
and how an end, you know, you've,

219
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,560
you've written a lot about trying to
figure out the right balance of technology

220
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:04,350
in our lives and the
importance of unplugging,

221
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,040
which is so easy to say,
but so hard to do

222
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,270
is,
and it's so funny how many of us,

223
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:14,300
like we have these rules for our
children that we think about.

224
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,650
And then if we kind of looked
into mirrored or own behavior,

225
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:22,430
like what poor role models
we are of those exact roles.

226
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:27,410
So it's always funny because I
feel like people always ask, okay,

227
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:30,530
Randy, what are your rules
for your children? What are
your rules in your house?

228
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,160
But so few people ask me, Randy,
what are your rules for yourself?

229
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,870
And where would they be? Like, you know,

230
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,790
where do they think my children are
learning their behaviors from? So, uh,

231
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,360
I, I remember when Asher, my
oldest son was six months old,

232
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:45,650
he started picking up a remote,

233
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:50,150
a TV remote and making texting
thumbs with it. And I was like,

234
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:54,950
oh gosh, I think I to adjust
my own behavior a little
bit in front of him. So, um,

235
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,630
we definitely have PR,
prolonged periods of unplugging,

236
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,500
which is difficult.

237
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:04,250
I don't recommend going cold Turkey on
unplugging for anyone that's starting out.

238
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:08,570
Like the first time I did, I hold my phone
in my hand still for most of the day,

239
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:12,000
even though I, but sometimes now
I'll even like, I'll go so crazy.

240
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:15,920
It's like sometimes put my
phone on airplane mode. Whoa.

241
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,810
Um, and uh, but I,

242
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:23,990
and I've also had to train myself and
the people around me and how I respond to

243
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:26,660
email because I know,
especially in tech culture,

244
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,780
like there's a lot of pressure to be
always on, to be answering emails.

245
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:31,430
Someone sends you an email,
you need to respond,

246
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,020
whether it's the middle of the night. And,
and a few minutes later, um, and I, I,

247
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,950
I felt like, okay, no one else is
going to create boundaries for you,

248
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,510
but if you create them yourself,

249
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,340
you will start to train the people
around you how to treat you. So I,

250
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,730
you know, just slowly started to
say like, okay, I'm, you know,

251
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:54,660
don't respond to emails as quickly
on weekends or to my team. Uh,

252
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,360
you might get an email from me at midnight
and that is not because I expect you

253
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:01,330
to respond.
That is because like,

254
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,880
that is the first time I've gotten to
myself after I've been able to put my kids

255
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,900
down to bed and do everything else
and that's when I work. So, um,

256
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,620
I think definitely creating those
boundaries back to kids though,

257
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,000
I think there are so many amazing ways
to introduce children to tech that

258
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,120
doesn't require screens all the time.
Uh,

259
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,530
there's so many great toys out there
that have encouraged and still love of

260
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:29,450
building engineering, coding. We just
bought for our sons the Coda Pillar,

261
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:31,010
the Fisher price code,
a pillar.

262
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,940
It's this caterpillar and it comes with
all of these interchangeable parts.

263
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,330
Like you code it, you know, go, go left,
go right, make a noise dance and you,

264
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,530
you make a start, a green
start and a red finish. And uh,

265
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,960
the kid has to decide,
okay,

266
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,190
how do I program the parts
of the Caterpillar to get
it to start here and end

267
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:52,670
here and you can root around.
And so there's like a little robots.

268
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:53,750
We have all kinds of fun things.

269
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:58,730
So we definitely do a lot to
encourage a love of programming logic,

270
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,410
uh, engineering in our household while
trying to limit screen time for our kids.

271
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,330
Um, it did not know about the Coda. Yeah.

272
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,700
Lot of felons available on Amazon.

273
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,810
Um, I hope so. Um,

274
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,500
so we talked a little bit about,
um,

275
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,030
women in tech and at Google. We've done
a lot of investigating here on time.

276
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,360
How can we, can we, you know,

277
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,410
address this issue and people have pointed
to the lack of women studying stem in

278
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:32,120
school as a reason. There
are fewer women in tech. And,

279
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,360
and you've talked about this role model,
um,

280
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,380
sort of lack of role models. What, um,

281
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,560
what do you think in your
observation is, is working, um,

282
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,010
and you know, since you've
taken this sort of media, are

283
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,600
there some,
you know,

284
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,110
how's it been encouraging signs that
you've seen of sort of impact and the tide

285
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:56,640
changing? Well, first of all,

286
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:00,480
I think New York is really a place
silicon valley can take a real lesson from

287
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,400
New York and this perspective.
I mean,

288
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:07,040
we can still do much better with
women and enrolls in tech, but, um,

289
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,320
it's incredible the amount of women in
higher positions in tech female founders

290
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,510
that we're seeing here in New York.
Um,

291
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,750
I also think it's because there's so
many other industries, like I said,

292
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,640
it's not a single industry town.

293
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,180
So we're used to seeing women at the
top of media companies at the top of

294
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,000
publishing houses at the
top of ad agencies. Like,

295
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:31,920
that's not such a weird thing here as
a as it is. Um, I think it starts a,

296
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:35,400
I think there's, this is almost
like a multipronged problem, right?

297
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,960
It starts obviously in the house.
Um, it starts in the schools.

298
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,070
It's really,

299
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:45,870
it's around age seven or eight that all
the studies show that girls suddenly

300
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:50,340
wake up to the fact that
society is telling them that
they shouldn't be good at

301
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,880
math and engineering and
science. And, uh, so I think it,

302
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,410
it's pop culture. It's our schools is
what they're learning at homes. But then,

303
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,290
I mean, it's definitely also has
to come from, from effort in, uh,

304
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,410
in our companies. Um,
there were, you know,

305
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,800
I recently was talking to a team of
investors out in silicon valley and they

306
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:18,210
were like, Randy, we really want you to
invest in our fund. And I was like, cool,

307
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:21,630
you have no female partners. So
like, come back to me when you do.

308
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,950
And they're like, but we tried so hard,
we just like, couldn't find anyone.

309
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,200
I'm like, well, yes, diversity
takes effort. It takes effort,

310
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:32,130
like try harder and then come back to
me. It's my money. I have a right to, uh,

311
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,130
to decide how I'm going to spend
it and how I'm going to invest it.

312
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:39,510
So I think it takes people standing up
and saying things like that and that,

313
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,970
you know,
takes reminding people that yes,

314
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:45,930
diversity does take that little bigger
step of effort, but it's worth it.

315
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,430
Definitely.
Um,

316
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,190
you've led a lot of teams
through your career and, um,

317
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,910
have been regaled as a
strong manager and a mentor.

318
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,800
Tell us about some of the mentors that
you've had in your life. Oh my gosh.

319
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:08,190
I've been so lucky to have
so many great mentors. Um,

320
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,480
Kathleen Kennedy of
Lucas Film. Um, I mean,

321
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:16,450
it's incredible to think that the
president of Lucasfilm is a woman. Um,

322
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,650
so she's clearly spent a lot
of time in a man's world, um,

323
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,020
but she has been an incredible
ally and an asset to me. Um,

324
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,160
I recently spent some time to Susie
Orman who just like what, first of all,

325
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:29,610
I was like,

326
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,230
everything that they portray on
SNL is totally accurate and fun.

327
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,630
But, um, she, you know,

328
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:41,190
she created such an incredible empire
from nothing on empowering women with

329
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:42,090
their finances.

330
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:46,980
And so that was really amazing to learn
from her and get some advice from her in

331
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,850
world. And, um, I've just,
I've also been so lucky,

332
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:55,090
I've been learning from a lot of the
women, uh, who are at the head of dot.

333
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,560
Like Lisa Henson, who runs Henson, um,

334
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,470
has been an incredible mentor
to me. Navigating La, um,

335
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,920
the head of sprout at NBC as a woman.
So like.is a,

336
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:09,550
is a real girl power show. And
also like, I love guys too.

337
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:13,210
Like I see a lot of guys in this audience.
That's awesome. Thanks for supporting.

338
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:16,250
Amazing. So I've had a
lot of incredible, uh,

339
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,710
male mentors in my life too. And, um, I,

340
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,690
I do think that there's a lot of pressure
on all of us and especially in the

341
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:30,160
tech world to kind of figure it out
ourselves, do what ourselves do it fast.

342
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:35,161
But what partnering on projects like Dot
has shown me is that there are a lot of

343
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:39,460
instances where one plus one equals four.
When you trust people,

344
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:43,570
when you put your faith and, and, uh, you
accept mentorship from other people. And,

345
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,310
um, I took this asset as far as
I could and it never would have,

346
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,300
it would have stopped there
without including folks
like Jim Henson and sprout.

347
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

348
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,370
So it seems only appropriate since you've
been such a proponent of women to take

349
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:04,371
a little moment to talk about our election
since women have then it's front and

350
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:11,410
center in so many ways.
In the recent months. Um,

351
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,770
there was a editorial that in the,

352
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:19,771
in the Times that commented on Michelle
Obama's recent speech in November where

353
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:24,720
she reflected on the recent happenings.
Um,

354
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,430
and I think the exact was oh,

355
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,950
really beautiful was it wasn't
quite in a remarkable speech. Um,

356
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,450
that misogyny is the midwife of history,

357
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,790
which I thought was a really interesting
way to sort of sum it up. Um,

358
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,870
what are some of your reflections on
what's been happening in this crazy

359
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:49,530
election and do you
think that come November,

360
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:53,250
we will have elected the
first woman president.

361
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,550
All right. Well, I, it's
interesting. So my, um,

362
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,610
my kind of emotional connections with
elections started back in the 2008

363
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:06,970
election. That was my first election
that I really worked on at Facebook.

364
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:11,020
And actually we worked hand in hand
with Google on, on that election.

365
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:16,021
And I remember we would big candidates
to get onto social media and most of the

366
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,710
candidates like hung up on
us or we're like, sorry,

367
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:25,420
we're not interested in the social media
generation. Um, and things like that.

368
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:30,070
Like I went with the team from Google
and we sat at the Republican National

369
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:34,110
Convention and no one met with us
for the entire time because like,

370
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,960
no one cared about the internet
and you know, whatever. Um,

371
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,400
and uh,

372
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,180
so it was amazing to me to even fast
forward just a few years to midterm

373
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,770
election and to see that I actually knew
who was running for every office and

374
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:54,890
before the media or the public did because
the first thing they would do is like

375
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:59,120
set up their Facebook page
behind the scenes so they
could press click when they,

376
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,460
when they launched their campaign.
Um,

377
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:06,461
so that was really amazing to me to see
in just that short period of time and

378
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:11,120
now to look at this election,
which is complete.

379
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,300
Everything is playing out online,
on social media.

380
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,920
Every single aspect of it is
about like what's going viral and,

381
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,730
um, how were we sharing content? And it's,

382
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,710
it's just been incredible for me to see
an eight years how the game has shifted

383
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:31,610
so completely to people saying we don't
care about the Internet and social media

384
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,420
to an entire election decided
on, on, and by the Internet.

385
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:38,600
So first of all,
as crazy as it is,

386
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:43,220
like the Internet has won
this election, so Yay. Um,

387
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,390
but that being said, it
is, uh, it is really crazy.

388
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:52,391
I don't think any of us could have
believed this and to be totally honest,

389
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:57,630
I think all of the incredible tools
that all of us have created, um,

390
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,760
have both empowered a world
where anyone could have a voice,

391
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,750
but also created a world
where anyone can have a voice.

392
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,330
And A, we are sort of seeing, like I
said, everything is dot complicated.

393
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,141
Like my book,

394
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:16,730
we've created tools that have empowered
Arab spring that have given voices to

395
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:20,360
the voiceless.
But like Donald Trump has a huge voice,

396
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:24,590
thanks to all the tools
that we've done. Um, and uh,

397
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:27,770
I so I think that's why it's going
to be really interesting for,

398
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:31,850
I think all of us to take a step back
after this election plays out and really

399
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:35,060
think, okay, you know, what are
the positive sides of technology?

400
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:36,230
What are the downsides?

401
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,210
How should tech be used to build
brands and empower elections?

402
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,920
And, uh, I really,

403
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,730
I really do hope we see a woman in the
White House and two and a half weeks.

404
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,150
Great. So audience, um,

405
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:55,100
please come to the microphones and we're
going to open this up for questions.

406
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,560
And while that's happening, I just have
a quick speed round for you, right?

407
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,780
You Ready? Awesome. IPHONE or android?

408
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,470
It's okay.
Phone,

409
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,000
but my husband has an android so that
we're both okay. Okay. We'll forgive you.

410
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,160
That's like a new, you know, modern family

411
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,670
uptown or downtown. Uptown
upper west. Google or bing.

412
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,150
Come on.
But funny story though,

413
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:27,770
I did accidentally get being locked into
my iPhone once for a few weeks and I

414
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:28,371
was like,

415
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:32,210
I had to like physically go to google.com
to search for things and I was like,

416
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,800
no. Okay. Hamlet or Hamilton.

417
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,170
Oh my gosh. Okay. Right now
Hamilton. But I am, you know,

418
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:46,710
a classical girl by heart,
so I am going to have to tie that one.

419
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,690
Okay. Okay. Croissant or
Bagel, what about the mixture?

420
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:54,660
Don't they have the leg?
Like the breath sounds like?

421
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,980
I'm sure like some bakery is making
that somewhere I want. I want. Okay.

422
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,950
Uber or taxi. Subway. Got,

423
00:27:03,951 --> 00:27:08,700
I'm do like the real New
York getting ready. I only
rarely say whatever's faster.

424
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,210
Totally good answer.
Perfect. All right, great.

425
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:15,000
We've got some folks at the
mix and let's open it up.

426
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,780
So I have a question
about the women and um,

427
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,830
young girls growing up with this idea
that they're not good at math or science.

428
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:26,660
Um, I think the first time I heard that
was when I was like out of college.

429
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,440
And frankly, it really surprised me
because growing up my math class,

430
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,870
my advanced math classes,
advanced science classes,

431
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,380
girls probably out numbered
boys and like two to one.

432
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,740
And so I truthfully to always thought
girls who are smarter than boys.

433
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,680
Um,
and I wonder,

434
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,820
I wonder if sometimes if by repeating that
we actually do ourselves a disservice.

435
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,940
Yeah. Rather than just focusing
our energy on things like dot.

436
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,680
And promoting more women in, um,
women in sciences, in the media,

437
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,720
rather than even just acknowledging that.

438
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:59,960
Because sometimes I get frustrated
when I hear women talking about it more

439
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:01,870
because I feel like it
perpetuates the myth.

440
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,460
I think you're totally right on that.

441
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:06,730
And it was interesting when we were
coming up with all the episodes for dot

442
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,893
people,
uh,

443
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:11,380
some of the people in the writing team
kept pitching episodes that were like,

444
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,450
dot. Overcomes this bias. And
finally, a few of us were like, wait.

445
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,810
Dot doesn't think she's
worse than the boy is. Like,

446
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:23,350
what bias does she have to overcome?
She doesn't even know that,

447
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,400
that everyone thinks she's not
supposed to measure up. So, um,

448
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,650
we were like kids today,
they don't, that's not even,

449
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:34,060
why should we put that idea into their
head if that's not in their head already?

450
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:38,080
So I think you're absolutely right.
I would love to,

451
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,290
to live in a world where that's not
even an issue when I think we are seeing

452
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,100
that more and more with kids that um,

453
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,380
there's not like girl shows
and boys show is or this.

454
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:51,280
But I think as long as we continue to
walk into toy stores and see like that

455
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:54,460
pink aisle and that blue while and um,

456
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,790
and Halloween costumes and different
things like that, like that,

457
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,280
that is perpetuating it without us even
thinking we're perpetuating it. Um,

458
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,370
okay.

459
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,020
But I agree. I think less talking
about it is probably the way to go.

460
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:09,983
What we're doing.

461
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,600
You guys both continents. Hi. Um, hi.

462
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:22,100
Thank you for coming in. Um,
I'm a mom. I also have two kids.

463
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:25,320
I have a nine year old son and
a five year old daughter. Um,

464
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,970
and I'm curious if with all of the
initiatives that you're doing around women

465
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:30,470
and creating a show about girls,

466
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:33,770
if your sons ever ask you
why you're focused on girls.

467
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,750
My son has started calling me a sexist,

468
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:39,470
which I think he's picking up from
the Trump stuff. I'm like, okay,

469
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:42,040
it's not about better than it's equal.
And then my

470
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,340
daughter's there and I don't want her
to hear that we're not equal yet and get

471
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:46,660
like this weird insecurities.

472
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:51,220
So I'm curious if your boys have picked
up on your female initial interesting.

473
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,480
My oldest is five,

474
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,670
so maybe he hasn't quite picked up.

475
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,140
He's never mentioned anything
or send anything. He did ask me.

476
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,890
So I went to a high school in New
York called Horace Mann. And uh,

477
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,580
he did ask me when I told him
why it's not called Horace woman.

478
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,510
Um, and I was like, well, that's
like someone's name. Okay,

479
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,220
good. That's great. I was
like, Yay. Raising boys. Um,

480
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,120
but so I don't,
it hasn't been an issue yet.

481
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,200
I mean that being said,

482
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:23,800
she wanted to come and go as
my little pony for Halloween.

483
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:28,150
So I know he's definitely not seeing
gender differences in content,

484
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:29,590
but um,

485
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,540
that is a good question and
I will definitely have to
think about how to respond

486
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,210
to that one when it comes around.
Yes.

487
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:40,590
Yeah. If you find anything, let us know.
Maybe make another story about, yeah,

488
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,330
I think, I think it's a, it's a

489
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,140
great idea and um, uh, but
it's, it's been funny to see,

490
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:52,030
we lined up to see the motorcade because
President Obama came to the apartment

491
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:56,590
building next to us a few minutes ago to
do a fundraising event and he was like

492
00:30:56,591 --> 00:31:00,460
all excited and we were talking about
how well like next it's going to be a

493
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:02,620
woman's turned to me and the
White House and he's like,

494
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,960
maybe we'll men have a turn.

495
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,180
No, again, one day.

496
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,510
And I was like, probably once the
country sees how awesome women,

497
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:11,760
they weren't running the problem.

498
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,110
Hey, thanks for being as quite top. Yeah.

499
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,660
My question is around this,

500
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,320
we've kind of moved into this world of
post fact politics or whatever you want

501
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:27,154
to call it.

502
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,090
And I'm from the UK as you can probably
hear and we just had the Brexit a few

503
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,570
months ago. Um, and all of us as we
scroll through our Facebook feeds,

504
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,460
that's where it feeds youtube,
wherever it might be.

505
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,660
The algorithmic nature of those feeds
means we end up seeing stuff that we want

506
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:44,010
to see you, right? Yeah. Which is
a good user experience. One extent,

507
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,070
but that also means we're kind of being
insulated and we're not seeing a diverse

508
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:49,870
range of opinions and that sort of stuff.

509
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:54,580
So I was curious to see if you had an
opinion on as creators of those products

510
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:59,440
by Facebook and Google, um, and you know,
entrepreneurs that you're working with,

511
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,040
how can we strike that balance to make
sure that we're inclusive of different

512
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,250
opinions, but no, actually, you know,

513
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,030
making sure I don't see
Donald Trump every day. Ava.

514
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,860
No, it's such a great question because
you're right, we do wind up in these,

515
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:18,040
these echo chambers of, uh, of
people who think like us. And uh,

516
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,560
on one hand it's so great that millennials
are getting a lot of their news from

517
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,730
social media.
I think millennials,

518
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,960
young people are more informed than
ever before because of how quickly and

519
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:30,600
easily they can access news. But, um,

520
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,830
I think it's also part of
our responsibility to keep
reminding people that if

521
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:38,250
you're actually going to get
your news from social media,

522
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:42,740
makes sure you are following
a diverse group of people. Um,

523
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:47,690
make sure that you are taking the time
to add people on Instagram and Twitter

524
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:50,530
and all of these sites that don't
agree with you and that, um,

525
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,090
represent different opinions
because you're right,

526
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:54,680
it's so easy to fall into that.

527
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,900
I think another kind of sort
of point you brought up,

528
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:59,840
like the post fact checking era is,
um,

529
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,130
it's also a really interesting world
because the nature of getting content out

530
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:08,630
fast has made it such that media
companies value getting things out quickly

531
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,350
rather than getting things out.
Right. So I also think it's important,

532
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:17,410
it's more and more important for all of
us as consumers to start demanding that

533
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,070
quality content.

534
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Because if we are positively reinforcing
this culture where media is just,

535
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:24,561
okay,

536
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:27,740
let's get things out for the clicks and
the click bait and the headlines and

537
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:30,170
fast like it on.

538
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,400
I mean in the long run they're doing what
we want, what we click on, what we like.

539
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:39,080
So if we start demanding that, that fact
checking that better quality content,

540
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,640
then that's what we're going to get.

541
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,300
Great. Thanks. Thanks.

542
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,953
Hi.

543
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:54,460
Has Your work brought you to anything
with the digital divide and how that's

544
00:33:54,461 --> 00:33:58,030
affected education?
Yes.

545
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,750
We're actually doing a lot of that with
dod and had been thinking a lot about

546
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:06,751
that because here we are portraying this
adorable girl on the screen with her

547
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:10,500
iPad and everything. But we
live in a world where most
kids, they don't, you know,

548
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,840
can't just pick up an iPad at
home. Uh, they can't afford it.

549
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:14,800
They don't have access to it.

550
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:18,160
They don't have parents that are
encouraging the tech. So, um,

551
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,910
we really went back to the drawing board
and tried to introduce a whole range of

552
00:34:21,911 --> 00:34:24,960
characters that have different
exposures and different levels to tech.

553
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:28,780
Some of the kids that are going to
libraries to look things up, um,

554
00:34:28,781 --> 00:34:33,190
on shared computers, some have
different access in their homes. Um,

555
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,540
we also tried to deal a lot with kind
of the generational divide in terms of

556
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:42,340
comfort levels because I also feel like
a lot of times when you talk to adults

557
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:46,210
about tech, they immediately go to a
place of fear. They're overwhelmed,

558
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:49,690
they're anxious, like a parent's.
We immediately think screentime bad,

559
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:52,300
I feel guilty.
But kids don't live in that world.

560
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,980
They don't feel fear and anxiety about
tech. Like the future is fun for kids.

561
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:57,940
And,
uh,

562
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,940
so I also really had to come to the
show from that divide of like trying to

563
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:08,080
overcome my own anxieties and guilt as
an adult in this world and to try to

564
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:11,740
think from the perspective of
kids. So, um, yes, and every,

565
00:35:11,741 --> 00:35:13,210
all the projects that we're working on,

566
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:17,740
we definitely try to address the digital
divide and the generational divide.

567
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,690
But I,
I really appreciate you bringing that up.

568
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,383
Okay.

569
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,990
Other question.

570
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,620
I know there's a few ads there.

571
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,870
Can we talk about, I have
odd way that's super fun. Um,

572
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,990
so my dream in life was with
never really to like work in tech,

573
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:46,170
although I blended my dream in life was
to sing on Broadway and then I got to

574
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:48,420
college and I got rejected
from the music major,

575
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,250
flat out rejected and they
were like, don't feel bad.
Yo Yo ma also got rejected.

576
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,560
I was like, cause I don't know, it
doesn't make me feel any better.

577
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:57,540
Like I feel just as bad.

578
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,540
Um, and uh, I thought I had given
up on my dream. I was like, okay,

579
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:04,550
by dream singing on Broadway.

580
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:07,650
And then I moved out to California and um,

581
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,370
I know you guys are
familiar with the hackathon.

582
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:15,371
So at one hackathon at Facebook I
created an eighties rock band called feed

583
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:16,101
bomb.

584
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:21,101
And our motto was we play for free and
you get what you pay for pretty mediocre.

585
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,810
But about two years ago,

586
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:28,811
I got a call in my living room from the
producers rock of ages on Broadway 80.

587
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:30,920
It's rock musical.
And they were like,

588
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:35,921
we saw your feed bomb videos and we're
looking for a new kind of guest star for

589
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,560
our musical who can kind of
bring in a social media audience.

590
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:43,260
Do you want to come star on Broadway?
So after um,

591
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,800
all of that, uh, my,

592
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,530
sometimes you give up on your dreams
and they come back and find you.

593
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:52,100
But now it's fun because I owe, people
always come up to, you're like, Randy,

594
00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:53,490
how do you get to Broadway?
And I'm like,

595
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,110
can you learn to code?
You got some Broadway.

596
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,683
Sorry.

597
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,430
I was wondering if you're worried about
the increasing prevalence of consumption

598
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:08,930
only devices. Like as an example, when I
was very young growing up, like it was,

599
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,560
uh,

600
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,240
easier to write a hello world program
in basic on like an old Ms dos computer.

601
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:17,720
Like that was easier than trying to
figure out how to make the CD rom drive.

602
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:20,750
We can load in windows suite I
want for instance. But nowadays,

603
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:24,110
like I'll be on the subway and there's
all these kids playing with iPads and

604
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:27,470
phones and whatever, but you can't
really program them on the device.

605
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,810
And I have the feeling that they don't
have access to like a real computer at

606
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:30,780
home either.
Yeah.

607
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,640
So was it like his program and becoming
less accessible for young kids? He stays.

608
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,600
That's a great question cause I think,
um,

609
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,000
on one hand that question sort of goes
back to the question we just had about

610
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:44,480
the digital divide because we have to
look at the rest of the world beyond just

611
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:48,500
us. And I mean there are many parts of
the world that are skipping computers

612
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:52,430
entirely because mobile phones are all
that people have access to. I mean,

613
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,620
there's more mobile phones
than toilets in the world. Um,

614
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,180
and but many countries like when you look
at India and Africa are just skipping

615
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:03,760
the computer entirely. So
on one hand we need to, uh,

616
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,920
I think you are right that we
are missing some part of that,

617
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:11,090
but I think we also need to adapt to the
world and to the changing environment

618
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:12,790
that people are,
um,

619
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,180
program that they are using mobile
devices and that is where they're getting

620
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:20,330
their content and using
everything. And so, um,

621
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,470
I think you've just hit on
a big opportunity for, uh,

622
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,220
for entrepreneurs who are creating the
next, uh, coding platforms. Thank you.

623
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:36,040
Well, we have great, hi, my

624
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,800
name is yen and I am a recent graduate.

625
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,120
I want to ask you like how do you,
um,

626
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,650
face failures and how do you,

627
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,760
what kind of power do you use to lift
yourself up in the moments of, you know,

628
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,950
insecurities,
um,

629
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,390
maybe a job rejections
or some kind of failure?

630
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,260
Well, first of all, congratulations.
I'm being recent Grad. Um,

631
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,480
it's everything that I've done.
I have entered a new industry,

632
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:08,020
so like I have no business being in
the children's television industry.

633
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:10,390
Like I'd never hosted a radio show.
Everything that I'm doing,

634
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:13,120
I'm doing for the first time.
So I feel like I'm,

635
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:17,020
the one certainty is that people are
going to say no to you and you're going to

636
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,360
fail. And so like, Yay, we
got that out of the way.

637
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:21,030
Like we can move on and we know it.
Um,

638
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,620
what I've also learned is that sometimes
things that look like failures years

639
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:30,160
later you realize they weren't.
And that, so for example,

640
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:33,610
right after I started Zuckerberg media,

641
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:37,000
I created a show on bravo
called startups silicon valley.

642
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,220
It was a terrible show. Like it was
really bad. It lasted one season.

643
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:47,020
It did not get renewed. Um,
and I was like, I failed.

644
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:50,140
My first television show
I made was a bomb. Like,

645
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,710
how am I going to pick my head up
and go back into this industry?

646
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:58,210
And I realized down the line like a,

647
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:03,190
about a year or two later that first
of all, um, people in Hollywood,

648
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,440
they didn't see that as a failure.
They were like,

649
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:10,250
you got a show to series as
a first time. He pee. Like,

650
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,730
that's awesome. And, uh,

651
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,410
it created a relationship for me with
NBC who now today is producing sprout.

652
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,460
I mean, and, and dot many years later. Um,

653
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,110
and so it took me awhile to like
scrape myself off the floor,

654
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:28,540
but without doing that show,

655
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,320
there's no way that I would be doing any
of the things that I'm doing today in

656
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:36,790
media or half those relationships
or be taken as seriously. So, um,

657
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,610
it's a, I think the, the,

658
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,570
the real thing is to be able to endure
when you're in that scrape that floor

659
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:47,680
moment to try to see what
lies 10 chest moves beyond

660
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,720
king of what lies beyond, Oh, as
do we have another question? Great.

661
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,400
We'll take one more and then
we'll take that year. Um,

662
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:02,401
so I sometimes feel that networking
and mentorship can be a little forced.

663
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,610
Um, I think Sheryl Sandberg said it
best. You don't go up to someone and say,

664
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,260
will you be my mentor? You kind of bring
that relationship forms over time. Um,

665
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:16,290
I'm in the process of starting working
on an idea and I've found myself googling

666
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:19,810
last night,
like women organization,

667
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,750
entrepreneurial programs and like
random things were popping up.

668
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:26,980
I was wondering if you
had any recommendations of
networks in the city that

669
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:29,320
bring women together for
entrepreneur programs?

670
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,930
I just would love outside
perspective of Google.

671
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:34,010
While I love I'd my colleagues here,

672
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,250
I think it's good to get outside
perspective. Okay, great question.

673
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:40,720
And one that I'm sort of still
digging my feet into as a newcomer.

674
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,270
But one thing I think you brought up
that's so important is that I think we're

675
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:46,850
told in the beginning of our careers like,

676
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,350
look for that Pie in the sky mentor
that's going to like fall of all of your

677
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:55,070
career problems for you and guide
you on this path. I'm sorry,

678
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:56,960
but every time I've ever
found a person like that,

679
00:41:56,961 --> 00:42:00,590
they haven't disappointed the hell out
of me. Like they don't, first of all,

680
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:02,900
careers are changing all the time.

681
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:06,140
Like the careers that will exist in
10 years from now don't exist today.

682
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:10,980
So how would that person even know to
guide you on that path? Um, and uh,

683
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,860
those people also, they're
busy. They don't have the time.

684
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,060
I have found that the best mentors
I've ever had and been my peers,

685
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,980
and it's been in creating groups of peers
that work in similar industries that

686
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:25,790
you can bounce things out
of. And, and over the years,
those people rise together.

687
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,650
Suddenly they're the
leaders in the company.

688
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:29,930
They're the people that
people want to network with.

689
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:35,030
And I have just had so much more success
in my own career building peer networks

690
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,950
rather than searching for that like
mentor 18 levels up for me. So,

691
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,150
um, I'm going to look into some, some
groups for you because I should know this.

692
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,200
That's something I should know,

693
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:48,950
but I definitely encourage you also
to maybe like start your own even peer

694
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:53,690
circles. Great. So we're gonna wrap up,

695
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:58,670
but TV shows, radio shows
and the books, more TV shows.

696
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:03,300
What is next?
Broadway to Broadway.

697
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,550
I am producing my first
Broadway show, uh, this fall.

698
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,140
It's called Dear Evan Hansen.

699
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:13,850
It's actually a musical about
cyberbullying that doesn't
sound like a really fun

700
00:43:13,851 --> 00:43:17,930
thing to have a musical about, but
it's a beautiful show. Um, and, uh,

701
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:21,860
one of the stars this from pitch
perfect, which we love and, uh,

702
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:26,000
it's so I'm really excited to be
actually on the producing side of,

703
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,580
of a show on Broadway.
Um,

704
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:33,560
I have a project coming out soon that
is around the election and women and

705
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:35,930
girls, um, which I'm excited about.

706
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:40,430
And then I'm really excited to
see where dot goes from here. Um,

707
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,230
hopefully it will inspire a lot of other
great content because the change isn't

708
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:46,900
going to happen just from one show there.

709
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,500
It needs to be 500 shows like dot
