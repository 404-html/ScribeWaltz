1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,950
Welcome everyone and thank you all
for coming to today's talk. Uh,

2
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:17,420
my name is Mike Diamond and I'm a manager
in the Google advertiser platforms

3
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:20,810
division focusing on
programmatic strategy. Um,

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,820
and I'm really excited and honored
to be moderating today's talk. Um,

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,390
I've been a member of the
Leadership Council for an
organization called upwardly

6
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:33,950
global, uh, for the past nine
or so years. The organization,

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:34,910
um,

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,890
helps refugees and immigrants
find meaningful work in
the u s that's requisite

9
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:43,850
with their skills and experience.
And when I think about,

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,120
um, when I first got involved
with the organization,

11
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:52,121
it's amazing because there was really
very little coverage of refugees and

12
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:56,660
immigrants. Um, it took
me a matter of five,

13
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:59,970
10 minutes to truly explain
the organization's mission. Um,

14
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:03,770
but over the past year, uh, with
the dailies of media attention,

15
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:07,310
there's been an increasing focus
on refugees and immigrants,

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,970
not only in the US but around the world.
Um,

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,660
and it's been quite a tumultuous
time for both of those groups.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,800
And refugees in particular have been in
the spotlight both here and abroad and

19
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:22,120
for good reason.
Uh,

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,530
worldwide displacement is that an
absolute all time high with simply record

21
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,700
numbers. They're staggering. Um,

22
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,990
one in nearly every hundred and 22
people around the globe is either refugee

23
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,660
internally displaced or seeking asylum.

24
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,010
65 and a half million people
have been forcibly displaced,

25
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,180
which is a 60% increase
from just a decade ago.

26
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,350
And over 22 million of those are refugees.

27
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,510
So today we welcome two guests who
can help us better contextualize and

28
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:03,281
understand emerging stories in the media
as well as our country is rhetoric and

29
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:07,190
policies towards newcomers.
Really New Americans.

30
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,440
Our discussion today is going to be
focused on both refugees and immigrants,

31
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,610
really who they are,

32
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,910
the workforce issues that surround
them and our country's policies,

33
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,870
um,
towards them.

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,330
We're going to hope to cover US policy
as well as practices with regards to

35
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:30,710
resettlement of both refugees and
immigrants will talk about the difference

36
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:35,390
between differences between refugees,
asylum seekers, migrants and immigrants.

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,340
As we often don't talk about the nuance
between those different groups. Um,

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,130
and finally talk about some of the support
systems that are here in America to

39
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:46,790
support these communities.
So without further ado,

40
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:51,230
let me introduce you to our
two. Uh, our two guests. First,

41
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:55,940
Suzanne, cause Ori is the senior director
of philanthropy and partnerships at the

42
00:02:55,941 --> 00:03:00,190
American Jewish joint distribution
committee, also known as the JDC.

43
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,110
She's had over 25 years of experience
working in the refugee humanitarian field

44
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,730
and in the course of her career has
worked for three of the nine resettlement

45
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,740
agencies in the u s um,

46
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,390
Maine and managing various aspects
of their resettlement programs.

47
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,520
She attended Wellesley college and,
uh,

48
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,660
also received

49
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,190
her degree from the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University St.

50
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,180
Next to me as Nikki says,
Ronnie,

51
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:35,080
who I've known for many years and
as the CEO of upwardly global,

52
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,070
um, where she's worked for the,
for the past eight plus years,

53
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,340
as we'll hear later,
uh,

54
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,420
upclose work grew out of the resettlement
system and as the first and longest

55
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:51,640
serving organization to support the
integration of skilled refugees and

56
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:56,450
immigrants into the u s
workforce. Um, Nikki has her, uh,

57
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,410
received her MBA from Columbia,
uh,

58
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:02,380
and has a bachelor's degree in
policy analysis from Cornell.

59
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,940
So to kick things off,
um,

60
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,860
I like to just baseline a little bit on
resettlement as a topic in general and

61
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:13,500
it turned to Suzanne.
Um,

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,860
we'd love you to kind of help us get an
understanding of the refugee situation

63
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:22,861
both globally and here in the u s and
start to understand why displacement has

64
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,460
grown so much over the past,
particularly 10 years or so.

65
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,700
Okay. Um, hello everybody. So, um,

66
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,420
I'll focus on resettlement in
the u s but just for perspective,

67
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,960
the situation right now in Syria is
definitely the thing that has turned the

68
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:48,870
pendulum and really ramped up the,

69
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,580
the desperation and the
situation for refugees worldwide.

70
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,200
But really we live in a world where
there's much less peacebuilding.

71
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,200
There's so much more
persecution than ever before,

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,390
but also we don't address the root causes
so that people can go back. I mean,

73
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,280
many of us remember situations in Vietnam,
in Bosnia,

74
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:13,490
in Rwanda where refugees
returned to their homes.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,800
There is less and less of that today.

76
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:20,801
So today we still see millions of
refugees that have left Afghanistan.

77
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:23,780
How many of you even remember
when Afghanistan happened?

78
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:28,781
That was way back in the 1980s some
of you weren't even born Sudan,

79
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,940
Somalia, all these things,
these refugee crisis,

80
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:36,830
we're so protracted and we haven't dealt
with the peace building side of it.

81
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,250
And so refugees are just basically some
of my colleagues call it warehouse in

82
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:47,480
refugee camps or in cities around the
world in poor countries and neighboring

83
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:52,250
countries. And that's just persisted for
so long. So there's a been a buildup,

84
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,500
but very few solutions at,
at the root causes. Um,

85
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,400
very few refugees are resettled. So
if the numbers, you mentioned Mike,

86
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,520
maybe 1% only get resettled and
it's like a lottery in a sense.

87
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,900
If you get out of your country and have
a chance at third country resettlement,

88
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,180
many refugees,
most of them,

89
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:19,010
the bulk of them are in
neighboring countries where
really it's hard to welcome

90
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:24,011
them because the neighboring countries
are poor and it's just such millions and

91
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,050
millions of people who need jobs,
need livelihoods,

92
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:32,450
need food, clothing, et cetera.

93
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:36,590
And refugees don't want to
be recipients of welfare.

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,520
They want to be able to have a
chance at continuing their lives.

95
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,180
That's why organizations
like yours are so important.

96
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:47,060
But all of our work is so important.
So in the US,

97
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,310
the US resettlement program traditionally
has been different than other

98
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:57,311
countries because our focus is
employment almost to our detriment.

99
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,340
Um, so the agencies, there's nine
resettlement agencies in America,

100
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:08,300
there were more before
the fall of communism,

101
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:09,620
but now there's nine.

102
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,520
Most of them are faith based
and three of them are not.

103
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:16,740
So their church World Service,
um,

104
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
Hebrew immigrant aid society,
Lutheran Immigration Refugee Services,

105
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,610
US Catholic conference, world's
relief. The Evangelical Group,

106
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,710
they don't proselytize.

107
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,950
But the reason they're important is that
there are churches and constituents all

108
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:35,330
over the country that welcome refugees.

109
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,800
And the other three that
are nondenominational are
they international rescue

110
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:44,630
committee, US Conference for Refugees.
And there's an Ethiopian group,

111
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,631
Ethiopian community and Development
Group that does the same work committee.

112
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,330
So all of them have sponsors around the
country that help with the resettlement.

113
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,280
So they are professional staff and sponsor
because the resettlement program in

114
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,920
America is a private public partnership.

115
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,400
The idea is it's so important to welcome
refugees in your community and you

116
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:14,000
don't want to impact any one
community in the country.

117
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,580
Usually if refugees had their choices,
they'd all go to Florida,

118
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,600
California cause they're warm in their
minds and maybe New York because it's so

119
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:24,710
receptive,

120
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,710
but welfare is such in some of these
states that it's so generous that really

121
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:36,290
the system is geared in such a way that
refugees who don't have family members

122
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:41,291
usually have to go to states where they
have hospitable communities to welcome

123
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:46,100
them and to work with the professional
staff like these nine agencies.

124
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,610
And what we're responsible for doing is
refugees are recognized as refugees by

125
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:55,100
State Department overseas.
They don't,

126
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,650
it's asylum seekers that
come to the u s borders,

127
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:03,651
but refugees are recognize it's part
of the u s foreign policy to recognize

128
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:09,651
people of humanitarian concern to the u
s so it's usually countries that America

129
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,890
realizes are persecuting
its own populations.

130
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,840
The president of the United States
and congress set the ceilings,

131
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,860
the numbers of people who get to come
in and basically they're processed

132
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:26,100
overseas. It's a long, long, long process.

133
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:30,020
All of you have heard that
screening people for um,

134
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,640
admissions to the u s is very complicated
because you have to go through a lot

135
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,350
of security clearances.

136
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,060
Basically you go through a UN agency
called the UN High Commissioner for

137
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:47,061
refugees who then refers
you for resettlement to one
of many countries in the

138
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,590
world.
Your papers go through.

139
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,740
Some refugees have been there 10 2030
years before they even arrived to America,

140
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:59,550
especially those coming in from Africa.
Some come in about two,

141
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,380
three years, which is considered very
fast after waiting and they come here,

142
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,610
we receive them.

143
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,890
The resettlement agencies basically
received them with sponsors in America.

144
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,980
The responsibilities are to get
people employed as soon as possible.

145
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,380
And for that reason they usually
take very low paying jobs.

146
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,790
The bar is to try and get jobs that
will help people become self sufficient

147
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,220
enough money to pay for your rent.

148
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,190
And basically over a longer timeframe,

149
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,140
a longer arc in your life.
You start learning the English,

150
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,030
you start doing all those other things
and you slowly, slowly move up the ladder.

151
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,700
So it's, it's, it's a difficult thing,

152
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:49,440
but that's the emphasis of the u s program
and some of the countries in Europe,

153
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,720
they would rather a refugee, go on welfare
then get the job of a local person.

154
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,120
But in the states,
that's not the way we do it.

155
00:10:57,121 --> 00:11:02,010
We do it with a real emphasis
on early self-sufficiency. Um,

156
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,760
so that basically,
and so when refugees come in,

157
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,790
the resettlement agencies within 90
to 120 days have to get you a job,

158
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,800
help you with an apartment.

159
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,380
And remember it's not just
through State Department money,

160
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:21,381
it's a lot of the goodwill of American
people and neighbors and communities get

161
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:24,660
you jobs,
social security numbers,

162
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,840
help enroll kids in school help connect
you to your community because nobody

163
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,490
wants refugees to live in isolation.

164
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:37,491
You both want a host community and the
community that might be existing like an

165
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:42,720
ethnic community that can speak the
same language so they can have access to

166
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,940
food that's familiar to them.

167
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,180
So basically the program runs for
the most part really beautifully.

168
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,060
But with the idea that you give
the minimum over the long term,

169
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,490
there are other social services
that refugees can access,

170
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,540
state employment programs,
ESL programs, et cetera.

171
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,250
And that goes on for a long time.

172
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,760
But it takes organizations like
upwardly global that have that specific

173
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,290
understanding of what
kind of support system.

174
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:22,291
Somebody trying to get a new job and
move up in the market really requires.

175
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:27,310
And so organizations like this are more
and more important to make sure that

176
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:32,020
refugees are not an underclass. Cause
as Mike said, there are new Americans,

177
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,870
they're not refugees
when they arrive here.

178
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,080
We've selected them as people who will
be part of our communities and many,

179
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,680
many contribute immediately to,
sorry,

180
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,770
it was a long,
long

181
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,920
response, but it's a big issue. Yeah.

182
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,210
Can you tell us a little bit more
about the profile of refugees?

183
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:56,740
So are they families, individuals? Like
what does that, what does that look like?

184
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,810
Okay,
so in general,

185
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,730
um,
it's a difficult question to answer it.

186
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,350
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees
used to have these posters and said,

187
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,920
says these are refugees and there
would be these little puppets,

188
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:13,290
pictures of anybody you can imagine.

189
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,220
So because basically when
you have a refugee crisis,

190
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,170
it's everybody. So it, it
could be anyone who's a Moslem.

191
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,570
Anyone who's a Christian,

192
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:29,040
anyone who's a Jew and from all classes,
it doesn't discriminate.

193
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,020
Governments don't discriminate just
by class. So it's basically everyone.

194
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,460
Um, more than half are
probably children. Um,

195
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,370
most coming to the u s are families.

196
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,670
There are situations and places where
single people are coming primarily

197
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,840
because of maybe specific persecution
that had government has inflicted on a

198
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:58,140
certain group. But genuinely it's
mostly families, but it's everybody.

199
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,850
It's carpenters, it's
journalists, it's everybody.

200
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:03,870
It's anybody.

201
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,040
We started mentioning,

202
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,590
I know you've worked for a number
of the resettlement organizations.

203
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:12,470
Can you tell us a little bit about the
process that those ordination go through

204
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:14,690
to, to help families? To help individuals?

205
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,700
Okay.
So most important is having volunteers,

206
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,540
having people to support refugees.
That's one of the most important things.

207
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,000
We usually realize it.
Again,

208
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:31,001
another aspect of the American program
at Visa VI refugees is priority's given

209
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:35,690
to people who have family members in
the u s because they're obviously the

210
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:40,190
biggest support system and then your
community and volunteers are the other

211
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:41,210
support system.

212
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,430
So for church based organizations you
can have many churches helping with

213
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:50,430
sponsorship. So mentoring
kids in school, um,

214
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,560
uh, mentoring families, helping families.

215
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:59,240
There's a lot of psychosocial issues
that maybe people are suffering from

216
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:03,500
isolation, depression. So it
really helps to be integrated.

217
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,803
Um,

218
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,610
the church based agencies I've worked
for often have used church sponsors or

219
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:14,360
community connections,
but a church agency,

220
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,450
we'll also work with a mosque if you have,
um,

221
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,480
you bring in a lot of interfaith groups
because you don't want people to just be

222
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:25,970
labeled and just be
ghettoized when they come.

223
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,020
It's really so important as many
more people as you can bring in.

224
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:31,130
The more important it is,

225
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,970
and maybe the single most
important aspect is financial,

226
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:39,650
which is helping people get jobs,
helping women with maybe five children,

227
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:41,780
find childcare.
So they really,

228
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,990
the agencies help with
all of that very much.

229
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:49,991
In the beginning the expectations of
the organizations are all the same.

230
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,710
So whether I worked for a church based
agency or the international rescue

231
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,830
committee,
the basic factors,

232
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,840
we all have to give a certain standard
of service to make sure that people are

233
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:08,530
self sufficient or know where to go and
get services so they're not on their own

234
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:13,781
because there's a lot of support systems
from the state that also are available

235
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:18,620
to people. And just a quick follow up,
how long do those support systems last?

236
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,810
It's very short in terms
of the contract with which,

237
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:27,270
let's say the resettlement agencies
have with State Department,

238
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:32,271
so it's between 90 to 120 days that
the relationship really is there.

239
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:37,661
And then the rest of it is referrals
and passing things on to state and city

240
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:42,911
actors or private actors like upwardly
global who come in and help out and pick

241
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,870
people up to the next step and next level.

242
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,830
And some of the organizations
have longer term contracts.

243
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:56,780
They may have employment contracts from
the state or from the city because there

244
00:16:56,781 --> 00:17:01,781
is an understanding by many states and
cities that you require a specific kind

245
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:07,481
of understanding and language experience
and cultural experience to help with

246
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:12,410
these things.
In your experience,

247
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:16,730
what do you think some of the biggest
challenges that the organizations face as

248
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:20,770
they're trying to help some of these
groups? Okay, so, so today and I,

249
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,990
I bet everyone would have the same
response is it's just this feeling of fear

250
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:29,000
and feeling that you're not welcome.

251
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,120
I should also tell you that refugees
when they're fleeing their countries very

252
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,470
often don't want to go
to a western country.

253
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:44,000
And most people think they do know they
want to be right by their homes so they

254
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:48,920
can go back home tomorrow.
And the fact is after 10 20 years,

255
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,670
five years, you stop thinking that
even with the Syrian refugees was very,

256
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:58,671
very difficult for the Western world
to convince them that you have been so

257
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:03,300
persecuted, you're unlikely
to go back home. You know,

258
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:07,050
resettlement might be the right thing
for you. You have a chance at a new life.

259
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,790
And most people make those decisions for
their children because they know that

260
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,590
going back is not an option.
Um,

261
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,980
so the challenges to me
are isolating people fear.

262
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,563
Um,

263
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,690
which is part of what's happening
in today's rhetoric about refugees.

264
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:31,310
I mean, the idea that you can have a
bag of skittles and one of them can,

265
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,520
can be dangerous is
that that creates fear.

266
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:39,030
And that's not been the history of
America. So we talk about refugees,

267
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:44,031
but in America there have been so many
groups that have come in for hundreds and

268
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,490
hundreds of years. Even before there was
an official enactment of refugee law,

269
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,510
we've had immigrants and refugees
coming since this country started.

270
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,490
And there's been backlash,

271
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,520
backlash against the Chinese backlash
against the Irish backlash against the

272
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:06,180
Italians. I mean, hatred and
vitriol like we hear today.

273
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,790
So actually I'm very positive.

274
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,820
I feel this is part of a
trend that will change,

275
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,720
but I feel that there are moments
in our history that this happens.

276
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:20,721
But I really believe in what I've
seen everywhere is there is something

277
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,860
unbelievable in America in terms of
how America welcomes the stranger.

278
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,960
Because so many Americans have had the
experience of being a stranger themselves

279
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,350
and it's unbelievable.
We,

280
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,060
so many of us in our family members
have been recipients of that kind of

281
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:39,894
kindness.

282
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,370
It's nice to hear some of that optimism.

283
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,100
Yeah,
I believe that genuine,

284
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,930
one of the things that's really struck
me through my experience with upwardly

285
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,980
global was how many refugees
and immigrants are highly
educated and are coming

286
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:59,390
to this country with years and years
of experience and university degrees.

287
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,440
Um,

288
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,440
a stat that I've learned is roughly 28%
of that community has bachelor's degrees

289
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:10,310
or higher, which is compared to
roughly 29% of the u s population.

290
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,600
Um, the interesting thing is
that despite that expertise,

291
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,920
despite that experience,

292
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,780
so many of these immigrants and
refugees are either unemployed or as,

293
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,340
um, uh, Susana lit it or under employed,

294
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,640
which is a term that we don't really
talk about a lot. Uh, and so, um,

295
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:34,150
many of them end up being very poor and
that is certainly not a situation that

296
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,330
they deserve. Um, and so when
I think about upwardly global,

297
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:42,620
I want to kind of transition over to
Nikki, um, to, to talk about, you know,

298
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:47,440
why that problem exists and how do you
think you have addressed it and can other

299
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:48,100
organizations kind

300
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,270
of addressed that? Sure, sure. Um,

301
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,610
so I think it's easiest to talk about
the founding of upwardly global because

302
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:55,990
our founder and I'm not,

303
00:20:55,991 --> 00:21:00,190
the founder of the organization was
working in refugee resettlement and while

304
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,010
resettlement happens through
nine different volunteer
agencies throughout the

305
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:03,730
country,

306
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,420
the government also has some national
services that help all of those volunteer

307
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:11,850
agencies do their jobs, particularly with
respect to us. Husan said employment. Um,

308
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,150
our founder was working and that
employment technical assistance to the

309
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,090
volunteer agencies when the
first wave of Bosnians came over.

310
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,370
Now the Bosnian refugee cohort
was relatively highly educated,

311
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,350
um, and it was in seeing that the
system was set up to do what Susan said,

312
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:33,970
rapid attachment jobs. Those jobs
tend to be low wage, low skill work.

313
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,440
And it was her experience
watching literally surgeons
and engineers wind up in

314
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:43,441
the front lines of chicken processing
plants where they were considered the best

315
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:45,700
employees in the organization,

316
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,990
but there was nothing left in the
system to help them get back into their

317
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:54,220
trained fields. And our founder was sort
of spinning the narrative on its head,

318
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:58,660
which is not only is it an old romanticize
narrative that the first generation

319
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:02,350
comes and sacrifices so that the next
generation can enjoy the opportunities

320
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:05,230
that this country and that that's
a detriment to the individual,

321
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,060
but that that's also a
detriment to the country.

322
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,980
So this was really at
the beginning in which,

323
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:12,220
I mean we've talked more
and more certainly over the
last decade when I've been

324
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:14,440
with upwardly global about
a skills gap in the country.

325
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,980
But the vision of our founder
was exactly that, that this is,

326
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,420
this is we're losing out on two sides
when we accept under employment and when

327
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:26,710
the narrative we build is encouraging
those who are coming with skills to accept

328
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,270
sort of their new station in life.

329
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,490
And that was part of what
happened in the system.

330
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:32,740
That there was a bit of a
narrative that says, look,

331
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:37,000
your education from your home country may
just not count here or the the sort of

332
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:39,070
quicker you sort of accept
your new station in life,

333
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:40,720
the better your
integration is going to go.

334
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,370
And upwardly global was founded for that
niche of the population where we were

335
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:49,510
trying to change that narrative by
proving that better outcomes were possible

336
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:52,660
for refugees. And then as we
sort of grew as an organization,

337
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:57,040
realizing that the problem existed for
a much broader swath of the immigrant

338
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,870
population.
Um,

339
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,060
so we exist because despite the media
having you believe that every immigrant in

340
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:07,540
the country might be undocumented or
coming through the h one B process,

341
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,410
most people don't know.

342
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,580
We legally allow about a million people
into the country every year through our

343
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,290
regular immigration channels.

344
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,550
And so our primary immigration policy
in the country is family reunification.

345
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,300
We also of course have a policy of refugee
resettlement where you're getting a

346
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:26,380
skilled population coming through and
then also the diversity card lottery.

347
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,950
So through those three channels alone,
you get a million people coming in a year.

348
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,260
And of the adult population
of that larger group,

349
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,410
you've got 48% who have a bachelor's
or better and you have drastic

350
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,140
underemployment. So
the, the, on the whole,

351
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:44,710
if you look at everybody coming in about
one in four windup, under or unemployed.

352
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,370
Um, and then if you look at subgroups
like refugees, those coming from Africa,

353
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:52,310
Latin America, Middle East, it's
much more drastic than that.

354
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,070
Why does that happen?

355
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,050
So if you start to think about your own
sort of trajectory as a professional and

356
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:03,740
you start to think about what you needed
in order to get where you're going,

357
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,090
some of those things will not be there
for somebody coming to the country after

358
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:10,310
they've been educated
and started their career.

359
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,340
So the biggest thing that could
possibly be missing, of course,

360
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:14,720
his English language skills,

361
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,830
and that's true for about
half the population that
wind up under or unemployed,

362
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:20,690
is that their English is
simply not sufficient.

363
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:23,000
Now that doesn't mean
that they're not fluent.

364
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,480
It means that actually there's a big
difference between being good at English

365
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,420
and what they call very good. And I
promise you, these are technical terms,

366
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,570
good is where you can
actually be very conversant.

367
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:36,920
Somebody understands what you need,

368
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:40,640
understands how to give it to you because
you can make yourself understood being

369
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:44,540
very good actually trans aggresses that
and it means you've actually achieved a

370
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:47,420
level of English where years likely to
speak it in the home as you are your home,

371
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,160
your, your, your home country language.

372
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,240
And it also means that you understand
the contextualized English of your field.

373
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,700
And so when you have English barriers,

374
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:58,550
I don't want everybody to think that you
have people who don't speak English at

375
00:24:58,551 --> 00:24:59,180
all.

376
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,730
That part of the problem is that English
is not moving people from that good to

377
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:05,390
very good. Um, in addition to that,

378
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,410
one of the biggest barriers that
newcomers face is a lack of a professional

379
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:13,760
network. Think about how you
found your job here at Google.

380
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,990
Um, it could be that a recruiter
saw you on linkedin and called you.

381
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:20,390
It could be that they found that profile
on linkedin through somebody else.

382
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:23,270
They were looking at it on
linkedin. Um, but in most cases,

383
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,560
as we progress through our careers,

384
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:27,920
we use our network to find our
next job or an opening in that job.

385
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,020
When you come to resettlement, when you
come through family reunification, you,

386
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,320
you're less likely to have
that professional network.

387
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,200
And then there's other
barriers. Um, a culturation, uh,

388
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,290
the job search is very different here
in the u s than it may be another

389
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,880
countries.
So a very classic example.

390
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,090
I don't know if we have anybody who
was educated outside the u s experience

391
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:51,770
outside the u s but your resume may
have its picture on it, marital status,

392
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,570
religious affiliation. Um, it's
not atypical to have a five, six,

393
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:59,540
seven, even eight page resume and
from certain parts of the world.

394
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,740
And then if you just start to think
about the nuance of American culture,

395
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,440
we are typically self promoting.
Um, meaning that we don't,

396
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,010
we don't shy away from talking about
accomplishments of yourself or your team.

397
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,350
Um, but that you have to actually do
that. We express enthusiasm about a job.

398
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,470
We tend not to be as
hierarchical as other cultures.

399
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:25,460
So our interview processes require
that we ask the interviewer questions,

400
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,510
things that may feel odd
coming from other types of, um,

401
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,820
cultures where that's just
not done in the job search.

402
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,770
And so what you have is this no network,
uh,

403
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,140
resume and set of job search skills that
are not working here. And then finally,

404
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:41,570
what you have is you have a
misunderstanding of foreign education.

405
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:47,470
Foreign degree simply in most cases is
not as highly prized and or understood as

406
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:48,354
a US degree.

407
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,610
And so when you're coming with a Middle
Eastern name and the University of

408
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,510
Baghdad on your resume,

409
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,840
an employer may see that and
simply not know what to do with it.

410
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,470
And that's the kind of
innocuous, uh, version.

411
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,340
And then the non innocuous one is his
subconscious and even conscious bias.

412
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,420
We're here in New York City.

413
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,540
Sometimes it's hard for us to
really grasp that that happens. Uh,

414
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:12,090
but I can tell you we worked throughout
the country, upwardly global,

415
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:16,800
and we see routinely, um, simply
bias in the hiring process. Um,

416
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,280
so that's why the problem exists.
And, uh, and who would exist for,

417
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,290
so refugees in America are we settled
in some 300 communities across the

418
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:28,740
country. So you can imagine
where some of this plays out.

419
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,480
Um, so one of the interesting things is
there's, there's been a big focus in,

420
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:40,750
in previous administrations, particularly
Obama administration around, uh,

421
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:45,700
employment and economic opportunity
and placing refugees into, into, uh,

422
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,510
into their fields program
called Partnership for
refugees with nearly 6 million

423
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:54,610
open jobs in the country.
Why do you think, you know,

424
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:58,030
what are some more of the reasons why
you feel like it's so difficult for

425
00:27:58,031 --> 00:28:00,130
refugees to get placed both on the,

426
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,320
and we've talked a lot
about the refugee side,

427
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:05,500
but even more so potentially
on the corporate side from
your experience working

428
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:06,930
with some of the biggest,
yeah,

429
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,810
yeah, yeah. Um, so yeah, so
just to sort of juxtapose,

430
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:15,520
the Obama Administration was
very interested in immigrant
integration and in the

431
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:19,780
workforce. And so there was
a larger effort broadly for
immigrants and then very

432
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:23,890
specifically to bring companies
to the refugee crisis,

433
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,160
a corporate response called
Partnership for Refugees. Um,

434
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,520
I think largely companies
don't necessarily find
this population as readily,

435
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:32,440
particularly the refugees
for a number of reasons.

436
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:35,200
One is they tend to have a gap
at the top of their resume.

437
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,470
It could be a handful of months, it
could be a number of years. Um, uh,

438
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,610
and so if their most recent job is
actually the stocking shoes at Payless,

439
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:45,670
um,

440
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,670
when in fact they are an engineer
of some sort and we see all kinds,

441
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,290
um, it's unlikely that a, an uh,

442
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,630
somebody reviewing a resume pool is going
to understand why that gap exists and

443
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:00,430
we may make certain
assumptions about that gap.

444
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,200
And simply we're in competitive markets,
right? How do we screen lots of resumes?

445
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,670
The second is as again,

446
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,170
I think a very large misunderstanding
about the work authorization of certain

447
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:13,930
immigrant classes.
Refugees have a green card,

448
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:18,730
they work without visa sponsorship
as do a number of immigrant classes.

449
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:23,530
So I can't tell you how many times
we've worked with big companies,

450
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,310
fortune 15 companies that have said to me,
we can only hire citizens.

451
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,420
And I have to delicately say
that's actually an EEO violation.

452
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,560
Unless the position require
a security clearance,

453
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:39,130
where citizenship is necessary
for most positions in the economy,

454
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,730
you are not allowed to discriminate
between green card and citizenship.

455
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,180
And so the misunderstanding when they
see a foreign name and a foreign degree,

456
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,890
you know, is that this person will
needs sponsorship and we don't do that.

457
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,840
Um, so I think, and then the other
thing is where the channels, where are,

458
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,290
where are our companies going
for their talent? And you know,

459
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:03,460
so you work within networks. Um, I'm
sure he even here at Google, right?

460
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:05,110
They're strong referral culture.

461
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,100
Refer your friends if you're smart and
motivated and they're coming again.

462
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,650
So what helps refugees in the beginning,

463
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,100
our ethnic enclaves that support
them in language acquisition,

464
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:16,240
getting their kids in school,

465
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,080
ethnic groceries can also become isolating
when they're not connected to the

466
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,460
mainstream.
Um,

467
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,930
and so you do find this gap between
where they are and companies saying that

468
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,580
they want talent,
uh,

469
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:31,570
but not necessarily knowing where and
how and how to evaluate within the

470
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:32,800
existing processes,

471
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,190
the talent pool that lies within these
2 million highly skilled but under

472
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:37,960
employed immigrants and
refugees in the country.

473
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,760
So I guess as a followup to that, what are
some of the ways in which, you know, to,

474
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:43,840
at a policy level,

475
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:47,530
we're educating corporate leaders to be
able to understand those groups better?

476
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,150
Right. Um, I, I mean,

477
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:53,770
I think the larger conversation right now
is about finding talent, period, right?

478
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:55,270
So I think you see a couple of things.

479
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:59,380
I think you see a larger movement to
understanding that diversity and inclusion

480
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:02,650
happens, right? In a lot of ways
that we have to source talent from,

481
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,580
from a lot of venues. Um, and
in addition to that, it's,

482
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:11,610
I think really about the
companies embracing bias as
we see them trying to do,

483
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,280
um, and really understanding
where they may have that bias. Um,

484
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,810
and then I think it's really about
understanding recruiting processes and how

485
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:24,700
often are we really creating diversity
through our processes versus screening it

486
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:29,230
out. Um, but from a policy standpoint,
it's still at an individual company level.

487
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,940
This administration has not sought to
catalyze the corporate sector and maybe

488
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:36,010
the same way that the
last administration did.

489
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,400
And so it's still at a very
individual company level.

490
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:43,390
I think it's still under the broader
umbrella of companies seeking talent and

491
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:45,400
being in a moment where,
how do you assess that?

492
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,220
Could it come from foreign degrees?
Can it come from no degree? Right?

493
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:51,880
And we're seeing this broader sort of
idea that maybe we don't need a degree for

494
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:56,290
certain jobs in the economy and we're
just sort of inflating what is necessary

495
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:00,130
in educational attainment to
achieve certain, um, in demand jobs.

496
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,930
So I think that we're,

497
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,470
we're just trying to thread our ourselves
and the population into the larger

498
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:08,380
narrative right now that where
talent is and how we access it,

499
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,480
the things we have to do to get at it.

500
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,680
I would just say that
at a really basic level,

501
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,340
the fear that's going on right now,
this,

502
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,420
okay,

503
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,770
vilifying
immigrant communities,

504
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,800
this sense that they're pariahs rather
than looking at people as assets,

505
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,630
bringing in assets,
bringing in degrees,

506
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:37,980
bringing in diversity,
bringing in diversity in,

507
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,950
in ethnicity,
but

508
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,420
bringing in diversity. Even in age.
You know, America has been very,

509
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:49,421
very lucky because we're a young country
because of this influx of a million new

510
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:53,690
people every year where not Japan,
we're not Italy.

511
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:58,691
We're not suffering from a workforce to
retirement ratio like other countries

512
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:03,290
because of this. There's so
many and in many, many places.

513
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,910
I don't know where you are all from,

514
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:09,590
but there are many cities in America
that can talk about being revitalized

515
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:14,180
because of new ethnic communities that
have come in and are working and have

516
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:18,560
brought work and have invested
in private businesses.

517
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:21,680
And so all of that's not
part of the conversation now.

518
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:25,070
And really I hear even from people I,

519
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,160
I met recently with a couple of people
who are from Google and whose husbands

520
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:33,170
and wives don't have jobs,

521
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:36,290
but people are afraid to go
out now and look for jobs.

522
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,200
Everyone is so afraid of discrimination.

523
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,310
Eh, we, um,

524
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,580
I'm not going to overstate this statistic
understanding that I'm at Google,

525
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,900
but we did start to track,
we partner with employers in our program.

526
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:52,900
Our program focuses largely on the
soft skills that immigrants need,

527
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:56,860
job search skills, resume interviewing,
networking. Um, and we've,

528
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:58,530
we've made those things,
um,

529
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,530
such that they can do them in a self
paced way or that they can have one on one

530
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:06,130
advisory through our program. And then on
the employer side, we engage employers.

531
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:09,340
We do training for them on
who the population is. We
do some anti bias training,

532
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:12,150
but we also engage employers
and volunteer opportunities. Um,

533
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:17,250
we've done it with Google where employees
actually work as mock interviewers to

534
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:21,460
newcomers and they teach them really what
was good in the interview, what wasn't.

535
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:25,350
They get formalized feedback. It
goes into their advisory process. Um,

536
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,440
but we do also believe in contact
theory and even in these major markets,

537
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:33,810
upwardly global has a footprint of about
seven cities throughout the u s some

538
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,650
like New York and some like Boise,
Idaho.

539
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:40,900
And what's incredible is that uniformly
across that contact theory holds that

540
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,960
people will change their minds and their
attitudes about a certain population

541
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,620
after having had a personal
experience interacting with them.

542
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,620
And what we have found is that
some companies come to us and say,

543
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,440
we don't want to do any of this
employee engagement, show his talent.

544
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,340
And we've actually measured how many
times we present a candidate to how many

545
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:02,980
times they then interview
a candidate presented.

546
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,520
And we've then later gone on to have
employee engagement with that company and

547
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:13,891
measured the present to interview ratio
and seen enormous growth in the present

548
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,680
to interview ratio once we
have employee engagement,

549
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:22,360
meaning their employees or are interacting
with our job seekers in a meaningful

550
00:35:22,361 --> 00:35:23,194
way.

551
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,570
Yeah.

552
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,750
One last question before we open it up.
And I think one of the,

553
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,660
one of the amazing things has been
watching over the globals growth over the

554
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:32,830
past 10 plus years,

555
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,920
just in terms of the amount of job
seekers they've supported from hundreds,

556
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,320
thousands,

557
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,430
uh, in, in individual year. Right.

558
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,070
But I know that you've done a lot of
thinking about how to scale the program

559
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:48,420
beyond that contact specific piece. Sure.
How have you done that? And you know,

560
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:52,120
with a Google audience, we always
think about bringing our product to,

561
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:54,000
to a wider audience. So
yeah. Have you done that?

562
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,150
Yeah. Great. Um, we,

563
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,710
we did it as any 21st century companies
doing it. We used more technology.

564
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:04,400
So a program that was started out being
very much in person with training.

565
00:36:04,401 --> 00:36:08,420
We realized we have a population that
is very inclined to use technology.

566
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,180
They are highly skilled
in their home countries.

567
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:16,181
I mean 30 anywhere between 30 and 40%
of them in any given year have a masters

568
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:20,930
or better that work with us. Um, and so
we didn't have to do trainings in person.

569
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:24,410
We could absolutely use the best of online
learning and the best of technology.

570
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:28,280
So we've really tried to take everything
we were doing that we knew were

571
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:32,450
critical elements of the program and do
as much of what didn't need a human to

572
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:35,720
do through a automation technology,

573
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:39,830
robust platforms and robust online
learning management functionality. I mean,

574
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,850
to the point where we actually now we
were spending hours of human time taking

575
00:36:43,851 --> 00:36:46,880
foreign resumes and making
them look like us resumes.

576
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,160
And now we just built
a resume builder tool.

577
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:51,950
It just pulls it into a US style format,

578
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:55,280
like drop the picture and then
interactive trainings that teach you what

579
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:59,930
information goes where so that at
least you can compete for the job.

580
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:04,670
Our job is not to get anybody a job is
to give them the tools to compete for the

581
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:08,020
job, which I think is very
inherently American. Um,

582
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,720
and we're now doing that with a technology
platform and a portal that we can

583
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:13,970
license to partners like
the resettlement system.

584
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,460
So if you are our IRC and you have x
number of organizations on the ground,

585
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:24,020
some of those wolverine receiving higher
volume of refugees that are highly

586
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:24,854
skilled,

587
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,310
but the system's not really set up as
we heard from Susan to to that work.

588
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,040
But some of them are
coming ready to go today.

589
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,390
The Iraqis are all been educated in
English. They speak English very well.

590
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,530
If they went to university, they don't
need necessarily to take a survival job.

591
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,890
Some of them are coming because
they serve the u s military forces.

592
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:45,560
They know us culture relatively well.
Um,

593
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,310
so you can have tools that now you
can just embed in the existing system.

594
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:52,220
Community colleges,
libraries,

595
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,300
even the federal workforce system is
really geared towards helping people get

596
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,990
really low wage, low word, uh, low
skilled work or mid skill work. Now, um,

597
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,730
you can actually offer it through
the system. They licensed the portal,

598
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:08,930
they licensed the resources and we're
scaling our growth that way through

599
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:13,730
productizing what we've done.
And I just want to say this,

600
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,530
keeping data on all of it since day one.
So the most fun, right of what we do,

601
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:23,190
um, and that I'm really excited
about for the future is that it's,

602
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,960
it's like these mini pathways for those
who come to the u s and the more data

603
00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:30,830
you have, the more time you can help
them avoid pathways that didn't work.

604
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,120
A doctor who comes to the u s of a
certain age with a certain background,

605
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,200
a certain specialty may have decision
points in their journey in the u s should

606
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:41,760
they relicense as a physician.

607
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:46,480
So did they find an alternate degree that
may take less time and fewer resources?

608
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:49,990
I have had a higher degree of success
and we're going to start to have enough

609
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:54,190
data to look at where are they in the
u s where, where were they educated,

610
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:59,020
how long ago to give them some analysis
of what are the best ways for them to

611
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:01,920
pathway back into professional
careers that use their,

612
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,850
their skills and their experience and
their, we are doing a little test with a,

613
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,780
with a Google big data product.
So, so I would say that data that,

614
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,140
that distinguishes upwardly
global is incredible.

615
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:19,141
And it's the only way to counter
those stories that keep circulating.

616
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:21,760
I mean,
I'm a huge fan because of this.

617
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:26,740
I mean it's really distinguishes upwardly
global from any other service provider

618
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:29,230
in this field.
I think in this niche.

619
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,920
Really exciting stuff.

620
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,590
So I do want to open it up for audience
questions and feel free to please come

621
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:40,540
to the mic because we are
recording this talk. Um,

622
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,110
so we'll open it up to you guys.

623
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,820
I, uh, that was so great. So my
question is, do you guys have a,

624
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:54,350
a clear sort of end goal that you're
trying to achieve for any given sort of

625
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:57,620
refugee or immigrant?
Like what would be considered a success?

626
00:39:57,621 --> 00:39:59,030
Like would it be a success if,

627
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,690
say this doctor who came
over became like a lab tech,

628
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:06,680
would it be only a success if he became
like was was still working in the

629
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:10,940
medical profession or maybe would it be
considered as success if maybe his kids

630
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,270
eventually like went to a really
great college and you know,

631
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:16,940
eventually went on to medical school?
And what is sort of,

632
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,280
how are you measuring
sort of your progress?

633
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,850
Great question.
Um,

634
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,480
so we've thought about this problem
a number of ways and you know,

635
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,530
I'm sort of trained right
with an economics France. So
mine is like optimization,

636
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,660
right? When, when are we optimized?

637
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,710
We have decided as upwardly global that
we're sort of in a turn of the wheel

638
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:39,790
where our goal is at least creating a
high quality system of non vulnerable

639
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:40,624
support.

640
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,830
And that's a fancy way of saying no matter
where you land in the u s you should

641
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:48,760
not be without a resource that can
support you understanding where and how to

642
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:52,360
rebuild your professional career.
And so this is sort of the phase we're in.

643
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,670
While we've done that though,
and because of the data,

644
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,710
what we have is a large body of
information on licensing and relicensing.

645
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,790
What are the barriers? Whose
relicensing? How easily?

646
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:07,630
Because remember for professions
like doctors, dentists,
lawyers, civil engineers,

647
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,720
there's,
and it's governed by state.

648
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,750
It's not even a national policy that
where you land in the u s may predict the

649
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:19,660
ease with which you can relicense.
And so I think for us,

650
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:24,040
this first turn of the wheel is about
getting what we have into the system in a

651
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:27,970
way that is not vulnerable and ubiquitous
and to be able to collect the data on

652
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:29,950
it.
And the second turn of the wheel,

653
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:34,560
it would be optimizing for
understanding the policies around um,

654
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,300
certification.
So who's getting jobs,

655
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:42,230
who needs to recertify and if they are
an in demand fields where certification

656
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:47,120
is necessary, what and how is most
helping them obtain those certifications?

657
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,070
In some cases it's financial support.

658
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:53,750
They don't have the $800 to
take a Coursera course. Again,

659
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,510
we're being supported by
Google to sort of fix that gap.

660
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,090
In some cases it's a
little more sophisticated.

661
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,050
It's just simply a very long
arduous process to recertify.

662
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,860
And there's not necessarily a benefit
to the recertification is that the

663
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:11,600
professional bodies that govern
these industries stand in the way.

664
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,400
So a very classic example, not to throw
the physician's assistants under the bus,

665
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,080
but a doctor could easily apply their
training in their home country to become a

666
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:24,560
physician assistant in the u s where
the four years that somebody with no

667
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:26,660
medical training would need should,
could be shortened.

668
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,150
But the physician assistant,
um,

669
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,860
professional industry group holds tight
that none of that previous medical

670
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:37,460
experience training or experience can
apply towards efficiency physician

671
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:40,580
assistant degree.
And they're hopefully over time our data,

672
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:45,000
we'll help if there's a movement in the
advocacy world, um, to be pushing for,

673
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,100
for relicensing barriers,
um, to be lowered. For me,

674
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,970
it would be that wherever somebody
has a skill that can contribute to the

675
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:53,804
economy,

676
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,590
we're not letting an issue of their
ability to compete stand in the way and

677
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:01,040
we're not letting an issue of financial
resources to obtain the proper licensing

678
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:04,010
stand in the way. If, if
I could just respond to,

679
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:08,540
I would respond to it a little bit
more broadly about resettlement. Right.

680
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:12,950
It's also about integration and
I can't emphasize that enough.

681
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:18,250
So what Nikki's addressing is something
much more as a systematic response

682
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,430
overall.
Right.

683
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,880
The resettlement agencies may get some
people certified because some of the

684
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:29,930
volunteers or support groups may
have that extra money to do this,

685
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:33,920
but she doesn't want it
to be something ad hoc.

686
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:38,880
She wants us to be something systematic
that people have. But the arc,

687
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:43,860
the, the trajectory that the resettlement
agencies have is the longterm,

688
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:48,800
which is, we've seen refugees and
immigrant communities over a longterm.

689
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:53,780
So I always say to refugees
yesterday was bad. Today may be bad,

690
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:58,580
but tomorrow will be better is that
idea of the improvement is gradual,

691
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:01,640
but it happens and they definitely
see it with their families.

692
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:06,641
But not letting people be isolated is so
critical because America will suffer if

693
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:13,130
we make people afraid and isolated and
we're seeing back and countries in Europe

694
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:18,080
and the reason we don't have
those problems is we have
absorbed people well for

695
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:22,040
hundreds of years. We shouldn't
be afraid of absorbing people.

696
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,810
Well, thank you. Thanks.

697
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,680
I would guess that like,

698
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,830
okay,

699
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,170
the more time people spend
languishing in refugee camps,

700
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:38,290
like probably the worst it is for
their eventual outcomes. Is that,

701
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,970
is that something you've
seen from the evidence?

702
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,730
Yeah. Particularly the older they
are when their journey starts.

703
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,170
So young people do better.

704
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:50,650
We've seen young folks complete university
pre or during even refugee camp,

705
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,930
um,
time in a refugee camp and then come out.

706
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,890
And because there is still young companies
will take a chance on them. Those,

707
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,810
our experience and our data,
I'm talking,

708
00:44:59,811 --> 00:45:03,680
you can probably talking about the field
in general is that we've seen the older

709
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:05,990
they are, when they get in a refugee
camp in the longer they stay there.

710
00:45:05,991 --> 00:45:09,050
It is indeed harder when they get out.
That's what we've experienced.

711
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,570
Is that the question?
Where are you going to add something else?

712
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,360
So, so, um,

713
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:19,720
there are more and more programs overseas
that we call livelihoods programs.

714
00:45:19,721 --> 00:45:24,220
I mean, people need, people are
so anxious even psychologically.

715
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,560
So imagine if you're in a,
not just a camp,

716
00:45:26,561 --> 00:45:31,561
but even a city where you're
just a welfare recipient
and you just want to be in

717
00:45:33,611 --> 00:45:38,020
control of your life and your family.
You want a chance at a skill,

718
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,460
at a job,
at something.

719
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:44,461
And Actually Google supports a lot of
workforce livelihood programs all around

720
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:47,800
the world. Um, my organization,

721
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:52,801
even in a program in Israel for minorities
in that country has a Google support.

722
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:59,341
But it's so important for people even
psychologically to feel they have a skill

723
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:00,971
to have a chance,

724
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:05,971
but the need is so much greater than
the resources out there to give people

725
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:10,810
either the skills or the jobs
that they need. But you're right.

726
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:13,960
And adolescence are
particularly vulnerable, right?

727
00:46:13,961 --> 00:46:17,290
Because they're growing up in this vacuum.

728
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:21,100
And that's so scary
because idle adolescence,

729
00:46:21,101 --> 00:46:23,310
even in our own homes aren't a good thing.

730
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:27,360
Can you imagine in that kind of
environment? Yeah. Thank you for that.

731
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,910
They're right. Or young adults. Hmm.

732
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,790
I just want to say thank you because
your outlook on this is very positive and

733
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:38,310
that's a great narrative that actually
as someone who's worked with adolescent

734
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:40,620
refugees, that's pretty dire. Um,

735
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,360
obviously there's like a lot that can
be done with the data and technology and

736
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:47,520
sort of the idea of building
resumes and all of this.

737
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:50,370
But I wanted to touch a little bit more
again on what you're talking about in

738
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:54,120
terms of networking and stuff because I
feel like even for people born here and

739
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:56,700
everything, that's a huge issue
and barrier to getting jobs.

740
00:46:56,701 --> 00:47:00,750
And if you could go a little bit more
into the work that you do and potentially

741
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,800
the more work that could be done in
terms of working with the refugees,

742
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:09,270
integrating, creating networking
opportunities for them. Because yeah,

743
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:13,740
you can be the best qualified person and
to have a spic and span resume and if

744
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:15,420
you don't know the right people,
it's just not going to happen.

745
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,320
Yeah. Yeah. I mean I'll,

746
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:20,910
I'll talk about two things there.

747
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,010
One is just teaching

748
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:26,200
again,

749
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,400
the gap in the system is helping newcomers
understand networking is necessary.

750
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,420
That it's a part of how we look for jobs
and we do it outside of our family or

751
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:38,170
our immediate community. So in other
cultures, networking might happen,

752
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:41,590
but it might happen in a little bit
more of a its family or its immediate

753
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:44,440
community.
So education is a piece of the puzzle,

754
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,740
just that it's done getting
people comfortable with doing it.

755
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:51,480
Any U s with us expectations.
Um,

756
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,910
two is the use of linkedin from an
educational standpoint. So again,

757
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:58,030
I mean we just do training on how to
use linkedin. How did you your profile,

758
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:01,750
how to optimize your profile.
Linkedin helps us with that. Um,

759
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,820
I think the third about networks is um,

760
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,510
a little bit more of the systematic too
when we see sort of like how are you

761
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:14,440
going to get people hooked in?
And so I think two things.

762
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:17,500
I think that there's a systematic response
and I think there's a community or

763
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:20,470
movement response.
The systematic response would be,

764
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:25,300
wouldn't it be great if the resettlement
system could get everybody on linkedin

765
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:27,340
profile as they're starting?
Right.

766
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:30,940
And I think the badging movement
might start to help similarly,

767
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:35,470
but in the same way you have
to have communities that
are opening their arms and

768
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:39,940
saying, we're here to help. It's got to
be a community or movement type response.

769
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:44,440
And I actually do think you see that
response companies were very engaged after

770
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:48,430
the refugee crisis here and in some cases
internationally about saying how can

771
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:49,264
we help?

772
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,650
And I think that idea that you're
actually extending a hand specifically as

773
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:57,310
social capital, um, first and helping
them understand what's expected,

774
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:01,600
but then in extending social capital,
um, and I know it's exactly as you say,

775
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,330
it's not technology.
Um,

776
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,860
it is the part of the work that still
has to be done because it's values based.

777
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:09,820
It's what we believe
is sort of right to do.

778
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:14,821
And because we're acting as communities
that are better being compassionate as

779
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:19,831
well as sort of a thoughtful about
economic integration and its benefits.

780
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,880
I don't know if you want to add to that.

781
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,930
So, so tell me the emphasis
of your question again.

782
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:29,000
Um, just the idea of how
you can take this. It's,

783
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:33,490
it's almost the most ephemeral part of
getting someone to jog in the u s and you

784
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:36,790
can't just figure, there's no
specific process to it. But when you,

785
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:40,360
even no matter how you try in terms of
networking and helping people with jobs

786
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:40,661
that way,

787
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:45,661
given so much of success in terms of
hiring and all of that is driven by that

788
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:46,594
very element.

789
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:51,790
So I think maybe Nicki was alluding to
it when she said the community response.

790
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:55,120
But living in New York,

791
00:49:55,121 --> 00:50:00,121
you really see these themes of different
communities that have specific jobs.

792
00:50:01,361 --> 00:50:05,020
So the superintendents are,
I don't want to say these things,

793
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:09,580
but are from a certain ethnic group or
the people who work in places that you

794
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:12,010
know, might be in the, um,

795
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,290
gas places or from a soap.
People talk to each other. Um,

796
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:21,730
technology, social media has helped.
WHATSAPP really helps, you know,

797
00:50:21,731 --> 00:50:25,090
an organization's
humanitarian organizations,

798
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:27,070
resettlement agencies like IRC,

799
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,260
trying to work very hard and
using technology to really
help people in terms of

800
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:37,820
locating jobs, helping people
in many, many creative ways.

801
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,630
But I think people really,
so the,

802
00:50:40,631 --> 00:50:44,780
the really neat things is refugees and
immigrants are resourceful and they're so

803
00:50:44,781 --> 00:50:47,480
smart and they know how
to survive and succeed.

804
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,920
We just have to be careful that they're
not so afraid to be here. Right.

805
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:54,440
Like and so that they don't turn inward,

806
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,880
but that they go ahead and embrace
the challenges that are out there.

807
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,730
I don't know if I answered you,
but I think

808
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,880
they create dairy.

809
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:06,660
There's a whole other question about
empathy from non from the existing

810
00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:09,890
communities here, but that's for
a huge though. I have to say it.

811
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:12,620
Yes.
I would say on the positive side,

812
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,920
so all the agencies that do this work
and definitely the resettlement agencies,

813
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:22,700
but I'm guessing even the agencies
that go beyond resettlement,

814
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,140
the the,

815
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:29,620
the amount of support that the American
people gave with their hands and feet in

816
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:34,340
terms of volunteers and with
their pockets in terms of money,

817
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,920
when the rhetoric is ramping up,

818
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:41,510
the support systems for
refugees really are amazing.

819
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,110
They're just not aware of it
because it doesn't get pressed.

820
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:48,530
They just keep hearing all the bad
stuff. But in America, the protections,

821
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:52,070
the support systems, the,
it's, it's incredible.

822
00:51:52,071 --> 00:51:57,071
The goodwill of of America
towards these individuals I think.

823
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,850
Thank you.
I hope you're at

824
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,270
hi. Hi. Hi.

825
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,460
Do you have hard or soft data on what
employers find are the challenges in terms

826
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:12,790
of considering refugees or immigrants
into bringing them into their

827
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:13,624
organizations?

828
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,130
And is that something that you've been
able to kind of write down or you know,

829
00:52:18,131 --> 00:52:21,850
is that found in a certain location in
terms of what challenges on the employer

830
00:52:21,851 --> 00:52:26,140
side. Yeah. Um, and do
you have any denial? Okay,

831
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:31,250
sure. Yeah, I mean on the, and to your
question about harder stuff, data,

832
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:35,240
it's been soft until now. We just did
the first sort of official report.

833
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:38,030
Oliver Wyman actually did like a
third party report on it first.

834
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,590
That's embargoed for a couple more weeks.

835
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:42,530
But I can give you some
headlines to what we,

836
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:45,350
we thought was going to be there
and that we've heard over the years.

837
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:49,160
One is that it's very hard to take an
alternative candidate and advocate for

838
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:49,400
them.

839
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,140
There's risk involved in that as an HR
manager and even sometimes as an employee

840
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:57,920
who's advocating for a candidate.
So that gap at the top of the resume,

841
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:02,390
that education, there's no us
professional experience on the resume.

842
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:06,560
So making a case for that
candidate feels risky. And in fact,

843
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:10,460
one of the things that we've experimented
with significantly over the years is

844
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:15,550
pushing for contract work and measuring
how much of our contract work turns into

845
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:18,320
full time work for our job seekers.

846
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:23,180
And so we've seen about a 69% conversion
rate over the years from contract to

847
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:24,020
full time.

848
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:29,410
And that's because people perceive
lower risk with timebound contract work.

849
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,460
And so that risk perception is very high.

850
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:36,240
And getting somebody who feels safe
bringing an alternative candidate and,

851
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:38,070
and making a case for
them and probably feels,

852
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,400
say failing right at having
somebody fully integrate.

853
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:46,630
Then the practical challenge of it after
that I think really has to do with a

854
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:49,500
culturation and mentorship. So, um,

855
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,230
is there a culture of
mentorship within a company?

856
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,860
We've found where there's a real culture
of mentorship, they do a lot better.

857
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,060
We've also found that companies that
have a lot of internationally trained

858
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:04,140
people at the top, just, it's
not, the accent's not a problem.

859
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:05,830
The fact that like they're in there,

860
00:54:05,831 --> 00:54:08,430
it gets spelled wrong and
emails is not a problem. Like,

861
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:11,730
what may be my mother's an
English teacher. I mean,

862
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:16,110
even when I say confusing
there with their, I'm like,
my anxiety rises. Right? Um,

863
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,940
but you know,
we work with a major bank,

864
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:22,500
they're an international bank and
they hire, they hire folks like crazy.

865
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,680
The crazy, um, because it's just
not, those things are different.

866
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:29,940
And the culture of mentorship is very
strong there. I think on the true side,

867
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:35,130
communication and acculturation is a
long and in some cases, slow process.

868
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:40,430
And so I think where we've seen employers
tell us they're struggling is like the

869
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:44,810
job seekers in, but they're not
doing particularly well, right.

870
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:47,400
In advancing their staying right there.

871
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,600
And so it's because they don't understand
the nuance of managing up or they

872
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:55,890
don't understand the
nuance of communications or
because more communications

873
00:54:55,891 --> 00:55:00,120
have to be done remotely and it's just
not been a long enough time or they're

874
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:04,170
not coming along fast enough. And
that's just a reality. Um, so, you know,

875
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,060
part of,
as we've grown,

876
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:11,061
what we've done is to put more in our
resources for both companies and for the

877
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:14,070
immigrants once they have
their job. Right. Okay, great.

878
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:17,220
So there are resources for now
what we're trying, right? Yeah.

879
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:21,420
So we're a smaller organization, so
it was worth, exactly. Well, you know,

880
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:23,730
we've got 5,000 alumni now.
Um,

881
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,460
and we're like adding them at
a clip about a thousand a year.

882
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,460
And that's when we were sort of like,
oh, we have a new problem. We've got,

883
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,350
we've got alumni who have
to succeed in order to

884
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:36,200
for uh, you know, make way for the
those coming in. Okay. Yeah. Um, I,

885
00:55:36,201 --> 00:55:38,090
I think some of what Nicky talked about,

886
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:40,760
it's also true for American born correct.

887
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,750
People who are struggling in,
in these survival jobs.

888
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,300
I would just say from a
resettlement perspective,

889
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,700
I think the mentoring is very important,

890
00:55:49,701 --> 00:55:54,701
but many resettlement agencies try to
work with companies or employers that will

891
00:55:55,761 --> 00:55:59,960
accept a liaison for a period to
make sure there aren't any problems.

892
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:04,910
And a lot of employers would like to have
somebody to go to and talk about these

893
00:56:04,911 --> 00:56:05,211
things.

894
00:56:05,211 --> 00:56:09,380
And then you bring in people who may
be somebodies wearing hijab or somebody

895
00:56:09,381 --> 00:56:14,030
wants to go to pray. And for these
communities, it's nice to have other,

896
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,380
you know,

897
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,280
people from their parts of the world at
that same place so that they're not the

898
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:20,930
only ones there.
But

899
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:26,710
are there resources to help up those
liaisons between the four companies and

900
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:30,010
stuff like that or, or is that something
that companies define for themselves?

901
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:34,000
How does that, go ahead. We do that
in a very bespoke way right now.

902
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,130
So like that is part of,
so as we've,

903
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,000
as we've evolved our model to kind of
be technology enabled and scalable,

904
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:42,970
we focus first on the job seeker side
of this and then we still sort of do

905
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:45,520
custom custom stuff like
that with our companies.

906
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:49,180
Whereas like the second turn the wheels
about enabling companies to have a

907
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:54,181
playbook and or resources that would do
training internally like cross cultural

908
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:58,030
training for those who are going to
play that kind of a liaison for all.

909
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:03,670
So then the newcomers and refugees in
particular the resettlement agencies,

910
00:57:03,731 --> 00:57:05,800
very often we'll try to do this.

911
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,050
And also the whole push for take your
first job so you'd have some record of

912
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:15,850
having that job. Showing up to work to us
is so important in the beginning. Right.

913
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:19,570
It's a very different place than
by the time Nikki may see them.

914
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:24,610
I guess just kind of allude to what we
were just talking about when you were

915
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:29,611
mentioning the a page resume with the
details that then interviewer cannot

916
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,060
legally ask about it.

917
00:57:33,061 --> 00:57:38,061
It makes me wonder because I am the child
of Italian immigrants and either now I

918
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:44,461
sometimes have a difficult time explaining
to them how certain things work here

919
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:52,170
even as opposed to my
previous job. Google. Huh.

920
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:56,010
Slow ramp up in comparison.

921
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:01,430
Other software firms that
I've worked for the past.

922
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:06,970
So my question is how difficult is it to
teach the people that the job seekers,

923
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:17,200
how different America American customs
about regarding employment are and how

924
00:58:19,461 --> 00:58:22,430
difficult is it for that
information to be retained?

925
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,750
I'm not sure how else to explain it.

926
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:32,560
Yeah, well adults are
experiential learners. Um,

927
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:33,820
and so when we said,
you know,

928
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:38,470
we tried to make as much available online
that they can be self paced in and use

929
00:58:38,471 --> 00:58:41,950
the time that we have with the humans
that we have to raise money for pay to

930
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,840
practice. Um, and in fact,

931
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:47,950
many of the things that we practice
are the things that feel unnatural. Um,

932
00:58:47,951 --> 00:58:52,870
so like you said, Italians
and I'm speaking as one. Um,

933
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:55,360
right.
Like if we were coming over from Italy,

934
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:58,360
perhaps the ways in which we
would approach your job search,

935
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,960
we would have to tell him some
things down and some things up.

936
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,620
And those are the things that we spend
time practicing because we found,

937
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:10,420
and it is largely documented
that adults learn by doing. Um,

938
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:14,140
so where we, we did a lot of
information sharing, you know,

939
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,100
through online learning.
We spend a lot of our in-person,

940
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,040
human resource time on the practice
in order to ingrain those behaviors.

941
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,920
And in fact we continue to try to use
and are looking forward to using more

942
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:28,490
technology that gives positive
feedback when the right behaviors are

943
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:32,180
demonstrated. Um, so when
you say how hard is it,

944
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,270
it does also become a
very individual thing.

945
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:40,630
I've seen 67 year old engineers come to
the u s and just decide they get it and

946
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:46,620
they're going to do it. Um,
and, and they have job. Um,

947
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:51,410
and I've seen younger, I've seen a 30
year old or rocking man, you know, just,

948
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,650
he's not in his face as
he's, he's, uh, you know,

949
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,800
usually a refugee and,
and they're struggling.

950
00:59:57,801 --> 00:59:59,960
They're struggling with the culturation.
It's not their moment.

951
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:02,450
And I've seen them take a
very long time in the program.

952
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:06,770
They're simply not ready yet to sort
of accept that this is the way it is or

953
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:11,730
something like that. So I would hate to
make generalizations based on age. Um,

954
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,130
I tend to think it's about where we
need people in their journey or in their

955
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:18,590
process, but that it is always, for me,

956
01:00:18,591 --> 01:00:22,070
what I've seen is practice and time
on task rentals, yields, results.

957
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,800
And then when, when you, uh,

958
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:31,070
you are also talking about automated
tools, you're building work.

959
01:00:31,071 --> 01:00:32,330
The rest of my builder,

960
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:38,560
like somebody give some arrests made
with their religious affiliation on it.

961
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:44,260
You have to say you can't have that
on American resume and you got some

962
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:49,931
different because now you're not really
doing anything personal with them

963
01:00:50,391 --> 01:00:51,230
directly.

964
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,760
How do you deal with that scenario?

965
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,680
Best of online learning is my
response and then an advisor.

966
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:02,500
So they do have like a horn,

967
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,600
like online learning can
really know it's interactive.

968
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,430
They see a person come on and they say,
look,

969
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:11,770
in the U s we tend not to share
personal information, you know are,

970
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:16,070
this is what a a US resume would look
like. And then we have like a help line.

971
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:18,620
So if somebody is not
progressing in their training,

972
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:23,420
we get a notification they stopped and
we then use part of our helpline capacity

973
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:27,410
to understand why they stopped.
And if it's that, you know, again,

974
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:30,170
they're not trusting, they need
to hear human voice for a second.

975
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:33,110
We've had that happen. I had somebody
who, he told me, he was like,

976
01:01:33,111 --> 01:01:37,820
you guys don't know what you're talking
about. I even remember his summary.

977
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:42,620
There was a he, he wrote, and I don't
know where it went wrong in a translation,

978
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:47,480
but his lead in was, I'm an
awkward leader. Um, and I
tried desperately to say,

979
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:49,520
you know,
the pictures got to come off and awkward.

980
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:52,760
I think we're going for a different
word here. Any of, you know,

981
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,870
if he didn't get a response in the job
market and he came back a couple of weeks

982
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,180
later and few successful.

983
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:00,690
Thank you.

984
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:06,540
Are there any more questions,
if not,

985
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,710
just one of the things.
Okay.

986
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:16,140
[inaudible].
