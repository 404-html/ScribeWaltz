1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,930
So please welcome to Google Detroit.
Mrs Kristi hedges.

2
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,350
Well, thank you again for
joining us. We appreciate it. Um,

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,090
I mentioned in the Bio Intro, um, so
you wrote a book previously called, um,

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,290
the power of presence, right? And this
book is called the inspiration code. Um,

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,520
are you able to kind of kick things off
by just telling us a little bit about

6
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:29,840
how those two things are?

7
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:32,630
Those two books are similar and
perhaps how they're different, right.

8
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,850
Presence versus inspiration,
they tied together,

9
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:36,470
but there's obviously
differences between them.

10
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:38,600
Maybe kick things off with
that and we'll go from there.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,760
Yeah, sure. So what, well, let me start by
saying how I ended up writing this book.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,800
That's a little bit, that's how they're,
they're kind of tied together. Sure. Uh,

13
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:49,620
so I wrote the power of presence
and came out in 2011. Uh,

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,140
and that's really a book about influence.

15
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:55,540
How do we use our presence to
influence situations around us? Uh,

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,190
and as I was out talking
to groups about that,

17
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:02,000
I would start by asking them the simple
question to come warm up the audience a

18
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,060
little bit. It get people
talking. Uh, and that was, uh,

19
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,980
who inspires you and what did they do?

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,600
And I was trying to map those answers
and those characteristics back to people

21
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:14,240
who had presence and make this
real life connection for people.

22
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,820
What would I notice when
I asked that question?

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,270
A pretty immediately was no
matter how tired people were,

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,860
maybe it's the day after a holiday
weekend or something like that. Uh,

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,330
when they would start talking about
these people who inspired them,

26
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:29,840
their faces would light up and there
be all this animation and energy in the

27
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:34,790
room and people would be literally
transformed energetically in front of me.

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,270
Uh, and that happened again
and again and again and again.

29
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:42,300
And people would talk as part of the
exercise about what these people did. Uh,

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,240
and I noticed that they communicated in
certain ways, uh, that inspired people.

31
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,370
I mean, to even remember things
and you guys have them now.

32
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:52,640
Somebody said something to you that just
hits you, just write and those words,

33
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:53,680
you carry them around and you,

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,240
you use them when you need them
and they and fortify you when you,

35
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,270
you sort of need guidance and all
those kinds of good things. Uh,

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,540
and I just started writing
down what did these people do?

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,800
And I found that these patterns
just emerged again and again. Uh,

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,130
and that led me to put them together in a,
in the inspiration code.

39
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,350
Uh,
but as I looked at those,

40
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:15,800
because I was usually there speaking
to groups to talk about presence.

41
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:20,540
So talk about influence, which is
really important. Uh, but what we, um,

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,890
in leadership development programs,

43
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:25,640
we often rely so much on influence that
we leave out this other piece about

44
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:29,730
engagement, which is inspiration.
Uh, and if you think about that,

45
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,450
we need both of them as leaders,
but they go hand in hand. I mean,

46
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:36,380
none of us go home after a day of work
and say, I still did a great day to day.

47
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:40,460
I was influenced all day long. Right?
I mean, that, it feels different.

48
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,880
Influence has done to us, but we would
go home and say, I was so inspired today.

49
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:46,700
I had a great day. Uh,
inspiration comes from within.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,960
So I really wanted to figure out how to
create those feelings in people in the

51
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,580
workplace because we need more of it.

52
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,863
Yeah,
absolutely.

53
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,830
You so one of the really interesting
things that I read about in the book is

54
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:00,580
this kind of the influence of listening,
right?

55
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,360
So we talk about inspiration and when
you think about an inspirational person

56
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:08,020
person, you think of a great speaker
or somebody with presence, right?

57
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,430
Uh,

58
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,560
one of the things that you mentioned that
was one of the most cited behaviors of

59
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,680
somebody who is inspiring
is the ability to listen.

60
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,530
Can you talk a little bit more about
that? It seems like a simple thing, right?

61
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,120
And listening,
everyone should be able to do it,

62
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,760
but it's not really that
easy of a concept to handle.

63
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,380
A lot of people aren't good at listening.

64
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,390
And you talk about how listening kind of
plays into inspiration and also how we

65
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,810
can work on becoming better listeners in
order to be more aspirational with the

66
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:32,644
folks that we lead.

67
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,820
Yeah, that was a surprise to me. So
as part of the research that I did,

68
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:39,660
I also did a quantitative research that
I commissioned on my own and I looked at

69
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:43,200
what are the behaviors that were
most impactful to people in terms of

70
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:46,100
inspiration. And the number
one behavior was listening. Uh,

71
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,330
and I also heard in these discussions,

72
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,110
people would say that person was there
for me. Uh, they made time for me.

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,620
They were focused on me. Uh, that
came up again and again and again.

74
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:58,650
So it was clear that there was just
something magical about when somebody

75
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:01,980
creates a space for us, uh,
through strong listening skills.

76
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,120
So whether you're in sales or
whether you're leading teams, uh,

77
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,420
when we listen to people,
it's a sign of respect for their opinion.

78
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:13,920
It's a sign that we care. Uh,
there is a, a great quote that, uh,

79
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,810
the currency of love is time and I
would say the currency of respect his

80
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:22,650
attention. Uh, so when we give people
our attention, it feels different,

81
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:24,930
but we're not very good
listeners as a group, right?

82
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,930
We learned to listen quick and listen
halfway so we can get done what we need to

83
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:30,330
get done. And that's why would
somebody really listens to us.

84
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:33,060
It's sort of like the record skips
and it just feels quite different.

85
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,260
Yeah. And I think another concept you
talked about too is authenticity, right?

86
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,840
We've all encountered leaders who
most likely read a leadership book,

87
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,410
uh, and that's pretty much it, but
there's no authenticity to it, right?

88
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,250
Because they're just kind of spitting
back something that they read about, uh,

89
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,000
you know, being a powerful speaker or
giving someone a strong handshake, right?

90
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,790
That doesn't necessarily
equate to authentic leadership.

91
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,920
It's just something they read
about and look at in a book.

92
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:01,970
And I think listening is
one of those aspects, uh,

93
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,100
that actually conveys
authenticity. Right. Um,

94
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,290
can you talk about this kind of
concept of authenticity as well?

95
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,730
Not just reading a book about leadership
and kind of spitting it back to your

96
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,550
employees, but how you actually
could become an authentic leader.

97
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,310
In addition to kind of the,
the listening that we talked about,

98
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:21,690
some other concepts around that.

99
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,390
Yeah, well me listening, I
mean authenticity really is a,

100
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:29,620
it's about trust when it comes down to us,
you know, we trust people who are real.

101
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:32,940
So if we don't feel like we
actually know someone, then it's,

102
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,660
it's very difficult for us
to really invest in them. Um,

103
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,760
but authenticity is tricky at work, right?
People can be too authentic as well.

104
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,610
So just trying to figure out
what that fine line is of uh,

105
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,370
your authentic enough so that we know
you. Uh, and yet you're also, you know,

106
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,310
aware of your surroundings and what,
and what the situation will support. Uh,

107
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:54,910
and so, uh, with authenticity, what I will
often will tell people is that, you know,

108
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:56,650
we have to,
it really has to start within you.

109
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:59,120
Like what is your intention for
what you want to get across?

110
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:03,680
And I'm being very clear about what
I call your personal presence brand,

111
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,530
which is really your values were on
the outside. How do I want to show up?

112
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,900
How do I want people to perceive me?

113
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,840
How do I want to show
what's most important to me?

114
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:13,730
If you're very clear about that going in,

115
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:16,980
then you're much more likely for that to
come out in an authentic way because it,

116
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:20,860
it really is about the core of who
you want to be in that situation. Uh,

117
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,630
but situational awareness matters too.

118
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:26,300
So also knowing what those,

119
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,300
the room will support because sometimes
we get into to ed needed too much

120
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,010
information. The TMI situation where, wow,

121
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,730
your authenticity is screaming at me
and everyone kind of back it back up.

122
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,560
When we talk about, um, TMI, uh,

123
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,730
sometimes emotion comes
into the discussion as well.

124
00:06:41,731 --> 00:06:46,080
And in terms of leadership and
authenticity, um, Google is,

125
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,250
is known for kind of coming up with
this concept of search inside yourself,

126
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,820
which is this concept based
on of mindfulness and emotion,

127
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
uh, within the workplace. And, um,

128
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,270
not a lot of companies were
really thinking about this. Like,

129
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:03,360
how does this play into kind of
the ecosystem of the workplace?

130
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,320
But I think it's kind of a core emotion
as it is a core aspect of leadership

131
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:10,350
that a lot of folks don't
necessarily grasp. How do you,

132
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,790
how do you tie emotion into
leadership without being unauthentic?

133
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,050
How do you do it in a way that,
um,

134
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,400
kind of displays a sincerity?

135
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,830
Like you talk a little bit about kind
of the importance of mindfulness or

136
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,580
emotion within kind of the,
the aspects of leadership.

137
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,780
Yeah. Well, the, uh, you know, I just
wrote a piece for Harvard Business Review,

138
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:35,750
which is a believable, I online this week
hard, go ahead, get emotional at work. Uh,

139
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,190
and,
uh,

140
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,820
and the idea was the fact
that in my world with,

141
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:44,530
with coaching and leaders that I coach,

142
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,990
it's not the people who bring it too
much emotion and they're not bringing

143
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:49,720
enough emotion. And, uh, and you know,

144
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:54,100
emotion is really a signal for us as a
trigger to understand really what you

145
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:57,580
care about. So if a leader comes in and
they're overly stoic, you know, it's,

146
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,890
it was like a, what's there,
knock, knock, knock, you know,

147
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:03,130
you're looking for what the,
what the real story is. Uh,

148
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:05,900
and so emotion is actually something
we want to be very strategic about as

149
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,950
leaders because if we want people to
feel something, we have to bring in.

150
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,860
So if I want people to get excited,
I have to bring excitement into a room.

151
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,190
If I want people to feel serious,
I have to bring series as into a room.

152
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,080
So knowing what emotion you're trying to
impart and instead of trying to either

153
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,980
have it be an afterthought to make
it really important part of your

154
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,960
communication is really what that's about.

155
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:29,800
So it's a knowing what that emotion is
and then being willing to put it out

156
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:34,030
there. And, uh, instead of,
you know, a lot of us can have
come up through the ranks,

157
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,540
uh, learning that we want
to be unemotional at work.
We don't want to show,

158
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,190
we want to be always stoic,
you know,

159
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:42,070
have the same demeanor no
matter what people throw at us.

160
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,480
And as an individual contributor, we get
rewarded for that. Uh, and we're told,

161
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:49,180
oh gosh, you can give Jason
anything. He's going to, you know,

162
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,050
he's always has a smile on
his face no matter what you
dump on his lap. Right? Uh,

163
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,040
and then you get to be a leader and that
doesn't work so well anymore because

164
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:00,390
you have to use emotion to get people
excited to make them feel something. And,

165
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,920
and being able to actually think about,
oh gosh,

166
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,940
how should I be emotional at work versus
not having emotion to be something that

167
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:06,950
we really think about.

168
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,050
Yeah. I feel like we sometimes it Google
and counter the opposite of that as well

169
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,180
though, where when you're
an individual contributor,

170
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,840
then individual contributor or
you're newer to the company company,

171
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,210
you bring more emotion,
right? You're like, okay,

172
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm me Google.
This is exciting.

173
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,480
People are more emotional.

174
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:23,940
They're more emotional in their
interactions with their managers.

175
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,390
But then as you progress and you
become part of the leadership team,

176
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:30,240
maybe you're a manager or you
manage a team or you're a director,

177
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,200
you feel like you have to be more serious
and more stoic and you actually remove

178
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:39,090
the emotion because you want to be
respected and authoritative versus,

179
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,700
you know, an individual contributor
that's a little bit more free and open.

180
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,530
You see that as well as being kind
of a concept that comes up across in

181
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,210
inspiration where when folks get
into a position of leadership,

182
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:51,960
they actually lose some of those traits
of a good leader because they feel they

183
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:55,710
have to based on maybe an antiquated
vision of what a leader is.

184
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,410
Yeah. Well exactly right. And that's what,

185
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:00,490
I love that example where people come
in and they're like all gung Ho. Sure.

186
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,980
As a leader like that. Exactly. Yeah.

187
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,420
I guess we don't want our leaders have
excited. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Uh, and,

188
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,660
and you know, it's kind of funny
as we talk about it, but you,

189
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:12,860
you see that play out. There's,
you know, as you say that it just,

190
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:16,020
it makes me think about how
we think about, we quit joy,

191
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,970
a joyfulness at work with
naivete. Sure. Uh, and,

192
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:23,420
and that doesn't serve us
very well because wouldn't
it be great to have leaders

193
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:27,110
who were actually joyful about the
work that they did versus coming in and

194
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:31,190
feeling like it's a grind every day,
uh, that, that doesn't inspire anybody.

195
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,920
So, uh, it's, it's really thinking, again,

196
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:36,620
we don't think about things on
an emotional plane very much,

197
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:39,170
but if you just think about
it as a leader, you know,

198
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,860
and play around with the idea of motion
as being a critical part of how you

199
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:46,550
communicate. That opens up a lot that
maybe we don't even think we have.

200
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,710
Sure. Can you talk kind of
tying that topic together too?

201
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:54,080
So your book talks a lot
about inspiring others. Um,

202
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,350
can you maybe kind of turn that inward
a bit and talk about how leaders,

203
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:00,450
so folks here in the room,
folks that are watching,

204
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,230
who are in positions of
influence or leadership,

205
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,850
how they can inspire themselves
from a leadership perspective,

206
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:09,684
how can they,

207
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,630
if maybe they're one of these more
stoic leaders and then something just,

208
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,540
you know, the, the last comment you made
something snapped in the, is it they wait,

209
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,740
I'm one of these stoic leaders,

210
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,390
how can I inspire myself to be a
little bit more joyful, more mindful,

211
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:22,380
more emotional work?

212
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,310
What are some practices or ways that
folks who are in a position of leadership

213
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,780
can,
can inspire themselves?

214
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,920
Well, everything that a
I wrote in the book, uh,

215
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,310
that as far as other people also
inspires you. And I'll be honest,

216
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,990
that didn't even hit me
until the end of the book.

217
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,910
So I was writing it
and then wait a minute.

218
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,010
But we could use these
things on ourselves. Uh, and,

219
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:44,580
and that's great because that's the idea.
It's a virtuous cycle.

220
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,690
So when we inspire other people,
we also get inspired and it,

221
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:50,910
and it all plays into the same
thing. Uh, but for example,

222
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,030
one of the top ways that what we were
saying that earlier that people get

223
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:58,460
inspired is through conversation, through
communication with other people. Uh,

224
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,520
you can get inspired reading your email,
but you probably won't. Uh, it's probably,

225
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:06,100
you know, it's sitting like this
listening to other people talk.

226
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,230
I'm thinking about things.
I know you guys do a lot of that.

227
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,040
A Google bringing ideas in from the
outside just to expand your mind a little

228
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,790
bit and get you to think differently.
Uh, and, and so, you know,

229
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,550
with leaders that I've worked with, often
they'll get to a place where, you know,

230
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,590
they've achieved a great level of success,

231
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,620
but they just don't feel all that
inspired anymore about it. Uh,

232
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,080
and then I'll ask, well, who
do you talk to during the day?

233
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,440
And they talked to the same people.
They talked to their management team.

234
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:32,810
They might go out and talk to
some customers occasionally. Uh,

235
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,110
they talked to the board.
Um, whatever the case is,

236
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:38,410
but they don't actually have
any new inputs coming in. And,

237
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:42,430
and so to really go out and seek
inspiration to find people to have

238
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:45,850
conversations with two, if you don't
have any role models to find some,

239
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,960
cause they might not be
sitting around the office, uh,

240
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,600
you might have to look outward for that.

241
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,870
And to put yourself in places that just
really help you open your mind can be a

242
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:57,010
great pathway to inspiration.
Sure.

243
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,040
You speak,
obviously you're here at Google today,

244
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,380
you speak to a lot of other companies,
you speak at schools,

245
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,550
you speak at businesses.

246
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:09,130
Are there any kind of really interesting
techniques that you've absorbed from

247
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,530
speaking at these different places? Uh,
folks that are doing, I guess either a,

248
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:17,740
a really great job of inspiring
their employees or their students or,

249
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,350
or whatever it may be,
or on the flip side,

250
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,780
be doing a really poor job at doing it,

251
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:27,130
but maybe in a forceful way or an
inauthentic way as we discussed earlier?

252
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,630
Well, I'll tell you something
that, uh, that I see a lot,
so I don't want, you know,

253
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:35,980
and I'm not calling out anybody.
Yeah. Then then there you go.

254
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,170
Is that company spent a lot of money
and time on corporate mission statements

255
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,090
and corporate visions.
Uh,

256
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,490
and it's not that they don't
matter because they do matter.

257
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,560
They just don't matter enough.
Uh,

258
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,060
and they don't look at what are the
conversations that are happening every day

259
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:56,140
and organizations between managers and
their people and teams and you know,

260
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:57,460
what is the,
you know,

261
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,460
I always say like cultures are really
just stories built upon stories in the

262
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:01,261
organization.
There,

263
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:04,630
there aren't enough sort of fresh stories
getting into the mix about things that

264
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,550
are working and things that,
um,

265
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:09,700
solutions that are being overcome and
until they're really hanging their hat on

266
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,620
this beautiful mission statement,
uh,

267
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,610
and yet everybody in the organization
doesn't buy it because the culture doesn't

268
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,590
support it.
So I see a lot of that where we,

269
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,630
we look at the very high level though.

270
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:22,840
So the grand ideas of inspiration and
we've heard that you have to have a great

271
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:23,111
vision.

272
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:27,010
So we checked that box and we spent a lot
of money checking that box and then we

273
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,490
just wait for everybody's
behavior to change. Uh,

274
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,620
and it doesn't really get embedded
down to the individual level. I mean,

275
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,650
what inspires us as our day to day
interactions with people around us. Sure.

276
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,370
Uh, what are some common
mistakes people make? Uh,

277
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,010
we've talked a lot about the
positive things that people can do.

278
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:47,000
We talked about in that authenticity
is maybe I guess a mistake,

279
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:51,950
but are there other things that you
see people making on a daily, monthly,

280
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:55,750
weekly basis? Uh, mistakes
that the good leadership, uh,

281
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,840
folks that should know better or actually
making a mistake so we can kind of

282
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,110
understand and avoid learning
from past mistakes, I suppose.

283
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,450
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Well, you know,

284
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:08,090
it's one we just talked about at lunch
and I'll just bring it up because it's

285
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,840
very current. Uh, is that, uh,

286
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:15,150
one of the most inspiring conversations
a leader can have is to be in talks with

287
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:17,930
their people about their teams,
about their purpose.

288
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,010
So helping them really identify
how is your purpose for yourself.

289
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,550
I'm being played out and being supported
in the, in the position that you're in.

290
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,400
But that seems like a really great
conversation, but it doesn't have to be.

291
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,860
So just talking about
contextualized purpose,

292
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:33,020
so how does what you're doing today,

293
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,620
but just help you take a couple steps
further along in your development.

294
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:37,730
It can be that simple,

295
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,810
but often managers don't want to be in
that conversation because they'll worry.

296
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,330
That's gonna it has some, they're,
they're, they're, uh, you know,

297
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,080
team members going to have an epiphany
and then go out the door, uh, with that.

298
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,490
And so they don't want that
to happen. So like, well,

299
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,840
I'm not going to have the
purpose conversation cause
I might lose them. Uh, and,

300
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:56,180
and that's a real missed opportunity,
uh, because first of all,

301
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:58,680
we love when people engage us
in that larger question, um,

302
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,450
because we're thinking about it or we
want to be thinking about it. Sure. Uh,

303
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:05,360
and somebody creates a space for
us. It's very meaningful. Uh,

304
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:10,100
and then also often there are
things that you don't see that,

305
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,250
uh, that somebody around you might see
the can pull some threads together.

306
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,650
And help you understand that.
Let's say you're working in a,

307
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,410
in a company that's very chaotic,
um,

308
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,880
well that chaos might be really teaching
you how to manage a lot of complexity,

309
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,100
what you're going to need for
the next level of your career.

310
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,400
So somebody can help you see that all of
a sudden that chaotic environment isn't

311
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,080
a grind just to manage through every day.
It's a,

312
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:33,380
it's a huge learning opportunity and
you may not see that yourself. So being,

313
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:36,440
be willing to be in those conversations
is quite powerful and we don't have them

314
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:37,110
enough.

315
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,710
Yeah.

316
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,820
Oftentimes people want to build on the
base of what they have without analyzing

317
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:44,700
that base, right? So there's, how
can I be more inspiring? I'll do a,

318
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:47,730
B and c without fixing what
was wrong in the first place.

319
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:51,600
So we often look at how you can improve
upon what you're currently doing.

320
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,240
And then once you feel like
you've kind of fixed that base,

321
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:55,960
then you proceed with
some of the tips from,

322
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:59,850
from the book in terms of how you can
inspire the competitor yourself. Um,

323
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,290
a lot of the book talks, yeah. It
kind of in context of, uh, you know,

324
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,790
inspiring in a, in a
corporate setting. Um,

325
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,770
are there ways that you can
take a lot of these kind of, um,

326
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,490
topics and themes that apply to them
outside of the corporate world as well?

327
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,650
Yes. I mean, everything in the book, uh,
works in any environment you're in. So,

328
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,430
uh, I have found myself starting to use
these at home with my kids a lot more.

329
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,700
That's what I'm asking. Yeah. I'm

330
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,550
sorry. Uh, let me think about that.
Uh, and it's great. They do a,

331
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:32,220
and so it doesn't matter if
you're, you're trying to, I mean,

332
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:33,900
there's a lot of inspiration
going on in communities, right.

333
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:37,780
And I was on inspiration
going on in Detroit right now.
Uh, and, and so, you know,

334
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:41,490
using these kinds of ideas about
what really gets people inspired,

335
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:46,140
what lights up, lights people up. Uh, it's
any group you're, you can imagine it's,

336
00:17:46,141 --> 00:17:48,570
it's your teams at work.
It's your communities at home.

337
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:52,250
It's the schools that you're working
in a, it doesn't matter. It's,

338
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:54,330
it's the same stuff, which
is the beauty of it. Right?

339
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:57,070
I love when things will apply
at work and apply at home. Uh,

340
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:59,420
and that's really what I, I
tried to do last time. Um,

341
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,190
with the power of presence to, it doesn't
really matter where you have presence,

342
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:03,550
it's all the same result.

343
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,910
We talked a little bit right before
we hopped on stage here about, uh,

344
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,450
how inspiration can be contagious.
And we talked about the city of Detroit,

345
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,410
which were all located in right now,
uh,

346
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,330
and how Detroit has seen better days.

347
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:20,560
But what happened was there was a few
inspired individuals who started to live,

348
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:25,060
apply inspiration to certain their house,
to a neighborhood,

349
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:28,780
a street, uh, whatever it may be.
And it spread very quickly, right?

350
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:31,210
We saw this inspiration
spread very quickly. Um,

351
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,350
but I feel like that same concept, uh,
this, this took place in a major us city,

352
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:38,260
that same concept can also be
applied to the workplace, right?

353
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:41,470
So if you're in an uninspired workplace,

354
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,970
having a few individuals
that bring inspiration, that,

355
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:47,740
that learn how to be inspiring
individuals, it can catch on it.

356
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:49,050
It could be contagious as well.
Right?

357
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,000
Absolutely. And I sit here with my
Shinola watch on, right. So supporting.

358
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,570
Beautiful. Yeah. We were saying,

359
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:59,110
I've been lurking watching Detroit for
years and just rooting for Detroit and

360
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:02,680
just so inspired by what's
happening here. Uh, so,

361
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,810
so there is actually a, um,
a scientifically researched,

362
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,210
well researched,
a theory called emotional contagion.

363
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,620
And so we always sort of think about
it just in layman's terms as you know,

364
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,920
Kinda you catch somebody bad who don't
bring people down, right? Debbie Downer.

365
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:19,900
We catch people's bad moods or,
or whatever the case is,

366
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:24,340
but it's actually verifiable as humans,
we do pick up the moods of other people.

367
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,810
Uh, and we develop as groups what,
what sociologists call group aspect,

368
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:29,650
which is we kind of,

369
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,250
we kind of go towards the center of
whatever the mood is in a particular

370
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:35,200
organization.
Now,

371
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:39,850
leaders actually have more power to
shift that mood than anybody else because

372
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:43,180
people may pay more attention to leaders.
We pay attention up the hierarchy.

373
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:46,870
So if the leader is cynical,
the group's gonna feel cynical.

374
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,360
If the leader's optimistic, we're
going to feel optimistic. Uh,

375
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,600
and so absolutely it is contagious.
So,

376
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:56,170
but you need those people to come in and
be the brave ones to be the beach head

377
00:19:56,171 --> 00:20:00,240
for whatever emotion is that you're
trying to, to get people to impart a,

378
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,660
and of course there's safety in numbers,

379
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,810
so if you get a few people really
excited than that, that tends to,

380
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,900
to change the dynamic of a
much larger organization.

381
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,880
But it has to start with somebody.

382
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,400
Sure. And we talked about in the
city of Detroit, Dan Gilbert, not by,

383
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,420
by Fart, excuse me, not the only person,
but obviously one of the figureheads of,

384
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:20,370
of some positivity around Detroit.

385
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:24,390
And he instilled a lot of inspiration to
people by investing a lot of his money

386
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,420
into the city. And again, a lot of
people, when they saw that happen,

387
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,610
a lot of folks who were outside the city,

388
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:33,300
we're in the city who hadn't necessarily
invested now or investing time and

389
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,370
money to help kind of
inspire the city as well.

390
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,280
So Dan Gilbert's one that
comes to mind in Detroit.

391
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,070
Did you have any other leaders that,

392
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,980
that kind of are inspiring
to you folks that, uh,

393
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,890
it either in your hometown or
folks in your industry, uh,

394
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,310
authors that have kind of really embraced
this idea of inspiration and presence

395
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:54,100
and authenticity,
folks that have really inspired you?

396
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,330
Well, I'm in Washington DC, so lots
of inspiration there. Yeah, of course.

397
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,010
It's a lot inspiration. All guys of
the boys. Uh, it's, yeah. So, yes,

398
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:06,440
I mean I get inspired by
people all the time and a,

399
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:08,900
and I'll just tell you personally
from me right now, I'm,

400
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:13,790
I'm quite inspired by people who are
maybe 20 years further along in their

401
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:17,480
career than I am because I'm
starting to look and think, okay,

402
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:19,580
this next phase of my life.

403
00:21:19,581 --> 00:21:23,690
Like how can I be most inspiring in that
and using my talents and do the things

404
00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:27,530
that, um, that I think are going
to be important beyond myself. Uh,

405
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,310
and I'm very inspired by people
who've been there before. And,

406
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:33,670
and role modeling is just, it's such a
huge, we talked about earlier too, it,

407
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,010
it role models are inspiring to us
because they create a vicarious experience

408
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:41,030
for when we see somebody like Dan
Gilbert come in and do that, um,

409
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,550
were inspired because we see him
do something and we think, well,

410
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:48,030
I could maybe do that too. So I maybe I
can, you know, buy a whole building. Um,

411
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,930
but maybe I can put a couple of my people
in that building. Yup. Right. So we,

412
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:55,490
we make another step and then
that's what role models do for us.

413
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:59,660
So I'm really looking at, uh,
uh, people who are, you know,

414
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:04,661
have a real need and energy around being
in service and then how they're doing

415
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:08,180
that in their lives.
And so I have,

416
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:11,090
I'm lucky enough to have a couple of
people that I've sought out because they

417
00:22:11,091 --> 00:22:12,310
didn't land in my lap and I,

418
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:15,140
and I tried to spend time with
them and I see what they do. Uh,

419
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,190
and I always leave those conversations
just no, 10 feet tall and, and,

420
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,840
and we need that.
We need those people.

421
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,680
Absolutely. Um, we got
shifting topics a little bit,

422
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:27,070
but still kind of tying into what we were
just talking about is kind of the idea

423
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:27,910
of diversity,
right?

424
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:32,560
So diversity not in the sense of what
people look like or where they're from,

425
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:35,200
but the diversity of cultures,
diversity of backgrounds,

426
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:38,160
diversity of professional experiences,
uh,

427
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,190
incredibly important and a huge topic
and incredibly important for Google,

428
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,350
a huge topic in the media these days.

429
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,390
How do you kind of tie this idea of
diversity into authentic leadership and

430
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:50,830
inspiration and presence is,

431
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:54,460
is there a way to kind of tie in what
you were just mentioning bringing in

432
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:59,290
diversity from other folks and really
kind of bringing that altogether and in a

433
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,350
way that makes sense for a company
or a family or whatever it may be.

434
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,170
I don't know, but I'll, I'll try.
Yeah. Like we're all trying of course.

435
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,560
Uh, as well. Uh, the research
supports that, you know,

436
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,770
diverse organizations perform
better. Sure. Right. We know
that at the board level,

437
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:16,630
you know, throughout organizations. Uh,

438
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:20,140
I believe that the reason that that's the
case is because of the input idea that

439
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:22,060
I just talked about with the inspiration.

440
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,980
When we see things from
people's experience, it just
expands our own perspective.

441
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:30,580
It's so Weber cultural blinders we have
and you can define cultural however you

442
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:31,580
want.
Um,

443
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,230
they get widened when we see things
that we previously didn't see because

444
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:36,970
somebody else's helped us see that.

445
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,240
Like we've weathered through role modeling
or being with them or discussion or

446
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:42,280
whatever the case is. Uh, so,

447
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:46,890
so we learn a lot more people become
three when they're in front of us and,

448
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:51,350
and you know, we know them and we can,
we can understand that more. Um, we're a,

449
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:56,090
you know, a global world, you
know, it's, you know, and a
trite phrase, but it's true.

450
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,520
Like we work with people.
I work with people all over the world.

451
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,630
You guys probably do the same.
Uh,

452
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,060
and so diversity of everything
is important because it
just allows us to be in

453
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:08,060
the world and, and, uh, with
a, a broader perspective,

454
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,640
the two perspectives are huge.

455
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:12,760
Getting perspectives from different
people and countries and everything.

456
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:15,640
Culture is a huge,
huge difference maker.

457
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,710
What's one piece of advice you would give
us as Google speaking to us as Google

458
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:22,660
today in terms of inspiration?
Is there,

459
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,720
is there anything you've heard or
read that we do good or bad that could

460
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:29,870
potentially be turned into
advice that we can walk away,

461
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,150
walk away with today?

462
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,040
Well, I mean Google is known for a lot
of the things that we just talked about.

463
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:36,880
So,
uh,

464
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:40,870
you guys are lucky cause you're sitting
in organizations like that and not all

465
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:44,170
of the organizations I work
with, I can say the same, uh,

466
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:47,980
what I admire from Google from afar. So
I don't work in the company. But what I,

467
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,320
what I see is, is just the, uh, you,

468
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,920
you mentioned the word curiosity before,
but that's what I see.

469
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:58,921
I see just a hunger and a curiosity to
learn and expand and try new things.

470
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,630
Uh,
and you know,

471
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:05,620
when you have that sort of permeating
the culture, even, even today,

472
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:08,830
so we're having a Google talk
we talked about earlier of,

473
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:12,070
I said your diploma seat, right?
Because you helped put these together,

474
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:15,850
that means that you get to
learn, you know, a lot about
things that you might be,

475
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:20,340
you care about. Uh, but all Google
has that opportunity. So I think, uh,

476
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,730
having that kind of
mindset, uh, and to be, uh,

477
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,450
to be an outspoken leader and things that,
uh,

478
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,880
from a business standpoint and
the corporate community, uh,

479
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:35,470
which Google does a frequently, uh, is
inspiring to a lot of other organizations.

480
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:37,320
And you, and you see that, you see, um,

481
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,390
there are a select number of companies
and Google's one of them can,

482
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,980
that can put out a pretty bold statement
and you see other companies lining up

483
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:47,970
behind them and there's a
responsibility with that. Uh,

484
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,580
the Google seems to take it pretty well.
Yeah,

485
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,851
well,
we do our best.

486
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,780
We do our best to be inspirational
is as a company and as individual

487
00:25:56,781 --> 00:26:00,650
contributors here and the city of Detroit.
But it's hard, right? It's, it's a,

488
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:05,480
it's a simple concept, but putting it
into practice, uh, is, is it takes,

489
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,040
it does take practice itself.

490
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,390
It takes practice and understanding
and cognizance more than anything. Um,

491
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,660
I wanted to open up now I'm sure we've
got some questions from the audience.

492
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:16,980
We have a lot of leadership
here in the room. Um,

493
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,500
wanting to open up for questions.
If anyone has any questions,

494
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:23,170
if that we can ask Christy. Um, I do
have Mike's here if you want to court,

495
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,550
if you don't mind running those for us.
Thank you.

496
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,040
Nice for you, Jason. Hi, Dave Hoffman. Um,

497
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,430
and this is one of my main types this
close to my heart and went back to get my

498
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:41,290
MBA space specifically based on
corporate cultures, things like that. Um,

499
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,260
I, I'm an ex athlete and it's always funny
how the best team doesn't always win,

500
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,360
stolen the team that has the most hard,
most best leadership and inspiration,

501
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,790
all those kinds of things.
Um,

502
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,930
one of the things that I found kind of
time and time again is that natural light

503
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:57,780
that God given brilliant seems to
really hinder your ability to be an

504
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:00,280
inspirational leader. You
know, you get so caught up in,

505
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,830
in how things work or he or your mind
and whatever that you tend to not be as

506
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,150
personable, as outgoing. Um,

507
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,740
and that seems to be the case
sometimes here at Google where we,

508
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:13,290
we lack a little bit of inspirational
leadership because they just,

509
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,920
that Eeq kind of isn't there.
So first,

510
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:20,790
like what are some of the traits where
you can actually help coach someone up

511
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,970
into that from a leadership perspective
or the other end of the spectrum where

512
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:27,720
somebody might be a little bit more
fast and loose. So a lot of energy,

513
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:31,230
but at the same time needs to find a way
to authentically dial it back down so

514
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:34,710
that they can kind of fit into that
mold of a leader without losing their,

515
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,750
their uniqueness or their genuineness.

516
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,290
Sure. There's a couple
of questions. Yeah. Uh,

517
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,520
but I like where you're going and
let me just say that, uh, athletes,

518
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,050
often people who were former athletes,

519
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:49,530
our athletes are often really get
this because a lot of it is a,

520
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:53,330
starts in the inside that mental game.
So really being clear about that. And,

521
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:56,490
and if you have been an athlete,
a lot of times I wasn't an athlete,

522
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,780
I've heard this,
um,

523
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,130
that that's been part of the training
and it's a positive visualization, um,

524
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,160
plays a big role in it.

525
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:05,580
So I'm not surprised to hear the
connection that you just made between

526
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,940
athleticism and then, and culture. Uh,

527
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,180
so the being in your head problems
and interesting one a time,

528
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:16,410
a blessing and a curse because often if
we're someone who spends a lot of time

529
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:17,580
conceptualizing,

530
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:20,370
and maybe that's our personality or maybe
we're an introvert and that's how we

531
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:23,200
process or, or whatever the case, um,

532
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,200
it means that our first instinct might
not be to communicate right at first

533
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:31,340
instinct is to cut this a step
back and think about it. Uh,

534
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,790
and when I work with leaders like that,

535
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:36,030
which I do all the time because a lot of
people are introverts and, and that's,

536
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,930
that's where they naturally go.
Uh,

537
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,930
it's to get them out of
that predisposition that
things have to be perfect

538
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,180
before I communicate
it. Right. And so, yeah,

539
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,850
I'm thinking of someone that I worked
with several years ago. And so my,

540
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,150
one of my pieces of advice to him
was, uh, you know, you need to,

541
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,340
you need to go for, um, intentional
transparency is what I called it a,

542
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,610
because you think that people are
reading your mind but no one knows what's

543
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:02,970
going on up in here. Uh, and so you
need to be very intentional about it.

544
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:06,660
So your first instinct when you get new
piece of information or when you have a

545
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:11,661
plan that's maybe 50% bacon on 100% big
is to tell people like you need to get

546
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:15,330
that knee jerk reaction. Because
if it's just you thinking about it,

547
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:16,800
then it doesn't really shape anything.
So,

548
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:20,820
so that's one thing that comes up quite a
bit, if that, if that makes sense. Sure.

549
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,790
Thanks. Cool. Questions, Ashley?

550
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,950
Um, hotline. Here we
go. How's this? Better?

551
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,950
Okay, great. Um, so in
addition to, to be an author,

552
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:41,980
you consult and work with large
companies. And so I'm, you

553
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,910
know, I'm considering here
kind of thinking about all
these principles and how we

554
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:49,630
might push them down through a company
like Google or through one of the

555
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:53,500
companies that we support in this room,
which are large automakers,

556
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,130
the GM or Ford or Chrysler.
Um,

557
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,230
so when you think about tackling
a huge corporate client like that,

558
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:05,560
let's say budget was no option,
no issue in the CEO said,

559
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:09,620
I need your help transforming my
leadership. What are, you know,

560
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,940
what are some of the levers or the tools
that you would use with the company and

561
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:16,810
what do you think would be required to
really push this type of inspirational

562
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:19,510
development through a large organization?

563
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,950
Is that everything from personal
coaching for their leaders in addition to

564
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:24,731
retreats?

565
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:29,590
And what are sort of the levers that you
use to help actually push this through

566
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:31,840
in a meaningful way
across a big organization?

567
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,140
Okay. Well first of all, no one ever
says you have all the money you want,

568
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,950
but that my brain web chimps,
uh, well, so a couple of things.

569
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:44,220
Obviously I'm a big believer
in coaching. So I, there,

570
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:47,620
there is something really powerful and
I became a coach because I had a coach

571
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,660
and it just changed.
He changed my life.

572
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:54,340
And so I want it to be able to offer
that to other people and hopefully,

573
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:57,610
I don't know if I changed their lives,
but I, I try really hard to, uh,

574
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,440
to be in service to them.
Uh,

575
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:03,130
is that personal coaching changes
things because it's just such a unique

576
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:06,220
development opportunity.
It's so personalized and uh,

577
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:10,210
and it really allows you to ask the
questions that you want to ask in a very

578
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:14,200
safe setting, uh, with someone who
isn't invested in your outcome.

579
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:16,930
They just want you to be successful.
So nobody's trying to gain the system.

580
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:20,200
So That's why I think coaching is
very effective. Um, but beyond that,

581
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,630
if I could work in an organization,
however I wanted to,

582
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,440
what I think is most effective is
when you introduce concepts to a,

583
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,090
a swath of people.
So maybe it's a all leaders in,

584
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,760
in an office or whatever the case is.
Um,

585
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:36,910
so everybody gets a sort of the
same song book, if you will,

586
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,470
certainly starts to think about
things a little differently. Uh,

587
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,900
and then you have some sort of breakout
cohort groups underneath of that.

588
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,310
Because I think back to the role
modeling and the conversation,

589
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:50,590
I think that's what really starts
to get people to think, okay,

590
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:53,460
how can I really embed
this in my day to day? Uh,

591
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,800
and you get economies of scale that way
because the conversation gets richer and

592
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:59,140
everybody gets curious and they
start looking at other things.

593
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,620
So I think it's a combination of those
that can really help shift the culture.

594
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,370
Uh, but let me just say that anything
that I wrote about in this book,

595
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,690
the last book, I always tell people this,
it's, it's not hard stuff. Uh, it's,

596
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:12,850
it's not like you read and
you're like, wow, listening,

597
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:17,260
I never thought about listening before.
Uh, you know, it, we just don't do it.

598
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,240
Uh, and so part of my work, what I try
to do is really to close that knowing,

599
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:24,070
doing gap.
So you know it,

600
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:27,080
but then how do you make it
easier to actually just do it? Uh,

601
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,350
and so I try to make it
very accessible for people.

602
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:31,720
And so when I come in and work with teams,
that's really what it's about.

603
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:34,360
You know, I'm not there to tell you
something you've never heard before.

604
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:38,200
I'm there to get you to do things you
probably know you already should be doing.

605
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,240
Um, but you don't do. Yeah.
And that's really what it is.

606
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,290
Sometimes it's good to have a reminder,
you know,

607
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,670
for folks in this room and folks across
Google. Yeah. You talk about it. These,

608
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:51,580
these concepts are not difficult,
right? This simple concept.

609
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:52,600
It's not rocket science,

610
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:57,130
but a lot of times to some folks
in a company like this, uh,

611
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,940
coding, uh, search
algorithms is very simple.

612
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,130
Listening actually is
not that simple for them.

613
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:05,410
It's something that they do have
to practice. And something that,

614
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,080
that that seems like
a very simple concept,

615
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:12,100
but outside of kind of what they're used
to is it takes a little bit of extra

616
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:15,880
kind of focus and, uh, elbow grease to
kind of make sure that it happens. Right.

617
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,900
Kind of the last question I had because
you mentioned this here and the answer

618
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:23,140
to Ashley's question was around coaching
and you mentioned that you had a coach

619
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:25,540
yourself and kind of drove
you in the right direction.

620
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:28,820
Can you kind of talk about that process
a little bit? Because we all know,

621
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,570
we talk about inspiration, we're
talking about presence. Um,

622
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,860
I think one thing that we all look for
a here is finding coaches that can help

623
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:38,440
us along our paths as
well to become better, uh,

624
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,170
inspirational leaders to become
better employees and things like that.

625
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:45,790
Can you talk about that coaching and
coaching kind of atmosphere that you just

626
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:46,481
mentioned and,

627
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:49,620
and talk a little bit about your coach
and how that person was inspiring to you.

628
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,220
Sure. Well, I, I, uh, you know, I've
been an entrepreneur since I was 27,

629
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:56,710
so I didn't have a,

630
00:33:56,711 --> 00:34:00,100
an organization full of people
to role model and mentor me.

631
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,390
And in very early on, I got
introduced to someone who was a coach,

632
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,370
a leadership coach for a small
business owners. And it was,

633
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:11,170
it was just immensely helpful.
I mean, in so many ways, but,

634
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:15,730
but probably the most is that it was
somebody I could be very frank with and,

635
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:19,690
and he had, you know, had had a
business for, you know, 20 or 30 years.

636
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:23,170
And so there wasn't anything I came up
with had already been through five times,

637
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:23,830
you know,

638
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,460
so it was really nice just to have a
little bit of normalizing of things that

639
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:32,380
were happening. Uh, but also somebody that
could really just push my thinking and,

640
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:37,150
and have just sort of no bs,
uh, allowed and the discussion,

641
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:41,620
you know, it just sort of
call you on stuff and, and
really make you accountable,

642
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,820
but in a very supportive way.

643
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,240
And that's just a very unusual dynamic
to have somebody who will push you,

644
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,600
support you at the same time has
experienced, they can bring that,

645
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:52,810
help you understanding
contextually what's going on. Um,

646
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,740
and that doesn't have any sort
of game and your outcomes.

647
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:58,870
So they're not going to fire you if you
don't do it, what you just talked about.

648
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:01,060
Right. It, it's really you, it's
your development opportunity.

649
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:05,350
You do what you want to with it. Uh, and
I find with my clients now as a coach,

650
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:10,630
uh, you know, my job is to be supportive
and my job is to be incredibly honest.

651
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,360
So, uh, I don't hold back with my clients.

652
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,150
I think they need to hear what my
observations are. That's what I'm,

653
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,790
that's what I'm there for. Uh, and,

654
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,940
and I try to really adjust to their
learning styles so they can hear it in the

655
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:24,160
best way. Um, you know,

656
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:27,230
but my investment is in their
success and that's it. And,

657
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
and I think the best
coaches look at it that way.

658
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,780
Great. Awesome. Well, Kristy, thank
you so much for coming in today.

659
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:37,670
We appreciate it. This was very inspiring
for us appropriately. Um, again,

660
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:39,030
in the book,
the Inspiration Code,

661
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:43,830
if you guys haven't grabbed a copy on the
way out, I think it's, it's not right.

662
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,030
It comes out on Thursday.
So we have advanced copies.
How great is that? So, um,

663
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:49,020
if you have it grab a book,

664
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,930
you can read it before the general public
even gets to put their hands on it.

665
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:54,650
So once again, thank you Christie
for coming and we appreciate it.

666
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,290
Thanks for joining.

667
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,050
So that's happening.
