1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,090
Thank you so much for coming in out and
here in my talk. Just so you guys know,

2
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:13,450
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to briefly
read just the introduction from my

3
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:13,631
buck,

4
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:17,500
which I think actually tie us pretty
well into what we're going to be talking

5
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:21,970
about today and then I'm going to talk
a little bit about as was said before,

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,740
why it is so tough to talk about race
and then why don't we kind of have to do

7
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:30,730
it anyway and then I'm going to open up
for question and answers and hopefully

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
you will be inspired to ask questions
now that you've learned why we need to be

9
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,080
talking about these things.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,300
Now of course I expect that we will be
kind to each other and respectful of each

11
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:47,590
other when we ask these questions that
we will be considerate of the feelings of

12
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:48,100
people here,

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,360
especially people who are living with
the realities of racial oppression

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,590
everyday and whom this discussion will
always take a little bit more out of.

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,480
Okay,
so I'm going to start making

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,840
as a black woman, race has always
been a prominent part of my life,

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,350
or you have never been able to escape
the fact that I am a black woman in a

18
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:14,000
white supremacist country. My blackness
is woven into how I dressed each morning,

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,690
what bars I feel comfortable going to,
what music I enjoy,

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,400
what neighborhoods are hanging out in.

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,270
The reality is a phrase have not
always been welcome in my life,

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,560
but they have always been there.
When I was a young child,

23
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:31,310
it was the constant questions of why I
was so dark when my mom was so white.

24
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,960
Was I adopted? Where did I
come from? When I became older,

25
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:40,790
it was the clothes not cut for my shape
and the snide comments about my hair and

26
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:45,470
lips and the teen idols that would never,
ever find a girl like me. Beautiful.

27
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,210
Then it was the clerks who would follow
me around the stores and the jobs that

28
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,910
we're hiring until I walked in
the door and then they were not.

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,690
It was the boss who's who
told me that I was too loud.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,180
The compliments that my hair,

31
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,860
the comments that my hair was too ethnic
for the office and why even though I

32
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:05,150
was a valued employee,

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,920
I was making so much less money than
other white employees doing the same job.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,471
It is the cops.

35
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:17,450
I can't make eye contact with the Uber's
that abandoned their pickup driving on

36
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:21,470
instead of stopping when they
see me when I have my sons.

37
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:25,100
It was the assumptions that they were
older than they were and that they're

38
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,660
rough.
Housing was too violent.

39
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,680
It was the tears that came
home with when a classmate,

40
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,130
classmate had repeated an
ignorant comment of their parents,

41
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,250
but race has also been countless hours
spent marveling at our history evening

42
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:45,050
spent dancing and cheering to jazz and
rap and and RMB cookouts with ribs and

43
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:47,720
potato salad and sweet potato pie.

44
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,350
It has been hands of one
and braiding my hair.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,030
It has been reading the magic of the
words of Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou,

46
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,110
Alice Walker,

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,830
and knowing that they are written for
it has been parties filled with Joel,

48
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:06,400
the frys and Fufu and
Nigerian women wearing sequent
covered get gowns and giant

49
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:07,600
gala is on their heads.

50
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,570
It has been the nod to the black stranger
walking by that says they see you fam.

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,430
It has been pride in Malcolm Martin,
Rosa and Angela.

52
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,390
It has been a room full of the most
uninhibited laughter you've ever heard it.

53
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:28,120
There's been the touch of my young son
as he lays his hand over mine and says

54
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,450
where the same brown race.

55
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,890
My race has been one of the
most defining forces in my life,

56
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,020
but it is not something I always talked
about. Certainly not in the way I do now.

57
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,060
Like many people, most of my days
were spent just trying to get by.

58
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,730
Life is busy and hard. There are
work and kids and chores and friends.

59
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,100
We spend a lot of time bouncing from
one mini crisis to the next. Yes,

60
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,770
my days. Wage justice,
full of microaggressions,

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,790
of the pain of an oppression
of racism as they are now,

62
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,490
but I just had to keep
going on like normal.

63
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,570
It's very hard to survive as a
woman of color in this world,

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,970
and I remember saying once that if I
stopped to feel really feel the pain of

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,020
racism I encountered, I would start
screaming and I would never stop.

66
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,790
So I did what most of us do.
I tried to make the best of it.

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,530
I worked 50% harder than my white
coworkers. I stayed late every day.

68
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,360
I dress like everyday was a job interview.
I was over polite to white people.

69
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:39,280
I encountered in public. I bend over
backwards to prove that I was not angry,

70
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,130
that I was not a threat.
I laughed off.

71
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,440
Racist jokes is if I
didn't feel the sting,

72
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,560
I told myself that it
would all be worth it.

73
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:51,880
One day that being a successful
black woman was revolution enough,

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,270
but as I got older,

75
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,170
as the successes I had reached
four slowly became a reality.

76
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,240
Something inside of me began to shift.

77
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,190
I would try to make my voice
quieter in meetings and I couldn't.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,030
I would try to laugh off the
racist jokes and I couldn't.

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,650
I would try to accept my boss has reasons
for why I could have my promotion but

80
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:18,880
not my res and I couldn't
and I started talking.

81
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,770
I started to question. It started
to resist. It started to demand.

82
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,720
I wanted to know why it was considered
a bad thing, that I was opinionated.

83
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,850
I wanted to know what exactly it was
about my hair. That was unprofessional.

84
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,420
I wanted to know what exactly it was about
that joke that people found funny and

85
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:44,830
once I started talking I couldn't stop.
I also started writing.

86
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,020
I shifted my food blog into a mommy
blog and I started seeing all the things

87
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:52,630
that everybody around me had
always said were too negative,

88
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:57,631
too abrasive and confrontational or
started writing down my and my heartbreak.

89
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,630
I started writing about my fears
for my community and my family.

90
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,700
I had started to see myself and
once you start to see yourself,

91
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,930
you cannot pretend anymore.
It did not go over well.

92
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,350
My white friends having
grown up in Seattle,

93
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,670
the majority of my friends were white,
some of whom I'd known since high school.

94
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,420
We're not happy with the real me. This
was not the deal. They had struck.

95
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,670
Yes, they would rage over global warming
and yell about Republican Shenanigans,

96
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,510
but they would not say a word about the
racial oppression and brutality facing

97
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:36,470
people of color in this country.
It's not my place.

98
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,040
They'd explain in f when in frustration,
I'd beg for some comment.

99
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,230
I don't really feel comfortable

100
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,940
and as I looked around my town and I
saw that my neighbors were not really my

101
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:51,080
neighbors. As I saw that my friends
weren't no longer considered me fun.

102
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,430
I began to yell even louder.
Somebody had to hear me.

103
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,270
Somebody had to care.
I could not be alone

104
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,900
like dialysis.

105
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,640
The old went out and in came the
new suddenly people I had never met.

106
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:11,420
We're reaching out locally and from all
across the country in person than online,

107
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,740
just to let me know that they had read
my blog post and in reading it they felt

108
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:19,580
heard. Then online publishers
started reaching out to me,

109
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,060
asking if they could republish my work
and locally isolated and invisible people

110
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:29,780
of color started reaching out, showing
me that I did have neighbors. After all,

111
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,210
I was talking and writing at
first for my very survival,

112
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,160
not for anybody else's benefit.

113
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,280
Thanks to the power and
freedom of the Internet.

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,820
Many other people of color have been
able to speak their truths as well.

115
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,850
We've been able to reach
out across cities, states,

116
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,540
even countries to share
and reaffirm that yes,

117
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,580
what we are experiencing is true,

118
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,160
but the Internet has a very wide audience
and even though we were writing for

119
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:02,000
ourselves the power of
the herd, anger, fear,

120
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,740
pride and love of countless people of
color could not go unnoticed by white

121
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:10,820
people, especially those who are
genuinely committed to fighting justice,

122
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,370
injustice.
Well,

123
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:16,280
some have chosen to
turn away upset at this.

124
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:20,870
Unplug that this unpleasantness had
invaded their space of cat videos and baby

125
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,600
pictures.
Others drew closer,

126
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,500
realizing that they had been missing
something very important. All along

127
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,440
these last few years,

128
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,240
the rise of voices of color coupled with
the widespread dissemination of video,

129
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:40,241
proof of brutality and injustice against
people of color has brought the urgency

130
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:44,300
of racism in America to the forefront
of all of our consciousness.

131
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,250
Race is not something people
can choose to ignore anymore.

132
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,930
Some of us have been speaking all
along and I've not been heard.

133
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,240
Others are trying their
voices for the first time.

134
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,270
These are very scary times for a lot of
people who are just now realizing that

135
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:08,100
America is not and has never been the
melting pot utopia that their parents and

136
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:11,520
teachers told them it was
they.

137
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:15,930
These are very scary times for those who
are just now realizing how justifiably

138
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,610
hurt, angry and terrified so many
people of color have been all along.

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,920
These are very stressful times for people
of color who have been fighting and

140
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,320
yelling and trying to protect
themselves from a route,

141
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,850
from a world that doesn't care,

142
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,060
to suddenly be asked by those
who've ignored them for so long.

143
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,950
What has been happening your entire life?
Can you educate me

144
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,720
now that we're all in the room?
How do we start the discussion?

145
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,810
This is not just a gap in experience and
viewpoint. The Grand Canyon is a gap.

146
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,070
This is a chasm you could drop
entire solar systems into,

147
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,560
but no matter how daunting you are here
because you want to hear and you want to

148
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,394
be heard,

149
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,050
you are here because you know that
something is very wrong and you want to

150
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:08,460
change. We can, we can
find our way to each other.

151
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,710
We can find our way to our truth.

152
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,770
I've seen it happen my life as a
testament to it and it all starts with

153
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,950
conversation.
So I'm going to leave it there.

154
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,870
Didn't quite realize how
long my introduction.

155
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,523
So

156
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I'm here to talk about race and I know
that you're here cause at least perhaps

157
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,800
you might want to hear me talk about race.

158
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,070
Even if you don't want to
talk about race yourself.

159
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,570
I don't like talking about race.

160
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,520
I can't stand it.
I do not enjoy a minute of it.

161
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,660
I would rather be talking
about plenty of other things.

162
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,470
I have to talk about race and I want
to make progress on issues of race.

163
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,820
It's funny that I titled My Book,

164
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:02,430
So you want to talk about race because
I don't really know a lot of people who

165
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:03,660
actually wants to talk about race,

166
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,780
but I got to sing so you
have to talk about race.

167
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:09,240
Sounds a little odd to put on the book.

168
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,870
So why is it so hard?
Race is not a new topic.

169
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,830
This is not very new.
This doesn't seem that obscure.

170
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,640
We have people with different races.
Why can't we talk about it?

171
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,870
Why has this been such a difficult
subject for hundreds of years?

172
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,390
There's a couple of reasons why.

173
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,680
One of the main reasons why is because
we are deliberately denied the tools.

174
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:42,630
We need to talk about it,
and I say deliberately, I
really firmly believe this.

175
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,150
We must first understand that
race is a system of power.

176
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,960
It is a system designed to benefit
some of the expenses others by sheer

177
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,630
convenience.

178
00:11:55,631 --> 00:12:00,631
When you need to pick a group of people
who can be singled out if they look

179
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,010
different from another group,

180
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:07,210
that's a pretty easy identifier provided
you are in the group that wins when

181
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,560
you're setting up this system.

182
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,070
One of the reasons why it has been so
lasting is because it is very hard for

183
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:20,071
black people to no longer be black people
now because this is a system of power

184
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,110
and it is a system of power
that does a lot of harm,

185
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,980
brutal in human harm to a lot of people
and because fundamentally the vast

186
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:40,601
majority of us do not want to sign on
to systems that brutalize and murder

187
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,220
fellow human beings.

188
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:49,210
It is very important that we are unable
to accurately describe what is happening

189
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,510
in the system in order for
that system to continue.

190
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,310
I have met a lot of very
committed racists in my life,

191
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,940
but I have yet to actually come
face to face with someone who says,

192
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,710
I want to solely be responsible
for the mass imprisonment, murder,

193
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:13,410
and terror of people of
color in this country.

194
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,940
Even at that extreme calling it
what it is is very difficult.

195
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,840
The other reason why it is cut,

196
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:27,841
it's not because everybody's bad
and everyone's trying to lie.

197
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,850
It's because the system needs
us to continue to do nothing.

198
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,190
And in order to do that,

199
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:40,191
in order to stifle what would be our
outrage at how unjust our system is,

200
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,880
we have to not be able to describe it.

201
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:48,780
It has to be the vague
nothing that cannot,

202
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,640
you can't make any progress. So often
people come up to me and they say,

203
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,110
it's too big. What can I do? I'm
just one person. It's too much.

204
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:01,710
You can't change a system
that's been around for so long.

205
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,610
But think of how long you've been told.

206
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:10,611
You can't change the system without
actually being told what the system is.

207
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,400
It's like Voldemort, like you
just can't say it. If you say it,

208
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:21,840
then it will be bad. But nobody knows
what it is that they're so afraid of.

209
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,800
Now the good news is,

210
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,540
is the thing that we actually are so
afraid of is an economic, cultural,

211
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:33,050
and political system,
not that scary. Or we,

212
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,890
the thing we are afraid of is a collection
of decisions we are making every day

213
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,650
where we spend our money,
how we vote,

214
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,950
what we expect from our elected officials,

215
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,350
what we deem as professional or
unprofessional or valued as unvalued.

216
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,000
This collection of every day we
make turns into a system of race.

217
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:57,560
It upholds a system of race,
but in the end,

218
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,560
even if we don't know why it
is we're participating in,

219
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:04,670
it has a hefty pay out
for a very select few

220
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,940
and it is in their interest that we
never stopped and question what race

221
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:15,910
actually is in this country and what
racial oppression is in this country.

222
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,010
So if you don't have the words for it,

223
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,880
think of how often in school
you were given the worst for it.

224
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,320
Even if you did that exercise where like
half your class had blue eyes and half

225
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:26,681
your class,

226
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:31,681
you had brown eyes where you've then given
the words to actually talk about race

227
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:34,780
in your house or with your friends.

228
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,370
Okay,

229
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,850
well you actually given the words beyond
this makes people feel bad as to what

230
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:43,630
the impact that has on society on,
let's say,

231
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:47,530
the employment outcomes for
people of color in this country.

232
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,080
Throughout every one of our
efforts to get forward on this,

233
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,700
we kind of stopped with the whole stop
doing mean things to people of color

234
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:02,560
because it hurts their feelings and then
we wonder why we don't get anywhere.

235
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,590
Which brings me to one of
the other reasons why it's
so hard to talk about race

236
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,370
because we want this
to be about intentions.

237
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,240
We want to be good people and we want to
be seen as good people and we all know

238
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:22,960
that racism is bad, right? We've
been told this forever and it is.

239
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,590
I'm not here to like shock
you and saying it's good.

240
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,660
That part's true.
There's just a lot more to it.

241
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,630
Our idea of a racist,
right?

242
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,750
As someone who like can't stop
shouting the n word, right?

243
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,880
Or yelling that like Mexicans are coming
to take all your jobs or it's someone

244
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:48,370
on horseback riding
across and someone's lawn.

245
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,750
These are people with hate in
their hearts who wants to do harm.

246
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,330
Now this stops us from being able to
talk about race because when someone says

247
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:01,540
you did this thing and it
was racist and it's hurt me,

248
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,540
you don't want to be in that group.

249
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,740
You yourself have never said
the n word in your life.

250
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,290
You are a good person.
You don't want to be a bad person,

251
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,630
but that's not the way race works.

252
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,570
Okay?

253
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:25,570
The personal outcomes for people of Color
and our society is not built upon how

254
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:29,870
many racial slurs have been
hurled at them in their lifetime.

255
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,240
It is not.

256
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,360
Black households in this country have
13 times less net worth than white

257
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:43,220
households because they were called the
n word this many times and every time

258
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:46,970
their bank account dropped.
That's not how race works.

259
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,063
Furthermore,

260
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,370
there are plenty of people who would
shout racial slurs at me all day and

261
00:17:56,551 --> 00:18:00,840
outside of that moment of terror,
which he does have,

262
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,810
they have no other impact on my life.

263
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,460
There are plenty of people who
dedicate their lives to racism,

264
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,990
who aren't registered to vote, who don't
hold any positions of social power,

265
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,370
who kind of stick around with other
white people who hate people of color and

266
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:19,260
never leave that weird little hovel.

267
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:26,150
They are impacting me nearly as much
as someone who has a black lives matter

268
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:28,080
poster in their window,

269
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:33,081
but then votes for tighter
policing because she's a
little scared about the way

270
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,670
the demographics of her
neighborhood is changing.

271
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,640
Okay?

272
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,270
Right. When it comes to my
safety and my ability to live,

273
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,980
she is making a much bigger
negative impact on my life
and the life of my family

274
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,480
and the wife of my friends.
And that's where we have to realize.

275
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,270
But in a system that only requires that
you do nothing in order to continue to

276
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:01,470
perpetrate itself,

277
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,580
your intentions don't mean squat.

278
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,650
Yeah.

279
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,960
So if you did not mean to harm someone,

280
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:12,030
it does not mean that
the harm wasn't done.

281
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,630
And it does not mean that you then
hate them and you must be discarded.

282
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,340
But it also doesn't mean that they must
immediately forgive you and act like it

283
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,180
never happened.

284
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,280
But it's very hard to talk about race
when we can't update their ideas of what

285
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:35,230
racial oppression actually looks like
and what racism looks like when it hits

286
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:36,130
people of color.

287
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,603
One second.

288
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,520
It's also really tough to talk about
because we never actually say what we're

289
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:53,700
trying to talk about.

290
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,710
What we're doing when we're talking about
race usually is we have people who are

291
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,800
trying to come to their own personal
goals and usually people of color come in

292
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:09,730
and talk about race,

293
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,330
are trying to get other people to
understand what is harming them.

294
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,860
And very often white people come to rate,

295
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,470
come to talks about race to try and
make sure the person they're talking to

296
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:23,410
knows that they are not the
person who is harming them.

297
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,510
Those are two completely
different conversations that
we'll never meet because

298
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,580
you have one person
who's lived experiences,

299
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,280
you are harming me and
I need you to understand

300
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,600
and you have another person
she was lived experience says,

301
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,320
I am not part of the problem. I am a
good person. And I need you to understand

302
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,010
because don't state what it is

303
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,050
that we're trying to talk
about when we talk about race,

304
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,280
you can dissolve an entire
friendship in a discussion.

305
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,470
And if you were to ask why
of each person in that discussion,

306
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:01,300
the reasons would be completely different.

307
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,170
So we know what it is.
Tough.

308
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,990
We know there's a lot at risk and if
you are a white person in this room and

309
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:16,440
most of you are,
and you're thinking,

310
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,480
what if I get called racist?
Oh,

311
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:21,060
last time I tried a couple of times
it ended really bad. Trust me.

312
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,840
No conversation on racist
ever ended nearly as bad for
you as an ends for people

313
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:32,220
of color. So before we launch
into why we have to do it anyways,

314
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,070
I want to first say if a person of color
is willing to talk to you about race,

315
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,110
even if they don't seem very friendly
while they're doing it, it's a generosity.

316
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,620
I asked a lot of my friends
when I was working on my book,

317
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,080
what are your greatest fears
about talking about race?

318
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,060
And a lot of white people
were like, oh, you know,

319
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,990
I'm just afraid of being seen as
racist. You know, I'm really afraid.

320
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,730
Um, you know that like I'll get
dragged on black Twitter. Um,

321
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,890
and then my friends of color were like,

322
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:03,690
I'm afraid I'm going to
get fired from my job.

323
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,850
I'm afraid I will be physically attacked.
I'm afraid it will be harassed.

324
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,880
And there were plenty of people who said,
I have been harassed.

325
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,910
I currently have a restraining order
out on someone who I said was racist and

326
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:20,010
then tried to ruin my entire life.

327
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,560
I have people of color who have actual
threats to their life and liberty and

328
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,360
their ability to feed their families.

329
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,350
And then you have white people who are
afraid that they will be called racist.

330
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,870
So know when people of color come
to these discussions, first off,

331
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:41,871
they're already bringing their pain
pain that you do not know the bringing a

332
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:44,430
damage that has already been done.

333
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,070
And they're bringing a team knowing
that there's probably a 90% chance this

334
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,600
conversation isn't gonna go well

335
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,510
yeah,

336
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,590
that they're going to lose out. They're
going to be seen as angry. At best,

337
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,530
there'll be dismissed as you know,

338
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,000
overly rakes focused
and that they will lose

339
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,810
steam for you,
which hurts them.

340
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,380
They may lose a friend in the process
of just trying desperately to get you to

341
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:16,190
see their humanity.

342
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,330
So think about how generous it is to
have a life time of experience that says

343
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,260
this is not gonna end well
for you and you do it anyway.

344
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,540
And then wonder,

345
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,920
should you really be that afraid
to join them to meet them halfway.

346
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,610
Should you really be that afraid to talk
to your uncle at the dinner table when

347
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:45,050
he says something a bit off?
It's something we have to talk.

348
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,520
So why is it something we have
to talk about? First of all,

349
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
we're always talking about it and I
think that this is something that people

350
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,434
always forget.

351
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,880
We live in a society with a white default,

352
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,570
okay?

353
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,570
Everything is whiteness or holidays.

354
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,240
Okay?

355
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,440
Our calendar,

356
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,440
what we view as professional
or films or books,

357
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,290
the art that we call fine art versus
the art that we call ethnic art.

358
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,550
We live in a world defined by whiteness.

359
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,210
One of,
I understand a lot about white people.

360
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,050
I grew up here in Seattle and
that was raised by a white mother,

361
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:41,410
but I will never know what it's like to
be able to walk around in a world built

362
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:42,080
for me.

363
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,080
I never have to say it was built for me
to never have to recognize white culture

364
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,550
is white culture.

365
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,090
I always have to recognize black culture
is black culture because even if I'm

366
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:56,330
going about my day and my blackness,
someone's going to make it a parent.

367
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:01,070
I am doing something that is outside
of the norm. Walking around in my hair.

368
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,900
People make it very apparent,

369
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,860
whether it's weird comments about how
glad they are that I've embraced who I am

370
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,630
or the comments about how it's
a little wall. That's wild.

371
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:19,340
That's funky. I like it. It's
not wild are funky. It's,

372
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:21,350
it's the hair that grows out of my head.

373
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:22,803
Hmm.

374
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,140
I don't walk up to everyone who gets out
of the shower comes to work and go wild.

375
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:31,840
Funky. It's kind of stringy. I,

376
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,540
we live in a culture defined by whiteness,
which means,

377
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,820
but anytime you're not talking about race,
you're talking about whiteness.

378
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,660
What you're basically saying is everything
is white until I deem it otherwise.

379
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,100
And you're saying here, people
of Color, you navigate that.

380
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,180
You navigate this culture 24 hours a day
until I am comfortable enough to ask if

381
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,300
maybe it doesn't always suit you.

382
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,350
Maybe I'm deemed to be the one to
step around and try a different path.

383
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,580
We like to act as if it's people of color,
always bringing up race.

384
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:25,940
Yeah.

385
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,940
But if I go for a job interview and the
way that my hair grows out of my head is

386
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:36,380
not deemed a professional,
I am not making it about race.

387
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,060
I'm the one who,

388
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:45,061
because those doing the interview didn't
stop to think about their definition

389
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:48,390
and whether or not it included
everyone who might show up for a job,

390
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,260
who has to figure out what professional
means to white people and then has to go

391
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:59,850
and modify the hair that grows out
of my head in a way to fit that.

392
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,910
I don't want to make it about race.

393
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,080
I would like to just show up in
the hair that grows out of my head.

394
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,690
I didn't make it about race and me saying,
Hey,

395
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:15,690
I should be able to show him up with
the hair that comes out of my head.

396
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,080
It's my attempt to no longer make it
about race to no longer make it about

397
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:27,580
whiteness. So often these issues
that you find yourself saying,

398
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,380
why does it always have to be about race?

399
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:33,550
It's because it was about race when you
decided that the only people who needed

400
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,740
to be considered where white,

401
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,070
that's what made it about race.

402
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,660
Now oftentimes people of color are trying
to get it back to a place where it's

403
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,494
not.

404
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:52,150
We have to talk about it because right
now we are all harming other people

405
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:01,190
because we have spent a lifetime absorbing
incredibly harmful messaging about

406
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:05,550
people of different races,
about people of color.

407
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,800
That means I have spent a lifetime
absorbing harmful messaging about Asian

408
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:15,540
Americans, about indigenous
people, about Latinex Americans,

409
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,710
and about black Americans.
It means everyone here has,

410
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,610
and when you see something and it hits
a person of color and they know deep

411
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:30,750
inside that that's not right,
but they're not comfortable telling you

412
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,380
you are missing the opportunity to become
a better person and it stopped hurting

413
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:38,214
people.

414
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,470
If you don't want to talk about it,

415
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,800
what you're saying is you just continue
to carry that hurt and the next person

416
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:51,560
after you should continue
to carry that hurt.

417
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,810
Because the thought of carrying my piece
of it and doing the work necessary to

418
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:58,820
stop,
it's just a little too much.

419
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:03,821
I would rather continue the blissful
ignorance of doing harm and having other

420
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,360
people pick up the mess.

421
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,710
I don't think that's the type
of person you want to be.

422
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,210
I myself personally in my work have to
constantly challenge that because even as

423
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:19,044
a black woman,

424
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,940
there is a lot of messaging
I have absorbed about
people of color have that in

425
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:28,941
my work requires me to face and
recognize where I may have harmed people.

426
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,620
Yeah.

427
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,620
And try to make amends because as much
as it stings to know I've heard someone I

428
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:39,050
would rather know.
So I can do better,

429
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,550
but continue to think I'm
the thing since slice bread,

430
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,460
while I'm hurting everyone in my path,

431
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:53,510
we have to talk about race because it's
the only way to identify solutions.

432
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,570
What we're talking about here is not just
big group therapy or we're crying and

433
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:02,040
hugging our way out of this.

434
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,090
I honestly don't believe that will work
and I really don't want people to hug me.

435
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,640
I I'm talking about identifying where we
are missing opportunities to be a part

436
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:19,410
of the solution and that actually means
you have to talk to the people and find

437
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:20,490
out where the problem is.

438
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,420
And we miss a lot of opportunities.

439
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,310
You think of the last time a friend of
yours made a joke that just wasn't cool

440
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,550
and you decided to let it go.

441
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,470
Now if you are a white
person and you hear a joke,

442
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:39,870
it's not cool and you decide to let
it go cause you don't want to ruin the

443
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,703
evening,

444
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,420
think about who never gets the
opportunity to make that choice.

445
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,910
I don't get the opportunity.
My evenings ruined.

446
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,850
I don't even like if there's no saving it.
Like my evenings ruined.

447
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,340
My relationship with that
person is forever altered.

448
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,410
I don't get a chance to say I'm going
to not be black for the evening and not

449
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:03,340
have that hurt me.

450
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,870
I don't get to say I'm going to wait
until next month and then maybe I'll bring

451
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:12,150
it up. If they, you know, make a joke
at the expense of my humanity gun,

452
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,060
then I'll bring it up no
matter what I'm harmed.

453
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,553
Okay.

454
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,220
We have to talk about it.

455
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:21,940
Yeah.

456
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,680
Because what we are doing not only causes
hurt feelings not only causes trauma,

457
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,520
but it has actual measurable impacts
in the wellbeing for people of color in

458
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:37,210
this country.
So if you don't understand,

459
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:38,900
okay,

460
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,900
what the school to prison pipeline looks
like and you haven't heard for mothers

461
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:50,171
of black children whose kindergartners
have been dragged out of their classrooms

462
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:52,040
by school,
please officers,

463
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,420
but you will not make an informed voting
choice when it comes to your local

464
00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:01,320
school board. Chances are you
probably won't even vote for it if it,

465
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,740
especially if it's an off year

466
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,500
and you're going to leave that 10% of
the population most at risk to fight that

467
00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:16,200
battle on their own and then you'll
wonder as your kid gets older,

468
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,010
why these black kids can't
just get it together.

469
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,810
Why are they always getting suspended?

470
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,640
Why are they always getting expelled
and you'll think it's their problem.

471
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:32,330
When you had an opportunity for years
earlier to put in school board members who

472
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:33,871
could say,

473
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:37,500
we're going to take a look at the way
in which we are disciplining children of

474
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:41,690
color to see if it's fair to see if it's
in the best interest of these children.

475
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,660
If you don't talk to people of color
about how hard it is for them to access

476
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:52,640
resource access resources
in their neighborhood,

477
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,390
how you vote for taxes and levies in
your city and state that could give money

478
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:03,581
to neighborhoods that don't even have
working sidewalks and we do have stretches

479
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:07,250
here in the Seattle area,
but I don't have working sidewalks.

480
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:10,730
Kids are walking to
school on busy highways,

481
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,290
then you're not going to vote
accordingly because your street's fine,

482
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,860
but you didn't want to talk about
race and why money has kept from these

483
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:20,694
neighborhoods.

484
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,360
Why so much of it's about how wealthy
the tax bracket is for that neighborhood

485
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,740
and then you wonder why people aren't
rising up when they can't even get to

486
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:35,730
school safely, when they can't have
updated books in their classrooms,

487
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,360
when the nearest grocery store that would
give them the nutrition they need to

488
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:42,590
be able to pay attention through the day
is a mile and a half away and there's

489
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,670
no rule,
good bus routes,

490
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,600
but we're going to keep voting
to lower our tabs, right?

491
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,240
Without looking at the impact that
has and the people who need reliable,

492
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:58,470
low cost transportation more than
anyone else. These are conversations,

493
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:02,400
these are so blue oceans you come
to you when you talk about race,

494
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,140
but they are also solutions you are
rejecting when you don't talk about race.

495
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,410
It is not just something from
the heaven comes down and says,

496
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,490
would you like a bonus
solution for race today?

497
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,910
And you accepted and
you're glad for this extra.

498
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,810
These are responsibilities
that you're abdicating,

499
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,600
but no one else will pick up.

500
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:37,270
These are opportunities that you
are morally obligated to take,

501
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,060
that you are denying because you
don't want to have an uncomfortable

502
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:47,100
conversation.
Now.

503
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,570
It's not as easy and please for the
love of God, do not rush out of here.

504
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,850
Find the nearest black person
in the office and be like, Hey,

505
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:54,930
let's have a conversation about race.
Please.

506
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,250
There's a reason why there's
a lot of chapters from my book

507
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,280
because we have to do this in a way
that is not putting in an even more of a

508
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:09,140
burden, a marginalized people, but
it definitely can be done in first.

509
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,130
I would say start googling Google.
Oh my gosh,

510
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:15,980
you guys right?
Start googling.

511
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,740
There's not a question you
have that hasn't been asked.

512
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,140
There's not a sticky situation you are in,

513
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,600
has it you have that
someone else hasn't been in

514
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,450
before you stop and say,

515
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:30,860
I'm going to go and talk to Lataetia and
she's going to be my new dictionary of

516
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:33,440
race relations.
Google it.

517
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,800
Figure out what you're talking about.
Read My,

518
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,960
get some pointers and then start looking
in everyday opportunities to have

519
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,510
conversations, not just with people
of a different race than you,

520
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,650
but people in your own race. Especially
if you're white in this audience.

521
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,160
Please start talking to other white
people about this because it was only like

522
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:57,340
five black people in this entire city.
Like we can't have all these conversations

523
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,720
and make sure that you're talking
to people love multiple races.

524
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:06,060
I speak as a black woman.
I write as a black woman.

525
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,320
My experience in this world though, is
not the same as it is for a Latinex woman,

526
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,150
right? Or an Asian American
men, and you can't say,

527
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,900
I talked to a black person.
They're cool with it. We're fine,

528
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,913
but

529
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,390
come to it.
Knowing that as hard as it is,

530
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:28,020
it's always going to give
you an opportunity to be a
better person and to make a

531
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:28,920
difference in this world.

532
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,720
And that should excite you because for
the first time you may actually see and

533
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:41,590
the ability to make progress where you've
been told forever that you couldn't,

534
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,930
that there were just some people that
were always going to hate and some people

535
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:49,560
like you that we're going to laugh and
maybe one day love would win and then you

536
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:51,540
wonder why things aren't getting better.

537
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,950
You will have actual measurable
things you can do to make it better.

538
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,350
But it starts with conversation.

539
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,710
So that's kind of my talk and now,

540
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,910
yeah, he's walking around. So I think,
yeah, I hope there will be questions.

541
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,330
So, uh, I decided I want him to
come to a talk that was called,

542
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,020
so you want to talk about race? Um,
I was kind of sold already on that.

543
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:24,600
That seems like a good idea.
Um,

544
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,080
one of my main takeaways was that if I
end up talking about race with somebody

545
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:36,180
who is not white,
that they will have a bad time.

546
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,950
How do you reconcile those?

547
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,290
I mean that's the thing is it's,
it's almost,

548
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,690
I've never left a conversation about race,

549
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,130
especially with someone of a different
race and been like, man, that was fun.

550
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,053
Um,

551
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,710
I want you to come to that knowing her,

552
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,730
the reason why people engage with it
is because that's how urgent it is.

553
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:03,100
So there are things you want to do,
there are things you need to do. No,

554
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,390
that means that there were going to be
times where even as painful as it is,

555
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:12,310
I am dying to talk about race because
I know this only thing that's going to

556
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:15,490
make this situation better or are the
only thing that's going to make it seem

557
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:18,550
like I'm not completely invisible
to the people around me.

558
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,520
It's like you're walking around in,

559
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:25,750
your world is on fire and
people are literally going,

560
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:26,700
God I am so

561
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,160
cool

562
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,520
and like putting on Parker's and you're
dying and you're like, what are you,

563
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,370
what are you doing? No, you don't want
to talk about what that feels like.

564
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:37,061
You don't want to be like,

565
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:41,320
let me explain to you for an hour what
it's like to be this hot. But sometimes,

566
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:44,500
you know,
if I don't get someone to ask,

567
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,460
why are you so wow right now,
I'm going to actually die.

568
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,040
And that's oftentimes what
talking about racist. No,

569
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:54,070
it doesn't mean that it won't be rewarding
in the end, even if it's not pleasant.

570
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,910
Because I do think when these do go
well in the more of these that do,

571
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,240
it will shift.
Part of the reason why it's not pleasant,

572
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,970
it's because most of the
time it goes really bad.

573
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,680
And so we're already entering
in talking about pay.

574
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:11,230
We're going through knowing that chances
are all of that investment isn't going

575
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:12,064
to pay off.

576
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,950
So part of it is it's committing to be
someone who it might pay off, you know,

577
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,490
be like, Hey, you know what?

578
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,350
I'm going to try my best to be a little
different and listen and hear and be

579
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:23,840
here.

580
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,460
All right?
So how do I present as someone who

581
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,060
is less likely to cause somebody I'm
having a conversation with to have a bad

582
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:35,980
time, uh, without, uh,

583
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,720
like giving everyone a
minority tax, everybody like,
Hey, you're a black person.

584
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,240
Yeah. You know, I would
definitely say first off,

585
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,540
always try and gauge people's comfort
level in a conversation. Right?

586
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,910
So people of course,
especially because of the work,

587
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:53,670
I do want to talk to me about race a
lot and in fact sometimes people come to

588
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:56,610
save the conversations. They've been
afraid to happen to anyone else for me.

589
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,720
But when people gauge my comfort
level, say, hey, you know,

590
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:05,580
I had a question about something with
race or I was wondering if maybe this was

591
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:09,810
something you wanted to talk about. Are
you comfortable? Is this a good time?

592
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,770
If not,
I fully understand start back way.

593
00:40:13,771 --> 00:40:16,980
Because a lot of times what happens is
people get really eager and I think I'm

594
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,620
going to make a person of color day today.

595
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,010
I'm going to go up to him and
start asking them about race.

596
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:25,110
And that's just not
the way to go about it.

597
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:29,820
But it happens more than you than
you would assume and instead saying,

598
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,360
are you comfortable? Do you feel safe? Do
you want her to have this conversation?

599
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,190
Oftentimes even that alone,

600
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,090
like knowing that someone took the time
to even wonder if I want to have that

601
00:40:39,091 --> 00:40:42,840
conversation is a good sign to me it's
going to go better cause it's already

602
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:43,860
starting with listening.

603
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,890
It's already starting with
consideration for me as a human,

604
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,780
so I definitely started there.

605
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,620
I then always take time to pause and make
sure you're listening more than you're

606
00:40:52,621 --> 00:40:57,621
talking and that you're stating your
intentions and that you're checking in and

607
00:40:58,231 --> 00:41:03,231
looking for signals that someone is
still comfortable if they're not say,

608
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,030
I am sorry,
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

609
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:09,390
We can totally pause or a B out
of this conversation entirely,

610
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,600
but a lot of times what ends up happening
is you'll start a conversation and

611
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:15,840
it'll veer into areas that are no longer
safe and comfortable for people of

612
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:19,320
color and then it becomes, well what?
I thought you wanted to end racism,

613
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:23,340
why aren't you still talking to me about
it? But the truth is, is, you know,

614
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:25,770
this'll be the 20th conversation
I'm going to have today.

615
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:31,460
I need to be willing to like reserve
what I have left and move on.

616
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:33,260
Um,

617
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,290
so I would say definitely starting with
finding your comfort level if they want

618
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:37,130
to talk about it or not,

619
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:42,131
and stealing why it is you want to talk
about it are going to get you probably

620
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:45,380
at least halfway there
to having a conversation.

621
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,900
It's going to be one of the ones that
actually surprises people of coming by

622
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,530
going pretty well. Your parents, um,

623
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,880
parents and um, unfortunately grew
up in a household where I'm raised,

624
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,351
was brought up.

625
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:02,270
It was always negative and I knew when
I had my children and even just finding

626
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:05,220
out that that wasn't the type of
household I wanted to have. Um,

627
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,490
I want to know when I can be
doing to be a better parent,

628
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,220
to be teaching my kids how
to have these conversations,

629
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:13,820
how to be better people
as far as you know,

630
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,760
how they're treating their friends and
the people that they encounter every day

631
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,270
properly. It's a great question. I'm
assuming you have wakids. Yep. Okay. Um,

632
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,710
what I would definitely say,
um,

633
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,680
and I refer to those quite often cause
I think it's a really good example.

634
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:29,720
I was actually talking with
an associate a while back.

635
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,860
He was asking me about what it was like.
This was a white man.

636
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:37,870
He was asking me what it was like to
have to explain to my kids about avoiding

637
00:42:37,971 --> 00:42:42,560
cops in what police brutality is and
like why store clerks might follow them

638
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,810
around things like this.
And he said,

639
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,930
I'm so glad I don't have to have
that conversation with my kids.

640
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:53,070
And they pass. And I was like, oh,

641
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,630
why don't you have to have
the conversation with your
kids? It's like, well,

642
00:42:56,631 --> 00:42:58,430
you know what I mean? I'm
like, no, no, I really don't.

643
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,510
Because you're grateful that your kids
had been spared this painful conversation,

644
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:04,490
but your kids are in
community with my kids.

645
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,850
Why would your kids be
spared this conversation?

646
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:12,800
Why would they be spared the knowledge
of what their friends are dealing with?

647
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:16,100
Why would they be spared the
opportunity to lift that burden?

648
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,760
At least some of it,
but showing at least they understand.

649
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,960
It's really important to realize your
kids are going to be absorbing what's

650
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:25,790
happening in the world no matter what.

651
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:32,120
And you have to provide context and you
have to provide empowerment and places

652
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:34,040
of action.
So I like personally,

653
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:39,041
I have of course to kids of color and
so I talk with them oftentimes to see

654
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:42,380
outside their own experience
to other kids of color,

655
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:44,960
maybe kids of different races.
What I like to do,

656
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:47,480
especially when we're like listening to
the news and you hear all these awful

657
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:50,000
things happening and kids
really feel powerless.

658
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:53,540
They feel like grownups are
kind of screwing everything
up for them and they are,

659
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,390
and there's nothing they can do about it.

660
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,750
So I always like to talk with my kids
about solutions that they can help be a

661
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:06,740
part of. Right? They have no power is
to who's president and this country,

662
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,790
but they have a lot of power as to what
their friends at school are sitting to

663
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,250
other kids at school.
Right?

664
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,620
They have the power to raise their
hands and the teacher and say, Hey,

665
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:16,610
I don't think that's right.

666
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,780
So we'd like to like listen to the
news and especially, you know my,

667
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,560
well both my teenagers kind of like, he
thinks he's got it all figured out, right?

668
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,860
So I don't know.
He's absorbing probably half of it.

669
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,410
I talked non stop and said Mama, no
ignoring them. I have the Internet. Um,

670
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,740
my 10 year old.
On the other hand,

671
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,580
it's incredibly passionately concerned
about what's happening. Right?

672
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,700
He's very concerned about immigration,
very, very concerned about immigration.

673
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:42,810
He has friends who come home,

674
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,550
whose parents have told them they might
have to go away one day. Right? He's very,

675
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,560
very concerned about transgender rights.

676
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,250
And so these are things where instead
of saying, yeah, man, it sucks,

677
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:57,750
the world is horrible because you grow
up being an adult that just says that

678
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,970
instead, I think, okay,
well you know what?

679
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:04,971
Chances are right now you have kids in
your class who are worried about where

680
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,480
their parents are going to be.

681
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,710
So are you talking with your friends about
this issue and letting them know that

682
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:13,980
you support them?

683
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,490
Are you listening for kids who might be
saying hateful things that their parents

684
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:20,310
are saying and challenging?
That's right.

685
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:25,650
You have kids in your class who may
one day come out as transgender.

686
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,940
So are you making sure that no one is
saying anything that would harm them right

687
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:33,240
now? Are you talking to your
teachers about the bathrooms?

688
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:35,460
Maybe there's something that can be
done about your school bathrooms, right?

689
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:40,670
Giving them the opportunity
to know there's always a
way to be reaching out and

690
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:43,170
finding solutions even in
their own little corner.

691
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:48,210
And that not only is going to keep them
being solution oriented and reaching out

692
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,590
and working out,

693
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,220
but it's also going to keep them feeling
empowered so they don't enter adulthood,

694
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:58,020
jaded and feeling it. There's
nothing they can do about it. Lou,

695
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,140
I uh, actually have the privilege
of having the last question,

696
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,750
just Fyi. Um, uh, first of all, thank
you so much for putting on this talk.

697
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:11,430
You are wonderful writer and speaker
as well, so thank you very much.

698
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,710
I wanted to ask,
um,

699
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,230
if you have any advice for someone who is,
uh,

700
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:24,650
a person of color black specifically
who is navigating a white workplace?

701
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:26,610
Um,

702
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:31,470
I have worked at Google for
about a year and a half and um,

703
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,340
I didn't know that I was willing going
to be like the only black female engineer

704
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:37,650
here. Um, and that's, you know,

705
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:41,340
it's cool but sometimes I wish I wasn't.
Um,

706
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,640
do you have any advice for like feeling
kind of alone and feeling like you want

707
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:51,240
to be with people who look like you?
I understand that feeling.

708
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,620
Before I was a writer actually
worked in tech for a decade and um,

709
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,830
I was always the only black person
except for once I had a black supervisor.

710
00:46:59,340 --> 00:46:59,940
Um,

711
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,860
I know that family and it's a very lonely
place to be and unfortunately because

712
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:06,480
of the way the world is,
the more you rise up,

713
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,620
the more lonely you end up and first off,

714
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:15,600
that's a completely normal way to feel
it. Definitely. Um, I would say two fold.

715
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:19,200
One, personally, you have to find
community even if it's not in work.

716
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:21,360
And I know it's hard because we
spent so much time at work in,

717
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:24,570
especially in fields like this,
but you've got to find community,

718
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:25,440
you've got to find people.

719
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:29,500
There aren't groups of black
people in the greater area,

720
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:32,860
especially tech focus, black people
that kind of of seek each other out.

721
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:36,190
So definitely, you know, hit me up after
this if you have any questions on that.

722
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,730
Um, so definitely do that.
But then also I would say

723
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,660
always know it's going to be harder to
change the rules of how people engage

724
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:49,410
with you and later than
it is to set it up front.

725
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,810
And that's something I started learning
about halfway through my tech career

726
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:55,030
when I was in tech was there were,

727
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,430
there are a lot of compromises we
find ourselves having to make things.

728
00:47:57,431 --> 00:48:00,820
We don't talk about things
we don't address. Right. In
order to get where we are.

729
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,390
What I realized was the further I got,
the harder it was to go back and correct.

730
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:10,360
And so I had the always
weigh in smart ways, right?

731
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:11,890
To not get my house flyer,

732
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,420
how to challenge things so that people
knew from the moment they started doing

733
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:20,860
business with me, but I was going
to be challenging these assumptions.

734
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:22,570
So I started with a lot of
innocent questions. Right.

735
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,780
My favorite thing to do would be w w
what do you mean? What does that mean?

736
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:27,770
I don't,
I'm sorry I didn't,

737
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,230
I just don't understand and I'm not
trying to be like, no, what do you mean?

738
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,260
I'm like, no, I don't. I'm good. I don't
get what? What does that mean? I don't,

739
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,640
what's funny about that thing?
You know,

740
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,310
I always like to point out those little
things just to be like, not like,

741
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,230
you know, we're kind of have
a discussion about this,

742
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:46,420
but like there was this thing,

743
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:49,480
it works that used to drive me bonkers
is actually still happens to me.

744
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:54,170
Even as a writer online where it's say
I'm hungry and someone would say, well,

745
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,450
we try and give me cheese all the
time. People will be like, Jeez,

746
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,830
I don't know what it is about
selling cheese. Oh, it's this,

747
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,430
this is like a Swedish thing. No people
like all man, go get you some cheese.

748
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:09,910
And I'm like, I hope you understand the
majority of black people or electrical.

749
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:10,920
Sometimes I'm like,

750
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:13,860
are you trying to not only ruin my day
but your day because you have to sit next

751
00:49:13,861 --> 00:49:18,120
to you? And it wasn't like,
how dare you not know this?

752
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:19,980
It was just like,
hey,

753
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,910
you know where it say,
yeah,

754
00:49:25,911 --> 00:49:28,280
no cheese isn't going to work
for me because I'm black.

755
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:30,080
Sometimes I leave it at that
because then people will be like,

756
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:36,650
what do you mean? And think a little
bit, is there something like, yeah, no,

757
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:39,980
it's magic. She is mortal enemy. Like no,

758
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:44,510
actually the majority of people of color,
not just black people, Asian people,

759
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,680
indigenous people.

760
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,120
We don't do cheese too well and like
get people starting to think and I would

761
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:52,070
start to challenge a lot of those things.
You know,

762
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,090
we would have get together
work and be like, Hey,

763
00:49:56,091 --> 00:49:59,770
did you know that's not necessarily um,
that cool dive bar.

764
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,411
You think it would be fun?

765
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:04,880
The slum in with the confederate flag
can in the corner and not necessarily a

766
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:09,881
place where I'm going to be safe
and I would just constantly,

767
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:13,790
and like a very even
keel say these things.

768
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,720
And I learned that when people started
to figure out that I was never actually

769
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:23,720
going to let those things go,
but it wasn't going to turn into a fight.

770
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,930
Sometimes it was just like,
well, it's less knowing.

771
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,820
I actually start thinking about these
things ahead of time and start really

772
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:36,470
addressing them. But I would definitely
say find community. Um, learn.

773
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,101
You know,

774
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:41,630
what compromises you are and are not
willing to make early and think if I make

775
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:45,350
it all the way to VP, do I still
want to be ignoring these jokes?

776
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,980
Do I still want to be having
these horrible conversations?

777
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,950
Do I still want to be acting like
my needs are being met with or not?

778
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:52,641
Because believe it or not,

779
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:56,270
it's actually harder when you get to
that level to have those conversations.

780
00:50:56,271 --> 00:50:58,430
And now I hope that helps.
I mean,

781
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:02,450
unfortunately you shouldn't have to
be asking these questions. Absolutely.

782
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,770
And hopefully people listening in this
room will help make it so that that won't

783
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:08,400
be a case.
Right.

784
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,430
I mostly asked this question for
their benefit, not mine. Yeah.

785
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:16,460
I like the way you think.

786
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,380
Thank you very much for
coming to talk to us today.

787
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:26,850
[inaudible].
