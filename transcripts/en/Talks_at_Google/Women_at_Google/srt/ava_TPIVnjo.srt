1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,010
Please join me in what
calling Victoria Tucker.

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,080
Thank you very much and thank you
so much for everyone for coming.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,920
Thanks for inviting me. It's a
real pleasure to be here. Um,

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,170
I'm Victoria Tech.
I,

5
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:26,970
I'm an editor at wired UK and
I've also just written this book,

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,770
digital etiquette, which is out this
week. Uh, before I go any further,

7
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:33,630
I just wanted to make a quick confession,

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,350
which is that this is the very first
talk I've given about this book.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,590
And in fact it's pretty much the first
dog I've ever given about anything.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,690
So you guys are my Guinea pigs and if
my knees look like they're shaking,

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,950
it's probably because they
are. Um, but anyway, yeah. Oh,

12
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:54,510
also it is the first
PowerPoint presentation I've
made since like high school.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,260
Um, so I haven't used any clip art, but I,

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,110
I might have got a little bit
carried away with the animations.

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,360
It touch a keynote. Do you know, it didn't
even exist when I was at high school,

16
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:11,160
I think. Anyway. Um, so what
is digital etiquette? Um,

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,360
well the idea behind this book was
basically a fun modern take on the

18
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:20,370
traditional etiquette guide
for digital communications.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,040
And I think a lot of people when they
think about this term etiquette, uh,

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,000
it sounds very old fashioned
and kind of stuffy,

21
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,480
but actually I think
it's super importance.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,830
It is the social glue that makes it
possible to communicate with each other

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,170
without accidentally offending someone.

24
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,470
And we all kind of do it where the or not.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,150
And I think it's especially important
online and in digital communications for

26
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,040
several reasons.
Firstly,

27
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,310
because most digital
communications are text based,

28
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,450
that means you're very limited in terms
of the tools that you have to get your

29
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,320
point across.

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,640
You've probably all had that situation
where you meet someone only over email

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,570
and you kind of get the impression that
they're very terse and very brusque and

32
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:06,690
kind of rude because their
emails are always really short.

33
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,020
But then you meet them in person and
that absolutely lovely and really nice.

34
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,740
So I think for that reason digital
communications can be full of a particular

35
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:20,190
pitfalls when it comes to you at a cat.
Also that obviously rarely,

36
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:24,480
truly private. Even if you think
you're just talking to one person, a,

37
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,530
your conversation could easily be shared
more widely and they leave a digital

38
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,364
trail.

39
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,180
So that angry email you send it three
in the morning is going to be in someone

40
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:36,090
else's inbox forever.
Once you've sent it.

41
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,903
Okay.

42
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,020
Say this is a saying you've
probably heard on the Internet,

43
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:42,980
no one knows you're a dog.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,270
Yeah.

45
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,190
But that's no excuse for poor manners.

46
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,570
Now the book covers
for different chapters,

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,550
each of which is dedicated to a different
sphere of modern life. So there's uh,

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,650
the workplace romance,
which is obviously a lot of online dating,

49
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,770
friendship and community,
which is social media.

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,170
It would be impossible for me to attempt
to cover all of those here today.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,770
Um, and given that this is for
most of you, your place of work,

52
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,010
I thought we'd focus on the workplace
and specifically on how to do email.

53
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,263
Um,

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,370
now I do realize the absolute conceit
of me coming into Google and trying to

55
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,400
tell you how to do email.
But the last I checked,

56
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,770
you don't have a chief ethercat
officer. So you know, maybe I can, uh,

57
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,220
bring up one or two points
that are of use. Um,

58
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,170
and actually just to see
what I'm dealing with.

59
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:43,090
Let's start with a quick question.
Um, let's talk about email sign offs.

60
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,200
I want you to think about
your default email sign off.

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,320
The one you use 90% of the time you type
it without even thinking who uses best

62
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:54,964
wishes.

63
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,610
So whenever that anyone use best or all
the best kind of variations on a theme,

64
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,300
quite a few. Great.
Who uses anything else?

65
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,630
Okay. It's worse than I thought
because you guys are wrong,

66
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,530
but we'll get to email sign offs and
the details of actually writing an email

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,220
later on.
Um,

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,740
first I want to step back a bit and just
think about the bigger picture of email

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,933
etiquette.

70
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,890
My driving philosophy
behind email etiquette, uh,

71
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,390
comes from one pretty universal truth.

72
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,730
Everyone hates email. Again, maybe
not the best place to be saying that.

73
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,040
I'm sure there's a few of you out
there. Um, now don't get me wrong.

74
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,010
Email is a fantastic innovation.

75
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,810
There's a reason we all
use it and we still use it
decades after it was invented.

76
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,280
Uh,

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,700
it lets us communicate with people on
the other side of the worlds in different

78
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:02,380
time zones and it's really actually
reshaped workplace culture.

79
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,760
I don't think it would be possible to
work remotely if we didn't have email.

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,130
So is you know, a really great thing and
it is often very convenient. However,

81
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,750
it's also stressful time consuming,

82
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,780
annoying and it often feels like it
no longer just helps us to do work.

83
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,030
It actually is work. You don't see many
job ads were in the listing. They put,

84
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:30,670
you know, the skills required
being really good at email.

85
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,300
And yet I've spent whole days in my inbox
just writing and responding to emails.

86
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,850
I don't think anyone really wakes up
full of a sense of joy or the number of

87
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:46,720
unread, unread messages
they've got in their inbox in
the morning, in the morning.

88
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,710
I think you probably feel more
of a sense of dread and he's,

89
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,050
I hope I'm not the only one.
In fact,

90
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,210
I know I'm not the only one cause there
have been studies that have shown this.

91
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,360
Um, one of my favorites is
actually a really small study,

92
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:03,170
but I really liked it because
they actually put heart
rate monitors on a bunch

93
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:08,171
of office workers and they made them
go about their daily business and they

94
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,210
tracked their email usage and they found
that the more people spent on email in

95
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:18,560
a given day, the more stressed they
were and the less productive they felt.

96
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,860
I think we can probably
all relate to that.

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,420
So based on that, given that email
is terrible and everyone hates it,

98
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,290
the main principle of good email Atget
if do reduce it as much as possible.

99
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Every time you send an email you are
asking to take up someone else's time and

100
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:39,950
mental energy.

101
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,690
So obviously that means you should only
send emails when you actually need to,

102
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,980
but when you do,

103
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,580
you also want to make sure that you're
making it as easy as possible for your

104
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:50,990
recipient to deal with.

105
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,470
You want to make sure you're including
all the information the first time round.

106
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,210
So you're sending one email and not 10
and you just want to make it very clear.

107
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,580
You want to be concise and precise,

108
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,480
take up as little time as possible and
make it as easy to deal with as possible.

109
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,400
And often the best email is
actually the one you don't send.

110
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,180
So that said, sometimes
you do need to email.

111
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Sometimes it is a good thing an
email has become for many workplaces,

112
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,540
the default means of communicating
certainly an office space, workplaces, uh,

113
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,520
that is changing a bit at least
for internal communications. Um,

114
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,790
I know a lot of officers use
instant messaging tools like slack.

115
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,110
I'm sure you guys probably use Google
hangouts. I'm getting lots of nods. Yep.

116
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,930
Um, but certainly for external
communications and still a lot of internal

117
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,300
communications,
email is king.

118
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,360
It's the thing you kind of
just automatic you go to first,

119
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,930
but maybe you shouldn't always because
the very same things that make email

120
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,770
really good for some things
make it really bad for others.

121
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,230
So what is email good for?
It's good for distributing information,

122
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,060
especially if you need to send a
message to lots of people at once,

123
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,360
especially if it's quite a long message.
Maybe you need to attach documents.

124
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,980
Perfect, simple back and forth
at Kiva. That was simple.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,450
But if you want to have a quick question,
answer, question, answer with someone,

126
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,000
it can work. Um, you know,

127
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:26,090
if you have too many people on a thread
or the threat goes on for too long,

128
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,900
it can very quickly get
confused. Um, so simple is key.

129
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,600
Starting a paper trail.
Um,

130
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,590
I think this is particularly important
if you're working on a project that you

131
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:39,080
know is going to take
quite a lot of a long time.

132
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,530
One really good thing about email
is it's really easy to search.

133
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,960
It's not so easy to search back old
instant messages and things like that.

134
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,380
Um, but you can find an old email
from days ago, weeks ago, months ago,

135
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:55,320
even years ago, very easily.
So great. But more importantly,

136
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,120
what is email not good for?

137
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,050
It's good for immediate responses.

138
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,980
This is actually a bit of a controversial
one because I think certainly today a

139
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:09,900
lot of people expect immediate responses
or near immediate responses from email.

140
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,980
But going back to the whole nature
of email and the first base,

141
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,030
the whole point of it is that
it is asynchronous. Okay.

142
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:22,710
So you can send an email at one time and
your recipient can pick it up whenever

143
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:24,180
they like,
you could send it one evening,

144
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,190
they pick it up the
following following morning.

145
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,760
That is one of the major benefits of email
we'll get onto how fast you should be

146
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:36,080
expected to respond soon.
Uh,

147
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,870
but I do hold that if you're looking
for a really immediate response,

148
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,890
you shouldn't be relying on email,
discussion and debate.

149
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,560
I can't emphasize enough that email
is not a discursive medium. Um,

150
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,250
I know the one thing people hate more
than email is meetings, but if your heart,

151
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,740
if you have some kind of problem,

152
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,930
especially if you need to work as a group
to come together to create a solution

153
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,370
or come to some conclusion,

154
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,460
email is just way too open for
miscommunications in that situation.

155
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,400
So it might be better
just to speak in person

156
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,900
and nuance I mentioned at
the beginning of the talk,

157
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,860
the thing about digital communications
is it can be very hard to get your

158
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:24,390
meaning across and especially to get any
kind of sense of your emotional meaning

159
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:28,230
across. Um, so if it's a
situation that's a bit sensitive,

160
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,220
you probably want to be choosing a format
where you can use those nonverbal cues

161
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,770
like tone of voice, like facial
expression, body language, uh,

162
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,340
to make sure that you're
not misunderstood.

163
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,640
And that's not only to make sure that
your coming across the way you want to,

164
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,820
but also so you can pick up on those
cues from the other person and you're

165
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:49,380
dealing with and maybe kind of tune your,
your response along the way.

166
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,430
So you've decided that you do need to
send an email and the email is definitely

167
00:10:56,431 --> 00:11:00,930
the best medium I key thing around
email and to get his timing,

168
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,980
um,
when to send an email.

169
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:10,010
So obviously I mentioned that email is
asynchronous and that you shouldn't be

170
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,990
expecting an immediate response.

171
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Expectations have changed hugely over
the past decade because of smartphones.

172
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,890
Um, you know, it's pretty obvious point.

173
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,710
It used to be that when you
left the office at night,

174
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,250
you leave your computer and you wouldn't
be expected to check your email until

175
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:32,550
the next morning. In fact, you probably
couldn't, you couldn't even be tempted to,

176
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,890
uh,
because you had an immune cell doing say,

177
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,810
now we've come to expect everyone to carry
these mini computers in their pockets.

178
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,490
I mean, it's better than to
be available 24, seven. Um,

179
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,850
and this has really blurred the lines
between work life and personal life to the

180
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:54,400
extent actually that France recently
brought in a new law called the Dwight

181
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,330
[inaudible], uh, which is
like the right to disconnect.

182
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,280
And it essentially in shrines in look at
your right to ignore your boss's email

183
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:04,470
on the weekend,
um,

184
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,370
because they recognize that work life
was just impinging on personal and family

185
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:13,150
life. Um, so that workers
could never switch off.

186
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,680
And I think if you wouldn't expect someone
to be in the office that late working,

187
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,700
you shouldn't expect them to be checking
that email, that late working. Okay.

188
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,540
It takes just as much effort to do so.
Uh,

189
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,660
so I really think that you should stick
to work hours or near abouts I here,

190
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,300
none of us are perfect. Maybe
an hour or so either side. Um,

191
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,220
but try and stick to work hours and try
if you want to be extra good and stick

192
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,490
to your recipient's work hours, especially
if they're in a different time zone.

193
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,850
Now you might say, you know, that's
great. I totally respect my colleagues,

194
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,600
right? To have a personal life and to
not check that emails in the evening.

195
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,530
But I the super conscientious worker,

196
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,340
I really liked sending emails
late at night, you know,

197
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,750
I actually enjoy it and that way
I'm not keeping anyone waiting.

198
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,380
They've got their answer as soon as they
want it and I feel good about myself,

199
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:10,510
I can take it off my to
do list and I'm done.

200
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,630
The problem is that goes back to
the original paradox of email.

201
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,670
There you are enjoying the convenience
of being able to send it at anytime but

202
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:26,380
you're putting the stress on your
recipient because even if you don't expect

203
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:27,580
them to respond immediately,

204
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,270
they're going to feel that
unread email guild they are.

205
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,660
And they're going to be unsure about
whether they're supposed to be replying

206
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,523
right then or not.

207
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,860
So the onus is on you as a
sender to set a reasonable norm.

208
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,020
And if you really want to be
answering your emails late,

209
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,270
you can also use the delay send function
so you can just schedule it to email

210
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:50,104
the next morning,

211
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,520
which makes us to how fast
do you respond to an email?

212
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,560
And this is obviously the first thing
that comes up whenever I bring up the idea

213
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:00,820
of email etiquette with people.

214
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,050
And what's really funny is that people
have completely different views on this.

215
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,350
And I think this is one of the main
things that contributes to email stress in

216
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:08,831
the first place,

217
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:13,120
is that we don't have an agreed consensus
on what was supposed to be doing.

218
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,420
So we're all just kind of
scrambling around trying to
please everyone and no one

219
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:18,910
knows what they're supposed to be doing.
Um,

220
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,630
now it's easy to say good educate is to
respond to an email as fast as possible.

221
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,080
Usually if someone's emailed you, asking
you something, they want a fast response.

222
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,400
Um, but it obviously is
just so context dependent.

223
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,630
It could be something really simple
that you can respond to right away or it

224
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:41,320
could be something that actually requires
quite a lot of work. Um, and that,

225
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,960
you know, you might not be expected
to respond for several days.

226
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,910
So it's a bit of a cop out answer here.
There is no one size fits all,

227
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,050
but there is a sort of
workaround achieved ask them.

228
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,390
Um,
so yeah,

229
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:01,391
I think a lot of people assume that
etiquette has to be this sort of unspoken

230
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:06,920
thing. I kind of secret code that
everyone else, but you knows. Um, but I,

231
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:11,270
I'm very much pro being transparent
and being very practical.

232
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,140
So if you receive a message and you don't
know what you're expected to do with

233
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:18,740
it, just send a quick line back. Say Hi,

234
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,090
is it okay if I get back to
him this by Friday? Or Hey,

235
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:27,470
this is going to take me some
work. When do you need it? By easy,

236
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,620
I'm faster flies are actually
not always the best etiquettes.

237
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,083
Um,

238
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,100
I think a good example of
this is if you're on an email,

239
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,670
which has been sent to a group of people,
say it's been sent to your whole team.

240
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,900
I used to be this person who at the
beginning of my career I really wanted to

241
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:55,080
show how keen I was and how
ready to work and ego was to, uh,

242
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,120
to get involved with everything.

243
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,620
So if our boss would send an email
to the whole team asking for input,

244
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,210
I'd immediately jumped in with my
2 cents and I thought, you know,

245
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:09,290
I was just showing how great I was,
what a good worker actually.

246
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,260
Obviously I was just being super annoying.
Um,

247
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,300
I think in that situation it's
much better etiquette to sit back,

248
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,310
wait awhile, see what other people
say, see if your input is even needed.

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,030
And if it is when you do respond to if
they've got all the information that you

250
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:28,820
need. And I think not only
is that good etiquette,

251
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,570
but there's actually a lot of power in
being able to do that and give kind of

252
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:34,910
one very well informed response.

253
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,970
All right,
how to write an email.

254
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,530
I promise I'm not patching eyes on you
guys is I honestly think this is really

255
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:50,030
hard. I get it wrong all the
time. Um, I think everyone,

256
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:52,280
it gets it wrong a lot.
Um,

257
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,270
everything of course goes back to thinking
about your recipient and reducing the

258
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:58,190
burden of email on them.

259
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:02,360
So precision and concentrate
in or both your friends. Um,

260
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,870
and this is a quote from Merlin Mann.
Does anyone know who he is?

261
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,080
He's a speaker,

262
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:12,770
a podcaster and a writer and
he coined the term inbox zero.

263
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,250
Have you guys heard of inbox zero.
Okay. Quite a lot of recognition there.

264
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,270
That's good.
Um,

265
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:20,750
I won't go through exactly what
inbox zero is in this presentation,

266
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,610
but it's basically a way to stay on top
of your email so that you don't drown in

267
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:30,290
unread messages. Um, I'm, I'm a
huge kind of devoted to inbox zero.

268
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,371
Anyway,

269
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:35,570
Merlin was kind enough to speak to me
for this book and this is one thing he

270
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:38,060
said, which I think really, um,

271
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,230
really makes a good point when
you're going to write an email.

272
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:46,640
So he says assume that everyone you're
communicating with is smarter than you

273
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:51,240
and cares more than you and is busier
than you. Sounds kind of obvious,

274
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,540
but I feel like we all almost
automatically do the opposite.

275
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,310
You sort of think this is really
important. Why haven't they responded? Um,

276
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:05,170
and obviously it's better to just consider
the other person if they're writing

277
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,910
an email.
Let's start from the top subject lines.

278
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,100
I'm pretty simple.
Keep it descriptive.

279
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,530
Again, you're trying to make your
email super easy to deal with.

280
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,880
So you need something that helps people
categorize it and so they can see at a

281
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:24,330
glance what it's going to be about and
what probably the adaptations on them

282
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:28,850
we're going to be. I've got a few
examples of how not to do it. Um,

283
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,630
and I've used it a scenario that I think
everyone who works in an office will be

284
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:38,490
familiar with. So here's our email. Hi
all feeds. Can everyone remember that?

285
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,720
If you use a mug from the kitchen,
it is your responsibility to wash it up.

286
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,380
Has anyone ever received an
email like that? Yeah. Now,

287
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:48,930
you'll notice in this email,
there is no subject line.

288
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:53,700
The subject line has been left blank.
Don't do that. It's super annoying.

289
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,260
When you go to check your email,

290
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:58,770
you just see who's who it's sent from and
there's no subject and you immediately

291
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:02,310
assume the worst, right? You're
like, Oh God, I'm in trouble. I mean,

292
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,540
you could argue you're in trouble
there, but yeah. Um, so don't do that.

293
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:08,780
Yeah.

294
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,560
Don't put the whole message in the
subject line. I've seen people do this.

295
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:16,910
I often see, actually I'm quite senior
people have a habit of doing this.

296
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,990
And again, it's super annoying, especially
if you check your email on mobile,

297
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,120
you only get the first
few words and it's like,

298
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,440
what am I supposed to be doing with that?

299
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,180
The clickbait headline.

300
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,930
Uh, yeah, I've seen quite
a few of these in my time,

301
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:39,860
usually from pos trying to
get my attention. Um, yeah,

302
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,150
obviously it's dismissed eating.

303
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:44,780
It's not very useful and you probably
think you're being really funny,

304
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,663
but you're not.

305
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,533
Yeah.

306
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,500
Okay. Oh, Jen. Kitchen mess. Um,

307
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,460
yeah. So it's okay to play the
urgent card every now and then.

308
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,850
If it truly is urgent, if
you need a fast response, uh,

309
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,700
but every time you play that card,
you are devaluing it.

310
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,910
I don't think many people would
consider this an actual emergency. Uh,

311
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,730
so be very judicious with urgents and
going back to the whole point of email

312
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,940
etiquette as well.
If it wasn't at least a bit important,

313
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,110
you probably shouldn't be sending the
email in the first place. Uh, so yeah,

314
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,810
so this is what I've gone
for. Kitchen mass. Um, yeah,

315
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:27,310
it's totally boring,

316
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,750
completely bland and therefore absolutely
perfect for professional situation.

317
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,930
Um, so that's subject mines.
How to start the email.

318
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,940
This is pretty easy,
so I won't spend too long on that.

319
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,790
Um, you don't need to
greet someone every time,

320
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,960
especially if you have back and
forth thread. Um, so, you know,

321
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,670
obviously you might first day high,
uh,

322
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,320
but it's like if you're
having a conversation,

323
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:57,640
if you're having a quick back and forth
email thread, you wouldn't say like, hi,

324
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:01,600
how are you? Hi, I'm
great. Hi. That's good. Hi.

325
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:04,570
And what about yourself?
Hi. Yeah, good too. Thanks.

326
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,330
You just wouldn't do it and you
don't have to do on email either one,

327
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,420
established the back and forth
conversation, fine to omit it. Um,

328
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:16,660
I usually just as like a rule of thumb,
if a day has passed so you slept on it,

329
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,230
I'll then kind of do a greeting again.
Um,

330
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,740
dare someone is not usually necessary
unless the email is taking the place of

331
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,720
sort of a formal letter.

332
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,120
So fits a cover letter for
a job application or an
official invitation of some

333
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:37,870
sort.
Then you might want to use dare it's 2019.

334
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,580
You can probably use someone's first name.

335
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:45,270
The exception I make is if they have
a title that is not ms Mr Ms. Mrs. Um,

336
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,640
so if it's something like doctor,
professor, Lord Lady Madam Sir,

337
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,030
I would use the title the first time
around just because some people are quite

338
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:56,860
picky about that.
Um,

339
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,710
and then when they respond they'll
probably sign off with their first name.

340
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,150
You're on a first name basis, that's
fine, but they're not usually necessary.

341
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,920
Hi.
It's probably fine

342
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,200
striking the right tone.
Um,

343
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:17,250
I mentioned kind of several times
already that this is truly difficult.

344
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,430
Um,

345
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,780
email is terrible for communicating
emotion for this reason.

346
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,780
I actually am totally pro things like
Emoji using lots of exclamation marks.

347
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,100
Um, whatever it is that helps you
to express your emotional meaning,

348
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,660
um, and get your view across more
clearly I think is totally fine.

349
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,710
Obviously that's going to be a bit
dependent on where you work and what your

350
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:44,770
position is. Uh, if
you're sort of a lawyer,

351
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,700
smiley faces might not be
appropriate. Um, but you know,

352
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,690
in the media world usually totally fine.
Um,

353
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,980
so anything that you can do to
kind of be clear is a good thing.

354
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,320
Um,
and again,

355
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:03,400
striking the right tone is going
to depend a lot on context. Um,

356
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:06,160
so you do have to kind of make
a lot of judgment calls there,

357
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,520
but there are a few stereotypical ways
that people email that I've observed and

358
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:15,340
I think that everyone in this room will
probably be able to recognize at least

359
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:20,110
one person they know who does
each of these, the boss emailer.

360
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,210
Um, so this is the concept
of emailing like a CEO, uh,

361
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,320
and Katie and a topless, uh,
American digital journalist.

362
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,030
She wrote this great piece about
emailing like a CEO. What is that?

363
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,840
It's when you respond right away,
but just as like one or two words,

364
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,990
like just okay.
Um,

365
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,660
and she noticed that her boss did
this and it's also kind of, um,

366
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,170
a thing that a lot of tech
CEOs are quite well known for.

367
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,630
You probably know Amazon's Jeff Bezos,

368
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,870
he's renowned for forwarding emails from
customers to Amazon staff with not even

369
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:02,540
a word, just a character, a question
mark. Can you imagine receiving that?

370
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:07,520
The horror? Um, so yeah,
emailing like a CEO,

371
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,180
I spoke to Katie about this cause she
kind of did an experiment where she tried

372
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:14,630
it for a week. Um, and she said
it was actually really great.

373
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:16,730
It made her feel so much more productive.

374
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,520
She really stayed on top of
things and she told me, you know,

375
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,020
she never realized before
how much email hung over her,

376
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,730
like a little black cloud.
So it definitely has its advantages.

377
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,230
Um,
you know,

378
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:34,280
it helps you be able to kind of maintain
your inbox zero if that's what you're

379
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:35,114
working towards.

380
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,640
But you have to exercise caution because
there's a very fine line between being

381
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:44,840
concise and being brusque and
being brusque and being rude.

382
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,280
So it's a really difficult one to judge.
Um,

383
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,870
and there's a certain thing to be said
about who is able to do this is called

384
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,210
emailing like a CEO and it tends
to be people in senior positions.

385
00:24:58,211 --> 00:25:02,030
So if you do it and when you get
higher up the pecking order, you know,

386
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:05,640
maybe you have a bit more licensed
to actually just be a bit rude. Uh,

387
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,950
so it really depends kind of where you
are on whether you can get away with it

388
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,120
or not. And if you work in something
like customer relations or HR,

389
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,660
there's a certain expectation on you
that you have to be a bit sort of more

390
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:21,820
gentle in your email tone.
So that's the boss emailer,

391
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,700
the corporate jog on Waffler. Um, this is
almost the opposite of the boss emailer,

392
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,370
yet they have the same aspirations,
right?

393
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,610
So this is someone who sort of sees
every email as an official missive to be

394
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:40,820
carefully crafted. Um, yeah,

395
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:44,030
they're probably read a lot of business
books and there were always into the

396
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:48,590
latest sort of trends in thought he to
ship and they try and use that in their

397
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:52,310
writing. So they end up with
things like this sort of stuff.

398
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,070
Uh,
you can probably tell from this,

399
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,290
I've never actually worked in
a really corporate environment,

400
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,340
but my partner who's a
management consultant tells me
that it's not that far off.

401
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,700
Um, so yeah, you've probably all
received something like that,

402
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:06,790
which means obviously
absolutely nothing at all.

403
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,140
Definitely want to avoid
third type of emailer.

404
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,440
I couldn't think of a name for this one.
Um,

405
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,790
that's the best thing I could
come up with to describe it. Um,

406
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,380
and I now realize, obviously this,
that headline right next to me,

407
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:28,200
and probably everyone could just take
a picture and put it on social media,

408
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,320
but that would obviously be
terrible digital etiquette.

409
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:32,900
So I'm sure you wouldn't
do that. Um, but yeah,

410
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:35,900
so this I think is actually a really,
it's a,

411
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:40,070
it's a big phenomenon and I think I have
definitely been guilty of this in the

412
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:42,620
past. I'm sure it will be guilty
of doing it in the future.

413
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,620
I think it's actually a very British
thing where especially if you get a little

414
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:54,120
bit annoyed or a little bit
worked up instead of being rude,

415
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,690
you kind of go overly formal in a
way that looks extensively plight.

416
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,460
But is that she's just
super passive aggressive.

417
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,630
So instead of saying something like,
um, kind of get back to me soon,

418
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,870
perfectly normal and acceptable,
you'd say something like,

419
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,250
I would be much obliged if you could
kindly respond to this message or earliest

420
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:17,040
convenience.
Yeah.

421
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,890
Has anyone ever done that?
Yeah, we've got that. A few,

422
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,790
a few people are confessing that one.

423
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,520
So that's another one to be
aware of. Um, before we move on,

424
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,320
a few common email translations,

425
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,040
I find it really funny that we will have
these set phrases that we seem to use

426
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:38,370
an email and we wouldn't consider
saying them anywhere else.

427
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,260
It's just that kind of email language.

428
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,640
And I think it's especially funny
when I see the GML suggested automated

429
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:49,230
responses because they're always so spot
on because we all already just email

430
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:50,670
like robots.
Um,

431
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:55,440
so we'll just go through a few
apologies for the delayed response.

432
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,570
Um,
yeah,

433
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,690
it's just the law that you have to start
messages with that I think I've tried

434
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:02,550
not to my hands just do it.

435
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,960
Yeah.

436
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,800
Hope you're well. Um, yeah.

437
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,010
There's really no needs to ask after
someone's health unless you have a reason

438
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:12,640
to be concerned.

439
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,970
We all know this is an authentic
and you don't actually want to know.

440
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,040
Okay.

441
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,710
Not sure if you saw my last message.
Yeah,

442
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:25,900
you definitely saw my last message.
I'm obviously what we,

443
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,740
what you mean with that is that hey,
why haven't you responded

444
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,160
just following up? Um, yeah,

445
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:39,580
we're always just following
up for me. Um, no,

446
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:42,790
you're never just following up, you
know, if you're just following up,

447
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,990
why you send sending me email and just
ask the question that you need to be

448
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,770
answered.
Does that make sense?

449
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,670
Um,
of course it makes sense.

450
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,490
You wouldn't be sending the email if
it didn't make sense. If you would,

451
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,320
you need to go back and start redrafting.

452
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:05,680
Thanks in advance. Um, yeah,

453
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:10,270
I'm going to talk about thanks in advance
a bit more, uh, in the next slide.

454
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,300
Um, but yeah, obviously it's the, again,

455
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,190
going back to that kind of
passive aggressive thing,

456
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,060
it doesn't really mean what it
seems to you on the surface.

457
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,580
So facts of what I asked at the
beginning and email sign offs.

458
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,503
Um,

459
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,400
these are the ones I'll accept basically
best wishes or any variations on them.

460
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,430
Why do I think there a
good email fine off, um,

461
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,850
that inoffensive the formal enough
without being overly formal.

462
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,120
Um,
the totally boring again,

463
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:48,150
which makes them just perfect for at
least 90% of workplace communication.

464
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:54,280
So you're not going to offend anyone
with a best wishes. What do I not like

465
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,840
that? Has anyone seen that one?
I've seen that in the wild. I, yeah,

466
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,700
you've obviously taken a
perfectly good sign off,

467
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,970
best wishes and turned it into an
utter abomination kind of Gods.

468
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,700
A lot of people use this one.
Does anyone use kind regards?

469
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,170
You're going to admit to it. We've got one
over there. Yeah, yeah, we've got a few,

470
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,170
you know, it's fine. It's probably okay.

471
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:22,410
I just think it's a bit overly formal
for most situations in the modern

472
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:28,060
workplace. And I think when you do
that and you go a bit too formal,

473
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,580
it can come off as standoffish and a bit
stuffy and maybe it's maybe not giving

474
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,590
the impression that
you quite want to give.

475
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,633
Okay.

476
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,950
Cheers. I used it as all the time with
my colleagues and I'm also friends with,

477
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,230
and I think that's fine
in an informal situation,

478
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,470
but as your default sign off
is probably not appropriate.

479
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,350
It's a little bit too informal.
So it's just striking that balance.

480
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,530
Ah, thanks in advance again, this is,

481
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,860
and I've saved the west the last
because I really hate thanks in advance.

482
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,150
Why do I hate it so much?
Because it's,

483
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,340
sorry, let me gather my thoughts. Okay.
Does, I mean it's just so presumptuous,

484
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,970
um,
because that's not how gratitude works.

485
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,470
You don't think someone before
they've agreed to do something right.

486
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,180
It's just saying like,
Oh yeah,

487
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:20,150
you realize that you have no
way of getting out of this. Um,

488
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:22,430
say I hate thanks in advance.
Um,

489
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,160
definitely want to avoid thanks
someone after doing something.

490
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,030
Oh, right. So email sign offs.

491
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,880
Um, great. So we've gone through pretty
much all the main parts of doing an email.

492
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:44,830
So you're ready to send
it. One last thing, um,

493
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:49,060
and actually I think this is,
if you take one thing from this talk,

494
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,540
let it be this. Let's all
agree on how to use SI. Si.

495
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,080
I'm serious.
So when should you cc on an email?

496
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:04,350
So obviously this is when you're
sending an email to all recipients.

497
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,160
It's a very simple rule.
There is a strict rule for this.

498
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,880
The two field is for primary recipients
of an email who are expected to respond.

499
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,890
The CC field is for people who need to
see the email for reference only and who

500
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,550
are not expected to respond.
Now, I didn't come up for this.

501
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,450
I'm not reinventing the wheel.
Do you know the um,

502
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:31,110
the big old fashioned etiquette guide,
the brats, the edition I have at home,

503
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:35,280
it's got two pages in the whole thing
dedicated to the whole of digital

504
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:39,030
communications. That's about the same
as it has for how to address a bishop.

505
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,160
But even it's includes this cc rule.

506
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,970
That's how important it
is. Um, why is it useful?

507
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,440
You're just making very clear what your
expect expectations on your recipients.

508
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,050
Ah,
and so that is again,

509
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,280
reducing the burden of
email stress on the world.

510
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,550
Uh, if people are on CC, they
know they don't need to respond.

511
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,650
If they're in the to field,
they know they have to.

512
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:09,550
Obviously the problem here is that not
everyone may be aware of this rule.

513
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,710
So what you can do to help
kind of establish good
email hygiene is if you send

514
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:20,020
an email, you could just say, so you can
just put something like a to those on cc,

515
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,400
no need to respond.
This is just an Fyi.

516
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,170
And then you don't end up in that kind
of awkward situation where you've got

517
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:32,171
people who you just included as a kind
of courtesy responding and turning it

518
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:35,840
into this whole thread from hell.
Actually that's another point on CC.

519
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,790
Like when should you include people on cc?

520
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,770
Obviously the kind of top level
rule of reducing email, uh,

521
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,120
means you should only include
people when it's necessary. However,

522
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,930
people's feelings kind of
Trump that productivity.

523
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,780
I'm so good at ACAP means taking
peep other people into consideration.

524
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,920
So if you're, for example,
emailing a whole team of people,

525
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,600
you really need to include the mall.
You can't just include half of them,

526
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,510
even if not everyone is
on a need to know basis.

527
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,380
And so I call that tossing
a to CCC. It's like, ah,

528
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,950
I'm including you even though
I don't really care. Um,
but yeah, just so everyone,

529
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,840
no one feels left out. Um, cc,
however, it isn't always a courtesy.

530
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,710
Has anyone ever been in that position
where someone emails you to ask you to do

531
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:31,610
something or maybe even complain about
something you've done and they so

532
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,910
thoughtfully think to cc
your boss? Yeah, that's,

533
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:40,580
that's not a courtesy cc that
should be avoided at all costs.

534
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,360
It's very, it's not even passive
aggressive. It's just aggressive. Um,

535
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,630
and the thing is if you genuinely
need to complain about someone,

536
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,460
you should be going through
the correct channels, right?

537
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:54,260
You shouldn't be sort of doing the
snide like cc or superiors. Um,

538
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,690
it's, it's, it's like
blackmail. It's like saying,

539
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,510
if you don't respond to this
email how I want you to,

540
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,420
you're going to be in trouble.
So don't do that.

541
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,130
Now that is of course an
alternative to CC BCC a,

542
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:14,510
it stands for blind carbon copy,
as you will know. So if, um,

543
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,780
if you send an email to someone
and include someone on BCC,

544
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,260
your original recipient can't tell
that anyone else is privy to that

545
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:24,860
conversation.
That means it can be incredibly sneaky.

546
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:29,450
And for that reason, it's
usually very poor advocates. Um,

547
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,060
and dabettes actually covers this as well.
It says,

548
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:36,560
if you need to loop someone in on an
email conversation confidentially,

549
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,000
you should forward the email to
them with a note explaining why it's

550
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,843
confidential.

551
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,270
That way you don't get in one of those
awkward situations where someone doesn't

552
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:49,410
realize they were on BCC and
not cc, et Cetera, et cetera.

553
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,370
But the Rfu situations where BCC is
not only acceptable but very necessary,

554
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,830
okay

555
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:02,330
to protect people's identities. So if
you're emailing a whole group of people,

556
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,570
you don't want to reveal their names
and their email addresses to each other,

557
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,700
email it to yourself and put everyone
else on BCC. This is super important.

558
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:14,210
Sometimes it can even be a
legal requirement. In 2016,

559
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,480
there was a linden NHS
clinic, um, the accident,

560
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:23,481
he revealed the identity of hundreds of
people who do use an HIV clinic because

561
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:28,050
someone forgot to put them on BCC.
So they will all leave together. Uh,

562
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,220
they will obviously find lots for that.
Um,

563
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,060
hopefully you guys aren't doing
anything quite as sensitive as that,

564
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:39,800
but it's still useful to use.
So void of reply all apocalypse.

565
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,920
Do you all know what I mean? If I
say a reply or apocalypse? Yeah.

566
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,460
When someone sends an email usually to
like an office mailing list and they

567
00:36:46,461 --> 00:36:48,020
think it's just for their department,

568
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:52,250
but it ends up being like the whole
office and also all the global offices and

569
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,800
someone replies back in,
they're like, the classic,

570
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,330
take me off this thread and then everyone
else does and you end up with this

571
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:01,490
huge pile up. Um, so BCC,

572
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:03,920
if you're emailing lots of people
and you want to avoid that,

573
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,870
it can be a useful tool because all the
people who are on BCC on not able to

574
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:12,560
reply all, they can only reply to the
person who actually sent the email.

575
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,650
Another example also
from the NHS actually,

576
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,850
which apparently has some work to do
on its email skills. Um, they had,

577
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,900
if you think,
you know,

578
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,960
reply or apocalypses that you've seen
have been that they had one also in 2016

579
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:32,650
at the effected the entirety of Nhs Mail
and it resulted and around 500 million

580
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:37,920
emails being sent because they were all
sent to every other person with an NF

581
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:41,810
test mail address. Um,
so yeah, it can be bad.

582
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:43,950
Okay.

583
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,330
To nobody saves someone else's inbox at,
this is a quite specific situation,

584
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,840
but it actually comes up all the time.
Um,

585
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,900
so this is when someone emails you and
a colleague with a request and you say,

586
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,030
Oh, you know what, actually I'm
better placed to deal with this. Uh,

587
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,900
no need for my colleague to be involved.

588
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,480
So what you should do is respond to them.

589
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,510
Move your colleague to bcc and say in
the email something to the effective,

590
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,090
Hey,
I'm best placed to deal with this,

591
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,890
moving Sally to bcc to save her inbox.
And that means that Sally,

592
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,390
well then no longer receive any more
emails on the thread. So you, you know,

593
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:31,170
it's the ultimate act of
email self sacrifice, right?

594
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,680
You're taking on that thread and saying
actually you didn't need be involved,

595
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,910
don't worry about it. So that's some
real, that's a really good thing to do.

596
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,161
Um,
okay,

597
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:47,020
we're coming to the end now cause I think
we've covered most of the major points.

598
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,330
Um, oh just as I was talking about a
reply or apocalypse and using the all all

599
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:55,390
office email address, I
thought I had to end. Um,

600
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,130
obviously if you've been paying attention,

601
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,760
you should be able to work out for now
that you should never really be using an

602
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:03,550
all office email address
unless you really have to.

603
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,690
The three circumstances
under which it is acceptable,

604
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,730
a genuine emergency,

605
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,320
unofficial announcement and free food.

606
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,920
Now one of those is a joke.
Can you tell which one?

607
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,120
Genuine emergency you shouldn't
be emailing in a fire. Um,

608
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,320
thank you very much
everyone for listening.

609
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,390
My Name's Victoria Tech digital ads to
get the book it's out this week. Um,

610
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,590
that's my Twitter handle. If you
want to tweet abuse at me later. Um,

611
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,040
and I think we're going
to have some questions.

612
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,013
Thank you very much.

613
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,250
Sorry for questions.

614
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,290
Please go to the microphone in the middle
of the room so we can all hear you. Um,

615
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:58,580
um, uh, yeah, while you're going
there. The first question about me,

616
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,660
um, you talked about, uh, business,

617
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:04,820
email of Worki mo mostly.
Um,

618
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:09,821
do you see any general difference
between a work email and uh,

619
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,870
and personal email?

620
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,500
Um,

621
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,760
I have to say I don't really know that
many people who emailed in their personal

622
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:21,370
lives that much anymore. Does
anyone here email for fun? A couple?

623
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,810
Um, yeah, obviously the
rules are very different. Um,

624
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,870
it all goes back to kind of that
context of how far we need to be.

625
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,390
If you're actually genuinely
friends with people,

626
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,480
you can be a lot more kind
of free any spoken. Um,

627
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,860
and you don't have to abide
by the rules so much. Um,

628
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,570
I think the really interesting thing about
email actually is that it can kind of

629
00:40:44,571 --> 00:40:46,610
take the place of
several different things.

630
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,840
It used to be very much used
like a snail mail letter.

631
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,280
Now it's often used more
like a text message. Um,

632
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,890
and I think in your personal life you're
probably going to be doing more of the

633
00:40:57,891 --> 00:41:01,880
latter. Yeah. Use laser were
majors would be my advice.

634
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,360
All right,
so

635
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,580
let's,

636
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,520
let's start with the assumption that all
of the people in the room now are able

637
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:14,140
to craft the perfect evening
now at the right times and like,

638
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,400
we're all going to be good.

639
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:20,401
But how do we actually deal with
receiving emails that are not appropriate?

640
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:21,220
I mean,

641
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,840
how do we actually respond to
the thanks in advance at night?

642
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,950
And how do we encourage people to
like follow the digital etiquette?

643
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,960
Preston?
Yeah.

644
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,870
Mean obviously it would be quite poor
etiquette if you went off at your

645
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,700
colleague for using thanks in advance.
Um,

646
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,660
so there's not much you can do on
that one except for kind of, you know,

647
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,550
silently enjoy the feeling of self
worth you get from doing it better. Um,

648
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,370
for email sent at nights.

649
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:54,730
I think workplaces on the whole should
establish kind of better codes of conduct

650
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:59,240
when it comes to email is so often this
thing that it's assumed that everyone

651
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:01,250
knows how to do it and
how to do it correctly.

652
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:06,530
And actually expectations just vary so
widely that that's clearly not the case.

653
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,450
So I think every workplace should have,

654
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:13,451
I kind of standard set of rules on when
you're supposed to be emailing a knots.

655
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,230
It's really funny isn't it?

656
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,980
Because we all seem to assume now that
we have smartphones and that we are

657
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:23,180
technically contactable most of the
time that we need to always be on call.

658
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,250
Like I'm a culture journalist.

659
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,060
There's not many emergencies where I'm
going to be the person that someone calls.

660
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:33,320
And yet even I'm like, Oh gosh, I've got
an email. I better check it just in case.

661
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,470
Um, I don't think that's
ever been super urgent. Um,

662
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,070
but it is hard to get out
of that mentality. So I do
think as send it, I send us,

663
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:46,440
you have to, the kind of onus to fix
that is on you if we receive, uh,

664
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:49,930
obviously, um, if it's
possible, just don't answer it.

665
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,310
I think people get different expectations
around different people based on your

666
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:57,790
behavior as well. If they know that
you're going to answer it 11:00 PM,

667
00:42:57,791 --> 00:43:00,610
because you always do,
they're probably going to keep doing that.

668
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,320
Whereas if you establish that kind of
routine where actually I don't answer my

669
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:06,154
emails until,

670
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,270
okay,

671
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,040
eight 30 in the morning
or nine in the morning,

672
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:13,210
then they may end up respecting
that without you having
to actually say anything.

673
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,190
Okay.

674
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:20,940
Oh, hi. Thanks for the talk on the
subject of the email sign offs, uh,

675
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,520
one option which you didn't mention
is how about having no sign of a, all,

676
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,170
there's something I do sometimes and
take a picture plane to an existing

677
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:30,780
conversation or a
colleague I Novell faster.

678
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,630
Yeah. Um, I'd say that similar
to the greeting at the beginning,

679
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:38,350
if you're having a back and forth with
someone you don't need to sign off. Um,

680
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,460
and I often actually just sign off
with the Letter v the first and it says

681
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:47,170
letter of my name. Um, and
I think in that context,

682
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:51,850
that's fine. The first email you send,
I think you do need to sign off. Um,

683
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,241
again,

684
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:55,780
I'm see if it's a more sort of acting
more like a letter than a text message,

685
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,160
then you need sign off.

686
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,610
But I don't think there's anything
rude about having no sign off if you're

687
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:03,820
treating it like a back and forth
conversation. I think that's fine.

688
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,030
Hey, thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming. Um,

689
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,000
you talked about email and
professional environment.

690
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm sure that in the book you also talk
about personal relationships as you said.

691
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,343
Can you,

692
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,190
can we hear your thoughts on what we
call the dictatorship of the blue tick?

693
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,210
You know, like when you send a message,
someone sees that you sold, I have sex,

694
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,690
you want someone's story on
Instagram and they're like,

695
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:28,090
I know that you've walked through
it and you didn't see anything.

696
00:44:28,091 --> 00:44:32,220
And then there's like, oh, am
I supposed to do? Yeah, being

697
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,370
left on red is excruciating,
right?

698
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:39,600
When you can see someone's read your
whatsapp and they haven't bothered to

699
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:43,860
respond and you're like, but
you had time to check in. Um,

700
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:49,440
what do I think about that? I think
you shouldn't leave people on red. Um,

701
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,570
I think we've probably shouldn't
be so neurotic about it,

702
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:54,810
but I don't know how to fix
that. Um, I'm terrible for this.

703
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,050
I read so much into those
little boutiques. Um,

704
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,220
so I think if I relate
it back to inbox zero,

705
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:03,630
which I mentioned earlier,

706
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,490
part of the rules of inbox zero
is if you check your inbox,

707
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,850
if you check an email, you have to
have time to do something about it.

708
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,590
There's no point looking at it.

709
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,720
If you know you're not gonna be able to
do anything about it cause then you're

710
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:18,210
just going to have to read it twice and
you've kind of doubled the amount of

711
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:19,044
time spent on it.

712
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,370
I think it would be good to apply a
kind of similar idea to your whatsapp

713
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:27,000
messages if you're checking them,
you should have time to answer.

714
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:32,460
Um, and that way you don't end up
leaving people on red. And again,

715
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:33,900
it could be the same where, you know, if,

716
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,040
if it's someone kind of trying to organize
a dinner and asking you lots of dates

717
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:40,410
and you need to check your calendar,
you can just respond like, oh,

718
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:42,310
check this later.
Um,

719
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,000
but that way they at least know
that you've seen that message.

720
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:49,740
Because that's the thing about
the blue ticks is we used to,

721
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,020
you know,
before you had them,

722
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,900
someone could see your
message and not respond to it,

723
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,320
but you wouldn't be so bothered
about it because you just,

724
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:02,550
you could invent all these myths about
why they hadn't responded. Like, oh,

725
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,270
they haven't dead their phone. Oh, they're
probably really busy. Oh, you know,

726
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:10,680
maybe they died in a ditch. Um,
but when you see the blue ticks,

727
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,070
you know, they've actually seen it
and that's what's so irritating.

728
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,210
Do you acknowledge that most of us don't
use email for personal stuff anymore?

729
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,650
Do you think that it's entirely a good
thing? Or there's cases for example,

730
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:27,390
like planning a holiday or something.

731
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,140
Would a whatsapp group or an email
thread to be better for that?

732
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,190
That's an interesting question cause I
just tried to hop to plan a holiday with

733
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:40,400
my family over whatsapp and
like we all fell out. Um,

734
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,870
it was a disaster.
Would email have been better,

735
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,300
you know, for something like that
where it involves lots of discussion.

736
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,080
I think the best thing is
an actual conversation.

737
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,460
Obviously that isn't always possible.
I suppose the advantage of emails,

738
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:59,010
you can include more information,

739
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,560
you can put links to stuff
and things like that. Um,

740
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,840
yeah, I mean I just think, I don't even
know most of my friends email addresses.

741
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:09,723
Um,

742
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,740
so I just think it's not the kind of go
to communication for those more sort of

743
00:47:14,741 --> 00:47:17,290
friendly situations these days.
Maybe it should be.

744
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,810
Maybe we should just try to revive it.

745
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:23,920
I think maybe everyone's so put off email
just from work email and it just being

746
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:27,100
so terrible. Um, that I'm,

747
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,870
I'm kind of loath to try to that
into my private life. Thanks.

748
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:39,670
Well transfer questions. Um, thanks.

749
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:41,440
Good Talk.
Um,

750
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:47,590
having sent email for decades,
I'm from a very nerdy,

751
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,660
um,
sort of area.

752
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,790
The majority of males I dealt with
were reply in line with the Chevron

753
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,040
invitation.
Moving the thread was he as a follow up,

754
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,000
oh my God,

755
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,240
look came up,

756
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,050
came along and the curse of flushed at
the top and sort of new generation of non

757
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,710
tech started just replying
top posting and a,

758
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:10,500
it's a different style of email arrived
and then you can't mix the two at all.

759
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:13,370
Google, I thought I'd given
up and the second sale.

760
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:17,270
But at Google it's surprising there's
a good 40%. Males are replying lines.

761
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,650
Lists like this is still
survived as a, as a thing. And I,

762
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,990
I just wanted to know what your,
your take on that was. You know,

763
00:48:24,991 --> 00:48:27,840
should I just give up and I'm just
an old timer and I should just,

764
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,170
or is this really,
it can lead to quite a nice thread,

765
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:32,850
a very good easy way to
follow what's going on.

766
00:48:32,851 --> 00:48:36,720
You're applying to
specific bits or discuss.

767
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,220
Yeah,
that's a really good point actually,

768
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:42,160
because that I think is when
things can go really wrong is when,

769
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,330
is when you mix the two.
Right?

770
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:46,960
And so the thread goes completely
out of control and it's kind of part

771
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:50,860
chronological and then it skipped
something and you're like, whoa. Um,

772
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,001
I'd say,

773
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:56,950
I think most people don't even think
about this and they rely on the technology

774
00:48:56,951 --> 00:49:00,130
to do it for them. Um, I don't,

775
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,650
I'm not sure if I have a particular
preference for one or the other.

776
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:04,390
I think the problem is if you're mixing,

777
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,090
so as soon as the threat is
established in a certain way,

778
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:10,930
you should just follow suit.
That's probably the best
answer I have on that one.

779
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,590
Which do you prefer and line?
Yeah.

780
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,440
All right. Oh, we are at the end. Oh. So
once again, thank you very much, Victoria.

781
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,610
Thank you.
