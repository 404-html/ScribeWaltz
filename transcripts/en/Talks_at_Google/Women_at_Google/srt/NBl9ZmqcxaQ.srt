well over 200 people signed up,

19
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:17,731
so good morning everyone on the GBC
and welcome back to Google Morgan.

20
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:19,450
Thank you.

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,170
Maureen and I ran into each other in
the hallway this morning and one of the

22
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:27,490
reasons I was so intrigued come in and
speak with you was I met Maureen in the

23
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:31,540
past. She was, um, at
the time, CEO of Chanel,

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,080
one of the most coveted
accounts in the New York office.

25
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,150
I might add on all of our sales
executives from transcend very,

26
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:44,300
very specially when the
Chanel team came in. Uh,

27
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,980
and they got a lot of
love from us and Maureen,

28
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,240
you were really pushing your team to,
uh,

29
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,590
drive more value through
digital marketing.

30
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:57,670
And so clearly a lot of
leadership insight there.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,720
But I read the book review, uh, uh,

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,360
beyond the label Marines first book.
Um,

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,390
and I was intrigued and I sent the
review to our director of leadership

34
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:13,940
development because I thought there were
so many leadership lessons in here and

35
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,690
I said, we might want to get marine to
come to Google and tell us about this. Uh,

36
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,120
Maureen, you were running a
$5 billion global company,

37
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:27,121
one of the most iconic brands in the
genre of fashion and high end luxury.

38
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,990
And suddenly it stopped. Uh,
December, 2015 was it? It was,

39
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,080
it was January, 2016. Right.

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,050
So you've had this meteoric career.
You're one of the monkeys, Myers Ceos,

41
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,180
a female CEOs in your
industry, but also, you know,

42
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,810
an American CEO of this iconic
crunch brand. And then it stops,

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,190
I think, talk a little bit about what
it felt like and the disorientation.

44
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,980
Describe in the book. I would love to.
So there's a, there's a story in the

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,480
book and it's the first story and I'll
give you a sort of brief synopsis and let

46
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,190
you read the rest.
But you know,

47
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:10,960
from one day to the next I found
myself no longer with a, with a title,

48
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:13,840
with a label of global,
of Chanel.

49
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,090
And as part of what I was going through
I think, and I think, to be honest,

50
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,860
it was a moment for me
of both freedom in a way.

51
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:28,180
Cause I had been working in a company
for over 30 years in companies.

52
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:33,070
I had three major companies, L'Oreal gap
and all three divisions. And then Chanel.

53
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,300
And so while at one point it was kind of
liberating. It was, I was also grieving.

54
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,040
I mean it was really hard because I
found myself without knowing who I was

55
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:46,270
anymore. And the story goes that
I decided for whatever reason,

56
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,740
y'all probably think I'm crazy,

57
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,910
but I decided I need to purge my closets.

58
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,840
I have been wearing the
same uniform for 13 years.

59
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,950
I know it's a really wonderful treat to
be able to wear this kind of uniform.

60
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,020
For me it was jeans cause I, you know,
you can't give up your roots. So I had,

61
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,540
I had my, my denim jeans. Any variety
of denim jeans. What's your favorite?

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,600
Well, at the time, at the
time I was wearing j Brown,

63
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,810
but I've now transitioned to rag and bone.
I really liked there.

64
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,350
I'm giving them a plug. I hope they're
happy now. So all you Google earth,

65
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,730
I just think they're really comfortable,
well made and beautiful fabrics.

66
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,040
But I would wear any variety of j brand
jeans back then. My American apparel,

67
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,510
now they're going out of
business unfortunately,

68
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:36,400
tank tops and a Chanel jacket every
day, 13 years. That's what I wore.

69
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,700
So I had this moment,
I need to purge my closet.

70
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,910
I did that and I realized that all I
had left or tank tops a few woven shirts

71
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:52,210
from a company called Hartford and
these genes. So I thought, oh my God,

72
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:55,600
what am I gonna do? So I call it
Jeffrey is a store in New York.

73
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,890
I called Jeffery and I said,
are texted him. S O s I need,

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,090
I need clothes. I'm sorry, what
did you do with the old ones?

75
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,880
I know everybody has their about,
I don't know if you've just myths.

76
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,970
They're about 10 closets
full of my basement. But, um,

77
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,600
I still haven't done anything with them,
but I really, it was, you know, I know,

78
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,630
I know everybody. I know.
I haven't figured it out.

79
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,450
I haven't had time to figure it out.
But,

80
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,500
so I went into Jefferson
and I'm a merchant at heart
and meaning I love clothes

81
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:30,610
and I feel them. And I love to think
about what looks good in stores.

82
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,940
So I walked in probably the most
intimidated I had ever been because I felt

83
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:39,820
almost nude. You know, I
felt naked at this point.

84
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:44,260
I had on some of my converse sneakers
and jeans and I'm touching the mannequins

85
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,960
and they're looking down
at me and I'm thinking, you
know, I don't belong anymore.

86
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,540
I don't know where I belong.
And fortunately thanks to the team there,

87
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,200
they littered the, the dressing room
at all different options. And you know,

88
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,750
my first instinct was to go over to
my old identity, cause by the way,

89
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:02,210
this is a story about clothes,
but it's really a story about identity.

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,940
And I started looking at all the jackets.

91
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,050
That's all I could see was fitted jackets,
Chanel type jackets. And they said, no,

92
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:12,380
why don't we show you some other things,
wide leg pants and you know,

93
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:16,190
this kind of jacket and an underpinnings
and all these things that I hadn't ever

94
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,024
thought about wearing.

95
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,080
And I started looking at myself in the
mirror and I thought, oh my God, I'm,

96
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
there's a person in
there beyond the label,

97
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,480
really beyond the label
of global CEO of Chanel.

98
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,720
And it was the beginning of the process
that I went through a rediscovering who

99
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,900
I was after this 13 year stint as the CEO,

100
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,230
13 years spent as Theo Chanel

101
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,600
hurting your closet is a metaphor for
purging your life. That's exactly right.

102
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,460
Yeah. Your marriage of 26
years, is it the perch that to

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,730
automatic way it was, you
know, it wasn't dramatic. It's,

104
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,650
it's interesting to be in
the situation where I'm,

105
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:02,120
and I think in honesty of wonderful,
wonderful relationship,

106
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,460
which is still there is a friendship.

107
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,720
And to recognize that and to
be able to say, can we be,

108
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,190
can we evolve this relationship from
what it is and go beyond our own labels,

109
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:17,440
basically cool to into a friendship.
And so Antoine, I call him,

110
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:19,800
I was banned. And so, um,

111
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,090
because we're best friends
and he lives in Africa.

112
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:26,480
His passion and his work is in,
is really in,

113
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,420
in setting up NGO's in Africa.
So he's living in Burgundy. Um,

114
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,050
he does a lot of work also in Uganda.
Um,

115
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,710
but I also realize that what
was interesting about our,

116
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,490
our relationship is so much of what he
had to do in so many ways was follow me.

117
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,410
And this allowed him to follow him. So it
was a real opening. And now I say this,

118
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:50,330
it sounds really easy, but I cried
for three months and I kid you not,

119
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,320
this was not an easy thing,
but it was a, you know, you're
right. It was a, it was a,

120
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,110
it was a kind of identity. It
wasn't, I even hate to say purging,

121
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,870
maybe a strong word,

122
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,180
but do you think had your
separation from Chanel not happen,

123
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:10,160
do you think you would have been
provoked to, to, to your label?

124
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,010
You know, it's interesting.
Um, my marriage,

125
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,420
we were separated long before
I left to Chanel. And um,

126
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,350
it was interesting for me actually to
go through that. I'm not this, I'm not,

127
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,810
I don't want to talk too much
cause it's going to be the,

128
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:26,180
I think it will be the subject of my
next book. I know I would love to,

129
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,340
I'd love to talk more.
I, we can talk. I, I,

130
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,120
cause I haven't formulated all my
ideals. Um, but you know, it was, and I,

131
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,300
I don't,
you know how sometimes when you're in it,

132
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,690
and I think I'm the way I'm
still in that you're not exactly,

133
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:42,070
you don't have a distance enough to say,
what did I glean from this? Or what,

134
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,670
what questions can I ask?

135
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,660
What observations can I make that might
help other people going through major

136
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:52,310
transformations? Um, I, you know, I,
I'm, I'm still in the transformation.

137
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:55,710
I think kind of, we always are,
right? But this one was a big one.

138
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,330
It's remarkable in so many strong
women are giving voice to what it is we

139
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,310
variance in life. Um, Sheryl
Sandberg, who was one of the founding,

140
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,890
um,
she was the founder of women at Google,

141
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,490
which was here I had just come out
with option B and her whole premise of

142
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,950
resilience and you learn,

143
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,820
you actually learn how through
a difficult transitions,

144
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:26,720
just how resilient you can be and
resilience himself is a learned skill.

145
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,840
Is that something that you've
been toying with or has it,

146
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,220
I haven't been able to read the book yet.

147
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,870
Yeah, you know, in fact,
very early on in my career,

148
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,550
I started learning this
notion of resilience and I,
there's a story in there.

149
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,790
When I was a young merchant at the gap,
now you have to understand,

150
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:48,200
I was at L'Oreal for three years.
I was pretty sure,

151
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,600
and I had no idea by the way,
that when I went to L'Oreal,

152
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:54,960
I was going to be a marketer.
I studied literature. So I'll

153
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,930
at least in the room, maybe some
out there. Hi, you always. But I,

154
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,630
um,
I studied film as a literary form.

155
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,530
So as looking at imagery and trying to
understand the emotion that's created

156
00:10:09,531 --> 00:10:13,400
with image, and it was, I'd never thought
about that might be career marketing,

157
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:16,010
but how logical is that
really amazing at L'Oreal,

158
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:19,490
which is such a visual marketer.
Exactly. And so I fell in, in,

159
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:23,390
in really in the right place. But I'd
come from this three years and I had,

160
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,670
I gone on the road they sent,

161
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
L'Oreal has this great program where
they sent me actually to the north of

162
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:31,250
France, which is the industrial
part of France. I mean,

163
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:34,900
all my friends were going to, you know,
that could, that could desi on I'm,

164
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,940
and I'm in the north of France
with the coal mines. Um, and they,

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and they actually asked you to sell
L'Oreal products out of a suitcase and

166
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:44,120
you're trapped.

167
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,920
You're basically traveling salesmen to
hypermarkets hypermarkets or three times

168
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:51,410
the size of your local
supermarket. I mean, at least,

169
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,590
and I would meet with these guys
and there's a story in there.

170
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,210
I met with one guy and he
buys, you know, he bought ps,

171
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,310
he bought sanitary concerns and he bought
hair gel. Now you can imagine, and hair.

172
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:08,540
And I was selling Moose that day and
you know, his hair's all slicked back.

173
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,100
And I'm thinking,
maybe I should change my marketing.

174
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,940
I've got the marketing speak and I'm
giving my sales pitch. And he's like,

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,720
finally, he said, no, no, no,
no. Look, let's, let's talk
about the UNCAP. How about,

176
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,640
you know,
how much will you give?

177
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:22,700
And we started going back and forth and
I realized that I actually had to step

178
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:26,480
in his shoes to understand. But all that
to say, I came out of L'Oreal. Sure.

179
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,640
I was a marketer actually.
Sure.

180
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,900
And I got to the gap and it turned out
they actually had advertising at that

181
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,530
point, not marketing. So they had said,
you know, you're going to be a merchant.

182
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,600
And I thought this is great.
I mean,

183
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,480
I like looking at beautiful
products and selecting them.

184
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,590
My interview with the CEO,
then Mickey Drexler had gone really well.

185
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:50,390
I picked out some bags. I'm like,
oh, I can accent. Well, not so fast.

186
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,030
I found myself pretty much in a sample
closet the first several months trying to

187
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,680
sort through all the very,
you know,

188
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,860
the disarray of different products that
hadn't been organized in several years.

189
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,380
And then I had to learn this thing
called the open to buy, which was a,

190
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,600
it's a tool that manager inventory.
And um,

191
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,580
I had a difficult boss and he
one day said to me, you know,

192
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:16,750
I had lost again, lost. I had not
knowing where some Paisley bags were.

193
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,740
And he got very angry at me and told me
he wasn't going to teach me the open to

194
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,860
buy, that I had to learn on my
own. I, you know, and this is,

195
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:27,100
I'm a young person and I'm
also the sole breadwinner,

196
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,350
so he had yelled at me to such a
degree that I found myself crying,

197
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:37,320
calling my mom, this is what you do
when, right. Call Mom. So My, you know,

198
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,150
my mom had at that point said to me,
and you're talking about resilience.

199
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:43,270
She said, well honey, I hate
to see you working so hard.

200
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:45,010
I was working 12 hour days.

201
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,520
I didn't understand this thing called
the open to buy. I never been a merchant.

202
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:52,210
I realized that it was way harder than
anybody had told me in the beginning or

203
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:55,930
that I at least had surmised. And so she
said, why don't you do something else?

204
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:59,290
I said, but I want to be close
to creativity. And by the way,

205
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,280
no Google at that time,

206
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:05,050
this was back in 1989 if I had
known I might've come here. No,

207
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,580
I love,
I love the gap so much,

208
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:09,340
but I was so wanting to be
close to that creativity.

209
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,990
I sit and I was watching the
old, the older, you know, the,

210
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,880
the levels above me and what they were
getting to do and are working with design

211
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,820
teams and picking these
beautiful close up for the store.

212
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,940
So I stuck in there and I said,
mom, I'm going to stick it out.

213
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:26,170
And I think it was a very early
lesson in resilience, the resilience,

214
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,440
which is basically for me about when
you care so deeply about something and

215
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,400
you're kind of willing to tough out some
of those moments that aren't as easy.

216
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,270
And I care deeply about being close
to creative. I love that story.

217
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,180
Uh,

218
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,420
but because there is something in your
twenties where you prompt this sense of

219
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:47,700
who you want to be professionally,

220
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,130
you really do have to learn your
stuff your way into it, Tony. And, uh,

221
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,930
the ability to be patient with yourself,
uh,

222
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,480
and learn the tools of the trade.

223
00:13:57,481 --> 00:14:02,481
I think those are important lessons
because I often say too many Googlers who

224
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:08,040
are by and large,
a very high capability,

225
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,880
ambitious group. You're going to
be working for probably 30 years.

226
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,210
This is a marathon and enjoy this journey.

227
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,250
So you had quite a journey through,
okay. Marketing, merchandising,

228
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:23,780
and then what I would call
leadership. Yeah. Yeah. You

229
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,840
were, you were senior of
the gap when you left work.

230
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,170
No, no, no, no. I was, I was president
of Banana Republic. That's it.

231
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:31,521
All right,

232
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:36,521
so now Republican and then
to be selected or a Chanel,

233
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,980
maybe you have an unusual
profile. You're bilingual, right?

234
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,720
You had worked in Krantz earlier,

235
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,260
but that is a leadership
daunting leadership.

236
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:49,370
Remember we talked sometimes at
Google about imposter syndrome.

237
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:52,370
When you show up somewhere,
if all of a sudden you realize,

238
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,380
wow,
everyone else is really knowledgeable.

239
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,950
How did it feel walking into the story
of house of Chanel and taking up your,

240
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,850
well, first of all, it was incredibly,

241
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,060
incredibly exhilarating and intimidating
and I remember standing in Gabrielle

242
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,670
Chanel's apartment,
it's beautiful.

243
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:16,320
Crystal Chandelier and I
talked about this in booking,

244
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,230
gazing up and then going to these fashion
shows in the 17th century convent.

245
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:25,130
Cool. And, and the, and and you
know, the beautiful detailed,

246
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,110
intricate couture. I had never seen
anything like this. And then here's a,

247
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,450
here's a brand that has a hundred year,
almost a hundred here.

248
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Your history and gap is that was created
in 1969 and so I didn't I that the

249
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:44,351
richness of that and how do you take
that forward into this very different

250
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:50,030
future was going to be, I knew one of my
biggest challenges, but as the story go,

251
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:53,810
who is, when I started in CEO, so
this is after three years of training,

252
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:57,650
by the way, three years of training. So
I've taught, you talked about patients,

253
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:59,540
I think I learned to cultivate patients,

254
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,430
but the first year they had sent me
to France to just listen and learn,

255
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,960
put a tape on my mouth.
I said,

256
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,940
basically we launch in France
and then around the world,

257
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,760
we want you to meet
everybody in anybody you can.

258
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,170
I went into every single department from
creative to the factories to, you know,

259
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:19,190
finance visited with all the teams
and all I could do is ask questions,

260
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,860
which you said you're not allowed
to make a decision for a full year.

261
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,600
So that was humbling, very humbling.
And after about nine months I was going,

262
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,640
I want to do something.
And you know,

263
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:30,680
you're seeing these things
that you think you can do,

264
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,710
but this house has such a beautiful
storied history that you really do have to

265
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,500
learn the ropes first.
But when I came finally to become,

266
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,530
when I probably became CEO in 2007 that
was equally a hurdle because I actually

267
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:50,111
found myself at the table at the head of
a table of 10 men and all of them were

268
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,300
in their beautiful suits and cc logo ties.

269
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,890
Now I knew them because I'd been there,

270
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,120
but all of a sudden I was at
the head and I was 43 years old.

271
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,940
I'm American then most of them are French.
Most of them were a decade, if not two,

272
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,120
my senior.
And they all had,

273
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:09,230
not three years but about 20
years of luxury experience.

274
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,820
So that was the beginning of actually
tapping into a different kind of

275
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:18,260
leadership that I, you know, I had always
thought about leadership is, you know,

276
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:22,640
the idea of take charge, demand, respect,
you know, be focused, be strategic,

277
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,640
have a vision and that
wasn't going to work.

278
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,210
I wasn't going to work because
they had such deep history,

279
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,830
such such deep knowledge that I had to
figure out how I was going to integrate

280
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,270
the things I was seeing.

281
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,110
And certainly the digital world
that was coming out that, you know,

282
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,780
really 2007 was the beginning
of the major digital revolution.

283
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,370
And I had to figure that out.

284
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:48,371
So I realized that it was going to be
through asking questions through actually

285
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:50,520
sitting on their side of the table,

286
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:55,320
not trying to push my agenda and actually
being vulnerable saying, you know,

287
00:17:55,321 --> 00:18:00,060
guys, I don't know this help. It was
it collaborating with them, you know,

288
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,350
mixing ideas and actually opening
questions to everybody so that we could

289
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:08,520
actually co create a future. And that
was that, that knowledge of that moment.

290
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,770
This is getting long. I'm sorry, but
I'll be good. So that, that was a PR,

291
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,910
that's a personal story.

292
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,470
But it taught me something really deep
about leadership because what I realized

293
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,240
during that moment, now this is three
major things were happening in our world.

294
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,590
The digital revolution for
you guys is incredible.

295
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,360
Now imagine yourself a luxury company
where it's all about exclusivity.

296
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,620
It's not more is more. It's not about
pushing sales are getting more exposure.

297
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,810
It's actually about making your products
rare and beautiful and connecting to

298
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:46,110
that customer. Not In en
masse, but one on one.

299
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,770
So the digital revolution
actually scared us.

300
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,020
So we had that as a great unknown.

301
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:57,021
And how are we going to be relevant in
this revolution if we are about rarity

302
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:00,500
and exclusivity. So that was the
first thing. The second thing was, um,

303
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,520
the globalization. We had been, we
had been global, but we hit the,

304
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,760
when the Chai China began to gain so much.
Well,

305
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:14,030
we had clients all over the world flooding
our boutiques from China and that was

306
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,250
hard.
We didn't know the culture that well,

307
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,600
but also we didn't know how to still
serve our loyal clients when the boutiques

308
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:26,580
were brimming. So challenge two,
challenge three and I'm looking, yeah,

309
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,530
I did all of you and
probably some of you there,

310
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:33,430
this generation that everybody's so fondly
called millennials for a luxury brand.

311
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,630
You know, and it's, it's
a patriarchal company.

312
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,190
It is based on a lot of history and you
have people who are born with devices in

313
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:45,480
their hands and who have a very different
perspective about what makes up a

314
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:46,314
luxury company,

315
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,440
not to mention mention different values
about ethics and social behavior.

316
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,540
So as I'm sitting at this table,
and you know,

317
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,170
this happened over a
period of a few years,

318
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,510
I realized that what I learned when I
came into the unknown and uncertainty

319
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,470
about how I should behave as a leader
was something that the leaders in our

320
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:11,580
company would greatly benefit from.
And that we as a company,

321
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:14,000
in order to step into this,
you know,

322
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,070
new age would actually have to adopt
new leadership behaviors and shift a

323
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:20,364
culture.

324
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Were you explicit about those leadership
behaviors with your direct team?

325
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,060
Yes. And I'll tell a funny
story about that. Um,

326
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,590
so I had a coach and I had begun to
realize that these were things that were

327
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,201
starting to help me.

328
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:41,100
So when I could sit at the other
side of the table with my team,

329
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,060
when I could actually engage
in questioning and curiosity,

330
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,930
not only did our relationship got better,
but more ideas are starting to spawn.

331
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:52,810
So I said, great, I got it down.

332
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,520
I know what qualities I am going to teach
these guys what to do. And this point,

333
00:20:57,521 --> 00:20:59,680
by the way, it added some
women to the team. So we were,

334
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:03,130
now I had added six women actually.
So I,

335
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:07,750
it was a rainy day in July.
July is not a good month.

336
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,740
I couldn't control the rain.

337
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:12,550
But July is not a good month in France
because it's a month before people go on

338
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:16,960
vacation and people leave
for months about. So very
busy people are stressed out.

339
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,040
Um, and I corral my team
into a dusty ballroom and I,

340
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,740
the ballroom was 10 times
the size of this room.

341
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,620
And there were 20 of us so you
can imagine what that felt like.

342
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,900
And then I had them play those team
building games, which sometimes are good,

343
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:35,590
but when you're in a group of Europeans
and when you know you're actually

344
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,590
forcing them to be out in the rain
because we did them out of the rain.

345
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,980
I don't know what I was thinking.
That doesn't go over so out.

346
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,560
And then I got up in my band,
Stan and I started to say, listen,

347
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:48,100
we need new leadership qualities.
We need to change our culture.

348
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,680
We need to be more empathetic.
We can to be more flexible.

349
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,490
We mainly have more collaborative. You
can imagine. Okay, so Ooh is right.

350
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,500
Biggest face plant of my entire career.
How they revolt immediately?

351
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:01,630
Well,
so pretty much pretty much.

352
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:05,110
I had also brought in some consultants
from California and that just wasn't the

353
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:09,190
right mix. They felt like,
I mean, you know, they can
smell it doesn't rain here. So

354
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,550
to say they felt like I wasn't taking
into account their perspective,

355
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:16,570
their point of view.

356
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,750
There are great history and all the
things that had made them great up until

357
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:24,180
this point. So I had one of
those moments where, you know,

358
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,990
your biggest errors are usually
your greatest learnings. And um,

359
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,050
August came, took some time off. I had,

360
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,380
I had organized an offsite with a great,

361
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,450
wonderful poet and speaker named David
White and that we had to cancel at the

362
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,440
last minute. I cancelled it. I canceled
it because I thought, what am I doing?

363
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:48,310
I didn't actually listen to it
for heed, my own advice. Um,

364
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,810
I actually need to let go
of my preconceived ideas
and collaborate with them on

365
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:54,040
how they see the future.

366
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,390
So while my ideas around
leadership might be valid,

367
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,910
I'm not going about this
the right way at all.

368
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,710
So I sat down with each team member
for over two hours, one by one.

369
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:10,090
I just tell me how you see the culture.
Tell me what you hope to improve.

370
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,220
Tell me what you hope to retain. What
about you? Where are you struggling? Um,

371
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:17,730
what are you ambitions? What's
your purpose? What do you,

372
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:21,760
when you care about and how
can you contribute to what
we're going to cocreate.

373
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,340
So I gathered all that 20 hours of,
of um,

374
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,360
interviews into some themes and we met
again and this time they were completely

375
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,270
engaged and we co created something
we later called active and conscious

376
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,910
leadership journey. Oh,
so listening was cute.

377
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,770
And acknowledging their expertise,
respecting their history and their legacy.

378
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,910
So the active leadership, active and
conscious leadership journey journey.

379
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,900
Can you tell us a little bit about
that with pleasure? Um, so I,

380
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,690
one of the things I also realized is
in any company there's a very specific

381
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:03,350
culture.
And while I respect lots of consultants,

382
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,950
I knew that actually in this
culture for this company,

383
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,490
it was going to be more about
really creating something very,

384
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,840
very specific for them.

385
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:16,490
It's tailor made and that takes into
consideration not just the culture of the

386
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:19,590
company, but the business issues
that we have. Right? I mean it's, it,

387
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,450
that's what we're ultimately you will,

388
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,090
you want to create an environment
or good business can flourish and,

389
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,960
and employees are happy. So, um, I
just said, we're going to design this.

390
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:31,470
I had a coach,
we decided that we would,

391
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:36,471
we would design it together and it
started with having outside speakers just

392
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:37,520
like today.

393
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,450
Only the difference perhaps in this
situation was we would take an outside

394
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:45,800
speaker and ask them to work
with us on our questions.

395
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,430
And so that we would have a session of
speaking and then we'd go into some of

396
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:50,660
the things that were going on for us.

397
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,940
So the first speaker was a wonderful
poet by the name of David White.

398
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,620
And everybody thought it was
crazy at first, but I'll,

399
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,430
if you want to hear that story,
we can come back to that. We had,

400
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,900
so Elworthy who was a peacebuilder and
had worked with Desmond Tutu and taught

401
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:10,570
us a lot about nonviolent communication
and deep listening, we went.

402
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,350
So the idea is you were going from
inside out. So who am I as a leader?

403
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,220
What do I care about? What
triggers me? What gets me excited?

404
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,730
Then who am I in with relation
to my colleagues, my team,

405
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,170
alumni with relationship to the
business, into the world. And so the,

406
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,990
it went from inside out,
started with David White,

407
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:34,310
went to Scilla and then we
started actually with some
business leaders like Clay

408
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,930
Christiansen,
we use Dan pink.

409
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,760
And so the idea was really
try to understand how do
you connect who you are as a

410
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:45,050
human being, as an individual to your
greater business purposes. And after,

411
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,510
so this took a, and there
was that component. We,

412
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,510
each executive had a
coach and this is in the,

413
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,890
in the phase where we were just
in 20 at 20 people. Um, and they,

414
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,470
I asked them to work on, so anything
they wanted, just one thing,

415
00:25:57,471 --> 00:26:00,650
she's one thing and I mentored
them through that coaching.

416
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,640
So it was a very rich program
and it lasted for, I don't want,

417
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,080
I don't actually don't
like to call it a program.

418
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:09,230
I like to call it the journey and
the, yeah, because it's, it's,

419
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:11,420
it's actually leadership
doesn't start and stop.

420
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:15,240
It's something that we do all the time
and we're active and we're conscious and

421
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:20,241
it hopefully so Atlanta and ended up a
year long for this group and they were so

422
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:25,520
enthusiastic because by the end of
this time they were working in new ways

423
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,100
together.
New ideas were coming about.

424
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,230
Our business was on fire, on fire, and the
brand reputation and never been better.

425
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,560
So they wanted to roll it out.
They ended up,

426
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,620
and this is what was so amazing to me,
I get chills thinking about it.

427
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,790
They said we'll roll it out to the next
200 and so they took it to 200 people.

428
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,410
Now we couldn't afford coaches
for everybody, but there's a,

429
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,570
there are a lot of ways of getting good
feedback other than getting a coach that

430
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:55,680
200 Ben said, we love this. Can we roll
it out to 400 and by the time I left,

431
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,770
we were 600 strong.
It's a really powerful program.

432
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:02,010
And it did start to shift our
culture. I mean that was, you know,

433
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,490
meaning at the time with Google was
one of the beginning things, you know,

434
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,460
how do we get digital, how do we create
relationships with external vendors,

435
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:15,750
partners really how do we begin to create
those so that we can be relevant in

436
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,010
our, in, in our field.

437
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,770
You recall having visited
the Googleplex here,

438
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,570
not when you're with your team and
when you went back to Paris and,

439
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,550
or New York is when I first met you.
You were,

440
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,540
I think working between
parents always. Yeah. Um,

441
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,120
was there anything that shifted in your
approach that was conscious that was

442
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,220
sparked by something you experienced?

443
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,430
Yeah. You know, it was
amazing. We, so I had, I did a,

444
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,990
I chose actually I want to say 12
executives. I can't remember how many,

445
00:27:46,991 --> 00:27:51,880
there were none of them executives
across levels to come here to Google.

446
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:54,970
We might to, um, Facebook. We might,

447
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,810
I mean we were really trying to get a
good sense. Pinterest at the time. Yeah,

448
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:01,840
it was, it was really, really
small. It was like in one room,

449
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,450
but it was really interesting.
We were trying to figure out how do we,

450
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:07,390
and we sat in a room and
shortly after Google,

451
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:09,130
we'd love the environment and Google.
I mean,

452
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:11,700
one of the things that
we've picked up on was this,

453
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,520
this notion of creativity
in any domain at Google.

454
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,560
And I don't know if that's
something that you experienced,

455
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:20,020
but it's what's what we
experienced meeting with Googlers.

456
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,320
It was like this freedom and ability
to express and to be in a creative mind

457
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,670
regardless of what kinds
of jobs you are doing.

458
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:32,460
And I Montessori I was inspired
by that. Totally. I mean,

459
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,050
and just the ideation,
you know, we drove in the,

460
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:40,000
in the driverless car and the kind of
ideation and forward thinking that I think

461
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,640
Google has was something
I wanted to learn from.

462
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:44,500
Because even though luxury companies,

463
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:48,700
one of the components of being a luxury
company at the highest end, his history,

464
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,480
you can't ignore the future.
And if you get stuck on history,

465
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,200
then you've got a problem getting into
the future and you ha that's a balance

466
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,034
that you have to.

467
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,010
Um, actually France has
that problem. I loved reds.

468
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,880
I went to university for a year in Paris
would there upward and increasingly I

469
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:08,750
feel back there on business quite a bit,
but it does feel a little stuck.

470
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,080
I felt that before a little
messy and like beautiful places.

471
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,890
French are extraordinary because
they have exquisite taste.

472
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,280
They understand beauty better
than I think any culture.

473
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,400
I mean Italians also doing,
they have a different,

474
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,630
I think a different way of expressing it,

475
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,560
but the French in terms of food and wine
and five minutes. Yup. And you don't,

476
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,840
I and I feel like that is
a gift for any culture.

477
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,970
It's a gift to the world.
And if you know,

478
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,560
just not unlike luxury brand like Chanel,

479
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,800
if there was a way that we could all
benefit from that gift and make it

480
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:48,880
contemporary enough so that we can
connect to it, I think it'd be beautiful.

481
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:48,991
I mean,

482
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:53,560
one of the things that I'm seeing with
luxury companies today and something I've

483
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:56,740
been watching quite carefully
is this notion of purpose.

484
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,750
And our Google has a great purpose and
I can feel it and luxury companies,

485
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,990
some of them do and some of
them are still developing that.

486
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,530
And purpose to me isn't
just about adapting a cause.

487
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,180
It's when the cause and who you
are connected yeah. Is Intrinsic.

488
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:17,080
So I think about Tesla for example, now
that, and then you look at their luxury,

489
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,880
they've made a luxury car and they,

490
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,290
their sales have been better on their
top model then BMW, I think, and,

491
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,430
and Mercedes.
Um,

492
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,770
but what's so interesting to me about
Tesla is you have all the fittings have a

493
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:32,990
luxury car because it's a
beautifully appointed. Um, Eh,

494
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,040
it's a technological innovation and yet
it's for you feel good about driving it

495
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:43,120
because you're not putting
more carbon or Max at, into,

496
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,470
into the environment.
And it just,

497
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:49,470
there's something about that to me that
feels really relevant in luxury brands

498
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:54,130
today, is how do you figure out how
to connect to today's consumers?

499
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:59,131
Connect to what we care about in the world
will still having a luxury offer in a

500
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:03,280
world of seven and a half billion people,

501
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,210
most of whom they could ever afford
something, which now would be a lipstick.

502
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,350
And that would be an indulgence.
Um, that's a, that's a call.

503
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,280
That's a tall order for
a brand like Chanel and,

504
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:20,120
and to make it accessible yet
still retain its luxury. Indeed.

505
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,370
But if you look at, you know, what a great
brand to do that, and you have a story,

506
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,690
a true story,

507
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:30,310
a legendary story about a
woman who was an orphan.

508
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,820
She was a complete orphan.
It's a rag to riches story.

509
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:35,850
She became a cortisone.

510
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,000
And then she finally started her own
tour business and became all the rage and

511
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:43,120
the top couturier in all of Paris.
And besides,

512
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:45,670
she changed the way women could dress.

513
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,980
She liberated us from corsets
and long dresses. So that is,

514
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,890
is for me that's a contemporary
story that, you know,

515
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:58,900
the iconic clastic perspective, the
subversion, she took men's wear fabrics.

516
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:03,050
No one had heard of doing this
into women's design. So you know,

517
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,340
when you have as richest revolutionary,

518
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,500
that's fair and you think about it
for women today. And I, you know,

519
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,550
I think about it for an and, and I
think there are other companies, I,

520
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,410
they're companies that are
doing amazing things, but it's,

521
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,820
I think it's slower for luxury
companies because sometimes, um,

522
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,410
the concerns have been
much more around that,

523
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,130
just that impeccably beautiful product
and service rather than thinking about,

524
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:28,630
so consumers have today, they're not
just in this transactional mode anymore.

525
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:31,180
They don't just want the label,
they want to go beyond the label.

526
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,210
Something about authenticity
that's really popping in, uh,

527
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,080
in,
in New York culture.

528
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:43,081
But I think you see it popping
up in retail around the world.

529
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:47,780
Love you to free associate. You worries
the Tesla. Obviously Chanel great brand.

530
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,520
We talked a little bit about rag and bone,

531
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,770
but the brands that really stand out for
you, that resonate with me right now.

532
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,780
I love Rei.

533
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,420
I just think it is amazing
opt out on black Friday.

534
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,160
It's not just a marketing move and you
know that because they care about being

535
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:10,180
outside and, and you know what I
think, and I think about luxury this,

536
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,580
this may sound crazy, but what does
luxury today, it's time, right?

537
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,580
Both said that at the same time
it's getting outdoors, you know,

538
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:23,930
because that's rare in rare it's
connecting with friends and with oneself.

539
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,400
So I love Rei for the way that it taps
into the outdoors and what it means.

540
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,600
I actually think Nike's doing a really
good job, big company, but you know,

541
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,830
equality has no boundaries.
That is, to me, I,

542
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,900
that made me want to run out and buy Nike.
So I,

543
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,320
they're connecting to something I care
about and they're still making great

544
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,730
innovative products do you can't forget,
for me, the product is still the,

545
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:49,580
you know, you've got to have a great
product. It's, it starts with the product,

546
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,400
but you also have to today
off of more than that.

547
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,270
And I think those are the
two examples. Just, you know,

548
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,020
that I've been kind of following
a bit. I was looking at, um,

549
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,530
does anyone reformation? Does anybody
because they want to know that, that yeah,

550
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,480
it's a, it's an online
clothing brand that's really
going after ethical sourcing,

551
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,310
ethical products and things that don't,

552
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,180
that don't rob our environment
of natural resources.

553
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,110
And I think it's an interesting
concept. I don't know what, you know,

554
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,490
where it will go,
but I,

555
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,310
I'm hopeful that we can get more of that
kind of attitude and environment into

556
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,530
fashion.
Did you,

557
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,950
for how long did you know
you had a book inside of you?

558
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:31,370
Because that's a brave thing to do.
It's time consuming,

559
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:36,020
very extremely personal and
intimate and you share it,

560
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:41,060
you're vulnerable. You don't know what
the reaction of the press will be.

561
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,430
Els, fair haired CEO, everyone knew.

562
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:51,610
And now you're an author with a
completely new orientation towards your

563
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:56,980
professional life. Uh, which
is still a journey. Absolutely.

564
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,580
Where are you itching to do this
for a while? I never considered not,

565
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,830
it's funny cause I, any of my
jobs I've never considered before.

566
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,390
I kinda got at the doorstep of them
that that's what I wanted or could do.

567
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,300
So with writing, I was a literature major,
sounds kind of logical. And I, I've read,

568
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,090
I love reading, I love
stories, especially fiction.

569
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,250
And so what happened is when,

570
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,270
when we did the active and conscious
leadership journey, I wanted to share it.

571
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,850
I really wanted to share it.
And I started with an article,

572
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,450
could not get the article
down to a reasonable size.

573
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:35,900
And I met an independent editor who
said, listen, you know, had asked me,

574
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,890
was a great asker and was pulling
ideas out of me and I thought,

575
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,540
and she said, why don't you write a
book? And at first I was like, oh,

576
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,430
I can't write a book.

577
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,060
And I realized that actually I had a
lot of things that I had learned and

578
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:53,580
stories that I wanted to
share to provoke questions.

579
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,370
I ask questions in the book,
um,

580
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,900
observations so that I could help other
people create their own paths to success.

581
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,190
And when you read the book,

582
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:06,270
you'll see it's not a set of
rules or dictates or how to, um,

583
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,260
I don't give a lot of instructions because
I feel like everybody has his or her

584
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:14,670
own journey. But this is really
about reading, opening somebody,

585
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,120
somebody else's journey up,
asking yourself some questions,

586
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,520
looking in the mirror
and, and, and, you know,

587
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,590
using some of those
observations for your own,

588
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,540
for your lives and for your own careers.
You're clearly a courageous person.

589
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:31,430
You were a teenager, decided to
study abroad in France one summer,

590
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,810
fell in love with goat cheese,
left me more about that.

591
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,260
And that somewhat set you on a
trajectory that has you here today.

592
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,370
I mean, did you consciously know
that you're a bit of an adventure?

593
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,580
You know, I, I don't, I don't
think I thought of it as adventure.

594
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:50,830
I fell in love with friends.
I think I'm very curious.

595
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,650
I'm exceedingly curious,

596
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,090
but I fell in love with the notion of
France because my father spoke really

597
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:00,630
fluent French. He learned without
a textbook. And believe it or not,

598
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:02,460
I think that was so
interesting and so effective.

599
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:06,330
He split it with beautiful accent.
So I was, I looked up to my dad,

600
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,350
I wanted to speak French. I came, I had
a great French teacher and I decided,

601
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:12,840
I got it in my head one year.
I said to my parents,

602
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,500
[inaudible] shoes,
I said to my parents,

603
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,800
I must live in France.

604
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,550
I must go be with a family cause I have
to have this language, this language.

605
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,330
I want to learn it too, except that nobody
can, nobody can tell I'm an American.

606
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,740
And the only way you can do that I think
is really other than my dad's schooling,

607
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:35,610
which they weren't doing in my school,
is go immerse yourself in the culture.

608
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:40,510
And so I landed in the south of France,
which was incredibly lucky. And I,

609
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,460
I stayed for a month with a family
and my father was a gal, has east.

610
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,000
So he was a mechanic and I got
to work at the gas station.

611
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,300
And every morning the table was set with
fresh wild flowers and the light would

612
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:57,180
glow on the limestone and
I would smell the lavender.

613
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,000
And my senses just broke open.

614
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,320
It was almost like I didn't know that
I cared so much about these things,

615
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:07,740
but the beauty, the sheer beauty
and their appreciation of it way,

616
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:11,070
they take it in the lecture hall,
which you know,

617
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:14,920
which is the hour that you had the
drink at night. Everybody sits in the,

618
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:15,300
you know,

619
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,680
they pour the pest east and calm and
it's a moment to be together and it's a

620
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:21,240
moment to take in the surroundings.

621
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,800
And I found that
absolutely just refreshing.

622
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,120
Fascinating at the time
in France. And I had, um,

623
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,600
also later gone back as a college junior,
I found a roommate and she,

624
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:36,370
and you'll read about this and book
and she was very liberated about her

625
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:40,360
sexuality and about her body. And I
thought, that's cool. Cause I grew up,

626
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,100
I grew up in the Midwest
and you know, it was, I,

627
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,620
women really weren't supposed to
be sexual beings. Well I didn't,

628
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:50,920
I did not feel that way. I felt like,
you know, I'm, I was supposed to be very,

629
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:54,430
very careful with who I was and you know,
kind of buttoned up.

630
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,640
And so this liberation
really appealed to me.

631
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,230
I love that story. I'm going to invite
now. We have questions on the dory.

632
00:39:03,231 --> 00:39:05,660
I can keep talking and I have
plenty I could ask Maureen,

633
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:07,070
but there are a lot of
people in the room there.

634
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:10,660
Mike's and there are dory
questions. So I don't want to, um,

635
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,380
completely dominate the Q and
a, uh, anyone in the room.

636
00:39:15,381 --> 00:39:18,260
So motivated.
We're going to have to get you a Mike.

637
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,610
You can take mine for a second.

638
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:22,930
Okay.

639
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:27,090
Hi Maureen. Hi. So you mentioned,
um, we'll luxury means tool, uh,

640
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,010
everybody in today's society a
little bit tired and being outdoors.

641
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,690
So I'm also from Saint Louis

642
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,750
and I did a little Wikipedia
research earlier. So fraud.
You grew up in San Louis?

643
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,380
Uh, Clayton. Oh cool. Yup. Great for,
I know you went to John's morose.

644
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:45,070
I did go to town.
No secrets,

645
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,720
no CRM. We, it's like we know we
can speak each other's language. Um,

646
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:53,560
so I'm curious from John's were rose
in St Louis to leading one of the most

647
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:55,390
coveted fashion houses in the world.

648
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,140
How has your personal interpretation
of luxury evolved over time?

649
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,530
That's really interesting. You
know, I think I always loved luxury,

650
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:06,050
but I wouldn't have called
it luxury. I was, I just,

651
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,150
once I had that experience in France,

652
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,800
I realized that I love beautiful things
and just the, the make the way they feel,

653
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:17,730
things that smell good. Um, great, great
food things on the pallet things. It's,

654
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,740
I love music.

655
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,100
And so I think the initial thing that
drew me was beauty and not this notion of

656
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:28,760
luxury by the way. I find beauty in things
that aren't expensive. A lot of beauty.

657
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:29,511
And in fact,

658
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:33,890
one of my early experiences at L'oreal
was I was driving in coal mining country

659
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,740
and it was a foggy industrial area.
Um,

660
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:43,390
and I rolled down my window and I noticed
this purple mountain of coal debris

661
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,660
and it was glistening and sort of the
early morning hazy song. I thought,

662
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,470
that's so beautiful.
There's a beauty in that,

663
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,770
even though in a way it represents
something that's about hardship and about,

664
00:40:56,991 --> 00:40:59,990
you know, difficult living
conditions. But that was the beauty.

665
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,570
The beauty wasn't the perfect aesthetic.

666
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,710
The beauty was actually the story at toll.
So that was my initial,

667
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:09,380
I don't know that I've changed
that much on that, by the way,

668
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,750
just cause to me luxury and
I think recently now I'm
realizing that luxury is so

669
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,310
much more than objects.

670
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,570
It really is this notion
of being able to have time,

671
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,710
being able to have space outdoors and
with the people who you love. To me,

672
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:27,740
that's what I think where I've evolved to,
but in the beginning,

673
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:31,610
and I think it's still in me,
that notion of beauty is imperfection,

674
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,410
not perfection. Yep, exactly. And it's,

675
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,580
and it's in the story.

676
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,410
It's in the story that there is beauty
and it doesn't have to be, you know,

677
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,160
this kind of aesthetic plastic thing.

678
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,123
Thanks for asking.

679
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,860
I am also from Saint Louis. Not just
kidding. Wow. I was going to be like,

680
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,930
you go St Louis.
I'm from Paris and by the way,

681
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,770
I love friends as described by American.
It sounds amazing.

682
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:05,030
So I want you to ask to you,
I've been CEO of Chanel from a long time.

683
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,080
What keeps you motivated and
how did you reinvent yourself?

684
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:13,520
Or this is yours to keep
being a great visionary CEO?
Oh, that's a great question.

685
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:16,850
Thank you.
I think interestingly enough,

686
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,160
it was pretty easy from about 2007 odd
because of what was happening in the

687
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:25,880
world and the,
and our business was exploding.

688
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,300
So I was being motivated just by trying
to actually keep this historical brand,

689
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,380
this incredible,

690
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:37,640
incredibly beautiful house moving into
the future without compromising or

691
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:40,520
sacrificing the things
that made it so special.

692
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,740
And it kept me motivated because
everyday there was a new, you know, we,

693
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:47,990
we'd wake up one morning and there was
yet another social media platform to

694
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:51,770
think, to consider, or we'd have
to, we'd have a new fashion.

695
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,180
What's great is you always
have new collection.

696
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:55,490
So there's a new collection
to figure out how to,

697
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,530
to communicate to your customers,

698
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:00,920
how to sell to your customers and
how to create desire all the time.

699
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:05,600
So for me that, that actually wasn't
difficult. What towards the end of,

700
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,630
I guess the last three years when I was
doing active and conscious leadership,

701
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:10,760
I was actually discovering
beauty and people.

702
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,850
And so what was really
keeping me motivated was,

703
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,090
was watching this team and
this big team and getting,

704
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,040
I mean hundreds of letters from people
who said that this work had changed their

705
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:25,220
lives. That was really,
really motivating to me.

706
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:30,490
It's like how do you in a company get
people to tap into what they love best,

707
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,030
where they can bring value and how they
connect that to the purpose of the brand.

708
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:38,420
And when you do that, and you guys
know because is such a great place,

709
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,750
when you do that, you get incredible
workout people and they're happy.

710
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,820
So that kept me really motivated.

711
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,633
Thank you.

712
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,360
Hi Matt. Hi Maureen. Thank you so
much for coming, uh, for having me.

713
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,190
Well,
I'm originally from India,

714
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,150
but I'm California for awhile.
Um,

715
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,130
so I had a question around the
inflection points in your career.

716
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:07,280
Could you speak a little bit about
like what brought you to your next

717
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:12,200
opportunity from L'Oreal to grab
to Janelle are so different.

718
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,240
Great question. So, um,

719
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:20,380
I moved to the L'oreal story is that
after three years I was there and I loved

720
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:23,360
it there. I was learning all
about marketing by the way.

721
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:27,080
I did not go to business school. So
there were, you know, there's all these,

722
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,530
I had to learn all the techniques,
techniques or technical terms,

723
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,040
what marketing really was, um,
ups and market segmentation.

724
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,140
And everybody around me had
gone to business school,

725
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,500
so I had a lot of catching up to
do. Um, but I realized that my one,

726
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,690
my one gift that I had is I could see
image and I can understand what emotion

727
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,350
was created. The thing
is, is after three years,

728
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,880
I didn't see a lot of women at the top
then, and it's changed so much. I mean,

729
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:56,790
I was now one of the best companies
for that, but back then it wasn't,

730
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,290
and in the meantime,

731
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:02,160
my husband had an offer to go
to Indonesia and I didn't want,

732
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:03,270
I didn't see myself there.

733
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,450
And so we decided to pick up
and come to San Francisco.

734
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,170
So this is the funny influction
point about getting into retail.

735
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:13,560
I would have never, if you had
asked me even lit, leaving L'Oreal,

736
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,530
can you see yourself in fashion or retail?
I would say absolutely not.

737
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,160
I'm a marketer. So I come to San
Francisco now, this is not so smart.

738
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:24,540
We didn't have jobs and we had about, I
don't know, maybe a month to have savings.

739
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,240
So that was it. And it was sort
of like you got to get a job.

740
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,600
So I started interviewing, this is, um,

741
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,750
I guess in 1989 I started interviewing
and I realized that I am at this point,

742
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:36,930
I have the label in my own head of
what I am. I have an expectation,

743
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,390
it's called marketers, you
know, fixed on my head.

744
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,770
So I go to the two packaged
goods companies, biggest in
the bay area at the time,

745
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:48,420
Clorox and del Monte. Okay.
Demonte doesn't call me back.

746
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,120
I mean they don't,
I don't even get my foot in the door.

747
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,700
I get one interview Clorox and like,
you don't have an Mba,

748
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,760
what are you doing here? But
also I realized, wait a minute,

749
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,100
I don't think I want to be on photo shoots
for toilet bowls like this. I don't,

750
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,700
this isn't, I mean I love, you
know, I respect them, but the,

751
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,270
I don't think this is right for me.

752
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,080
And so I'm walking down market street
and you ask about reflection point and I

753
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:13,500
see this poster of Miles Davis,
Miles Davis, jazz, great.

754
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,540
And his head is in his hands.

755
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,080
He's got this soulful look and he's
wearing a black tee shirt that says gap

756
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,490
Michael. I'm like, I
want a market that, well,

757
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,230
the story goes snail mail at this time.
I send my resume a week later,

758
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,570
whatever it was, I got a
call from the recruiter and
I said, so you know, he said,

759
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,440
when you want to do her, so
I want to market the gap.
You said you're a merchant.

760
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,390
I said, I'm a what? What would it mean?

761
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,820
What is a merchant do that
don't want to sell stuff?

762
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,110
Like I'm not a good salesperson.

763
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:42,610
I had learned that myself and the
north of France, I'm not going to get,

764
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,150
I don't think I should do that
anymore. So he said, no, no, no.

765
00:46:45,151 --> 00:46:48,210
A merchant works with design teams will
make they help to create the products.

766
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:51,480
And the assortments and figure out how
much to buy and where to source them.

767
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,690
So that was the info. But the
inflection point, if I think about it,

768
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,130
I mean to two things.

769
00:46:56,131 --> 00:47:00,990
One was being in a company where I wasn't
sure I could progress and wasn't sure

770
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:04,800
that I had the means to do what I really
thought I want to do it or at least

771
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:09,210
grow. Um, and then the second thing was
seeing that poster and saying, you know,

772
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:10,800
is that,
so that was one transition.

773
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:14,310
And then I guess the second inflection
point was getting that call from a

774
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,220
headhunter while I was at old navy.
I'm,

775
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:22,020
I'm still selling $5 to use out of the
back of a truck and they say a French

776
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:23,520
luxury companies interested.

777
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,870
Now at this point in my
life I was missing France.

778
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:31,360
We were living on the west coast.
Um, we've been here for 15 years.

779
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,150
And just the notion of working
in a French leisure, coming,

780
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,830
getting back to sort of my, my, it was a
dream. It was, it was absolutely dream.

781
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:42,040
And so,
and then I learned about Chanel story,

782
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:46,810
who she was as a person and I
thought this is, this is new for me,

783
00:47:46,811 --> 00:47:50,180
this is going to be the next
challenge. So it, you know, again,

784
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:54,190
and I never imagined that I would be
doing that, I think ever in my life.

785
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,060
But it just sort of being open
and opportunistic in a sense.

786
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:01,140
And I'm seeing those things and
hearing those things. I mean,

787
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:04,540
of course I got that wonderful
call, but you know, it's funny,

788
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,100
I'll tell you the funniest story
about that. This is gap. Let's see,

789
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:14,101
what was it about 2001 when I got the
call was the center of the universe.

790
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:19,960
Back then Chenelle was small and
I thought it was a brand for,

791
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,240
you know,
older women.

792
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:25,960
Like I didn't know that Chanel could be
young and hip because it wasn't so young

793
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:30,040
and hip done.
So for me it was actually a huge,

794
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,070
it sounds crazy, but a huge risk.
I had moved my entire family,

795
00:48:33,071 --> 00:48:36,640
my kids were 11 and eight, so
I moved him from, you know,

796
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:41,641
their cozy little noe valley
slash Tiburon existence to new,

797
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,110
to first to Paris for a
year and then to New York.

798
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:47,970
So it was actually religious risk.
And I didn't think, you know,

799
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,490
I didn't at the time I, you
know, I didn't, I wasn't sure,

800
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,610
but I ended up thinking, you know
what, there's something about this,

801
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:58,990
this feels right. Trust your
instincts. Long story, sorry.

802
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:02,470
But we're storytelling here today and

803
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,550
thank you for coming.
Um, and my questions,

804
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:11,551
but were there key mentors that you
had along your journey and what kind of

805
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:16,010
pivotal role did they play for you
and then to then inspire you to,

806
00:49:16,011 --> 00:49:18,600
to mentor others? I uh, I have,

807
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,200
I have mentored so many people and it's
one of my favorite, favorite things. Um,

808
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,970
I have a lot of really amazing
mentors at both at gap, um,

809
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,350
and even at Chanel.

810
00:49:29,351 --> 00:49:33,460
But one I think about mentors
cause it's kind of a hot topic.

811
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:36,850
We talk about it a lot and we talked,
especially amongst the women mentors.

812
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:37,960
And I think that's amazing.

813
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:42,610
But I would encourage all of you to
think broadly about the mentor because I

814
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:47,200
learned as much in so many ways from
my friend in France flu in the book.

815
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,130
Um, who is, who taught me about, you
know, being comfortable as a woman,

816
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:52,540
being comfortable in your own body.

817
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:56,980
I would say I would learn in so many ways
as much from her as I have some of my

818
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:57,791
greatest mentors,

819
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:01,750
like Jenny Ming who was running old navy
and Mickey Drexler who is the CEO of

820
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:05,830
gap. So at mentoring doesn't
have to be a hierarchical thing.

821
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:10,690
I think it's really about getting
somebody with whom you can share

822
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,050
conversations,
stories you can ask questions.

823
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:19,300
I made a lot of mentors will mentees I
guess is how we turn that have asked me

824
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:23,470
to, so what do I, what do I do about
that? And I never answer. Instead,

825
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:26,950
what would I do is I ask them more
questions about what they care about.

826
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,400
You know,
where they want to go with this.

827
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,510
And what ends up happening is they find
answers that are better than any answer

828
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:36,110
that I could give. And so I would, for me,

829
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:40,460
that means that mentors can breed a broad
range of people and it doesn't have to

830
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:45,260
be somebody who is really impressive or
higher up reading in your book you're

831
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:48,920
talking about just a fall on them is
getting comfortable in your own body.

832
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:53,600
You talk about spending a long time in
your career operating in a masculine

833
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:55,110
frame.
Uh,

834
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,740
when did you realize that wasn't working
for you or did it work for you for a

835
00:50:58,741 --> 00:51:02,990
while and you just decided to go
beyond that label? Um, you know,

836
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,030
it's interesting.
I never thought of it.

837
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,820
I've never really thought of it
when I was at gap, first of all,

838
00:51:07,821 --> 00:51:12,821
because I think we were such drivers
and business and while leadership and

839
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,570
management was incredibly important,
gap was progressive in this.

840
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,050
The one thing that cap had done for
me, I'd given, they'd give me a coach.

841
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,560
I'd already been working on my
own leadership capabilities and,

842
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,810
and learning even more how to listen.

843
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:30,910
I have a funny story in there about
the launch when making Drexler, um,

844
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,150
it taught me how to listen.
It was very tough story. Um,

845
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,640
and another one of those
embarrassing moments. But, um,

846
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:41,900
so I was aware of this in myself,
but I wasn't so aware that it would,

847
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,680
it would be the those feminine
qualities people by the way, I didn't,

848
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,330
I didn't label them feminine qualities.

849
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:52,130
Sociologists and researchers
are now saying these are
feminine qualities but can

850
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:56,120
be found in men and women in fact,
and happened to be intrinsic to women,

851
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:00,200
but they, they're both men and women
share these qualities. So once I started,

852
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,020
I didn't, I didn't notice that or
I didn't think about it that way.

853
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:07,370
I would say when I was at the
gap, um, once I got to Chanel,

854
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:12,460
as I realized that I had to shift from
the drive out of the strategy and vision

855
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:16,730
and focus and all the things that
had made me really successful,

856
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,340
that I had to actually use
those other things that I was,

857
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,320
I was also aware of and working on.

858
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,910
But those things would become more
important or not more important.

859
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:28,640
I get those things at least had to be
integrated and I think that's the one

860
00:52:28,641 --> 00:52:31,660
thing I think about sort of this masculine
feminine thing that a lot of people

861
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:34,670
are talking about. I don't love the
labels. I really, I really don't. Um,

862
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:36,440
and I think you know, there, there's,

863
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,960
there's different people
have different qualities,

864
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:44,170
but what I see is that great leaders
actually combine so they know when to be

865
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:44,690
firm.

866
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:49,010
They know when to be strategic and focused
and determined and they know when to

867
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:54,011
listen and to be empathetic
so that they're the balance
of great leaders is what

868
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:58,100
I'm really intrigued by me. If you watch
great meters, you can, you can really,

869
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:02,540
really see that they are, they are
toggling quite a bit in different,

870
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,730
in all different ways I should say.
Multidimensionally

871
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,850
Maureen, thank you so much for
sharing your story. Thank you.

872
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:11,350
[inaudible] an incredible career.

873
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,480
And if you were to look back and talk
to your young self as you were just

874
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:17,830
starting out in your career,

875
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,860
what's the one piece of advice
you would give yourself?

876
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,030
Well, I'll tell you and
because people told me this,

877
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,980
I look back and I think about
this a lot too. Two things.

878
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:34,140
One is I was so serious and I was
so, you know, I was really a serious,

879
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:38,580
I took everything to heart all the
time and I had, and I still have it,

880
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,350
I'm working at,
it's work in progress,

881
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:44,830
but so my young self and my own self
share this, I have, I have, I have, uh,

882
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,860
I have a big self critic and I think I
would have actually just tried to quiet

883
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:54,360
the critic a little bit and I'm a times
that I was really beating myself up a

884
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:58,170
lot on the other thing, and we haven't
talked about this much here today,

885
00:53:58,171 --> 00:53:59,910
but in life as those
things were talking about,

886
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,500
I have two kids and I was
traveling, I mean a lot, every,

887
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,120
every three weeks.
Just about,

888
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:11,010
since I was a gap and I raised both
the girls and on Sean was there as the

889
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:15,570
staff, the staff on Dad, which was
at that time, if the gap and the gap,

890
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:18,570
it wasn't so unusual. But at, you
know, I'll try the gap. It was,

891
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:20,550
and we took a lot of
flack and it was really,

892
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,530
there's a painful story
in there about this,

893
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:27,531
but I would've loved to have
some conversations with my
kids about what that was

894
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:29,730
like for them and what
that was like for me.

895
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:34,790
And I think I was so grateful to Antoine
that he was home and that he was taking

896
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:38,310
care of them, that I thought
everything's fine, but you know, in fact,

897
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:41,310
and you'll read in a book, there's a
story that everything wasn't that time.

898
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,460
And um,
the,

899
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:47,280
these are hard things to grapple with and
you're in a wonderful environment here

900
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:51,710
where you have flex, flexible working
schedules, but um, I do think it's, it's,

901
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,840
things aren't perfect in this thing
called perfect work life balance.

902
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:58,920
It's another label that's another label
that I feel I feel really uncovered.

903
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,340
It makes us feel, I think it,
it disappoints us automatically.

904
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:06,060
You set yourself up for disappointment
and fulfilling guilty as a mother or a

905
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:07,010
father, by the way. Yeah,

906
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,130
I call it managed disequilibrium
and sometimes work.

907
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,820
I like that sometimes family wins.
And as an individual,

908
00:55:14,821 --> 00:55:19,110
you have to make sure you win every so
often because otherwise no one actually

909
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,870
wins. But, um,

910
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:25,680
knowing that it's never a PR
imperfect balance, it's liberating.

911
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,640
Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah,
you, you, you live with that.

912
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:33,390
The sadness let me cry.
I cried on planes to Hong Kong.

913
00:55:33,391 --> 00:55:37,380
I remember just leaving those little kids
and I didn't want to leave, you know,

914
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,130
lonely hotel rooms at night and it,

915
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,080
but you also know where you show
up and where you show up to me.

916
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:45,630
And for what for me was,
you know, I had two girls.

917
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:49,530
It was the emotional ways of crying
and mommy shoulder and you know,

918
00:55:49,531 --> 00:55:51,000
hugs at night and just when I could,

919
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,230
when I could support them emotionally
and then schoolwork because Antoine is

920
00:55:55,231 --> 00:55:59,170
French. So he didn't know the American
school system part as well. Um,

921
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:04,200
and trying to really, really be present
in those moments when you are there.

922
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:08,210
Um, I think is so, so, so
important. But I, it's not the,

923
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,920
not the extent that you get exhausted
yourself because when you're not present.

924
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,500
Yeah.

925
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,120
Um,
so the first question is,

926
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,470
can you share some practical advice on
cultivating sponsors and champions in

927
00:56:18,471 --> 00:56:19,430
your organization?

928
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:24,220
Practical advice and cultivating
sponsors and champions in the, yeah,

929
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:29,320
I think that that's a great point
are great question. For me. Again,

930
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:32,860
it was about, and I think about my own
personal experience because by the way,

931
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:33,694
I wasn't,

932
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,760
I didn't necessarily have a Chanel that
many sponsors other than the owners at

933
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:42,970
the time because everybody, nobody knew
me. And while they wanted to like me,

934
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:46,920
my experience didn't fit the exact
profile of what they, you know,

935
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,060
what they thought she should
probably meet the company.

936
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:54,450
So it really was about listening and
about being on their side of the table.

937
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:59,260
And to get the Digi actually get
champions means that it's, for me, it's a,

938
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,460
it's a two way street. It's not
about convincing someone. Um,

939
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,710
it's not about telling someone what to do.

940
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:09,280
It's actually about living in their world
and with, with them and what they do.

941
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,530
And then you coach champion something.

942
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,273
Okay.

943
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:22,470
Did Mr Lagerfeld participate in the
active and conscious leader? You know,

944
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:27,170
isn't true. No. Isn't a no. Um, no, I,

945
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:31,170
I have been an oh, well I'll,
I'll answer that and I'll get you,

946
00:57:31,171 --> 00:57:33,990
I've been such a huge
admirer of creativity.

947
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:38,530
I think when you think of creativity,
the word you think of Karl Lagerfeld,

948
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:42,540
you know, in the fashion industry. Anyway,
so what I, and I've worked with amazing,

949
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,190
amazing creative people at gap and
Banana Republic, old navy and at L'Oreal.

950
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,800
In fact, my early, early
experiences were at L'Oreal.

951
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,500
What I noticed is working with someone,

952
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:57,090
creative means giving them the space,
the resources to do what they do best.

953
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:02,420
And that, you know, to me that
was what was really important. Hi.

954
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,800
Um, it seems on your crave held a lot of
different titles and part of what your

955
00:58:06,801 --> 00:58:09,130
success was was not holding herself,
redefining,

956
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:12,260
defining yourself to a certain
label. Um, but I was also wondering,

957
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,480
I think for a lot of people
in their career journey,

958
00:58:14,481 --> 00:58:18,910
they have to sort of eventually
find somewhere where they
specialize in or where

959
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:21,050
like the,
like that's an area that they own.

960
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:25,070
So I'm wondering like how that journey
was for you and kind of figuring out like

961
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,730
what you specialize in or what skill
sets you bring to the table and then how

962
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:32,780
that evolved over time. That,
that's a great question. I
appreciate it. Um, you know,

963
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:34,820
I actually think there, I
mean, I always say the three,

964
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,680
the three groups of questions you asked,
you know,

965
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,160
what do I love so much that I
can't live without, you know,

966
00:58:40,161 --> 00:58:43,160
beyond the label and beyond the roles
and beyond the definitions, what is,

967
00:58:43,161 --> 00:58:47,330
what makes my heart sing? We're, can
I bring value? You know, what is,

968
00:58:47,331 --> 00:58:50,860
what is my greatest gift where,
you know, where can I cut and,

969
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:55,460
and how do I connect those two things
where I bring value on what I love and

970
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:59,290
then what, you know, sort of answer your
question, what context am I, am I in?

971
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:03,320
You know what, sometimes you have to take
jobs that you don't like for a while,

972
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,430
but I found that always staying really
close to what I cared about was something.

973
00:59:07,431 --> 00:59:11,750
And I learned it early on. And L'Oreal,
there's a story in the book about this.

974
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:15,820
But, um, so here I had not
been to business school and
I was in marketing and I,

975
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,060
and everybody else had.

976
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,320
So I didn't have that advantage and
I had to figure out what it was that,

977
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,170
you know, what was my path to your
point, what was it that I really,

978
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:27,900
really wanted to do and what, what
was my mark? And it ended up, I, we,

979
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,870
I got invited into some advertising
meetings and the art director and an

980
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,060
advertising agency,
I just,

981
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,860
I felt a connection with what he was
trying to do and we had this big oval

982
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:42,950
tables and I would find myself
like kind of scooching over to the,

983
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,520
to the advertising agents side,
you know, you're supposed to,

984
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:48,230
if it's client agent back in those days.
And I,

985
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,970
I found myself wanting so badly to see
through his eyes and it turns out and we

986
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:53,631
became friends.

987
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:57,230
He's the one who taught me about jazz
and we became friends and spent a lot of

988
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:00,820
time and he spent a lot of time
showing me how he sees buting,

989
01:00:00,821 --> 01:00:03,920
which was how I thought about beauty as
kind of an imperfection because he was

990
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:07,970
showing me models and they might've been
plastically perfectly say, but she's,

991
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,580
she's not giving something
in the camp to the camera.

992
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:15,290
Like he talked about it in such a cool
terms. So I think, um, you know, from,

993
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,730
from my perspective,

994
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,760
it was really kind of tapping into that
what it is I care so much about and how

995
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:24,170
can I bring value and in that environment,

996
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:28,040
for me that was one case I can bring
value because it was different from what

997
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,040
most of what most everybody knew. Most
everybody was doing more classic market.

998
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,740
That's everybody. There
were great. You know,

999
01:00:32,741 --> 01:00:34,400
you said it's a greatest that a company,

1000
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,920
but for me that was
really what we'll counter

1001
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:43,490
if we have time for perhaps one more
question. Anyone in the audience? Sorry,

1002
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,750
the Dory. Oh, a gentlemen. I'd love it.

1003
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:57,160
Thank you again, very much. Reading. Um,

1004
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:02,500
so you've worked both in Europe
and here and t you were of course,

1005
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:09,850
a female in a fashion world
with stereotypes about
women and dominated by May,

1006
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,050
let you know, executives. Uh,

1007
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,880
what is your comment about
the attitude that, uh,

1008
01:01:19,881 --> 01:01:24,881
you're showing France visuals but was
here and how this has changed over the

1009
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:28,730
year and what do you think are,
I know there are a lot of,

1010
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,740
there is a lot of room for improvement,

1011
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:35,741
but some suggestions about how to improve
the attitude to the women and getting

1012
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:43,340
to that state of really, you know, uh,

1013
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:48,680
equal, uh, no discrimination.
Right? But the idea,

1014
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:52,400
thanks for that question. Um, first
I'll say, you know, it's interesting,

1015
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:55,790
I worked around the world, so not
just in France, but all over Europe,

1016
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:59,560
all over Asia. And each culture
is different and it's, you know,

1017
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:04,490
it's almost impossible to even kind of
categorize them in terms of their views

1018
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,460
of women. It's interesting. We were just
talking earlier because Eileen is on, uh,

1019
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:12,770
the L'Oreal board, um, French
companies now actually have,

1020
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:16,940
they passed a law several years ago
requiring boards have 40% women.

1021
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:21,840
So while they may seem like you know,
more more bias in the workplace,

1022
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,120
I wouldn't say necessarily
that that's the case,

1023
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:26,490
although there are fewer
women in top leadership,

1024
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,940
there are also very few women in
top leadership in this country.

1025
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:34,110
And we're talking about 4%
CEOs that 4% of CEOS are women.

1026
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:38,550
That is not a lot. What
I, my thoughts about this,

1027
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:42,840
uh, are, are kind of clear
equity and pay is, you know,

1028
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:48,020
obvious work life arrangements that
help both women and men as those are

1029
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:52,140
obvious. I mean, we have to change these
things. We can't, you know, I, I'm,

1030
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,170
I'm impressive. Google has
flex time. It's amazing.

1031
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,510
But in my experience,

1032
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:03,140
if we don't also start to integrate these
qualities of empathy and flexibility

1033
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:07,260
and collaborative collaborative
skills and deep listening,

1034
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,080
if we don't start to
integrate those many women,

1035
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:15,620
many women won't ever feel as comfortable
or as confident or as natural actually

1036
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,400
being leaders.

1037
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:22,620
So I actually think that there's an
attitudinal shift that we need to make to

1038
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:25,530
get more women competent in those roles.
You know,

1039
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:28,840
past the ho I call it the hard stuff.
Meaning the,

1040
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:32,220
the pay issues and the,
and the work life arrangements.

1041
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:35,280
We need to expand our frame of leadership.

1042
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:38,820
We need to look at leadership differently
and consider that there are other

1043
01:03:38,821 --> 01:03:43,821
qualities both required for the world
but also that are intrinsic to women and

1044
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,120
make women actually really good leaders.

1045
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,800
And the good news about
this is by the way,

1046
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:51,660
and there's research done about the
oddness that women leaders where women are

1047
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:56,580
leaders and where there are boards, those
entities perform better. So, so you know,

1048
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,440
this,
this is a win win for everybody.

1049
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,560
Well that's a perfect statement in the,
uh,

1050
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,530
talk on Maureen, we've had a lot of
discussion at Google on these very issues,

1051
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:10,540
especially lately.
There's been a lot in the,

1052
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:15,541
in the news around gender
parity pay parodying the
tech industry and we're very,

1053
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:21,210
very convicted about ensuring that you
paid for the job you do not for the

1054
01:04:21,211 --> 01:04:22,780
person, the bar, um,

1055
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:26,430
talent and tenure and
performance in the role matters.

1056
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,490
But gender has no place in that equation.

1057
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,250
So thank you Maureen,

1058
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:36,460
you are active and conscious
leadership journey with us. Thank you.

1059
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:41,510
See it is you're on the journey and
there's a lot more interesting acts that

1060
01:04:43,081 --> 01:04:47,040
we're going to read about or hear about.
So best of luck to you.

1061
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:47,874
Thank you for spending.

1062
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,510
Thanks everyone.
Thanks.

1063
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:54,510
Do [inaudible].
