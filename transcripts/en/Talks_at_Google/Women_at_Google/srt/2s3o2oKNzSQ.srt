1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,210
I'm very excited to welcome back.
Ooh,

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,600
one of those incredible women on Kumar.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,880
So many of you may remember Anjalee
as one of our fearless lawyers,

4
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:21,410
a senior counsel who worked on
projects from Google x to youtube,

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,950
but many more of you may remember Anjalee
for hosting the Act Google Speaker

6
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:30,240
series, bringing in incredible
chefs like Anthony Bordain.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,680
Um, Jacques Pepin, Marcus Samuelsson.

8
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,460
I hope you got some really good
secret recipes from Ali's [inaudible].

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,170
Got a lot of really great reservations.
I will tell you, I still know cod. Yeah.

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,350
Was Nice.
Um,

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,470
and to entertainers like quest love
who you might remember from her series

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,120
lunchtime at Google shortly,
but it's so fun. Delightful.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,443
Um,

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,720
Anjalee like most of us knows that most
people's hearts live in their stomach

15
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:03,380
and so you're always having people
who could talk to us about food.

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,090
So after leaving Google Anjalee went to
be founding general counsel and founding

17
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:10,280
head of social innovation at Warby Parker.

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,030
And most recently was the chief
people officer at Cheddar.

19
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,520
And throughout these jobs,

20
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:21,200
Anjali was also pretty busy starting a
family with her beloved husband at tool

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,910
in 2010.

22
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:26,840
She had a daughter Zia and it was right
around then and that she started to

23
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:30,530
think about religion.
And as a new mom myself,

24
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:34,640
I can totally relate to the fact that
there's nothing like having a baby to make

25
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:37,520
you peek your head up around
out of your bubble and say,

26
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,760
how do I explain the
mysteries of life? Yeah. Um,

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,280
so Angela is here today to tell us a
little bit about how she turned over every

28
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:51,281
rock in what seemed like every corner
of the worlds religions and spiritual

29
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:56,351
groups and sects in her incredibly
delightful book stocking God.

30
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,180
So without further ado,

31
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:03,940
please help me give a warm
welcome back to Angela Kumar.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,400
How'd you so much for having me?

33
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,250
It's such a thrill to be
here and to actually not know
everybody in the audience

34
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:14,420
means that more Googler showed up and
just my team, which still meeting.

35
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,180
So Anjalee tell us a
little bit about yourself.

36
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,360
Like what was life like growing
up for you? Where did you grow up?

37
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:27,140
How did you kind of get to this place
where you were asking all these questions?

38
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:27,220
It's

39
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,970
sure.
So I was born in Brooklyn actually,

40
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:32,580
but raised outside of Chicago,

41
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Real Brooklyn Woo Woo for Brooklyn and
raised outside of Chicago by Indian

42
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:41,800
parents. I'm John is my religion.
So it's sort of a small,

43
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,500
very minority of religion,
at least outside of India,

44
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,580
but raised culturally Hindu and
also went to Catholic school.

45
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:51,130
Like you might get a sense of why I
wrote this book when you start hearing

46
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:55,150
because I'm not like there are a lot of
religion and a lot of traditions around

47
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,380
me.
And it,

48
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,440
for me it was really cultural and it was
just something that I never really much

49
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:03,370
about or questioned because it was so
seamlessly interwoven into our lives.

50
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:07,570
And I just never felt the need to ask
the big questions. And as you said,

51
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,750
it was when my daughter is zeal was more
in, which happened when I was at Google,

52
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,580
not physically at Google, but where do,
oh, hold on. We're having a mic and show.

53
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,070
Oh, keep going. Okay. So, um,

54
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,250
it was while I was employed at Google,

55
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,180
I had my daughter Zia about eight
years ago, almost nine years ago.

56
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,650
And it was in a conversation with my dad
when he said to me soon after she was

57
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,930
born, he was like, Oh, you
should take her to the temple.

58
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,800
There's a John Temple out in queens and
you should take her there to show her

59
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:39,340
what we believe. And I was like,
what do we believe? I was like, Huh,

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,910
that's a really interesting question. I
was like, what do we believe? It was like,

61
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:43,780
wait,
did I miss something?

62
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,480
Because I was injured the traditions and
I wanted to do all the right things and

63
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,870
like, you know, check off all the
traditional boxes. But I was like,

64
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,780
I don't really know what I believe.
And I just had never thought about it.

65
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,980
So I decided to start researching because
I realized there was at some point

66
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:00,610
there be the set of questions that my
daughter would inevitably ask me. Like,

67
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:04,120
what happens when you die? Is there
a god? How'd you find happiness?

68
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,540
What's the meaning of life? Things
that I could not Google an answer too,

69
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,660
but early, that was the
start of the journey. Um,

70
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,460
and so I started doing research and I
was like, well, what do I really believe?

71
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,100
And maybe I'll go see this healer
and go do this other thing.

72
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:18,400
And it started as a very quiet thing
because I worked at Google and I was like,

73
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,720
everyone's going to think I'm in bananas.

74
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:23,350
And I worked at Google in the legal
department, so the last thing you want is,

75
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,580
are like going off and doing
all this crazy stuff. Um,

76
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,060
but then as I started telling people, and
so, especially colleagues, a Google ad,

77
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,420
they, they really surprised me
because they started being like, oh,

78
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:37,300
have you checked out this thing? I'm
like, I know this healer downtown,

79
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:41,230
or I saw this showman, or I've tried
Iowasca or whatever. And I was like, what?

80
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,360
I was like, everybody's doing
this stuff except for me.

81
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,030
So like I'm the only one
who hasn't been searching.

82
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,380
And that's what's sort of the whole,

83
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,780
I, well, I was looking, um,
while I was thinking about like,

84
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,010
what can I talk with you about?

85
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:57,670
I was looking at emails that we
exchanged and there was one titled Amaa.

86
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,680
Um, and you and I are both
friends with Gopi, um,

87
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,030
who are extraordinary. As I said,
if you guys don't know Gopi should,

88
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:10,560
but he started the Yoga [inaudible] group
and he teaches yoga out in California

89
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,540
amongst the many other things that he
does, including being a Googler. And um,

90
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,400
he turned a lot of us on to Emma who's,

91
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,420
who's sort of the hugging saint. Um,
and I know you wrote about Alma in your,

92
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:26,550
in your book.
Can you tell us a little bit about her?

93
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,160
She's actually my opening chapter.
Um,

94
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,310
and it was through a conversation
with Gopi where he was like, oh,

95
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,730
I follow this woman, I'm a, she goes
around the world literally hugging people.

96
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:39,450
That's her job. That's what she does. It
sounds like, I mean, kind of a weird job,

97
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:40,450
but it's, you know, she

98
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,820
makes a lot of money doing this and so
she goes around the world giving hugs and

99
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:48,450
she was coming just to midtown
Manhattan and it was July 4th weekend,

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,760
many summers ago. So I was like,
well, I'm going to go check it out.

101
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:54,750
And I jumped in a cab and I go there
and it was, it was so interesting.

102
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:58,280
It was like lines out the door,
thousands, thousands of people.

103
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,440
I stood in line for probably over four
hours waiting for a hug and then have

104
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:06,500
this experience of like settling in and
like, it was like an overfamiliar Auntie.

105
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,690
And you know, if you've ever experienced
that, what you're kind of like,

106
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,530
this is getting uncomfortable. Like I'm
just, can you let you, she won't let go.

107
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,700
But then suddenly you're like peeled
off of her and like thrown off too.

108
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,540
You don't like just like a puppy but
like just thrown off. And it was um,

109
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,880
deeply unsatisfying for me personally,

110
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,260
but so satisfying to so many
people there who were in tears,

111
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,290
having hugs from her and who
are really deep followers.

112
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:35,150
And I think that also helped me sort of
go into all of these experiences with a

113
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:37,820
really open mind being like, you know,
just because it's not right for me.

114
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:41,840
There might be something that I can
take from it and then continue on the

115
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,910
journey to find what
really resonates for me.

116
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,500
But then I really respect the fact that
Gobi and other friends of mine really

117
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:52,340
believe in her and really
follow her around the world
and go every summer to get

118
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:56,630
a hug from her. I have not gone back,
but there's great food when you go.

119
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,390
And so if you're not into the hug,

120
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,620
there's amazing vegetarian food in the
basement of the hall. It's nice. Yeah.

121
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,630
There's always something
redeeming and all of these things.

122
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,120
So speaking of belief, your husband
is a doctor, right? As a scientist,

123
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,530
what did he, what did he think
about things as the Nanas?
What do you think he is?

124
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,810
Um, he is the most patient
man in the universe.

125
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:21,410
So he is an interventional cardiologists.
Like he's a super amount of science.

126
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,670
And He, I think for him,
again, so much of spirituality,

127
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:28,730
religion has just been cultural for him.
So he doesn't really think about it.

128
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,490
He doesn't waver around these questions.

129
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,680
He sort of goes through
the motions of religion.

130
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,180
He's Hindu was raised Hindu and I think
if pressed would call himself into,

131
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,340
um,
but he definitely,

132
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:43,480
there were moments when I was doing
the research where he's like, yeah,

133
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,400
you're not going to do that.
I'm like, that's crazy.

134
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,180
Or when I would come back from
things and he was like, oh, my word.

135
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,450
Like to like the, um, the chanting, the
tantric sound healing. I think that was,

136
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,840
that definitely tested our relationship,
but he's got a good sense of humor.

137
00:07:56,841 --> 00:08:01,210
So he mostly went along with it. Nice.
Yeah, he did not come with me on it.

138
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:05,720
Anything that stuff? No, just one. He did
the meditation with me. He learned TM.

139
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:06,770
He didn't do the Vipassana,

140
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,560
but he did a transcendental
meditation course with me.

141
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,000
But I found out later from him it was
because I had told him about all of these

142
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:16,940
athletes that did it with professional
athletes that he really respected and

143
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:20,570
admired. So he was like, oh, really?
Like that's kind of cool. It was like,

144
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:22,940
you're not a football player. Like, when
do you think this is gonna come in handy?

145
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:25,580
But he was really into like the
mental toughness aspect of it.

146
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,710
I really want to do it
because of David Lynch. So I,

147
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,960
that's where I learned David Lynch.
Let me write some sort of crazy.

148
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,640
It's going to let you write a
book and telling you. Yeah, baby.

149
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,580
I caught the big fish,

150
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,400
which is a book by David Lynch. Um, so

151
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,560
after you went to Alabama, what was sort
of like your next staff? Like you're,

152
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:56,250
you're, you're like, okay, I
did this. I'm in New York City.

153
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:59,940
This doesn't work for me. I know you
started traveling around the world.

154
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,190
You mentioned that your
husband didn't go with you,

155
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:06,270
but I know your sister went with you
to Brazil, right. To See John of God.

156
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,750
And so I thought the John of God's
story was particularly a little crazy.

157
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
So John of God,
um,

158
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,380
my sister and does not appear in the
chapter because the narrative just worked

159
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:24,210
better without her in it. But she was
there with me. John of God is a healer.

160
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,280
That a medium is what they consider him.

161
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,990
So there's a lot of
people around the world,

162
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:32,230
including Oprah who really believe
that he can cure all that ails you,

163
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,920
whether physical, emotional, spiritual.

164
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,360
And so people will go down to see him in
the small town in the middle of Brazil

165
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,310
and do get healing.

166
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,250
He sorta just pass in front of him and
you meditate for days and that kind of

167
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:48,840
thing. And, and he scans I guess
your oric field and then heels you,

168
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,660
I don't fully know how it works
because it's definitely out there. Um,

169
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,150
but people really believe in him and
really he does surgery on people. Yeah,

170
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,040
that's crazy. That stuff is, yeah, he
does surgery without anesthesia. Um,

171
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,140
sometimes there's cutting and he claims
that he cuts because the people need to

172
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,570
see the cut.
Like the patient needs to see the cut,

173
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,490
but not because it's actually required.

174
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,620
But there are people who say that they
had been cured of cancer and a lot of

175
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:18,840
other things by going to see each other.

176
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,300
Did you see any surgeries while
you were there? You saw some,

177
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:26,010
some cutting and some eyeball scraping.
It was really, it was really out there.

178
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,900
Um,
and it became,

179
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,100
it ended up becoming a real anchor for
me in the narrative of this particular

180
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:32,341
book.

181
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:37,341
So it's one of the first chapters of
the book of going down to seeing him and

182
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,550
you know, what happens there. And
then when the conclusion comes,

183
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:46,500
it sort of ties the whole thing up of
what I found on this very long journey.

184
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,633
Um,

185
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,960
because of things that happened related
to him but not directly from him.

186
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,940
So tell me more about that. Sure. And
so when you go to see John of God,

187
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:01,050
you can also make wishes and so you go
down with your three intentions and sort

188
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,930
of like wishing for, you know,
through a genie in a bottle.

189
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,700
And what you can also do is
bring photographs of other
people who would like to

190
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,560
be seen. My John of God,
who can't make the trip.

191
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:15,561
So you can save them the airfare down in
Brazil and he will scan the photographs

192
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:17,790
and apparently do distance healing.

193
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,570
So I guess if you believe that he
can heal you by looking at you,

194
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,050
it's probably not that much of a leap
to think that he could also heal other

195
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,890
people by scanning of voter photograph.
So when I was going down,

196
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,100
I started offering to people, including
some colleagues at Google, um,

197
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,360
that I could take their pictures down
and that I could also take their wishes

198
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:37,200
down if they wanted.

199
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,920
And then I started telling around
people because I'm super chatty.

200
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:43,920
And so I was telling like the guy at the
coffee shop and like the lady at whole

201
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:47,020
foods and all these other people who have
like a stack of photos with you. Yeah.

202
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,520
So I ended up getting
bombarded with emails,

203
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,200
like to the point where
it was really crazy.

204
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:56,770
Like I just so many emails and I had to
go run and get a bunch of photos printed,

205
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,990
uh, you know, the local
Dwayne Reed and whatever.

206
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,920
And so I went down with all these
wishes and all these photographs. Um,

207
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,080
and it wasn't until I was
kind of researching the
entire book and working on the

208
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:13,081
conclusion that I went back and actually
read the emails with a fresh eye and I

209
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,280
noticed a few things in common amongst
the emails and there were, you know,

210
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,920
there are some things that were
not necessarily as interesting.

211
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:24,190
Like people gave me very specific
instructions on how they could be reached.

212
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,430
It was like, just in case this
shit's real. Oop, sorry. Ah,

213
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,830
it in cases Israel, uh, I want to make
sure my wishes going to the right person.

214
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,800
Right. So they gave me like a
full addresses apartment numbers,

215
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:40,330
like where they could be reached then the
end of class. Yeah. It was like, don't,

216
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,190
don't let them screw it up.
If this is going to be real.

217
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,130
I want to make sure the wishes are coming.
Like the,

218
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,310
the good stuff is coming
to my house. Yeah. Um,

219
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,400
the second thing that I
saw in these wishes is that
everybody was asking for the

220
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:55,000
same things and it was health,
happiness and love.

221
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,220
And it was in that order. And then the
third thing is that they all ended,

222
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:03,460
every single email I ended in
the same way. And they all said,

223
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,150
please don't tell anyone. Which I
thought was like, I'm telling all of you.

224
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,620
I see me. Um, I also told a bunch of
people at Ted and laying everywhere.

225
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:14,920
I did it on the stage and I wrote it
in my book. So I've told everybody,

226
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,750
but I think it's because
it's really important.

227
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,330
It's important for us to know
that we at the end of the day,

228
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,510
mostly all want the same thing,
right? So at the end of the day,

229
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,720
despite all of our differences and all
the things that we might be searching for

230
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,230
that are different, um, all the political
divides, the religious divides us,

231
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,650
you know,

232
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,650
every other philosophical divide in the
divisive time that at the end of the

233
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,790
day, we really all want the
same things. It reminds me of,

234
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,810
um, one of the things you talk about
in your book, which is burning man.

235
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:46,420
So I've been to burning man and,
and you go,

236
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,310
you have the opportunity to write on
the wall of the temple. The temple,

237
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,670
something usually like a letter to someone
who's passed or wishes or whatever.

238
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,520
Um, and I found that to
be really moving. Um,

239
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,890
can you tell us a little bit
about your experience there?

240
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:05,260
I know there's somebody in the
audience here. You went to burning man.

241
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,510
I met him at burning man.
We didn't even know each other.

242
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,880
Google and we were in the same camp.
Um,

243
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,520
I feel like everybody at Google
was wanting to burning man,

244
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,440
isn't it a job requirement?
There's nodding heads.

245
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:20,070
So if you can imagine me as a
lawyer going into burning man,

246
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,800
I mean like a reasonably uptight
person going to burning man.

247
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:26,200
You can just do the math on what
that experience was like. For me,

248
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,980
it was really uncomfortable at
first and I went and I was like,

249
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:34,540
I feel so out of place and I don't know
what I am doing here and I don't have

250
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,390
clothes to radically self express myself.

251
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:41,050
Like I had to borrow this outfit from
somebody. Like I don't Ha, you know, I am.

252
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,780
I worked in tech. No, I
did not have costumes.

253
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,900
I don't have a lot of feathers
in my wardrobe. You don't like,

254
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,030
I don't have stuff to
where it burning man.

255
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,190
No one's going to see me in a bikini top.
Like it's just not happening.

256
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,510
I've had a child,
it's not happening.

257
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,690
So going there was really
out of my comfort zone to
put myself in that situation

258
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,350
and I ended up loving it
after a couple of days.

259
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:07,720
Like once I kinda got in my groove and
got over myself and got over the and not

260
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:11,750
over the the general lack of dryness.
Yeah,

261
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:16,130
just the dryness and the lack of
sanitary conditions around bathrooms.

262
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,170
I once I got over that I was,
I really enjoyed it and I felt like,

263
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,530
um, I, you know, I feel like you really,

264
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:28,520
that cliche of what you need out of
that experience is truly what you get.

265
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,490
And I think that was true for me.
I got a lot of rest at burning man.

266
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:34,640
I think I was the only person who
came back reasonably well. Preston,

267
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,830
which also just tells you what
a nerd I am. Cause I was like,

268
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,290
[inaudible] I'm going to go to sleep.
Like I just was like,

269
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,590
not the person staying up until five in
the morning and like doing drugs in the

270
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,370
desert. Like I was just like, no, I'm
just going to go read a book and like,

271
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,760
you know, sleep in the healing dome.
Like I was really taking it easy. Um,

272
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,590
but I engage with it in a way that was
comfortable for me and I think I got out

273
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:55,550
of it what I needed to.

274
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,200
And the temple I think was a particularly
powerful thing for me as well.

275
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,130
Did you write something? Yeah, I left a
lot of wishes for friends. Again, sort of,

276
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:08,600
I think part of the journey and the way
I've kind of justified indulging in this

277
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:12,710
journey, it was taking people along
with me virtually or mentally,

278
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,550
wherever I could. So going to burning
man, it's like who else has got a wish?

279
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,980
Like I'll put it in a temple
for you. And so, you know,

280
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:23,981
writing those for people was a really
emotionally cathartic experience in a way

281
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:25,820
that I was really surprised by.

282
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:30,440
Like people who are mourning friends
and loved ones, including a Googler,

283
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,390
you know,
who had died in the Nepal earthquake,

284
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,560
who you all probably remember who is a
friend of mine and a friend of a lot of

285
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,050
friends in common.
Um,

286
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,990
and so just being able to bear
witness to that and to, you know,

287
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:46,991
to kind of mark that for his mom and
for his friends was really meaningful.

288
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,100
And so I think again,
I got,

289
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,490
I got out of it what I needed to and
it's my favorite chapter in the box.

290
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:56,030
So there's also that, which
is, so speaking of the book,

291
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,820
when I was reading it,
um,

292
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,040
every night I would sort of come
home and be like, yet, wonder what,

293
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,630
what wacky store here tonight?

294
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,140
And it's sort of like hanging
out with you on like, you know,

295
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,360
and getting to hear all
of your best stories.

296
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:15,500
So what do you think of all
of these wacky adventures?

297
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:20,450
Like what's the craziest thing
that you saw? I would say,

298
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:20,960
uh,

299
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,960
the tantric sound healing was probably
one of the more out there experiences.

300
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:31,370
My, my dad read the book and he, when the
galleys came out and he was just like,

301
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,920
he couldn't look me in the eye for a
couple of days. Like he was just like,

302
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:38,210
what on earth are you up to? And can you
go back to Google? Are they still hiring?

303
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:41,180
Can you go back and do you
feel comfortable telling
these guys? Sure. Yeah.

304
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:43,370
So it's um,
the,

305
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,790
the experience was I actually went after
a Google sales conference because we

306
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:50,040
had sales conference out in health
go with Google salespeople. No,

307
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,290
nobody from Google joined me.
I should have asked people.

308
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,540
I did not invite anyone
on that particular truck,

309
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,310
but other friends of mine
who is a screenwriter was
going to this thing down in

310
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,850
southern California right outside
of La and Santa Barbara and it,

311
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,170
and she told me about it.

312
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:07,560
And so I went to meet her after Google
sales conference cause I was already on

313
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:10,590
the west coast. So a lot of the things,
it sounds like a very diligent like, oh,

314
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:14,370
I'm like privilege and flying all over
the world that I really did tack a lot of

315
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:17,780
the things that I did on to work.
Travel, not just Google were child,

316
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:21,750
but just like generally because I'm a
mom and I have a budget and I'm a working

317
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:25,250
person. And so trying to coordinate
these things into real life is,

318
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,250
was part of the challenge.

319
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:29,610
And part of the reason the book
talks along the research. Um,

320
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,240
but how long they would take.
I worked on it.

321
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:37,290
I probably researched,
I started at when Xeo was about one,

322
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,640
she's turning nine in February. The bulky,
I mean, probably like six, seven years.

323
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:44,790
I mean, every research and writing, I'm
not constantly obviously, but like, yeah,

324
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,800
over the course of six years, it's
a full time thing. Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:54,990
Um,
and so he basically,

326
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,450
you lie on the ground and this,

327
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,030
this guy is like a 65,

328
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:03,450
seven year old Indian man
who was not my husband.

329
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:07,140
He lies on top of you. There's a
sheet between you. So it's not,

330
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:10,220
it's weirdly not sexual. I
mean, not for me at least. So.

331
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,590
So he lies on top of
you and then he chance,

332
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,060
I can't believe I'm telling
the story of Google,

333
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,240
he founded itchy your shock rub points.

334
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,610
So if you know your shockers are,

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,640
you can use your imagination of
what that entails. But he had like,

336
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,780
he sounds into your,
into your head and then like her throat,

337
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,610
then you all the way down,
all the way down. It goes
all the way down. And it was,

338
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,710
it was super bizarre. I
mean, as you can imagine,

339
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:38,460
so he's doing this and it goes on
for like 45 minutes to really, yeah,

340
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:43,200
like you're committed to this experience
and then it's a group activity because

341
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:46,380
there's people who are
not all doing it with him,

342
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:49,110
but they're all sitting around you
as this is happening. So again,

343
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,490
I mean it's just, it was, that's, that
just wrote itself. I don't, you know,

344
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,970
I don't know how you write about that
and share that experience with people if

345
00:19:56,971 --> 00:20:00,150
you have experienced it herself.
But it was, it was crazy,

346
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:02,670
but it was also on legal moxie.
Like it was really,

347
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:07,230
it was like having noise
canceling headphones on or
being surrounded by like bs,

348
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:10,910
but they're not stinging you like just the
humming. Huh? I know it sounds strange.

349
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,810
It was actually kind of delightful.

350
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,340
I haven't gone back but I probably
should cause it was there.

351
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,580
There are people who really enjoyed it.

352
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,890
I'm much more than I did but that aint
give me his number. He's on Facebook.

353
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,440
He follows me on Facebook. Oh awesome. So,

354
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,980
so, so, so speaking of
group group activities,

355
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:35,570
one of the things you talk about is
going to this Wiccan, potluck dinner.

356
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,630
Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Because I found those,

357
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,040
so when I think about Wicca, I'm kind
of like, these are witches and you know,

358
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,800
I don't really know what that means.
And it sounds a little dark.

359
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,370
But that chapter was super

360
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,810
lighthearted and, and women seemed really
lovely. Yeah, everybody was amazing.

361
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:57,811
That was actually one of the chapters
that I think really challenged my own,

362
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,840
I guess unconscious bias against witches.
I didn't know I had it,

363
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:06,010
but it was the one thing I
know, I'm sorry. It's anyone
in here as a Wiccan, like,

364
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:10,600
I'm, I'm fully converted. Like I'm, I'm
in it. I really respect what you do.

365
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,740
Um, the, that was the one thing that
my editor actually encouraged me to do.

366
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,550
So everything else was
basically researched and
planned of what I was doing.

367
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:22,060
Right. Already done the research. And
my editor was like, you know, the one,

368
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,590
the gap that you have in this is Wicca.
And I was like, why? Like I, you know,

369
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,310
I had this really childlike,
um,

370
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,230
preconception of what it would mean to
be Wikipedia, black pointy hats. Like I,

371
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,110
you know, my kid watches Disney movies.
Like I would, that's what I was picturing,

372
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:41,290
which is so, you know, it's,
it's such an unconscious bias.

373
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,140
Like I didn't even realize that I have
this bias against witches. And I was like,

374
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,840
oh, I don't want to do that. It's kind
of scary. Like I don't want to do that.

375
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,420
And then she kind of kept encouraging me.
She's like,

376
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:53,350
I feel like that's the one thing that
people do when they first step out of

377
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:55,930
traditional religion that a lot of people
explore that. And I was like, all right,

378
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:59,180
fine. So I started researching it and as
I researched more and more, I was like,

379
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,400
this is actually super
interesting because it is, um,

380
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,670
there was no like rulebook right?
Like it really is a choose what you want.

381
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,340
I'll let and practice the AH,
um,

382
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:13,390
in a way that I think so much of us who
don't ascribe to a specific religion or

383
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:17,260
religious tradition but still want to
find something and some meaning would

384
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,000
actually be like, oh
yeah, that makes sense.

385
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,270
Like I believe in equal like eating
seasonally or would have, you know,

386
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:27,100
like I respect nature. Like I do a lot of
the things that are core principles. Um,

387
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,430
I believe in being good to people and
hoping that that comes back to me and that

388
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,640
kind of thing. And so
going, I went to a potluck,

389
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:37,870
it was a Thanksgiving potluck for,
but not related to our,

390
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,080
like to American thanksgiving.
It was, I guess Wicca,

391
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:43,360
thanksgiving because there was a
little bit, when is wicked thanks.

392
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,260
It was right around my daughter's
homecoming times. So like it was probably,

393
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:51,250
I think October, September, October. I
think it's done by the lunar Oh yeah.

394
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,350
Must be harvest. Yeah. It's
like Harvard. Exactly. Um,

395
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,930
and it was at the LGBT center
in Manhattan and it was,

396
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,300
it was really wonderful.
Like after you got off,

397
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,350
after I got over the sort of initial
awkwardness of just dining with strangers.

398
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,080
It was, they, it was such a wonderful,
warm group of people. I know.

399
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,890
It's really just people again
searching like the rest of us, right?

400
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,490
They just trying to find community,
trying to find connection. Um,

401
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,960
a lot of people were new to the city
and they were just looking for somebody

402
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:23,290
else to have that kind of moment with.

403
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,060
And it was a really lovely
dinner and these witches
could cook. It was good food.

404
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,560
My contributions were lackluster,
but there's where we're quite delicious.

405
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,510
It was a really,
it was a really special evening.

406
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,800
So was there any time during this,
I guess, journey where you are,

407
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:44,680
like your curiosity was really peaked
about a particular religion where you were

408
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:48,680
saying, maybe I'll actually go
in that direction. You know,

409
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:51,200
I didn't really do
traditional religious stuff.

410
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,010
So I mean if Waco was probably the most
traditional religion that I explored

411
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,830
there's, and it gives you an
idea. Yeah. So there weren't,

412
00:23:57,831 --> 00:24:00,440
the meditation was really powerful for me.

413
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:04,550
I think that's something that I had
started doing when I worked at Google.

414
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:09,310
In fact to end the TM, the TM hard. Um,

415
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,310
and that's a practice that's really stuck
with me and that's become almost like

416
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:16,100
mental hygiene for me. Like
our daily flossing, right?

417
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:20,120
Like I just do it because it feels good
and it's not like your teeth will fall

418
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:22,880
out if you don't floss one day, but you
kind of feel achy all day. It's like,

419
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:24,590
that's what I feel like about meditation.

420
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,680
It's like if I download a 10 minutes in
the morning and 10 minutes and I do 20

421
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:28,491
minutes in the morning,

422
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:32,060
I used to be able to do 20 minutes in
the afternoon when I worked here because

423
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,330
they have things like because a
girl and it cause Google. I know,

424
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,490
but then don't leave Google ever.

425
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,310
You can never do that kind of
stuff when you leave this place.

426
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,540
There is no meditation room at other
startups, like they don't have the space.

427
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:49,070
And so that practice fall by the wayside
when I left Google, but when I was here,

428
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,700
it was something that I did, you
know, twice a day and was pretty,

429
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,500
pretty committed to it. Um, so that's
a practice that's really stuck for me.

430
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,190
And in terms of the other things,
not really,

431
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,460
like none of them are things
that I've been like, oh,

432
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,790
I want to go back to that again and
again and I think this is my thing. So,

433
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,390
but I think I've gotten it to be okay with
that. I sort of got to the end of the,

434
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,480
the journey, at least for the
narrative of this story, um,

435
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,470
and got comfortable with just sort of
stopping for a minute. When was that?

436
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,030
What has,
you know,

437
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:24,530
I did bring a plus into the wine on the
silent meditation retreat and I think

438
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:28,350
just being still for that long
and shutting up for awhile,

439
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,480
it was really good for me and it got me
out of my head and it got me out of this

440
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:35,360
sort of frantic search and just
being like, you know, you kind of,

441
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,000
you probably know the answers
to a lot of the things,

442
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:43,001
at least what's true for you if you just
quiet down a little bit and stopped for

443
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,340
a minute.
And so that's what I ultimately did.

444
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:48,320
I sort of stopped the frantic search.

445
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:52,130
It felt like a nice natural ending to
the story for this particular book.

446
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,700
And I don't have that same kind of,
um,

447
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,850
urgency around answering these questions,

448
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,890
but I still, you know, people ask me to
do stuff all the time and I'm like, yeah,

449
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:05,120
let's go do that.
Like it's,

450
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,810
I think the curiosity and the
search of it is still fun for me.

451
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:12,290
So I every so often we'll
go do it. Like, yeah,

452
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,410
I'm pretty sure if you asked any of the
people in this audience they want to

453
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:19,370
come with you, including
me. So I have to ask,

454
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,390
what about Zia?
Like what was the end result for her?

455
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:26,210
She must've seen you doing this.
She knew you published the book.

456
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,510
Like how did this impact her life?
Yeah,

457
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,400
so she was really little when I
was doing most of the research.

458
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:35,870
And so I think she just thinks I'm sort
of cookie and like always off doing

459
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,501
things.

460
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:40,670
It was concerning when she would tell
her her teachers about where you can

461
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:43,260
imagine like a button hadn't
private school. Like they were like,

462
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,370
oh we heard you weren't talking for a few
days. I'm like what is everything okay.

463
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,900
And I was like, no, I was
at a retreat. You know,

464
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:52,110
like they're like or kindergarten teachers
were super concerned when I came back

465
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,970
from that, from that silent retreat. Um,

466
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,800
cause he would just give them a bit
of information. But I think, you know,

467
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:01,740
what's been the most interesting
thing for the questions,

468
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,060
she does ask me questions that are
themed to the book and we just have

469
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,520
conversations about it. I'm like,
what do you think the answer is? Like,

470
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:10,290
I don't know what happens when you die.
Like what do you think?

471
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,800
And she actually weirdly has a very easy
relationship with the idea of death.

472
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,430
Like that's something that since
she was little, I had told her, um,

473
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,200
actually went down Frydenberg who died.

474
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,540
I had told her that when people die,
um,

475
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,170
but they become stars in the sky.

476
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,470
My husband and I had told her that's
because she had come across a picture of

477
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:30,630
his mother who had,
has to wait when he was quite young.

478
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,490
And I don't know why we said that,

479
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:34,980
but that's what we kind of turned to
were like, yeah, they become star.

480
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:35,814
She was like three.

481
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,620
And so when don passed away and she
heard me on the phone talking to somebody

482
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:43,620
and getting the news, she's
like, what happened? And I
said, well, you know, a good,

483
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,480
a good friend of, of our friends, um,

484
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,180
died in an earthquake and she's like,
she's her pauses. And she's like, Oh,

485
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:54,870
you mean you became a star in
the sky? And I was like, Oh yeah,

486
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,860
I think he did. You know,
it was just a really, like,

487
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,940
maybe I'm not screwing this up so badly,
but it was really beautiful moment.

488
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:04,921
It sounds,

489
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:09,921
and you also described to me another
beautiful moment about the library and in

490
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:13,440
your daughters saw, I wondered if
you would tell all of these. Yeah,

491
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,800
so not really related to
the spirituality piece,

492
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:21,300
but I think just the idea of all these
conversations we're having and in a place

493
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:25,530
like Google or just across corporate
America or Hollywood or anywhere around

494
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,000
diversity and inclusiveness. And one of
the things that I did not expect was, um,

495
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,750
how much that having that book
on a shelf would mean to me.

496
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,970
And so the story we were talking about,
um,

497
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,830
when my book came out soon after my
daughter's school librarian, you know,

498
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:42,880
to send me a text and she was like,
oh,

499
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,900
she sent me a picture of the book and
the School Library and she's like, oh,

500
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:48,530
we just got a copy of your book
and the next time your end,

501
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:52,800
could you sign it for us? And I just
started crying and I was so surprised.

502
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:55,770
Like this is the most impactful thing.
Like I've done a Ted talk and I was like,

503
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,150
this is the moment where I was like,

504
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:02,220
I can't believe that my little kid will
walk into a school library to her school

505
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:05,880
library and see a story
that literally reflects her,

506
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,020
reflects her story in some way back
to her [inaudible] I get like a little

507
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:11,970
choked up thinking about it and it's,

508
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,210
it had meant so much to me because
growing up in this country,

509
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,550
in the time that I grew up,
uh,

510
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,510
I did not have that expectation and I
didn't even know it was an option. Like,

511
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,620
I didn't know to be,

512
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:25,260
I didn't know I was being cut out of a
narrative or that my narrative didn't

513
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:28,770
exist on the library shelves
or in Hollywood or anything
else. They're just like,

514
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:31,020
oh, I'm an recent immigrant
to this country. Like,

515
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,110
why would my story of nobody would
tell your style, like, you know,

516
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,910
why'd to watch Bollywood films?
And that's definitely not my narrative,

517
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:36,481
but that's,
you know,

518
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:39,590
that's what I would watch to see
somebody who looked like me, um,

519
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,010
and definitely can downs
like me, uh, on the screen.

520
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,770
But it wasn't something
I had an expectation of.

521
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:49,150
And to know that she and her friends
would have that experience was so,

522
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:51,810
so moving and meaningful to
me in a way that it wasn't

523
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,300
expected. Yeah. So,

524
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,260
so what now, so what are, what
are you doing now? Oh Gosh,

525
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,870
a million dollar question.
I'm trying to come back to Google.

526
00:30:00,871 --> 00:30:03,200
I've decided that I can just
hide out in the hallways.

527
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,420
None of you would even notice. Like
I could just stay here forever. Now.

528
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:10,680
I am kidding. I am. Uh, the
book came out a bit ago,

529
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:13,530
a few months ago,
and so there's been some great,

530
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,610
exciting and trust around turning
it into television and some way,

531
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:21,600
which it would be been.
Talk about like seeing yourself on screen.

532
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,440
Not that I would be in it, but that
other people would, would play you. Ooh.

533
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,490
Who are you thinking play you?
Julia Roberts? No, I don't know.

534
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,210
I'm totally getting, um, I don't know.

535
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,790
I like the idea of Archie Panjabi
do you guys remember from like,

536
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,870
not like back home? She played her
sister and, but I was like, fuck,

537
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:44,820
I'm just super funny and like really like,
she was like quick and funny.

538
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,300
I really liked her.
Um, so yeah, maybe her,

539
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,300
and then I told my husband
that Dev Patel should play him

540
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,190
just saying, and he started getting
annoyed with me because I'm like,

541
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:59,700
did you see him in Gq? Like he's
somewhat sometimes minor. Like this guy,

542
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:02,310
he got super cute. You should, he should
play you. And he's like, you got to stop.

543
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,580
So I'm going to, I was, yeah, it was,
it was only funny to me apparently.

544
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:08,640
But I hit on him in a gym once
you did it. Yeah, it's great.

545
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:14,200
We'll talk about that in the after show.
That's um,

546
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:19,200
so that, yeah. So there's
some talk of that, which would
be really, really exciting.

547
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,380
Um, I'm thinking about if I would
write another book. I don't know.

548
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,060
I'm doing some writing different,

549
00:31:24,061 --> 00:31:26,790
like sort of my first time
doing different things.

550
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,020
I was just a clown in the Macy's
Day parade. Yeah, Super Fun.

551
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,190
There's definitely an article there.
I highly recommend all of you to do that.

552
00:31:35,191 --> 00:31:36,510
If you ever have the opportunity,

553
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:39,450
you can volunteer to be a clown in
the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.

554
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,200
Didn't know that was a thing.
Super Fun. Totally crazy. Um,

555
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,440
so there's things like that
that I'm exploring. Um,

556
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,930
and then I don't know, we'll see. I'm
excited. Stay tuned. All right, cool.

557
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,310
Cool.
Well

558
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,240
before we open it up to questions, I guess
I would say like, you know, what advice

559
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,560
do you have for fellow seekers like

560
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,783
me?

561
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,300
I definitely don't have answers and I
really do think it is about ultimately

562
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:13,010
getting still and knowing
that you hound them, you.

563
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,083
Hmm.

564
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,870
Like the,
whoever's telling you that they know,

565
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,550
they know for them but they don't know.

566
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,400
So I know for you that's my, that's my
gut. That's good advice. Yeah. All right.

567
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,250
Thank you. Thank you. Will
you take some questions?

568
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,870
Anybody have any questions?
Not all at once.

569
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,203
Okay.

570
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,010
Hi. Hi. Hi, I'm Susanna.
Thank you so much.

571
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,160
I think it's really interesting
what you spoke about. Um, uh,

572
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,470
definitely would read the book,

573
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,500
but what I'm finding it difficult to is
tying all this together and if you had

574
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:58,520
to say something like what, what should
the reader take away from this book?

575
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,740
Like is there a, is there an
underlying tank? Like, Hey,
I did this, this, this, this,

576
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:07,400
and this is what I would conclude
or this is what I would say.

577
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,550
I'm just trying to figure. Yeah. Um,
thank you for your question. I think the,

578
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,290
the conclusion is really
a bit of a non conclusion.

579
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:19,260
It was sort of like this is an ongoing
journey. This is something that,

580
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:23,400
it was a very naive of me to think that
I could answer within the pages of a 250

581
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:27,330
page book. Because if that was possible,
somebody would've done it already. And,

582
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,220
and it was really,
you know,

583
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:32,250
that I'll be searching probably for the
rest of my life and then I'm okay with

584
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:32,970
that.

585
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,350
And then the story that I told earlier
about John of God and about the letters

586
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:41,880
that I've received about for me was really
a conclusion to it was just that you

587
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:45,840
were all seeking the same things.
And so the health,

588
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:48,530
happiness and love part of that,
um,

589
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,690
gave me a lot of comfort that ultimately
everyone that I know really wants the

590
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:54,391
same things.

591
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:57,510
And if I can focus on that and on the
things that bind us together as opposed to

592
00:33:57,511 --> 00:34:01,060
the things that drive us apart,
especially in times like this, um,

593
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,850
I might be on the past to
something. Thank you. Thank you.

594
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,530
Yeah. Angela, thanks for coming. Hi
Erica. Thanks for being here. Um,

595
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:15,870
so the tech industry is facing some
really massive questions around

596
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:19,060
responsibility, accountability, um,

597
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:24,160
an analog parts of society and the way
we've, yeah, in so many ways. Right.

598
00:34:24,161 --> 00:34:28,150
Sundar was that car in Congress
yesterday. Um, you also mentioned,

599
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:31,270
it was interesting thinking about how
when you started this journey you were a

600
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:33,340
little like quiet about it at Google.

601
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:38,320
And so the third part of this is Jack
Dorsey posted this tweet storm or a few

602
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,950
days ago he did a 10 day silent meditation
treat in Mirror a retreat and Miramar.

603
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,293
Um,

604
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,530
what do you think the space is or
the role is for spirituality in tech?

605
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,270
Um, why is it not talked about
and at the executive level,

606
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,640
do you think it's an important
character trait for a leader? Oh,

607
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,320
that's such a great question,

608
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:00,660
which I know is not the response
we're supposed to give to a question,

609
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:04,140
but it really is a great question.
Um, why is it on talked about?

610
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,080
Did you guys watch Silicon Valley?
I mean, I suppose your lists,

611
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,740
I don't want to watch it.
So I had missed seasons of it and there's,

612
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:16,080
there's like season five or something on
United flights and I was watching like

613
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,910
one episode,
which you can catch on pretty quickly,

614
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:19,140
but like you can figure
out what's going on.

615
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,700
And it was an episode about one of the
developers who was going to come onto the

616
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:28,240
plot, the new Internet, um, where they
find out that he's Christian, right?

617
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,870
So it's like he's going to start a gay
dating website and was like, that's cool.

618
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:33,190
Like that's great. I like the word he's
knew that. And then it's like, wait,

619
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:36,450
he's Christian. They're like, don't tell
anybody. And it becomes this big thing.

620
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,300
And I thought was so fascinating. So
look, that's what it's like, right?

621
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:43,890
It's like the last taboo. We talk about
everything now. Nothing's off the table.

622
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:48,360
But for some reason, the
thing that arguably is one
of the most important things,

623
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:52,200
like what do you believe about the things
that really matter that really drive

624
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:54,960
your every day?
And we can't have those conversations.

625
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:57,390
And I don't know why that is.
I was,

626
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm embarrassed to talk about it cause
I really thought everyone would think I

627
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:02,040
was nuts.
And I'm sure people that,

628
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,690
I remember a conversation at one
of the women at Google events now,

629
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:08,820
he'd just come back from Brazil and I
was talking to a very senior salesperson

630
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,030
at Google and I was telling her
and you could see her backing away.

631
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:15,330
She was going hard. Like why?
He's like this woman's crazy. Um,

632
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,780
and it was just such an
interesting experience because
I'm not this like deeply

633
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:19,441
religious person,

634
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:23,220
but the fact that I even have to say that
by way of like contextualized and like

635
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:26,610
don't worry, I'm not religious.
Like I'm just, I'm a secret.

636
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:29,490
I'm doing a lot of this for fun and I
have to like make people comfortable with

637
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,780
it I think is really interesting.

638
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,220
But the thing that they've also found
interesting is that since I've written

639
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:35,910
this book,

640
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,060
people come up to me and they spill
forth their religious views or their

641
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:42,660
spiritual views or their religious
upbringings like a confessional to me now.

642
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:47,070
So I know all kinds of stuff about people,
people that you know in tech,

643
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,070
not in like all over the planet.
And it's been,

644
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,110
that's been really interesting to me.
So to me there,

645
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,760
there seems to be a clear desire to
talk about these things because people

646
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:59,100
really do want to get to
the stuff that matters.

647
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,120
And I think until we all started
talking about this stuff,

648
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,860
nothing's gonna Change.
Right?

649
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:09,150
So is it important for our senior
leadership in a place like Google to talk

650
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:12,030
about that stuff? I don't know. I
don't want to impose on, you know,

651
00:37:12,031 --> 00:37:15,390
sooner that he should be telling everybody
if he's Hindu and if he's practicing

652
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:17,610
and if he goes to tumble and
if he believes in God like it,

653
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,870
maybe it doesn't matter.

654
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,650
But I think if that is something that
drives him and it's a belief system that

655
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:26,160
informs how he leads this company,
I think that's interesting.

656
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,090
I would want to know that.
Just out of curiosity, I
think it'd be interesting. Um,

657
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,580
thank you, Angela. You
for coming. Um, so I,

658
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:38,060
and myself from of a passenger meditator
and I did the 10 day course and

659
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:39,210
everything.
Um,

660
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,340
but I am new to New York and I've found
it to be extremely difficult in New York

661
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:47,290
to like find like 20 minutes
just to like calm down. Um,

662
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,970
so do you have any advice or
tips on how to meditate daily?

663
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,900
You need to get access to the mother's
room at Google and then go in there.

664
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:58,370
I'm sort of kidding, but it's sort of
true. I think actually focus rooms now.

665
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,690
Focus rooms.
Yes.

666
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,920
We have focus rooms where you're not
supposed to do anything except for sit and

667
00:38:03,921 --> 00:38:08,870
think, wow, I really want to
come back. That is the thing.

668
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,960
I'm joking aside. I
think it's really, it's,

669
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:16,100
it's being really intentional
about carving out the time
and doing it no matter

670
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:20,150
what. And I think if you start, when I
did that first TM class, I remember they,

671
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,360
they said that you had to do it for two
months I think or where they're like try

672
00:38:23,361 --> 00:38:25,550
to not break the habit or
the street for two months.

673
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,660
And then it just became a thing I did
where I now I am not a morning person and

674
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:33,230
I will wake up early to do it.
So if you can,

675
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,130
I would start by just
waking up like if it's 20

676
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,930
minutes, 10 minutes,
whatever your practices,

677
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,050
and then if you're trying to
find space during the day,

678
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,420
if you can block off a meeting,
I would do that.

679
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,350
Okay.

680
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,110
And I think in a place like
Google, people respected, actually,

681
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:49,240
it's not necessarily
true of other workplaces.

682
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:51,430
I can tell you that cause they'll be
like, you know, we've got a meeting,

683
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,550
this is the only other time everyone can
meet it and they just schedule over it.

684
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:56,620
But I feel like here you could
actually carve that space.

685
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,020
Have you done search inside yourself?

686
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,450
No.

687
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,360
So there is a course here
called search inside yourself,

688
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:07,890
which is essentially a meditation
course. Um, started by, um,

689
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,140
an ex Googler who's an
incredible guy and Mang. Anyway,

690
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,230
so search inside yourself as a
course here and at the end of it, uh,

691
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,460
you get paired up with a fellow.
Why Alumni?

692
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,560
And, um, you know,

693
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:25,890
the goal is essentially you have meetings
together so that you can carve out the

694
00:39:25,891 --> 00:39:28,650
time to meditate. And if you
write to that, that list,

695
00:39:28,651 --> 00:39:31,860
which is [inaudible] why dash alumni,
I don't know actually a full let me,

696
00:39:31,861 --> 00:39:34,370
he'll be able to access it. But, um,

697
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,460
there are tons of people who I'm sure
would love to set up time with you.

698
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:39,923
Great.
Thank you.

699
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,330
Hi.
Um,

700
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,770
so I feel like maybe the questions that
you started with in this book and the

701
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:50,640
questions that kind of started this
talk are generally like universal among

702
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:54,060
people. And I think that everyone kind
of wonders about a lot of these things.

703
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,520
I'm thinking about like myself personally,

704
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,650
I think my instincts are like my first,

705
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:04,010
whatever my first movement here would be
to think about exploring the more major

706
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,730
religions in the more
mainstream religions.

707
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:08,730
And I think that a lot of the stuff
you explored to kind of be a secondary

708
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:09,830
thought. Okay. Um,

709
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,020
can you talk a little bit more about
your decision to kind of go that route

710
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,300
instead of the more
mainstream religion room?

711
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,470
Yeah,
it's,

712
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,090
it was really because I'm not a theologian
and I didn't feel drawn Tonya them.

713
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,430
So I didn't feel like I could do a real,
uh,

714
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,440
an adequate job of like
exploring Christianity and
then a little bit of Judaism

715
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:29,280
and then Islam.
It's like,

716
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:32,970
how do you do that in a meaningful way
with a full time job with the new kid.

717
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,170
And I didn't feel Jon Tenney them
because I don't think this project was

718
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:39,570
necessarily a rejection of the
religion I was raised with.

719
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,590
If you ask me now like what religion
are you, I'd probably still answer John.

720
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:46,650
I'm like John Ish. Like people are
Jewish. I'm Jen Esch. You know,

721
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:50,400
like I think that's still directionally
what I feel makes sense for me because

722
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:51,540
it's so cultural to me.

723
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,860
So I think because I tied
religion and culture so,

724
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:00,300
so much together, it would be
like searching for a new culture.

725
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:02,430
And that wasn't really the project.

726
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,800
But a lot of people have asked
me that question. It just, yeah,

727
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:08,910
it wasn't something that felt like
the right direction. And so, um,

728
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,730
yeah,
so I went in this kind of other direction,

729
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,710
but everything that I
searched for and everything,

730
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,700
all the experiences that I did were very
much authentically what I felt curious

731
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:20,790
about. And so it wasn't like,
oh, what, don't make a funny
chapter. I was like, no,

732
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,730
I kind of want to go to burning man
and like I think I want to do a silent

733
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,040
meditation. We give us things
that I actually wanted to try.

734
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,090
Can I ask a followup
question please? Yeah. Um,

735
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,890
can you talk a little bit more
about the title of the book?

736
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,740
Because I feel like this is maybe when it,
like I,

737
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:39,860
I got is something that I associate
maybe more with mainstream religions then

738
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:42,070
with other spiritual practices.
Yeah.

739
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,070
And I'd be interested to hear about kind
of your thoughts about the connection

740
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,320
between those and,
right.

741
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,420
Um,

742
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,410
so the original title of the book that
I sold the proposal on was actually from

743
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:56,520
Google to God and then, and I loved it
and I thought it was really a funny title.

744
00:41:56,521 --> 00:41:59,790
And then my editor halfway through
my writing process was like,

745
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:02,640
you got to change the title because it
sounds like you left Google to become a

746
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:06,590
priest. And I was like, oh,
that's true. And that's not
what happens in the spot. Um,

747
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,770
but the idea of it just being a search,

748
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:14,970
I wanted some reference to the tech kind
of piece of it and the fact that tech

749
00:42:14,971 --> 00:42:16,350
played such a large part,

750
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,850
certainly in my personal journey
and just of life and my career,

751
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:24,900
but then also in how I was accessing a
lot of these things because so much of it

752
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:28,140
started with an internet search.
What did you know that was part of the,

753
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,310
the narrative, the stocking
reference. You know,

754
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,020
it's a bit of a provocative
sort of word to use,

755
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,010
but certainly like a Facebook stalking
kind of reference it like, but again,

756
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:42,450
tongue and cheek. So there was a lot of
thought put into the title and I think,

757
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,310
um,
it can be confusing to people.

758
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:48,270
There's definitely Amazon reviewers who
do not like my book because they're like,

759
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,750
that's not the answer.
And Christianity is answer whatever.

760
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:55,770
There's a couple of very angry
people on Amazon and I was like,

761
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:59,280
well then it's not for you and I get it.
But it was,

762
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,680
it was meant to be a
bit tongue in cheek to,

763
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,290
thank you.
Thanks.

764
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,020
Um, my first question was the same
as his actually my next question was,

765
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:15,050
is was anybody actually healed like that
you took to the Brazilian healer guy?

766
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,790
Oh, the followup. Like
did anybody ever photos?

767
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,710
So I don't think anyone I brought photos
of was struggling with a real medical

768
00:43:25,711 --> 00:43:29,250
condition of the, of the
batch that I had. Um,

769
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,660
but that's said in followups.
So he also,

770
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:37,200
John of got also makes a trip to like
Omega Institute in upstate New York.

771
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,580
And so I had gone last year
before my book came up,

772
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,940
came out, I drove up there cause
he was coming and I was Kinda like,

773
00:43:44,941 --> 00:43:48,630
Oh I feel like I should show a picture
of my book cover to them and have them

774
00:43:48,631 --> 00:43:49,710
scan that and heal it.

775
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,620
It's thought we be kind of like
a nice tying up for myself.

776
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,491
I don't know if he did it,

777
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:57,150
but I watched a picture of the book
cover and is in his bed in his basket.

778
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,530
And I did bring a photograph of a friend
who was just diagnosed with breast

779
00:44:01,531 --> 00:44:05,010
cancer and she is cancer free.

780
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,090
I don't think that did it. I mean she also
had medical treatment, right? Like, but,

781
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:13,230
but uh, I dunno if it gives
somebody a little bit of hope,

782
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,990
I think that's okay. Yeah.
Cool. Thank you. Yeah.

783
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,360
Hi Angela. Thank you so much
for coming. I really enjoy that.

784
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:27,240
Especially because last night I had
like my monthly existential crisis,

785
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:31,080
like taking on like these sorts of ideas.
Um,

786
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,900
and one of the thoughts that came was a,

787
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,960
and this is actually a followup from a
podcast I was listening to earlier this

788
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,050
week, um, was a bit like this,
this sort of rationalist mindset.

789
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,490
The very scientific driven
mindset is fairly modern.

790
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,350
Like it's a byproduct of like the post
industrial revolution movements. And,

791
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:50,184
um,

792
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,810
it's sort of like when you have that
mindset where like we want to critically

793
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,920
analyze, okay, why is this happening? I
found that like even doing meditation,

794
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:01,560
like my first thought
after it, it's like, okay,

795
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:04,590
it felt something but like why did I
feel that it has to be something like

796
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:06,780
neurological process that's causing this?

797
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:09,030
Like clearly it has to be a
rational explanation for that.

798
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,260
So when you're doing all of these
like very unorthodox things,

799
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:18,240
like did you find that you
needed to suspend that sort
of mindset of like, okay,

800
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:21,690
how like there has to be clearly
rational way to explain like why this has

801
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:21,900
happened?

802
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah, 100%. So if, um,

803
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:28,770
when you read my book is a way that the,
the narrative really plays off that way.

804
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,090
I,
there's,

805
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,890
there's like this a very lawyerly part
of me that does the research and we'll

806
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:38,550
talk about oxytocin release during a
hug and like what that might mean if,

807
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:41,100
and that's why hugging him,
I could be effective because of that.

808
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,840
But then the other side is kind of like,
well,

809
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:46,080
what's the feeling like she smelled
really nice. Like it was a little sweaty,

810
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,650
a little uncomfortable, but like it was
awesome and that, that juxtaposition,

811
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:53,190
I mean it was constant. Like it
was a constant dialogue in my head.

812
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:57,480
It continues to be just the way I
work and navigate the world. Um,

813
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,350
but that was very, very hard for me and
I would keep flipping back and forth.

814
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,890
And I do address it a lot in the book
cause I think that's so much of, uh,

815
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,970
so many of us are in the same position
where it's like we're raised to think of

816
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:13,500
very specific way or educated
and overeducated sort of
repeating things again

817
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:16,350
and again to be come experts at something.

818
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:19,770
And then here's this whole
set of questions that are
truly not Google a wall.

819
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,570
You will not find a satisfactory answer.

820
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,900
You will find people who are reporting
to know the answers on Google to all of

821
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:26,050
these questions.
Um,

822
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:29,460
I would challenge that maybe
their incorrect answers on Google.

823
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:31,590
You need to tweak the algorithm
on these particular things,

824
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:35,220
but there are just things that are
unknowable. And so if you start,

825
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,120
you know, I don't know how
you reconcile those things,

826
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:40,470
but I kind of flipped back and forth to,

827
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,260
but then ultimately it was like
I just got to suspend disbelief,

828
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:48,290
like I can't try to explain these things
otherwise I'll just be stuck in a loop.

829
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,860
Just as a small follow up the week
when you were actually having these

830
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:56,640
experiences, did you like just like push
aside any of the thoughts that are like,

831
00:46:56,641 --> 00:46:57,990
okay, why is this happening? Why is that?

832
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,390
No,
I think I did it really unsuccessfully.

833
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:02,020
There were moments that I would like the,

834
00:47:02,021 --> 00:47:05,010
the tantric sound healing being a perfect
example. There are moments I was like,

835
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:07,800
this is so weird. Like my head was
like, oh my God, I cannot believe,

836
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:10,950
do I and I should not be doing this.
My parents like, what would they think?

837
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:13,740
Like they're going to hear about this. I'm
going to write, I can't write about it.

838
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:16,170
Like I was going on and I was like,
this is bananas. I am married.

839
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:18,780
Like what am I doing? You know? It
was just like a loop, a loop, a loop.

840
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,210
And then there are moments where it's
kind of like, all right, just like relax,

841
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:23,970
just breathe into it. And I was
like, oh, it's got a nice oily,

842
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:30,490
like this is him. This is bizarre. But it
also kind of not altogether unpleasant.

843
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,080
And then so, and then
I'd be like, oh my God,

844
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:34,670
I can't believe this man laying on
top of me. This is very awkward. Um,

845
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:36,850
and so it would just be
like a constant thing.

846
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:41,230
And not for me is also my meditation
cycle is like the monkey mind of the loop

847
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:44,110
of like, what's going on? I have to
make dinner, I have to go to this thing.

848
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,120
I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning,
blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, Oh,

849
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:48,630
I'm just be meditating and like munch
a bunch of much, much. I'm like, ah.

850
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,550
And I'm like, crap, did I fall asleep?
And I'd just keep going. And you know,

851
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,350
it's like constant and I think, um, I
feel like that's the very human journey.

852
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:59,830
I don't live in the woods, right? Like,
I don't live on a meditation farm.

853
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:03,320
I live in New York City. I lived downtown.
I take the subway, I walk everywhere.

854
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:06,670
Like it is hectic and I think
that's just part of our life.

855
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:10,150
But if you can push that reset
button every day in some way,

856
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,080
and the fact that you're just asking them
questions I think is great, you know.

857
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:19,160
Thank you. Going back this
way. Huh? Nice to see you.

858
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:22,580
Thank you for coming in.
Um, how did you know,

859
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:26,540
it sounds like you got to a point where
you felt at peace that like the search

860
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,740
you had searched enough,

861
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,470
you didn't find specific answers
and you were okay with that.

862
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:31,820
Can you describe that?

863
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:35,210
Because when you're just talking about
the constant loop and it's really hard to

864
00:48:35,211 --> 00:48:36,230
break that cycle,

865
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:40,770
how did you feel fulfilled on this journey
and what was that moment like? Yeah,

866
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,930
there are a couple of
things that drove that.

867
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,980
I think one was definitely the silent
meditation experience of just being still

868
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:51,420
for that long. I didn't do a full 10
days. I tell that story of why I'm fuck,

869
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:56,190
but it's, I did a five day retreat
and uh, by the end and I was like,

870
00:48:56,191 --> 00:48:58,230
I think,
I think I'm good for a minute.

871
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,500
Like I feel like just stopping and I
just need to sit with what I've already

872
00:49:01,501 --> 00:49:05,490
researched and sort of be in that, um,
and, and feel like I have enough data,

873
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:09,600
you know, to lead Gen form
something that felt right.

874
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,630
And then also, truthfully, it was
partially because I was on deadline.

875
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,580
It was like I can't keep
searching and I can't,

876
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:19,581
I've got to turn this book in and I have
to be okay with not having a conclusion

877
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,310
because I'm not going to in
time for this book to come out.

878
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:27,210
And so either I can spend the rest of
my life writing this book and it will be

879
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:32,570
written and published post humorously
or I can try to wrap this up and be okay

880
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:35,970
with the knowledge that I will never
know the answer to these questions.

881
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:40,530
And that's where he chose to land.
Sorry, one more, one more question.

882
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:41,723
Um,

883
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,080
it sounds like the impetus of this search
was more about your daughter and the

884
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:50,460
question she might have as she grows
older. When did you decide, hey,

885
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:53,760
this is a book and I should probably
put this out there for more people to

886
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:56,520
absorb? Ooh, that's a
good question. You know,

887
00:49:56,521 --> 00:49:59,760
there was a moment where it was going to
be a film and then I realized I did not

888
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:00,660
want to be in a film.

889
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:04,890
And so that was pushed aside and then I,

890
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,130
but I felt like there was something I
wanted to do with it because it was fun in

891
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:12,370
anyone. I would tell the stories too
would be like, you have to ride the salad.

892
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,150
These are such funny stories or
they're really interesting or whatever,

893
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:17,400
depending on what story was.
Um,

894
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:21,410
so I started taking better notes
as I would do things. And then, uh,

895
00:50:21,411 --> 00:50:25,020
I met an agent a few years ago and he
was like, you've got to write this.

896
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:28,400
Like this is a book. I know I can sell
it. And that's what ended up happening.

897
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,920
So it's sort of,
I never set out to write a book.

898
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:34,370
It just sort of it and it sounds
like such a jerky thing to be like,

899
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:36,950
it's just sort of happened, but that's
kind of what happened. It felt like,

900
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,150
you know Jesus took the wheel. No, I'm
just joking. I that's not inappropriate,

901
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:43,340
but I just, I feel like
it does. They just,

902
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:47,180
it's sort of just played out the
way it was meant to I think. Yeah.

903
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:49,823
Even question,

904
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,750
how forthcoming were you when you
went and traveled around and met with

905
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:55,670
different,
like when you went to the and potluck,

906
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:58,730
did they ask you why you were there?
Did you tell them and if so,

907
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:03,110
what was the response? I was
incredibly forthcoming. I am a lawyer.

908
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:07,520
I do not want to get sued by anybody. I
wasn't trying to dupe anybody. I was very,

909
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:11,690
very clear that I was,
once I decided to turn it into a book,

910
00:51:11,691 --> 00:51:16,460
I was very clear that I was writing
a book and for anybody that was prior

911
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:17,211
chapters,

912
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:19,940
I reached out to people to make sure that
they were okay with what I was writing

913
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:22,820
because everything in the book was true.
And so anyone that,

914
00:51:22,821 --> 00:51:24,380
I certainly if I named them,

915
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:28,580
I gave everyone the opportunity to change
our name or to read what I was writing.

916
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:33,480
So I didn't want anyone to feel made
fun of or you know, like thought,

917
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,220
like kind of side swiped from what I was
writing because it was not meant to be

918
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:41,360
like a takedown of, of all these
different practices. So I was very,

919
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:44,180
very forthcoming when I,
when I did it. Thank you.

920
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:48,550
From the legal team of
Google for asking. Yeah. Um,

921
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:53,240
were there any ways in which you feel
like your life has been changed in either

922
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:57,380
positive or negative ways that you were
not expecting after the experience?

923
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,880
From the research or just
the whole experience reading
anything? Yeah. Oh yeah.

924
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:05,540
It's opened up in ways that I wouldn't
have expected for sure. I think just,

925
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:05,930
you know,

926
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:10,930
what it did was one of the habits I think
I learned working at Google actually

927
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:14,810
was to be ready for anything and to
really put myself into uncomfortable

928
00:52:14,811 --> 00:52:17,050
situations. Right. Like,
again, as a lawyer,

929
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,060
you're trying to like know something to
go really deep on that issue to really

930
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:20,894
be the expert.

931
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,650
And working at Google in the years
that I did that was not going to be the

932
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:26,450
situation. It was like,
here's a new product,

933
00:52:26,451 --> 00:52:28,940
we're launching this other thing and
you just have to go figure it out.

934
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,880
And working that muscle here,
um,

935
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:35,720
I think led to me being really comfortable
going into these very uncomfortable

936
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:40,220
situations for the research for this
book and has become a theme of both my

937
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:44,090
career and my personal life
since then where it's been like,

938
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:47,450
it's just opened up all these things
because something like becoming a clown in

939
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:48,800
the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade,

940
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:52,450
like that is not something I would ever
have thought I would do. And I went,

941
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,990
I had so much fun and it was so goofy
and it was such a delightful thing to do.

942
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:01,970
And I think it's because I worked at
Google and then did something like this

943
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:05,960
that I'm willing to put myself out there
and sort of suck the marrow out of life

944
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:09,680
while I'm here. And I think
that's definitely what this
has taught me. For sure.

945
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:15,020
Yeah. Thank you, Angela. Faye coming.

946
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:16,610
And I think if we've learned anything,

947
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:21,611
it's that in addition to wanting love and
health and what was the APP enough and

948
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:26,040
happiness, I think also everybody
kind of wants to know. Yeah. What's

949
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,600
it all about? So thanks for bringing
us together to talk about that. And,

950
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,290
and um,
if you haven't read the book yet,

951
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:39,060
I highly recommend it. So much fun. Such
a fun journey at the back of the room.

952
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,470
Pick up a copy and it's nice to see
you all. Thank you all for being here.

953
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,070
Thank you so much.
