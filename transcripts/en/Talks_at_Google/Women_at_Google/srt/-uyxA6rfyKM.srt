We're super excited.

10
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:42,831
This has been a huge labor of love
and it has also been a really great

11
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,820
collaboration with her family.

12
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:48,690
They keep nes specifically
Susan [inaudible] who will
be joining us here in one

00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:51,630
moment. Suzette is a sister,
older sister of Santa Ana.

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,000
She was also a band mate incident idols.

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,510
He knows I'm a pretty cool
drummer if I do say so myself.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,010
And we're going to sit down and have
an awesome chat about the life and the

17
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:04,740
legacy of Selena as well as how they
felt about the process of the doodle.

18
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:07,110
So Suzette,
welcome in.

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,593
Okay.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,633
Hi.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,070
Thank you so much for coming. I'm not
texting anyone. Don't be, don't worry.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,340
I'm just going to pull up the
questions here. So, um, yeah.

23
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:21,950
And then there's also a lot of people
that you can't see, but if you,

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,900
I don't even know where we waved to,
like maybe have a,

25
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:28,250
I don't know if we're cool. Um,
all those people in TV land. Yeah.

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,600
So we're just gonna start off talking
about like life, um, in, in the band.

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,270
And I was going to be asking
questions just so everybody knows.

28
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:40,040
We'll do about 30 minutes of
just my questions. I know,

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,380
I know.
I know you're probably like,

30
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:44,840
I don't know if he can talk that long
parallel. I don't know if you're able to.

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,640
Um, but, uh, after those 30 minutes
I'll open it up for questions. Um, are,

32
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:54,320
I don't know if we're able to take from
the live stream. Yes we are. No. Okay. No,

33
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:56,750
that's fine. But if anybody
in the room has any questions,

34
00:01:56,751 --> 00:02:00,580
feel free so I won't hog up
all the time. Cool. So Suzanne,

35
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,860
we're going to start off with,
tell us about the early days.

36
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:07,880
How did you guys first respond to
the idea of forming a family band?

37
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,890
And you were also all really,
really young.

38
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:12,800
So like what did your friends at school
thing that you remember that part of the

39
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:17,040
movie was like, I'll still play drums.
Yeah, I remember every part though.

40
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,360
You say that it's about you,
but yes,

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,930
you know, a lot of people I
get asset quite often. Um,

42
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,680
this kind of just happened
by chance. I mean, um,

43
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,730
my father had worked for Dow chemical
for over 13 years as gene was also,

44
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,590
you know, at one point he didn't want
that nine to five job anymore. So he,

45
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:41,591
him and a friend decided to open up a
Mexican restaurant and it was around in

46
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:44,750
the 80s.
Marlo,

47
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:48,050
some of Y'all might've been born around
in the 80 [inaudible] but it was run in

48
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:50,750
the 80s. And, um, long story short,

49
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,410
it was when the oil boom happened
and all that. Um, and we,

50
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:58,650
it was open for not even six months,
so we lost it at, around that time. Um,

51
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,970
[inaudible] my dad was teaching a
how to play the bass and then Selena,

52
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,430
of course,
he was the youngest and you know,

53
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:08,770
the young ones always fill
the need for attention.

54
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,080
So she just started humming something
and my father picked up on it and he was

55
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:18,280
like, wait a minute. Um, so
that's Kinda how it started.

56
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,060
It's a little bit of everything is
how it just kind of flowed into how we

57
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:26,330
actually started performing at different
parties and things like that. Um,

58
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,200
once Selena,
he realized it [inaudible] you know,

59
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,670
had the capability of holding the tune
at such an early age. Um, she was,

60
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,330
I think like around six,
um,

61
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,740
my cousin had been living with this
for my mother's side and he ended up,

62
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,630
he was supposed to play the drums and so
he ended up going back upstate to stay

63
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:51,070
with his father. And so lord behold
there was a pair of brand new jobs.

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,473
I'm the only kid that,

65
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,800
yeah, you're going to
play drums. I was like,

66
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,703
wait a minute,
girl.

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,010
And I really said that girls don't play
drums because at the time, you know,

68
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:05,650
the only female drummer that was
really well known when she was young,

69
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:09,990
she sure a lot of gum shield.
He is. Um, and you know,

70
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:13,090
she was the only one. And I remember
thinking, well, surely he plays dumb.

71
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,730
Who's the high? Like, you know
what I mean? So, um, that's how we,

72
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,490
I started playing in and then shortly
after that, after we started, you know,

73
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,730
performing as a family band,
um,

74
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,320
just like for a little
parties and things like that.

75
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:30,070
Whenever my dad would have friends
over or some of our friends over,

76
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,380
he'd asked for us to play and we
play like three or four songs.

77
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:33,790
It seemed forever for us.
Right.

78
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,360
And then the restaurant ended up closing
and we actually used to perform at the

79
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:45,970
restaurant, right? Yeah. Like on Fridays
and Saturdays. What was that like?

80
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,490
Uh, it was cool, but it wasn't

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,760
cool. And then you can see your people
that you go to school with. Right.

82
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,740
You're embarrassed

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,780
the thing. But it really was a
blessing in disguise because when,

84
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,870
when my father, when the
whole, we lost the restaurant,

85
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,060
we literally lost everything.
Like everything we, the house,

86
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,020
um, my parents really invested everything
into that house, into that restaurant.

87
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,480
So,
um,

88
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,170
the only thing that we
really knew was music.

89
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,760
And so we started playing little gigs
here and there and make three, four, $500,

90
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:27,110
and we'll woo. Um, and
next thing, you know, yeah,

91
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,420
we'll get to that farmer. Definitely.
Yeah. I'm about to ask you for that.

92
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:34,520
Don't worry. That's really how it started.
And it was just kind of like, yeah,

93
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,080
also a labor of love from all
of us, you know, um, we're,

94
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,470
we're struggling as a family and so what
other families do we come together and

95
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,870
do what we gotta do.
Right. That's not true.

96
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,840
Um,
so actually,

97
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:51,070
so we were talking about like how it is
incredible a thing to like come together

98
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:54,250
as a family and to produce this amazing
thing and just so happened that all of

99
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:57,380
you are super talented. So that's,
that's a definitely. Plus. Um,

100
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,320
but what were like the pros
and the cons of being in it,

101
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,470
because this idea of like being in a
band and maybe like you get your friends

102
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:04,400
together,
that's one thing.

103
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,160
But like being in a band with
your family I think is another.

104
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:10,820
So what would you say were like the pros
of that when we're also the kinds of

105
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:14,420
grass, so it Latino families. So
that's true. I wasn't gonna say it,

106
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,070
but you said it poorly feisty.

107
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,510
Yeah.
They're with budding heads and everything.

108
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:24,511
But I think one thing that really helped
keep us United is that my father and my

109
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:31,150
mother always treated each of us
equally. There is none of this like, oh,

110
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:35,350
Celine is in the front, you know, she gets
this, or I play drums. I do keep the beat

111
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,950
produces, you know? No, nobody had it.

112
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,140
Ego trip. And I think that that's one
of the things that really, uh, kept, uh,

113
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:47,740
the unity of our, our
family. And we also knew,

114
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,300
each one of us knew our role model.

115
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:52,330
And I kind of always like to explain the
kind of like a, I like a football team.

116
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,770
Quarterback knows what he's gotta do you
know the why you have the receiver and

117
00:06:56,771 --> 00:07:00,820
the coach. My Dad was a coach,
right? My Dad was our manager. Um,

118
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,300
we let him take care of that part and,

119
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,080
and we did our part and I think that
that's one of the reasons why our band was

120
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:09,490
very successful. Right, right.

121
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,910
Well, to keep the metaphor going, you
are probably the best team that's ever,

122
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:17,620
you know, is this it
in Martinique Imo. Um,

123
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,220
okay. So I'd be next is you talk
about, you know, the early beginnings,

124
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:24,160
but like what is the one moment,
if you,

125
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,580
if you remember a moment or like when do
you actually know that you guys made it?

126
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,680
Like this feeling of like, oh
my gosh, this is actually right.

127
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,000
Like, we, we did it, um, to be
honest with you, but a lot like,

128
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,570
I don't even think like the data,
even when my sister passed, you know,

129
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,460
you don't really realize what you're
doing when you, when you're doing it,

130
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,440
you know. Yeah. Clearly you see your, your
contracts are being sold out. You know,

131
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:48,670
you're like, oh yeah, even at,

132
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,450
even at to that point where we were at
in your career right before Selena passed

133
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,010
it was kind of like, oh my God, I
hope we have people. Right. You know,

134
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,670
and I hope people show up because you
know, as an artist you never really know.

135
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,310
You know, you do, you do your thing,

136
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,430
you serve it up basically and you people
like it, they like it. If they don't,

137
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:07,150
they don't.

138
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:12,150
So I mean I think like that one scene
in the movie where everybody freaks out

139
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,820
cause you hear your music
on the radio, you know, we
thought, oh my God, we hit it.

140
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,590
Yeah, music's playing on the radio. But

141
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,160
guess what,
it's not like that.

142
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,890
Just because your music is being played
on the radio doesn't mean that the

143
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:28,520
teaching is coming in. Right, right.
It's the fact that, you know, it takes,

144
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:32,060
it's a process and this process
took about four or five,

145
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:35,000
six years before we actually
started getting known.

146
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,560
So it's not a quick process. A lot of
artists think that it is and it's not.

147
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,270
We definitely did our time playing in
small little venues for like, I remember

148
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,790
we used to play for like we'd, you
know, we'd go for the door, you know,

149
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,510
percentage of the door or
whatever. And um, you know,

150
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:57,630
we've got like 25 would show up
and we buy. Okay, so we're not,

151
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,670
we're just going to pack up, right.
What are you gonna Leave? Right?

152
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:03,720
And then my dad's like, nope, what
do you mean? No? You're like, well,

153
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,920
you have to take this like it's
practice, but just go play. Right.

154
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,640
These 25 people, they're going to go,
they're going to have a great time.

155
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,030
They're going to turn around and
bring more people next time we come.

156
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,530
And that was literally the God
honest truth, how it happened, right?

157
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,620
Cause every time we would come back
to town, more people would come.

158
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,150
And then more people and more people.

159
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,460
And in regards to seeing
the actual success, I mean,

160
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,970
even now that she's been gone for 22
years, I'm still baffled at the fact that,

161
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,890
hey, I'm here at Google. Hmm. You know,

162
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,520
when we're fixing to release
something amazing. Yeah.

163
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,070
And she's still being talked
about. Right. Awesome.

164
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,510
Um, so kind of, I think
part of your story,

165
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:48,090
obviously there's so much amazing
like positivity to it. Um,

166
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,860
but there's also kind of like, uh, the,

167
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,940
the part about hardships that you guys
definitely faced a lot and I think that's

168
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:56,990
part of the power of your story is like
overcoming that. Um, so we know that,

169
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,261
you know,

170
00:09:57,261 --> 00:10:01,070
given the fact that you were
Mexican Americans in the
u s but then also that you

171
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:03,380
were,
this female led the Handel group,

172
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:07,580
which they kinda was like a male dominated
genre at the time. Yeah. It still is.

173
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:09,590
And you guys definitely did.
Baseau those things.

174
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:12,590
So what was it like when you
were in the thick of everything?

175
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,570
Like dealing with that
both because you know,

176
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,030
you're in a bicultural individual and this
and this, you know, in this country. Um,

177
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,330
but then also in, in this
genre that's like, so male
dominated. What was that like?

178
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,810
Um, definitely it was a very difficult
one because Celina was so young when we

179
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:29,800
started performing,

180
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:33,190
she started seeing when she was six and
a half and professionally when she was

181
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:37,150
like nine, nine and a
half. And so that made me,

182
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,420
we're about 14, we're four years
apart, so I'd maybe about 13,

183
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:45,070
14 and then my brother is four
years older than I am. And um,

184
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,690
you know, I guess we didn't,
when we first started,

185
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,140
we really didn't see it,
see it because we were so young.

186
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,800
And my father kind of shielded
us from that. And I grew up,

187
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,130
we grew up in Lake Jackson,
Texas, which was, you know,

188
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,340
I didn't know what a low rider
was until my ninth grade year.

189
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,600
So it was predominantly,
you know, Anglo people,

190
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,290
some black people,
but very,

191
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,180
not too much Hispanics going on.

192
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,990
So I really didn't understand a lot
of that until we started growing.

193
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,030
And then I could understand
more about, okay, uh,

194
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,040
this promoted doesn't think that we
can job because Salinas a girl, right.

195
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,470
Or work kids,
you know,

196
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,520
when we were kids back then got admit
that like the diamond should be a factor

197
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:37,720
because our music still
sounds good weather. You know,

198
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:40,720
it doesn't matter how old we
are or what, what, you know,

199
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,150
if Selena was a female or not.
Um,

200
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,770
I think my father dealt more with that
aspect of it and saw more and felt it

201
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,840
more.
But as we grew,

202
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:55,150
I will tell you that I
did fill it more and um,

203
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,141
you know,

204
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:59,860
and it's surprising to me that it's still
like that and we're 22 years later I

205
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,080
still see it and I still vibe it because,
you know,

206
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:04,390
I see what goes on in the
world. Right. You know,

207
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,200
and I see what goes on with other artists
and their difficulty and struggles and

208
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,920
definitely it is no matter what
people would like to say, you know,

209
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,930
it is this more of a struggle for a woman,

210
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:18,460
for female to make it in a male
dominated business than it is for,

211
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,080
for male. Right, right.

212
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,720
Well I will say that, um, you guys,

213
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,560
I think we can all agree
are like an inspiration for
a lot of those guys who are

214
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,510
dealing with that.
And no matter where you are,

215
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,680
I mean it applies to like
the music industry tick.

216
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,330
It applies to pretty much
every industry. Right. So, um,

217
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,480
I think that that's something that yeah,

218
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,640
that definitely a lot of people say
will tell you one thing that I think my

219
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:42,400
thought my father always told us,
you know,

220
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,280
cause we would get very discouraged
whenever promoters, you know,

221
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:49,720
didn't want to book us or have a set
of venue or things like that and,

222
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,020
or something didn't go right with
our record company or whatever.

223
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,360
My father always told us, you know,
oh, so you're just going to quit.

224
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,170
You just,

225
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,780
just like that you're going to quit
for everything you've worked hard for.

226
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,430
And he would just tell us all the time,
we need to just, um, you need to stand up,

227
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,900
brush off of your knees where
you fallen and try again. Right.

228
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,970
And that's always been our philosophy,
our philosophy fall off it.

229
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,020
Um, that's, that's
incredible words. Oh, well,

230
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,780
I mean going along those lines
of like male dominated, um,

231
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:31,060
kind of like worlds that females
definitely can hold their own in drawing.

232
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,620
You mentioned this earlier in the talk,

233
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,380
so droving professionally
is definitely still was,

234
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,620
it still isn't very male
dominated. Um, what was it like,

235
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,820
I mean you mentioned kind
of your first reaction to,

236
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,160
to it and when you were introduced to it,

237
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,830
but what was like throughout
your experience in the band?

238
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,330
Like what was your experience, um, in that
role? Um, especially also, like I said,

239
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,740
given that the condo music,
I mean,

240
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:54,130
just the fact that you were a girl drummer
and that kind of music was also like

241
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:57,580
a double whammy in a way. Um, did you
ever consider changing instruments?

242
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:00,610
Why or why not? So first kind of
what, how will the experience,

243
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,550
and then if you've ever thought like,
maybe I should do, first of all, no,

244
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,840
I cannot sing. I guess so much. I'd be
like, why don't you sing? I'm like, well,

245
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:12,250
there was a reason why.
Um, no, I mean, I grew up,

246
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,940
hello. You know, performing. I really
did. I, it grew on me. I initially,

247
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,440
I didn't like it.
You know,

248
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,080
you're talking about being put into a
position where you're like, wait a minute.

249
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:22,490
You know?
Um,

250
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,270
I loved it and I love the fact that
I was traveling with my family.

251
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,930
There's pros and cons to that. Yes,
we did argue, yes, there was that, ah,

252
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,460
you know, and certain things
that we've maybe disagreed with,

253
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,960
but at the end we always came together,
right.

254
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,840
No matter if you disagreed or agreed,
we always stuck to whatever, you know,

255
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,760
whatever the final say the United
States. It was whatever we did. Um,

256
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,133
I,

257
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,470
I really didn't find myself any different
to be honest with you. Performing as a,

258
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,250
you know, I'm the only really was the
only female, a drummer back then. Um,

259
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,380
genre of music.

260
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:03,850
And for those of you that don't
understand what the haunt of music, is it,

261
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,770
the magnitude of it,
the magnitude is about

262
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,470
the magnitude of Tahani
music and Latin music.

263
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,300
It's about that bit,
right? It is basically a,

264
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,173
um,

265
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,240
form of music that is performed in Texas
and only in Texas basically. Right.

266
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,020
Unless you are lived in Texas
and you moved to Chicago now.

267
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,943
So Chicago

268
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,660
really that big on a, on a spectrum of
this bed. I'm not in music. So you know,

269
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:38,310
I take pride in saying this, that we,
I'm having a genre of music, this bag,

270
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,870
we took that music and we
cross boundaries and it's not,

271
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,680
it's very difficult. And don't
ask me what the, how we did,

272
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,890
I don't know how we did
it, but it, we are music.

273
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,210
It didn't matter whether you're from
Puerto Rico or from whom are from me.

274
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:55,320
He pulled out matter what,

275
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,070
what nationality you were
our music appeal to everyone.

276
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,300
How I tell him,

277
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,560
I don't know. I think it was
a combination of clearly are

278
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,160
our music. We were, you know, were Mexican
or Mexican American, Mexican, like third,

279
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:13,100
fourth generation here.
I grew up on English music.

280
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:17,600
I didn't listen to Spanish music until
we actually started performing. Um,

281
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,730
it was a music that my father introduced
to us and we're like, oh, oh no, no,

282
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,550
no, that's not cool. That
is not like we were all in

283
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,450
against any, he's like,
no, this is your route.

284
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,600
You have to understand where this is
coming from, you know, blah, blah, blah.

285
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,690
And we grew to love it, you know? And um,

286
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,040
but you know,
it's just really,

287
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,030
I think it was a combination of the fact
that the fact that we were raised here

288
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,300
in the United States and we
listened to like men at work.

289
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:52,040
And then I was all about Janet Jackson
and Matana and you grabbed this,

290
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,110
what we listened to and then my brother,
you know,

291
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:58,970
fused what my father infused in us with,
with our culture.

292
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,850
And then that's how we created our sound.

293
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,040
And then adding the fact that
Selena was very soul foreign,

294
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,360
her singing and you can vibe that and
you can hear that when she's singing

295
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:08,780
Kumbaya,

296
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,520
you can really hear that soulful vibe
that comes from the music that we grew up

297
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:15,830
on.
So it kind of spills over.

298
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,190
Yeah.
Hybrid type of music that were created.

299
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,270
Definitely the right mix of everything.
So, um, I mean you talk about,

300
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:29,200
we talk about, um, you know, you created
your own thing, you, you, you know,

301
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,870
face a lot of obstacles and you
persevered. Um, specifically with Selena,

302
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,270
what do you feel like,
um, you know, you know,

303
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:39,840
obviously you're her sister and like
very close to her when you guys were kind

304
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,940
of out and doing it, like, was there,

305
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,360
was there something that you felt
like for her just like meant so much?

306
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:48,690
Like one obstacle that
she kind of, um, that she,

307
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:51,660
that thought through and
was like, wow, I like,

308
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,600
I'm really proud of myself for that.
Or like in my career,

309
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
that's an easy one.

310
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:59,220
That would be the English crossover that
she was working on before she passed.

311
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,910
I mean, that was something
that, um, you know,

312
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,160
if you're on this side of music
and mainstream is like a huge,

313
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,860
you know,
who doesn't want to go mainstream.

314
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,360
And so that was a thing that from the
get go, she wanted to be able to do,

315
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,210
we want it to be able to go
mainstream and to be able to,

316
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,100
to have a crossover album. And, um,

317
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,900
even though that that complete album
was completed because she was murdered,

318
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,440
you know, um, she's still
got to experience that.

319
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:34,080
And she cried when she found out that
she was actually, because it's, it's,

320
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:37,590
it's really a lengthy process
about picking up the correct song.

321
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,170
I remember they sent us
to La, um, uh, to shed,

322
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:45,840
had recorded an English song.
I can't think of the name of it right now,

323
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:48,030
but she recorded it and,
um,

324
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,570
they felt that her reading
technique wasn't correct. My do.

325
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:55,050
My sister's never had any type
of vocal lessons whatsoever.

326
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,310
So they felt that her breathing wasn't
right on the song. So they sent her to La.

327
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,070
I remember going with her.
I had a blast.

328
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,240
So we had a great time. Anyway, so

329
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,090
she went to go, um, with a
coach that did Michael Jackson,

330
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:13,720
all these famous singers.
She stayed with them a whole week.

331
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,990
He coached her. Um, she comes back,

332
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:21,040
she rerecorded the song and then the
executives heard it and they're like,

333
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,010
oh,
we like the original version better.

334
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,820
They ended up keeping it the way
that it was. It was, uh, oh my God,

335
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,340
I'll think about it and I'll
just blurt it in a minute,

336
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:32,940
but I don't remember
the name of it. But, um,

337
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,100
it's just a really lean out the process.

338
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:40,150
And I think that that was her main
goal was to be able to do the English

339
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:43,240
crossover. And when she actually was
finally able to do it and they said, yes,

340
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,920
we're doing it,
finally doing it.

341
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,210
Cause she'd been telling her fans for
like over what, three years it's coming,

342
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:50,940
it's coming. And then
it never did. And she,

343
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,510
she literally cried into
the wholesale bear hard,

344
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:58,780
which is well, who was the president
at the time of Emi records? He goes,

345
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,490
I promise my fans this. I
want this. I want it so bad.

346
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,150
And it ended up happening,
but unfortunately she didn't
get to finish doing it,

347
00:20:07,151 --> 00:20:09,030
but she got at least to do some of it.

348
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,000
That's awesome.
Um,

349
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,540
well talking a little bit
more specifically about
Selena before we kind of get

350
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,640
into her legacy,
like what,

351
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,020
what would you say was like your
favorite thing about [inaudible] or like

352
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,930
something that you
really, really feel? Yeah,

353
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,820
come on. Everything. I know if you were
to pick one, I know there's so many,

354
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:30,190
but like if you had to pick
one thing or rather like,

355
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,470
I can tell you the one
thing. Yeah, go ahead.

356
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,140
One thing. My sister, of course,

357
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,720
all of you all know she had
this beautiful hardy laugh,

358
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
but she was extremely goofy and very,

359
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,620
she was wanting to always laugh at her
own jokes that she would never say a joke

360
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,660
like all the way through.
Correct.

361
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,830
And then see what lot herself.
I like

362
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,040
everything to be the only one really
laughing after everybody stopped laughing.

363
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,630
Yeah.

364
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,850
And it was Kinda like,

365
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:58,851
I guess that was the practice who was
such a fun person to be around and so

366
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:03,870
easygoing and, and just laughed
really about everything in life.

367
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,990
Even when she was upset about something,
she would just kind of blow it off.

368
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:09,120
I'm like, ah. And she would
crack a joke about it.

369
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,920
So I definitely say probably that was the
thing that I'm did I miss most. Right.

370
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,450
That's awesome. Um, so moving on
to kind of like a little bit of,

371
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:22,220
of of Salinas legacy,
obviously it's very clear for fans,

372
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:26,180
like even people, even like people were
very, very young today that, you know,

373
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:28,600
obviously you weren't alive
when, whenever she was, um,

374
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,150
she's a beacon of hope and inspiration
for bi cultural people all over the world.

375
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,910
Um,
when I guess like,

376
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,710
did you really feel that when you guys
were in the thick of everything and did

377
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:40,490
it feel,

378
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,960
did you feel a sense of pressure and
like responsibility because of that? Of,

379
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,260
of like, oh, like we're actually
like, people look up to us, Pete,

380
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
we're like a source of inspiration
for people. Like we kind of,

381
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,430
we felt like that's like a weight on our
shoulders or did you just kind of feel

382
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:57,610
like love and it was like
kind of like this fun? Yes,

383
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,720
Julie felt all love.

384
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:03,010
There was never this like
we like for instance,

385
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:06,880
when we played at these nasty don't, like
there was like our main goal was like,

386
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,560
God,
I hope people show up.

387
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,820
And then we found out that it
was sold out. Like it was like,

388
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,070
why don't we sold it out?
Like it was never,

389
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,220
there was never this
like thinking about that.

390
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:21,760
It was more about like our short
term goals, you know what I mean?

391
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:26,761
And just kind of like taking it like
that and never really thinking about what

392
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,220
we were doing, why we
were doing it. Right.

393
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,230
So I know some people plan their
lives, okay, the time I'm this age,

394
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:38,290
I'm going to do this. And you know,
they have certain goals that they want.

395
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,790
Our goal was just like,
dude,

396
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:44,791
let's just survive and get money and
have a house and a car and eat and we're

397
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:47,940
good. You know what I
mean? That was our goal.

398
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:51,130
It wasn't to be able to be this rock just,
Oh my God,

399
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:54,850
this phenomenal group or anything like
that or I hope we're inspiring people.

400
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:59,720
It wasn't that mindset for us. It was more
like, all right, let's go play. Right. Um,

401
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,010
many popular artists today,
obviously I think, you know,

402
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:07,600
like think of Selena as an inspiration
to them and you see them, you know,

403
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:11,470
like sharing photos of her
and like wearing her on
their clothes and things like

404
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:14,890
that. So how does, what does that mean
to you and your family to see that?

405
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:17,710
Like what kind of goes through your head?
Do y'all see the Drake?

406
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,010
It's recently,

407
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,150
oh, Diplo wearing a sleeveless
shirt too, right? Uh, it's, it,

408
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,810
it warms my heart. I mean, you know,

409
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:32,340
it's pretty incredible and it's very far
in between like what is happening right

410
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:34,980
now with her legacy and what's going on.
I mean,

411
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,400
we're in a different phase now and
I mean, I've, I've always seen it.

412
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,540
I get asked like,
how do you feel about this and do you see,

413
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,530
and did you see this coming? I
was like, well, yeah. I mean,

414
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,770
I remember when my sister passed away,
one of my goals,

415
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,320
my father's balls was tall.
He made it very clear.

416
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:54,830
You've wanted to make sure that
nobody forgot about Selena and I,

417
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:58,550
and we work very hard
behind the scenes on,

418
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:02,840
and we're very selective of things that
we do. Associate Celine, his name too.

419
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,710
Um, uh, and there's a reason
for that. You know, I,

420
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,290
we've been offered to do so many
crazy things and we just say, no,

421
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:16,790
that's not what we want to do. Like, no,
there's a reason for it. I think also,

422
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,960
you know, just, just having
her presence, you know,

423
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:24,110
and people knowing about who she
was and what she represented,

424
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,370
not just as a person,
but as far culture.

425
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,570
She is definitely a role
model for us. Latinos. Um,

426
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,530
she inspires the youth. Um, she, um,

427
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:41,510
was very much about not doing drugs.
She was all about, you know, um,

428
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,350
speaking out about, um, she was, uh, I
don't know if a lot of people know this,

429
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,330
but she was a spokesperson
for battered women.

430
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,120
She was about giving back
to our community that way.

431
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:54,710
She was very loving and she wanted just
to like everybody to kind of like, um,

432
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,560
understand where she was
coming from as a person.

433
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:01,610
And I think that everybody gets
that that's, that's ever hurt her.

434
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:02,510
And then not only that,

435
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:06,560
but I think that how can you not be
captivated by her 22 years later?

436
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,830
You look at her now,
she's still looks very current.

437
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,540
Selena was so what you would consider
an artist that's timeless, you know?

438
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,080
Um, you know, her look was very simple,

439
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:22,040
but she can kind of like cool,
right? But not over the top.

440
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,880
Yeah. People still like coffee or, right.

441
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,780
Oh, like if even if you sit down and just
block all that out and just listened to

442
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:34,140
her vocals. Right. You know, if
you listened to her, her, her,

443
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,770
her voice captivates you.
If you just listened to it,

444
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:41,400
it just captivates you and you know,
then on top of that,

445
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,670
just add the fact that
she had this amazing body

446
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,340
and she had this amazing

447
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,300
personality to go along with it.
So she, I hope that, you know,

448
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,310
another 20 years we're
still talking about her.

449
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,150
Right. I'm sure that will be the
case. I will definitely do my part.

450
00:25:56,151 --> 00:26:00,110
She was definitely one of
the greats. I will say that.
And I can say that. I agree.

451
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:04,940
I agree. Um, so actually you just
started to mention this a little bit,

452
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,980
um,
among many other things.

453
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:11,690
So Lena was and is known for her style
and being a trendsetter. This is my note,

454
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:15,120
frankly, her performance
wardrobe, everything she
was fears and like on point.

455
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,960
But what was your style behind the scenes?

456
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:20,870
Was it different from like what
people would see and like what,

457
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:21,704
what did that entail?

458
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,390
Um,
tee shirt,

459
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,720
baggy jeans about her hair slicked
back in the load button and very,

460
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,340
very little bit of makeup.

461
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,850
She always wore makeup and just very
little and a little bit of lip gloss.

462
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:36,860
And that was her right?
Very stripped down.

463
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,250
Very like she used to also like to grab,
um,

464
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,730
Christmas shirts and she used
to just like, uh, like the,

465
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,950
the Umopar TV though video. Are y'all
familiar with her? She's wearing the red.

466
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:50,580
It's tight. That's Christmas shirt. She
had a big old suitcase full of stuff.

467
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:51,100
And what does she do?

468
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,933
Pull out?

469
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,690
So, um, the, there's also
another outfit she's wearing,

470
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:59,370
she's wearing all white and
it's one of Chris's starting.

471
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,800
She just like tied it and tucked it
under and just made it hers. Right.

472
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,660
Um, she was, um, when she
wasn't performing, um,

473
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:13,180
she was, you know, opening
up her boutiques and um,

474
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,960
she was actually working on her makeup
line. She was wanting to do a makeup line.

475
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:19,490
She was also looking into perfume.

476
00:27:19,491 --> 00:27:23,270
She already had picked off the toes
of a perfume that she wanted to do.

477
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,120
So, um, she also was
attending a business, uh,

478
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,140
university and here in La
via correspondence, um,

479
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,640
for business because she wanted to educate
herself more on the business side for

480
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:44,000
her business, her businesses. So she
was, I have her on tape actually, uh,

481
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,810
went on a thesis. Nobody's
ever heard it. Really? Yeah.

482
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:49,940
It kind of sounds crazy
because he's talking like

483
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,810
that's smart. Well, I actually didn't
know that. That's incredible. Like,

484
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:56,100
I mean obviously she was,

485
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,640
I mean in the time like an entrepreneur
for sure and had that mindset.

486
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:00,800
So that's really cool to have it.

487
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,280
That that was something that like behind
the scene she was really pursuing, um,

488
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,030
kind of on a more traditional level

489
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,430
that she wanted to be a mother.
She was, um, you know, are in,

490
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:13,190
Chris wanted to have children. She
wanted to have like an army, but

491
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,970
Chris is like, Whoa, calm down.

492
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,860
Um, and she loved, you know, of course
animals and she wanted to have, yeah,

493
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:21,130
she didn't want to have
a farm. Wow. Crazy.

494
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,030
The Sky's the limit. Right? Yeah. Um, so,

495
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,690
so we talk about how Selena was,
I mean,

496
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,350
you guys were just an
inspiration to people and a hero.

497
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,260
A lot of people consider her like
a hero heard their, their heroine.

498
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,920
But who was hers? Do you feel like,
did she ever talk about someone who,

499
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:40,610
she really just looked up to

500
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,820
that my father and my father
and my mother. Okay. I mean,

501
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:49,740
my father played a huge role in and
guiding us. He's still guides us.

502
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:55,110
I mean, he still manages us. You
manage is my brother. He's a force,

503
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,470
you know, that we've
always looked up to. Um,

504
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,730
my mother has been always also somebody
that my sister's always looked up to

505
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:08,400
you. I would definitely say those two
poop or, or, or the ones that I still,

506
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,470
if you ask me that question, my answer
is the same too. Right? Yeah. My parents.

507
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,120
Well, I, I, um, agree.
My mom is awesome line.

508
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:20,240
So say it's funny how
that works. Right? Um,

509
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,900
I think the last one before we kind of
go into the doodle and we can open up for

510
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:28,650
questions for people. Um, you talked, you
mentioned a lot about like the movie you,

511
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:30,260
you were like the
anecdotes from the movie.

512
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:35,090
So how was it working on that project?
How accurate was it?

513
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:37,610
Was it because that's also
something that I've always wondered.

514
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,040
And what was it like to see yourself
and your family portrayed by actors?

515
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,410
Um,
well when they've,

516
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,620
we first talked when they first kind of
crazy how the movie came about once she

517
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:53,350
passed away,
um,

518
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,270
our lawyers in la found our entertainment
lawyers that found out that, you know,

519
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:03,190
somebody, there's already
companies wanting to make a
movie and because we live,

520
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,890
you know, there's freedom
of speech, anybody can kind
of basically do everything,

521
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,930
um, without giving the consent of the
family. So that's the only reason.

522
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,050
That was one of the main reasons why
the movie came out two years after she

523
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,270
passed,
because we,

524
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,060
if anything was going to be done and
we wanted to make sure that it was done

525
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,260
correctly and it was done,
um,

526
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:27,430
the right way and portrayed Selena in
the right light and not any other life

527
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:30,840
just to sell movie
tickets. Right. And, um,

528
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,400
so the whole process was,
it's pretty insane. Like what,

529
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,130
you know, the whole process of trying
to pick a Selena, you know, that,

530
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,280
uh, they narrowed it down out of
like, I don't know how many girls,

531
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:49,810
like seventies on girls to like five.
And Jennifer Lopez was one of them.

532
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:52,660
And actually the lady, uh, the
girl who paid Constance Marie,

533
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,860
the one who played my mom, she actually
oxo audition for the saline apart.

534
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:03,160
And so, um, you know,
they narrowed it down.

535
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:08,030
And this one girl, she wasn't a
professional actress. And, um,

536
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,180
I, my, I wasn't on the sat,

537
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,470
but they all did tapings like a live
tapings have thing like filming.

538
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,210
And uh,
this girl looked like my sister so much,

539
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:23,950
it was crazy. They dressed her up and I
was like, whoa. But she could not act.

540
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,700
And after like the 30 [inaudible] take,
you could hear all the,

541
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,760
like my dad said that you could hear
like everybody working, you know,

542
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,530
I mean like,

543
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:38,530
cause that right there is an indication
making it [inaudible] he wouldn't be

544
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:39,640
good to make a movie.

545
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,180
So then Jennifer came in and they just
thought that they all agreed or the

546
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:47,000
directors, executives and
everybody agreed and you know,

547
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,320
alongside with our family that Jennifer
was a perfect park for, you know,

548
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:52,670
for Selena,
you know.

549
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,570
But the crazy thing was with what
surprised us is that a lot of the,

550
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,210
like once they announced that
Jennifer was going to do it,

551
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,050
there was a lot of backlash from Selena,
from the fans because they're like,

552
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:07,040
oh my God, how can a Puerto Rican portray
and Mexican, you know, blah, blah, blah,

553
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:11,510
that way war. That freaked
me out because, you know, um,

554
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,660
the same here, you know, like in my head
I'm like, it doesn't matter. She's Latina,

555
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,950
you know,

556
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,750
and that's the important thing in the
fact that she's physically looks like my

557
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:27,290
sisters. I mean like bodywise, um,

558
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,950
the fact that she has dance, um, you know,

559
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,930
Jennifer has dance background. I
mean, um, I thought it was perfect.

560
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:39,920
Like we were, we were super happy once
everybody come down. I, everybody was,

561
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:42,380
but the whole process,
Jennifer worked her butt off.

562
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:46,660
She stayed with me for about a
month at my house. Um, there are,

563
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:49,790
we'll share a story with y'all.
She totally freaked me out.

564
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,930
Came in like,
you know,

565
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:55,330
after a while you do when you're
hanging out at somebody's house,

566
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:59,340
like you get comfortable or she
came downstairs and we were getting,

567
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,251
we were in the kitchen,

568
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,680
we were going to eat and we're
preparing food or whatever,

569
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:06,010
and then she comes and I have a
sectional and my sister would,

570
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,290
Jennifer came in and she sat right in
the middle where my sister would sit and

571
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:14,980
she brought her feet
up and she grabbed the,

572
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:18,070
I have like a little rap thing, you
know, like when you get cold, you know,

573
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:21,630
I don't know what to call her
throat. And she covered herself. Um,

574
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,900
never forget this. I looked at my
husband and he looked at me and I'm like,

575
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,520
my sister would do the same exact thing.
Wow.

576
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,230
Yeah. Take me out. And then

577
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,660
that, and we're cooking. And
I'm like, do you think she's

578
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,003
right?

579
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,570
It's like, do you think, but
how would she know? You know,

580
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,750
mean like something like that. It was
so cool to work with Constance addy.

581
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:52,340
Almost all of them. It's a lot of work to
do and moving. I just want to tell. No,

582
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,880
I think the, um, the sets of the house,
you know, where I'm cutting prices,

583
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,200
hair and all that, that was all
they, they created that they went in,

584
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:03,260
they took pictures of our house
and they read, we constructed it.

585
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:06,530
And the scene in the movie
with the bus where, you know,

586
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,750
I'm pissed off because of
the Dorito situation. Yeah.

587
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,673
Right.

588
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,200
Pretty interesting because they, they
created a bus and it wasn't really a bus.

589
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:20,201
It was like in a of studio area and have
like big old air tire things that to

590
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:24,290
give it that movement, it was
like on a bus. It was super cool.

591
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,880
Little things like that just, it was
really cool and it was very difficult to,

592
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,130
um, there was some times that I, you know,
clearly I wasn't there every day. Um,

593
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,100
it was also very difficult,
uh,

594
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,260
especially the scene where, um, you know,

595
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,910
the hospital scene at the end, I
completely, I showed up all like, hey,

596
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:48,830
and then they told me what he
knows. Like, okay, bye guys.

597
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:53,700
And I laughed and I just heard that it
just, everybody was in tears. You know,

598
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:58,000
and um, Jennifer and Jochin
the whole, the whole,

599
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,153
um,

600
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,730
the whole crew and everybody just said
that it was probably the most difficult

601
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:08,840
thing that they've ever had to do,
you know, because it felt so real.

602
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,190
But it will share on a good note,

603
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:15,191
we'll end this section on Jennifer when
she came out of the trailer with the

604
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,070
white dress where they're recreating
the scene where Celina won the grammy.

605
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,013
I ain't gonna lie.

606
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,790
That was probably the only
time that I truly freaked out.

607
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,330
Like I got chills all over my
body cause when she stepped out,

608
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,130
she's kind of scooted her little dress
down and she looked up and for a split

609
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:38,550
second I thought it was my sister, like
I like, and she goes, what do you think?

610
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:42,150
And I was like, Oh wow,
you look amazing. Like,

611
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,130
and then we were just kind of sit back
and I just stepped back with my father

612
00:35:45,131 --> 00:35:47,580
and go, we were just
like freaking out. Right.

613
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,300
Well, it sounds like, uh, you said
it was a lot of work, but I know if,

614
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,040
if anyone out there, I've seen it
many, many times. It's a family game.

615
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,890
It's a family thing. Um, and I will
definitely see it one more time. Um,

616
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,590
and so it definitely, you can tell that
it was a labor of love than it does.

617
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,360
And I love that it's there because it's
something that not only for people who

618
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:10,580
loved her,
but it's just like a great way.

619
00:36:10,581 --> 00:36:13,430
I'm so glad you guys had a hand in it
so you could tell the story the way you

620
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:14,264
wanted to tell it.

621
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,090
And it's just a great way for a lot of
people to learn about her story and I

622
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:17,800
think that it helps,

623
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,710
so it keeps losing his memory alive.
That's how a lot of,

624
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:25,711
I feel like a lot of millennials can
identify or understand who she was because

625
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,000
the movie's always on there.
Like they hear the music,

626
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:30,070
they start seeing what's
going on. Right. You know?

627
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:30,790
Right.

628
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,710
Well that's a perfect segue into another
thing that I will do a similar thing.

629
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,460
The Google doodle that we'll be
launching next week on October 17.

630
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,720
My last final question before I open it
up for people is kind of what kind of

631
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:50,130
went through your head, whatever, cause
I full disclosure gave Susan a call,

632
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:51,820
it was like, hey, we want to do this.

633
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,290
What's kind of the first thing they can
went through your mind and really Google

634
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,230
yes. There also like, yeah, you're like
to the community. Like this is great.

635
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,600
Um, but yeah, so like
kind of what was your,

636
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:09,250
what was your thought when
we first approached you and
how has the process been

637
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,720
free?
Um,

638
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,780
I was pleasantly surprised that
I got a call from me that a lot.

639
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,900
Um, I initially, you know that when
you and I started talking on the phone,

640
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:23,340
I instantly found this
connection with you. Um,

641
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,380
I could hear the passion that you had on
presenting what you guys want it to do

642
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,710
and it's all, it's been that
from day one, you know, um,

643
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,680
there is definitely passionate in this
creation that you guys are fixing to see.

644
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,780
Um, sat down with [inaudible].
I got to meet you and Kevin, um,

645
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,920
talked about details of certain
things and what your idea was.

646
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:46,930
And we kind of Torque it here and there.

647
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,470
And I think that the Google
wraps up Selena completely,

648
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:53,950
even though it's very short, it,
you know, in the sense of, you know,

649
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,020
it doesn't total, it's not like a
whole hour long curly, but it's,

650
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,680
it's perfect because

651
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,950
it sends a huge message that, you know,
you can do anything you really want.

652
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:10,951
Selena started when she was really young
and she became this amazing artist and,

653
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,630
and she's still being remembered.
And you know,

654
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,830
I will end up with this Salinas favorite
saying is the impossible is always

655
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:21,310
possible. And it is. And
I think that this Google,

656
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,740
there's that form of that totally in that,

657
00:38:23,741 --> 00:38:27,850
because it shows the passion that
you guys put into it and, and,

658
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,270
and the whole creativity of,
of having her young

659
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,730
shine the story throughout to is.
Yeah. And we hope that everyone,

660
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,241
like I said,

661
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:41,260
both fans and people who don't know about
Selena will be able to learn about it.

662
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:46,510
Um, and along with it we're also
going to be, um, uh, launching, sorry,

663
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:50,050
at launching a digital exhibit of select
items from this. And I'm Louisiana.

664
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:51,400
So that's another collaboration,

665
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:54,790
amazing collaboration we have with the
Convenia family and we're excited for

666
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:58,220
people to see a lot of the
things there. Um, a lot of gray,

667
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,890
a lot of great iconic items.

668
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,980
Yes, definitely. I think the hardest
thing for me is, uh, you know,

669
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,930
you already know Latinos are
like really hard to keep secrets.

670
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,610
Come on.
They

671
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,570
were like,
why are you going to San Francisco?

672
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,493
Oh my,

673
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:19,760
what are you doing? I'm like,
I'll tell you later on the 17th,

674
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,100
because I'll give you a call. Um, cool.
Well we're going to open up for questions.

675
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,940
Hi. Thank you for being here. Um, yeah,

676
00:39:28,941 --> 00:39:32,480
I was just wondering if there were any
things that you do for your sister just

677
00:39:32,481 --> 00:39:36,020
to honor her memory that are personal
to you, that you're open to sharing.

678
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,010
I think when you lose someone,
like having, you know,
these special things are,

679
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,360
it really makes a big difference,

680
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:46,050
um, as a family. Um, from the get go,

681
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:49,920
from the first anniversary of
her that we have are passing,

682
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,580
we kinda just don't get together.

683
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:58,350
We don't make it a, an event. Clearly
it's a day that she lost her life.

684
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,750
Um, we just kinda like call
each other, Hey, hi. Hey,

685
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,640
just checking on you. Say any fear.
Okay. That's basically all we do. Um,

686
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,200
in regards to me, you know,
remembering her or anything like that.

687
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:16,620
I don't do anything special
like that. It's, um,

688
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,860
I just keep her here and in here and I'm
good and I just try to keep her always,

689
00:40:23,581 --> 00:40:24,780
and even when I'm shopping,

690
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:27,840
it's crazy cause I'll be shopping and I'll
be with my mother and when we're like,

691
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,930
oh my God, that Selena like, oh my God,
she would totally buy this, you know,

692
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:35,550
stuff like that. So I keep her alive
like that and little things, you know,

693
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:39,210
throughout my day. This right here
is a total labor of love. This is,

694
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,560
this is one of the things
that brings me great joy. Um,

695
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,910
coming here and speaking about her
to you guys, it means a lot to me.

696
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,400
Um, you know, I,

697
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,000
I do this because I love her because I
know if the shoe was on the other foot

698
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:58,260
and I wasn't here, I know for a fact
that she would be here doing this for me,

699
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:03,420
you know, and, and so it's definitely
only real love. So, and that, and that.

700
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,990
Then going back to your answer, no,
I don't do anything in particular.

701
00:41:06,991 --> 00:41:09,100
And then none of us do,
not even Chris,

702
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:12,030
we just kind of check on each other
and make sure we're good. And some,

703
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,230
it's crazy because some,

704
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,460
it has been 22 years and some
last year was really bad.

705
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:22,920
Some, you know, you just want to stay
in bed and crier but off, you know.

706
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:27,150
And then other days, I mean,
some years you just want to like,

707
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,150
you're okay and you want
to talk about or you just,

708
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,970
you don't have no problem and
then you want to blast the music.

709
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,380
There's some days that I don't even
want to hear our music cause it hurts.

710
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,800
It's just, um, I remember when I,

711
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,570
when she passed away some, this older man
of my, a friend of my father's told me,

712
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:49,510
you know, time with time, time
will heal your heart. And it,

713
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,060
I found out it doesn't heal
your heart, your, your, your,

714
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,310
there is a void there in your
heart that will be there for ever.

715
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,670
You can never feel that.
What time does,

716
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:02,960
it helps you deal with what's been put
in front of you and you have a choice to

717
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:06,620
either move forward or just stay where
you're at and you don't do any good and

718
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:09,440
staying where you're at. I learned
that because I went, you know,

719
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,730
I took about two and a half years
before I figured out me again.

720
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,990
That's how long it took me to
figure out who I was again. So,

721
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,780
but you do a lot I think.
I think the things that you do,

722
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:23,600
I mean just having gone and spent some
time with you guys in Corpus Christi,

723
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:26,850
which was like a really
awesome thing for me to do. Um,

724
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,980
just seeing like the museum and you know,
how,

725
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:33,050
how you treat the people who come there
that really want to learn about Selena

726
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,650
and cherish her memory is just
really awesome. I think like,

727
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,240
and just watching you guys do,
you know,

728
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:42,200
the day to day and all the calls and
like answering questions and all of those

729
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:45,590
things. I think all of those, all
the, you know, in your day to day,

730
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:49,790
I see you guys honoring her and making
sure that people who love her and people

731
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:53,150
who want to learn about her do
that. And I think that, um, yeah,

732
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,260
in that way it's like,

733
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:57,510
it's really awesome thing that I was able
to see in person can just go up. Yeah.

734
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:58,750
Okay.

735
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,110
So I had, oh, I had a quick
question from the back.

736
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,500
Um, so I mean, I think so working
with Prolo and this doodle and,

737
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:11,420
and the team has been amazing and getting
to meet you today is just fantastic.

738
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,790
Um,
but I think what surprised me is like,

739
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,490
I always knew that Selena was so popular,

740
00:43:16,491 --> 00:43:20,410
but seeing how devoted her
fan basis through the, uh,

741
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,830
basically throughout this
project, um, like do,

742
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,780
like what is the fan
interaction like with you now?

743
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:30,140
Do you still get a lot of artwork
or things that people are, you know,

744
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:34,250
sharing with you and your family?
What does that like? It's awesome.

745
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,290
Pretty creative people.
Well,

746
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,010
send some pretty amazing
paintings on Selena.

747
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,520
I love interacting with
those Salinas fans. Um,

748
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,230
I like to hear stories
about, you know, um,

749
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,970
what Selena means to them, how she
inspires them, how they live up to her.

750
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,220
Um, I love hearing that. I mean it's,
it's amazing and it's a good feeling.

751
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:02,360
It definitely leaves that good feeling.
And you know, going back to like,

752
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:05,000
when you lose someone,
you know, people die.

753
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,270
People lose their loved ones all the time.

754
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,440
And I'm super blessed.
I tried to look at life like that.

755
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:16,460
I'm super blessed having to be
able to like hear my sister's boys.

756
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,520
I'm able to see her on youtube.
I mean,

757
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,750
I'm able to hear stories about how she
inspires people and that's part of the

758
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:28,160
legacy that is part of her legacy.
And I feel that,

759
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,203
you know,

760
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:34,240
I'm doing my part to help that along with
her fans because clearly we cannot do

761
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:38,510
this without her fans.
So I feel blessed. Cool.

762
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,210
Cool. Hey, thanks for coming. Thank
you for, I have two questions.

763
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,780
One is on behalf of my sisters,
they wanted to know what,

764
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,600
what was Salinas favorite shoe designer?

765
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,733
MMM,

766
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,893
I know.
I,

767
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,140
I don't think she had any, Selena
was one to just really shop anywhere.

768
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,100
Um,

769
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,720
she wasn't always like
about designer stuff.

770
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,900
Uh, she literally just,
if she found something,

771
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,710
I remember one time we were shopping and
this lady goes, oh, I like your dress.

772
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:15,830
She goes, thank you. I gotta at Kmart
Asleep. I was like, I knew she got it.

773
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,673
It came up by that.

774
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,540
My sister loves shopping. If it was
cool and she liked it, she bought it.

775
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,930
So she wasn't really in

776
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:31,250
the designer designer things back then.
Um, my knew she liked the good stuff, but

777
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:35,240
you know what girl doesn't cause she
didn't have any favorite favorite. Okay.

778
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,610
She wore a lot of boots
too when she performed.

779
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:40,040
So she would always look out for boots.
Perfect.

780
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:43,340
I'll tell him to keep it simple.

781
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,470
Oh, in the movie, uh, Edward James
Olmos so I think he's a fantastic actor.

782
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:53,630
Played your father as sort of a
very dominant machismo, a role.

783
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,290
I think Latinos across the country can
resonate that whether it's the mother or

784
00:45:57,291 --> 00:46:00,530
the father. Yes. How was that
dynamic in a band group though,

785
00:46:00,531 --> 00:46:01,670
when you know that that's your father,

786
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:05,030
but also your manager and how much
pushback did the kids give to make sure

787
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,140
things got done at the end of the day?

788
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,370
Um, at the beginning. I mean,
clearly, yes. Is that, first of all,

789
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,550
pretty much all,

790
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,720
all Latino's understanding
what you just said because yes,

791
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:20,220
there's that male machismo and that's
just the way our culture is. Um,

792
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:25,290
at the beginning, I think that's what
helped us, um, because it was pretty much,

793
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,400
hey, we're going to do this this way.
And as we started getting growing,

794
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,150
we started having more say about what and,

795
00:46:33,151 --> 00:46:37,860
and actually that's how my brother
started producing our music because I'm a,

796
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:42,240
was complaining about, um,
complaining to my father that,

797
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,060
that the music that they
were sending us was,

798
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,540
and there were treating a be kind of like,
Eh, you know, kid, get away. You know,

799
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,170
other producers that were in our John or
music, they were like, ah, you know, um,

800
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,460
and Abe with getting really
frustrated. So my dad said, well,

801
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,390
you don't like it then do it yourself.
You know?

802
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:03,600
And that's how he became a producer.
That was him.

803
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:07,380
What I'm trying to say is that machismo
part of my father and that strip part of

804
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:11,610
him pushing us and pushing us
and pushing us. And one thing,

805
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:12,630
I think that was,
uh,

806
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,770
it didn't bother us because clearly
you were raised in that environment.

807
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:19,410
So I was like, okay, it's dad
being dad. Right. You know?

808
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,230
But now in hindsight,

809
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,490
I look back and I think what a blessing
because if he wouldn't have pushed us

810
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:30,880
and push us and, and never let us
like stop doing what we're doing,

811
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:35,350
then this wouldn't have
been, you know, and you know,

812
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:39,640
and it's so it's a blessing. And
um, yes was their arguments. Yeah,

813
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,620
there was arguments but we pretty much
were okay with things the way that there

814
00:47:43,621 --> 00:47:48,400
were being handled, you know, um, eh, but
a little complaints but nothing on a like,

815
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,380
Kaboom type of thing, you
know, like a situation. We
pretty much were in agreement.

816
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,350
We're always like, okay, if you
feel that that's what we need to do.

817
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,630
Perfect example. Um, uh, when
we got signed to Capitol Emi,

818
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,330
which was our first major
album, which is what, uh,

819
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,590
the date of the doodle is
actually the front of the day,

820
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,740
the first September 17th, that is,
the doodle day is going to come out.

821
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,360
It's actually,
um,

822
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,770
celebrating our first album
release with capital Emr,

823
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,070
which is our record company.
That was our first big record company.

824
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,270
And when we were going to sign with emi,
we,

825
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:29,610
Sony was also interested in us and Sony
was offering us way more money to sign

826
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,770
versus emi. But my father
told my, my father was like,

827
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:38,710
no I don't. I don't think that's a good
idea. I think we need to stay with him.

828
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,990
W let's go with emi.

829
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:44,440
Were all through like going all
doing way more money and he's like,

830
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:48,190
it's not about the money.
It's the fact that emi doesn't,

831
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,280
this is a new thing for them,
a new venture and to Tahana music,

832
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,480
they don't have any artists right now.
It's like,

833
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,730
so that means that they're going to give
full force and whatever they do to make

834
00:48:57,731 --> 00:48:59,380
sure that whoever is signed with them,

835
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,270
they're going to back them
and make sure that they,

836
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:02,740
they go where they need to go.

837
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,940
So it was more of a business decision
that we took and so we allowed,

838
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:09,160
we stepped back and we said,
all right, we'll check,

839
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,550
we'll let you do your thing and thank
goodness because it was probably the best

840
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:16,150
decision that we could have ever made.
Thank you. And your teachers are fresh.

841
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:19,643
Awesome.

842
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,770
Hi Susan. Hi, my name is Cynthia. It's
nice to meet you. Hi, first of all,

843
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:28,070
I just wanted to say I live in Salinas
and anytime anybody ever asked me who my

844
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:31,210
favorite artists of all time, it's,
I always say Selena, thank you.

845
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,370
And of course my question is,
uh,

846
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,380
what is your favorite Selena Song?

847
00:49:36,381 --> 00:49:39,260
And do you know which one was
Salinas favorite to perform?

848
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,050
Good question. She used to love for, for
me it was still good. God, I don't know.

849
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:48,580
Still the God cover tunes. Um,

850
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,283
I don't know.

851
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,820
She used to her favorite
English or or whatever.

852
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,340
I don't know about performing
at the top of my head.

853
00:49:57,341 --> 00:50:00,220
I really can't say as regards
of what her favorite was,

854
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,750
but her favorite song was a
bike stream more than words.

855
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,720
That was her all time favorite to the
point where we would tell him to shut up

856
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:11,080
in the bus.
She would sing it over and over and over.

857
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:13,960
We tell it to go to the back of the bus
because she would shut up about that

858
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:18,400
stupid song. Right. Um, my
off time frame it is, um,

859
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,630
uh, you'll flee out gay, uh, or, uh,

860
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:27,930
a lot of it on the chat as a normally get
mosque clearly a bit more than I'm 10.

861
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:32,510
I was like [inaudible] he has, you
know, stuff like that now to me,

862
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:36,080
all of them are amazing.
I never listened to our music back then,

863
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:37,670
but I tell you what,
when I lost her,

864
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,560
that's all I listen to and I actually
carry our music in my car because I didn't

865
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:46,250
do that before. Like, people would be
like, Hey, give me when you see these.

866
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,070
I'm like, you're kidding.
I don't have mine.

867
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,780
You know what? A cassette tape. I'm sorry.

868
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,970
So, um, I don't know. That's a good
question. I don't know what Celine,

869
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,660
his favorite song was. Hmm. That's
good. Thanks. Yeah, I think the one,

870
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,800
what is the one that she used to
like tell him the guy off his,

871
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:07,340
he really got into it kicking
a, yes, that's a good one.

872
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,500
Remember when she's like singing
it to the guy? She gets down,

873
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:13,030
it's grabbed it like she called somebody
out from the audience. There's video.

874
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:14,690
Very should call somebody
out and she went to,

875
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,380
she invites a guy and when she tells him
you're going to be my boyfriend and the

876
00:51:18,381 --> 00:51:19,214
guy gets don't have.

877
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,590
Yeah.

878
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,423
Huh.

879
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,670
Hi. Hey, thanks for coming.
Um, so obviously you spoke a
little bit about it and uh,

880
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,110
how,
uh,

881
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:37,460
this was like a family endeavor getting
into the band and doing this together,

882
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:42,461
but I was just wondering like what
were your own personal like musical

883
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:46,130
inspirations back then in also
like what are you listening to now?

884
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:47,643
MMM,

885
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:52,620
back then I really,
you know,

886
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:54,600
back then it was all about Joe Jackson

887
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:01,150
and Madonna men at work, you know, uh,

888
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,220
pretty much what every other kid who
was into in like the what the 80s.

889
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:10,090
Oh my God. It sound cool. But yeah,
and in regards to now, I mean,

890
00:52:10,091 --> 00:52:13,660
I pretty much listened to like everything
that's in the radio, Bruno Mars. I like,

891
00:52:13,661 --> 00:52:17,540
I'll let you know. I like
drag. I like, you know, um,

892
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,470
Charles Scott. I mean, I listen
to a little bit of everything.

893
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,520
One thing I didn't listen to back then,
which I was like, Eh, was country music,

894
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:27,470
which is weird cause I'm from Texas.
But um,

895
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,870
I really didn't listen to country music,

896
00:52:28,871 --> 00:52:32,260
but I find myself gravitating more toward,

897
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:36,760
towards it now as I'm a little older, but
I listened to everything. You name it,

898
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,170
I'll listen to it. I have no set
preference in regards to like,

899
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:45,910
you know, the whole music
musician aspect of it. Um,

900
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,170
you know,
I think growing up and being

901
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:50,743
mmm

902
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,400
self taught because I learned how to play
the drums from my dad with his weird,

903
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:03,170
I guess he does not a drummer and also
like a friend of mine that was a drummer

904
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,680
in our cut my cousin as well.
Just getting the basics down.

905
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:11,210
I never learned how to play, uh, as
a musician. Are you a musician? Yeah.

906
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,930
Are you dumber? Okay. Well Jennifer
is, they have to play with their wrist.

907
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:18,200
I tended to play,
I taught myself because I was self taught.

908
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,290
I play more with my forearm
than I do with my wrist.

909
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:26,190
So my roles are no as fast as
what they should be. Um, but,

910
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:31,470
um, one thing I do say that, am I a
fancy drummer? No, but I tell you what,

911
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:32,304
I am a solid.
Yeah,

912
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:37,750
that's what I've been told me. I can
keep a beat. And that's one thing

913
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,010
that's really cool about our
music too was that we never,

914
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:45,150
like there was never a fight with
one of my brother produced our music.

915
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:46,560
There was like,
you know,

916
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:50,280
sometimes you get a like a whole bunch
of musicians together and everybody wants

917
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:53,580
to take the lead and Glam
boolean and all that stuff.

918
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:58,320
We kept it pretty much simple and clean
and I think that that also is another

919
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:03,000
reason why our music still resonates
22 years later with a lot of people.

920
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,150
It's the drummer.

921
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:12,130
Cool. I think we have maybe even Tracy
at one more time for one more question.

922
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:16,883
No.

923
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:23,510
Hi. Um, thank you for being
here. I just want to share too,

924
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,960
building on what perilous said,
but I remember seeing, um,

925
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:31,820
I was really little when Selena passed
away. I was, I think I was like 10. Um,

926
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,780
and I had heard a music,

927
00:54:32,781 --> 00:54:36,230
but I didn't really understand your
story until I saw the movie and I was in

928
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:41,231
junior high and it was like the first
time I saw a Latino woman in such like a

929
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:45,770
leading role. And it was really
just incredible for me to see,

930
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,780
um,
my culture,

931
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,480
my mother's culture being represented
in such a positive way and,

932
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:56,330
and like a stage that you know, that
the world sees and he just, it just,

933
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,390
you know, it's stuck with
me forever to this day. Um,

934
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:04,010
so I thank you guys for like wanting to
make sure that the world continued to

935
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:08,090
know her story. Even people who weren't,
you know, obviously there at the time,

936
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:11,720
it's like being able to have shared
that and continuing to share it today.

937
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:16,250
It's just, it's just so incredible for
the entire, um, the entire world really.

938
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:20,990
Okay. But my question
for you is, um, you know,

939
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,520
what is exciting you musically these
days or what, do you have any, uh,

940
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:29,300
personal, uh, music plans as the drummer,

941
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:34,190
a yourself that is on the horizon or,
or that you could share?

942
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:39,020
Well, uh, first of all, thank you for your
words. I almost cry right now. Seriously.

943
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,780
They're very hard phone.
I appreciate that. Um,

944
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:48,190
I don't have any plans right
now. I, I stepped out of that.

945
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:52,660
I didn't, when Selena passed away, like
I said, I took me about two and a half,

946
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:56,200
three years to find myself again. And, um,

947
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:01,150
I didn't find the need to play
anymore to be honest with you. Um,

948
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:05,680
my brother continued with his band,
you know, going to be kings. Um,

949
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,040
he created a band that's
been very successful. Um,

950
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:14,070
but I just didn't find myself being
okay with playing with anyone.

951
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:19,900
Um,
I didn't want to start my own band.

952
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:23,800
I didn't feel like, I don't know, I
just, it was just didn't feel right.

953
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,760
And then I just kind of
gravitated into, um, you know,

954
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:31,030
we have a production company that
protects, our production company,

955
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,770
has three recording studios
and we have like we do,

956
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:38,910
we have our editing department and
we have a graphic designer now,

957
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:43,570
so we do layouts for cds and DVDs
for other bands and things like that.

958
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:49,590
So I just kind of found myself helping
my father and just so many people calling

959
00:56:50,171 --> 00:56:51,320
and doing things and I don't know,

960
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:53,500
it just kinda like felt
right just to be there.

961
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,800
And so now I am CEO and president of our
company and I wear a lot of different

962
00:56:59,531 --> 00:57:04,320
hats and um, well I ever
play again. I played, um,

963
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,230
we have a yearly festival and Corpus
Christi called Fiesta though a flawed and

964
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:09,400
our city.
Um,

965
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:13,810
I got up and I jammed with my brother and
Jackie Cruz from the orange is the new

966
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:17,860
black. She was down visiting for that.
We had our seeing like get there.

967
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,630
And it was, and it wasn't planned.
Literally my brother's like, hey,

968
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:26,870
you want to play with me tomorrow? And
I'm like, what? And I haven't played. Um,

969
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,770
I was so freaking nervous.
You have no idea.

970
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,290
Like it was insane.

971
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,520
It was probably the coolest insane.
I felt panicky.

972
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:41,500
I didn't remember the count of our song.
Like I had a couple of drinks

973
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:43,780
[inaudible]

974
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:49,400
but it was crazy because as soon as I,
soon as that second or third became in,

975
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,020
it was like riding a bike.
It was like, oh, I got it.

976
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,700
[inaudible]

977
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,940
oh Lord. And um, I don't
know. I don't know what,

978
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,670
what the future holds. I don't know.
Like we'll ever play again. I don't know.

979
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:09,860
I'm one of those and I'm very spontaneous
and not like if I feel like it may be

980
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:13,880
when I get a little older.
Yeah. Maybe. Why not? I mean,
not that I'm, I'm very old,

981
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:17,720
but one thing that I will say that was
really cool about that night was that, um,

982
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:20,870
I have a son,
he's 19 and he got to see me plex.

983
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:21,803
How cool am I?

984
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:28,680
Right. So, um, I dunno.
Maybe, maybe one day. Cool.

985
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,360
Well, thank you, Tracy.
Tricky question. Um,

986
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:36,420
and thank you guys again for coming and
thank you to Suzette and your family.

987
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:42,070
Thinking, I mean, this was like
a dream project for me. And,

988
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,550
um,

989
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:47,550
obviously like just a super meaningful
for a lot of people at Google and on

990
00:58:47,981 --> 00:58:49,060
October 17,

991
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,450
hopefully it will be extremely
meaningful to a lot of people out in the

992
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,830
world as well. I love it. I
love it. I love it. This is
just, this is just another,

993
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:00,930
um, another thing that just elevates
Celine and just kind of helps us.

994
00:59:00,931 --> 00:59:03,450
So thank you so much and
thank you to Google for,

995
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:08,020
for coming to our family and wanting
to do this to honor her and, and uh,

996
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:11,160
I think that her fans, you guys are
going to make so many people happy.

997
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,060
It's going to go crazy. I'll just, yeah,

998
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:16,370
I know. I'm so ready to break
the Internet. I just want to do,

999
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,270
I didn't just want to tell somebody
right now that'll, that'll come soon,
