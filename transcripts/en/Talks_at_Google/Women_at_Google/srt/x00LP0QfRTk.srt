1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,120
Thanks Aaron. Thanks for giving up
lunch or whatever you're giving.

2
00:00:07,121 --> 00:00:09,640
You have to be here.
Um,

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,880
I am just going to start by
introducing you to this fellow. Um,

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,630
the book is sort of arranged,
uh, with 13 species,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,420
um, as, as their sort of focal point and,
and, and this guy's at the end. So I,

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,100
I'm giving away the end of the
book, but, but it's not really,

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,810
it doesn't really have a surprise ending,
so I think I can do that. Um, so he's a,

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,070
he's an a Hawaiian cro
or an all a law and,

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,070
um, there used to be several
species of Hawaiian crows. Um,

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,210
so they're sort of like,
uh,

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,230
which probably diverge from like the
crows you see around New York, um,

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,640
probably several hundred thousand
years ago. So it's a, it's a case, um,

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,830
a bit like Darwin's finches where,
you know,

14
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:56,940
a very small founder population
arrived on the Hawaiian archipelago.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,540
We don't know how, cause why he's really
quite, quite distant from the mainland,

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,900
uh, thousands of miles. Um,

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,530
and then the speciated radiated out so
that they could occupy the different

18
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:10,890
islands and fill different
ecological niches.

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,170
But the difference is that actually most
of the species of Hawaiian crows, uh,

20
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:20,580
went extinct before modern times.
And this one is also under very,

21
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,950
very heavy threat.
And in the 80s,

22
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:27,270
the state of why realize that there
only, you know, very few left.

23
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,270
They took them into captivity, uh,
to try to breed them. Oh, thanks. No,

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,640
I'm good. Thanks. Thanks
a lot. Um, and this, uh,

25
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,340
particular bird is a bird as a male
bird by the name of, of Kenobi.

26
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,510
Uh, and he was born at this breeding
center, which is actually on Maui.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,310
Uh, the bird is native
to the big island, but,

28
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,950
but this breeding centers on Maui
and he's a very odd duck. Uh,

29
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:57,810
as they say, he, he doesn't really think
of himself as a CHRO. Uh, he seems to,

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,620
we're not sure what he self
identifies as a, the woman who,

31
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,880
one woman who takes care of him,
uh,

32
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,110
told me that he wants a fell
in love with this spoon bill.

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,420
So He's, he, um,

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,820
will refuse to meet with any of the
females, uh, at the Mallee facility there.

35
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,550
There's maybe 50 females, a hundred
birds all together. Uh, and he, uh,

36
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,860
refused to meet with any of them,
but his genes genes are really important.

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,480
So they took him to this, uh, to the
veterinary hospital at the San Diego Zoo.

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,510
And there he came under the care of very,

39
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:35,130
very experienced a reproductive
physiologist whose was really,

40
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:39,300
who's really eager to
get, um, you know, a vile,

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,350
let's just put it this way,

42
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:44,120
of his genetic material to
take back to Maui with her. Uh,

43
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,970
so every spring when it's
breeding season on Maui,

44
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:52,971
she takes Kenobi on her lap
and strokes him in a way that,

45
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,600
you know, male crows are supposed
to find very, very exciting, uh,

46
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:01,690
hoping that he's going to deliver
so that she can take a vial,

47
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,180
a of his jacket back to Maui. But
at the time I visited, he had,

48
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,550
he had not yet delivered.
Uh, so she was still added.

49
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,810
And crozer are really
smart, as you know, uh,

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,640
and Kenobi can imitate human speech.
And he says, I know that's his,

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,840
that's his phrase, which is really quite
extraordinary. And, and when I thought,

52
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,380
when I heard that it sounds kind of
demented, he has this demented sound,

53
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,670
but it seemed to really encapsulate
a lot of the themes of the book.

54
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,560
On the one hand, uh, you know,

55
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:36,880
the incredible lengths that people
are going to try to save this species.

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,980
Meanwhile though,
all of the forces that that brought,

57
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,900
the Hawaiian crows to this point are
all still raging and in fact are being

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,670
increased because Hawaii,
there's now avian malaria in Hawaii.

59
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:52,930
There didn't used to be mosquitoes.

60
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:56,710
Now there are mosquitoes with avian
malaria and as the climate warms, uh,

61
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,910
these mosquitoes are moving
up the mountain slopes.

62
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:03,520
So there used to be sort of refuges for
some of the native birds on the tops of

63
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,720
Hawaii's very tall mountains,
uh,

64
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,600
and avian malaria is now
moving up the mountain.

65
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:11,650
So birds on Hawaii or are really,
really in trouble.

66
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,970
So he is sort of the emblem
in a way for the whole book.

67
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,560
Um, and, and he's the animal
that I end it with. So I,

68
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:26,561
I guess I was sort of step back and say,

69
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:29,770
what is the book, what it,
what is the sixth extinction?

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,470
The implication here obviously
is that there are five other, uh,

71
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,200
extinction events and that is true,
um,

72
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,320
with these are what are
called the big five,

73
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,560
the major mass extinctions of
the last half billion years.

74
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,360
And what you're looking at is time is
running from your left to your right in

75
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:52,510
millions of years.
So 600 million years ago to today.

76
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,640
And where you see those dips, where you're
seeing the number of marine families,

77
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,610
this is from the marine fossil record
and you're seeing the number of marine

78
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:05,140
families on the y axis.
And if you remember from intro bio,

79
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:09,400
a family is the level right above
a genus or species, Gina's family.

80
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,060
And if even one species made it
through this extinction event,

81
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,900
then the species is considered a survivor.
So on the species level,

82
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,370
the losses were much, much greater
than they are even on the family level.

83
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,870
And Mass extinctions are just
defined as moments in time, uh,

84
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,600
when the diversity of life suddenly
and very radically contracts.

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,060
One British paleontologists,
Michael Benton,

86
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,990
who my quote in the book uses the
metaphor of the tree of life. Uh,

87
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,020
during a mass extinctions he's written
vast swaths of the tree are cut short as

88
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,600
if attacked by a crazed
ax wielding madman.

89
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,300
So the first number one,

90
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,590
number one there that's occurred about
440 million years ago at the end of the

91
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:57,890
Ordovician period, uh, when most
of life was still in, in the sea.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,230
So that was very devastating
to marine organisms,

93
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:05,000
but not to terrestrial organisms
because there just were no terrestrial

94
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,360
organisms. And number five,
a that's the most famous,

95
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:10,610
most popular if you were well,

96
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,990
and that is the extinction event that
didn't the dinosaurs and a lot of other

97
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,560
groups, um, at the end
of the Cretaceous period.

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,210
And there's a pretty broad scientific
consensus that that was caused by an

99
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:26,720
asteroid impact.
I don't have a photo I can show you,

100
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:30,770
but this is someone's best
guess of what that looked like.

101
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,100
So to say we're in the, in the
middle or in the, on the verge,

102
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,400
some people would say we're on the verge.

103
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,190
Some people once they were
already pre pretty deep into, uh,

104
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,000
the sixth extinction is
obviously a pretty serious claim.

105
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,120
And this claim
arises from the fact that we are,

106
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,260
are changing the world a very
radically in very, very fast.

107
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:58,250
So not unlike a, you know, an
asteroid impact. Uh, and in fact,

108
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,990
I have heard scientists say that
right now. We, we are the asteroid.

109
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,940
Um, so, so how, how are we doing
this? Um, there are a lot of ways,

110
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,160
um, I'm just gonna touch on a couple
today. Uh, we're changing the atmosphere.

111
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,200
You all know this. It's really a
simple stuff. We drive our cars.

112
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,370
Uh,

113
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,370
we light our homes and all of this we're
doing with fossil fuels right now and

114
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:27,920
there's 7.2 billion of us on the planet.
So it adds up pretty quickly.

115
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,970
And what we're doing when we are burning
fossil fuels is we're taking carbon

116
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,960
that's been buried,
you know,

117
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,740
underground over hundreds of millions
of years and we're shooting it back into

118
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:40,760
the atmosphere a very, very quickly in
a matter of centuries, quite possibly.

119
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,290
So we're basically running geological
history backward, uh, and at very,

120
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,560
very high speed. Um, and if so,

121
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,870
if you were an alien and
you came to Earth, um,

122
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,700
you could actually easily conclude,
you know,

123
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,760
that what we're doing
that the whole point of,

124
00:07:55,761 --> 00:08:00,230
of modern industrialized
societies actually to affect
this transfer as quickly

125
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,120
as possible to see,
you know,

126
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:06,170
how much carbon we can get out of the
ground and how fast we can throw it back

127
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:10,880
up into the air. Uh, and if the
aliens, we're measuring this process,

128
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,820
they'd say we're actually doing a
pretty good, we're doing as, as, as,

129
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,710
as well as we possibly can. Uh, we're
increasing CRP levels every year. This is,

130
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,890
these are obviously our measurements
of this process. I know,

131
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,900
I'm sure you're all
familiar with this graph.

132
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,830
This is the keeling curve measuring
CO2 concentrations in the air,

133
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,770
once again from Hawaii,
from the weather,

134
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,670
National Weather Services
Observatory on Moana Law.

135
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,420
And,
and that a Jig jags pattern,

136
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:42,890
that seesaw pattern you see
that's at seasonal signal
because when the trees and,

137
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,710
and uh, plants of the
northern hemisphere, you know,

138
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:50,150
put up their leaves for photosynthesis
and the summer global CEO two levels fall.

139
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,390
Uh, and when they drop their leaves in the
winter, then they rise again. Uh, so, uh,

140
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,980
quite a recent reading,
396, uh, parts per million,

141
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:02,280
you may reasonably have read that steer
two levels hit 400 parts per million.

142
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,940
They did very briefly last
at the end of last winter.

143
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,300
They're going to again on now,
uh, you know, this winter, uh,

144
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,480
and then they're going to
keep rising in that seesaw.

145
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,910
I sort of way until they never go below
400 parts per million because obviously,

146
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,420
you know, we show, so no, no
signs of ceasing to emit CO2.

147
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,760
Um, and if we want to see how
we're doing on a longer term way,

148
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,010
then we can look back at ice cores.

149
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,450
Probably many of you have seen this
graph to a, what you're looking at here.

150
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,920
Once again, we have parts per million
of steer chew on the y axis time, uh,

151
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,060
on the x axis running once
again from left to right.

152
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:45,840
So from 800,000 years ago to the present,

153
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,730
you're looking at actual bubbles of past
atmospheres that were extracted from an

154
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:55,080
ice core, taken on an art, Dukkha and
all that. The Antarctic ice sheet is,

155
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,350
is just layers of snow that
were laid down year after year.

156
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:03,351
So we can actually see over time what
happened to the atmosphere and those Jig

157
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,180
Jags, cyclists that you see, those
are ice ages. Okay? So when see,

158
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:11,850
O two levels are low, ice creeps down
all the way to the island of Manhattan,

159
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,950
he knew,
which was glaciated in the last ice age.

160
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,060
And then it creeps back
up again into the Arctic.

161
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,450
And you're looking at a
glacial cycles there. I,

162
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,720
you see where people emerged
around 200,000 years ago.

163
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,560
And you can see that's your two levels
were never above 300 parts per million

164
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,400
over the last 800,000 years.
Uh, until very, very recently.

165
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,260
And now we're going up at what looks on
a scale like this to be a vertical line.

166
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,620
And if we want to go even further back,
uh,

167
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,410
we can tease out the composition of paths,

168
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,600
atmospheres by looking at
things like the shells,

169
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,290
a little tiny marine creatures
that fell to the bottom of the sea.

170
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,910
And those have big error bars.
Uh,

171
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,040
but it seems pretty clear that to get
c are two levels that are significantly

172
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,450
higher than today's.
Uh,

173
00:10:57,451 --> 00:11:02,240
you have to go back to around the
Miocene around 20 million years ago. Uh,

174
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,220
and at the rate we're going, we could
reach those levels, uh, you know,

175
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:10,200
by the middle of this century. And if we
keep on going, uh, we could reach levels,

176
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:15,201
probably not seen it since the Eocene
around 50 million years ago by the end of

177
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,570
this century. So obviously, you know,

178
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:21,780
what's significant about
this is on the one hand,

179
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,500
sear too is just a greenhouse gas.
I'm not going to bore you, you know,

180
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,540
where the global warming Spiel,
cause you all know it,

181
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,730
but I am going to just share you this
little video, uh, that NASA has made. Um,

182
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,410
it's just a recreation of
global temperatures over the
last hundred and 30 years

183
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:38,244
or so.

184
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,200
And where you need to know to understand
it is that as the colors get warmer,

185
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:46,350
so more orangy and more yellow,
uh, the world is warming.

186
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:49,740
That signifies warmer temperatures there.
Here we go.

187
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,580
That stops in 2011 but,
but uh,

188
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,240
hopefully they'll still
updated soon because it's a
very sort of powerful visual

189
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:27,380
representation. Um, and so what
does that mean? I mean for,

190
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,700
for living things,
for the creatures on this planet,

191
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,050
you know, the, the polar bear has
sort of become the icon of, of,

192
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:40,100
of species that are endangered by
climate change because the CIS are,

193
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:43,370
Dick Series is disappearing
very, very fast. Um,

194
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,130
and without minimizing the problems that
the polar bears are facing. Um, what are,

195
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:52,730
what I write about in the book actually
is that it's actually likely that

196
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:56,220
climate change is going to have a much
more, even more profound effect, uh,

197
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,300
in the tropics. And, and there
are a couple reasons for this,

198
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:03,830
one of which is just that the topics
are aware, most things actually live.

199
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,950
Um, so this, in this slide you're
looking down from about 12,000 feet. Uh,

200
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:14,270
we're in the Andes in Peru. Uh,
you're looking down that ridge. Um,

201
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,870
and I went there with a scientist
from, from wake forest, uh,

202
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,410
who had laid out these tree plots.
Um,

203
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,700
and each plot was about
two and a half acres.

204
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,600
It was exactly two and a half acres.
Uh,

205
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,160
and there were about 20 of them arrayed
down this ridge so that each one had a

206
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:34,790
different elevation and each one had a
different average annual temperature.

207
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,570
And he had,
they have tagged a measured,

208
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,620
tagged and id the species of
every tree in these plots. Okay.

209
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,220
And so they had come up within
this two and a half acre,

210
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:49,400
22 and a half acre plots,
roughly 50 acres, uh,

211
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,610
over a thousand species of trees.
Okay.

212
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:56,180
So in the entire Canadian boreal forest,

213
00:13:56,181 --> 00:14:00,950
which stretches over a billion acres, uh,
there are only about 20 species of tree.

214
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,630
So here we see,
you know,

215
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:07,631
in 50 acres and in an area roughly the
size of I think like Fort Tryon Park,

216
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,960
uh, we're seeing a thousand
different species is that
just shows you, uh, the, the,

217
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:16,340
the tropics, uh, are where things
actually were. Most species are,

218
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,080
that pattern is repeated over
most groups of organisms. Um,

219
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,580
and one of the characteristics of
tropical species turns out to be that they

220
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:30,290
have very narrow climatic ranges. So one
of the things this guy said to me was,

221
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,390
you know, we're going
down this ridge. He said,

222
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,370
you're going to see like a leaf on the
path when an interesting shape focus on

223
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:41,750
that shape. Watch as we go down the path,
you're only gonna see that leaf, uh,

224
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:45,320
for maybe a hundred meters or so, because
that's the whole range of the tree.

225
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,870
That's, that's the, this is
the only place where it lives.

226
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,800
And what they were looking at was as
the Andes warm and the is a warming,

227
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,520
you know, very quickly, what are
those cheese doing? You know,

228
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,200
they can't move obviously,

229
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,130
but they can see themselves at
higher and higher elevations. Uh,

230
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:05,030
and that's what's happening.
You do see a lot of species on the move,

231
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,720
but you also see a lot of species that
are not on the move that are just sitting

232
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,400
there.
So as the climate changes,

233
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,060
these communities are going
to clearly breakdown and,

234
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,010
and new ones will presumably form.

235
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,640
And the question of what will happen
to all of the organisms that depend,

236
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,780
you know,
on what's there.

237
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:24,920
Now all of the birds and all the insects
and all the mammals a is an open one.

238
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,400
It's very hard, you know, obviously
to track, uh, insects, they don't, uh,

239
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,860
they don't respond well to these having
these little tags and nailed it to them.

240
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,590
Um, but as, as, as this scientist mile,

241
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:39,500
someone pointed out to me
where we're going to find out,

242
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,800
we're in the process of finding out, we
are running this experiment. You know,

243
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,280
we can only run it once a,

244
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,660
but we're running it and we're going
to find out the answers to that.

245
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,850
So how else are we changing the world?
Well,

246
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,680
another very big effect of
carbon dioxide emissions, uh,

247
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:01,570
is the phenomenon knows
ocean acidification. Um,

248
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,820
I suspect everyone in this room is
pretty familiar with how that works,

249
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:08,390
but I'll just give you the basics.
Um,

250
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,070
and that is that the oceans have
absorbed about a third of this year too.

251
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,080
We put up so far that comes to
about 150 billion metric tons.

252
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,220
Every hour the oceans absorb
another million metric tons of CSU.

253
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,140
And the net result is of the acidity
of the oceans has increased by 30%.

254
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,490
So when CO2 dissolves in water,
you know, it forms an acid.

255
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:36,320
It's just basic. Pretty basic
chemistry, uh, is a weak acid. You know,

256
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,580
you drink it when you drink a coke,

257
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:42,050
but it's an acid and we are
changing the Ph of the oceans very,

258
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,330
very rapidly. And what the effects
of that are going to be, you know,

259
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,400
are also not that easy to anticipate.
Uh,

260
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,980
obviously marine creatures only interact
with their outside world through the

261
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,890
water. But one thing that
seems pretty clear as it,

262
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,840
it's going to impact anything that has
to build a shell or an external skeleton

263
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,240
out of the mineral calcium carbonate.
Uh,

264
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,930
it really affects sort of the
energetics of, of, of doing that.

265
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,180
And lots of things do that.

266
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,950
These are tiny little marine calcify
or is called Kaka Litho fours. This is,

267
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,920
you're seeing them under
high magnification here. Uh,

268
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,750
common shellfish like clams
or classifiers, sea urchins,

269
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,330
starfish,
coral reefs.

270
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,270
So lots and lots of marine organisms
need depend on the process of

271
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,980
calcification.
And one of the places,

272
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:41,650
a couple of chapters in the book focus
on marine organisms and how they will be

273
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:44,320
affected. A lot of people
trying to figure out, you know,

274
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,510
what the effects of ocean acidification
are going to be. And this is a really, um,

275
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,530
interesting sort of natural
experiment that I visited.

276
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,360
Now you're underwater here.
Um,

277
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,850
we're in the Bay of Naples in this area
where there's a lot of volcanic activity,

278
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:03,190
not, not too far actually
from Mt. Vesuvius, uh,

279
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,240
and it happens that there's CO2 bubbling
out of the bottom of the sea there,

280
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,870
uh, and, and sort of naturally
acidifying the water.

281
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:16,590
So I went out with a British marine
scientist named Jason Hall is Spencer,

282
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:21,591
who had gotten this idea that if we
looked at what happens near these volcanic

283
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:26,110
vents, we sort of have a window
into the future of the oceans. Uh,

284
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,480
and what you're looking at here,

285
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,920
I went with a national geographic
photographer and he took this wonderful

286
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:35,430
picture. And when you're looking at here
is we're, we're away from the events.

287
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:39,210
We're in a pretty ordinary Mediterranean
community. You see, you know,

288
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:42,870
there's a sea urchin there,
there's all sorts of this stiff seaweed,

289
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,260
which is also calcify. There's
calcifying seaweed, um,

290
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,590
that pink smear of pink you see
there, that's a tiny little, uh,

291
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,960
al algae that, that also calcifies. Um,

292
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,240
so you're seeing lots of lots of
different, different creatures.

293
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:59,980
They're different species there.
Uh,

294
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,510
and now we're moving near the events
you see this year to bubbling out of the

295
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:07,650
water. Uh, and you see what it looks
like. That sort of lunar landscape.

296
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,880
So this is when we get,
you know,

297
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,990
pretty close to the events and inbetween
he looked at every sort of possible Ph

298
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,170
between these two and came to the
conclusion that at the Ph that oceans are

299
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:25,590
likely to reach all of the
oceans, uh, by around 2100.

300
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:29,880
If we continue to Mitzi or
two at our current rate,

301
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,660
that about a third of the
species in the Mediterranean,

302
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,860
a dropout at that Ph, uh, they
just can't keep up with it.

303
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,830
So another way we're changing the planet,

304
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,740
and this is just the last one
I'm going to touch on today is a,

305
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:48,000
by moving species around the world,
um, everyone's familiar with this, uh,

306
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:52,290
with the problem of invasive
species. Um, oh, sorry. This is,

307
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,740
this is I, I skipped over this.
Coral reefs are huge concern.

308
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:58,240
Coral reefs are cows of fires.
Um,

309
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,110
this is just a quote from some
British marine scientists, uh,

310
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,300
that it's likely that reefs will be the
first major ecosystem in the modern era

311
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:10,710
to become ecologically extinct because
Carl's turn out to be pretty sensitive.

312
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,700
Many, many species at least a
to these changes in ocean Ph.

313
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,620
So back to our invaders.
This is an Asian carp.

314
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,670
He's been much in the news is Asian carp
is actually several different species.

315
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,180
Uh, they're incredibly voracious.
They're filter feeders.

316
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:31,300
They just eat through everything in
the water column, have a terrible lead,

317
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:33,240
devastating effect on native fish.

318
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,310
There's just a study that came out from
the army corps of engineers about what

319
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:41,400
it would take to keep Asian carp,
which are headed toward the Great Lakes.

320
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,830
What would it take to keep
them out of the Great Lakes?

321
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,500
And the Army Corps of engineers
put a price tag of $18 billion, uh,

322
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,000
on that one. Um, these are zebra mussels.

323
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,610
I don't know if people read
the story in yesterday's Times.

324
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,650
Are there invaders from Eastern Europe?

325
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,430
There are also variations for Aegis
feeders. Have done incredible damage.

326
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,370
Do commercial damage, stick
to everything, you know,

327
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:06,490
that they come in contact
with, uh, and really,

328
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:10,220
really have devastated native
mollusk populations. Um,

329
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,030
and there was a piece yesterday
about a scientist who had tried to,

330
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:16,990
it was trying to find a biological agent,

331
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:21,280
like a bacteria in this case of bacteria
or that could potentially fight a zebra

332
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:25,060
mussels. So we all have, you know,

333
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,410
if you have a backyard,

334
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,870
you doubtless have plants in
it that are not native species.

335
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,350
Some people have pets that
are not needed species,

336
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:36,880
but most of our non native species these
days are being moved around a sort of

337
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:41,440
unconsciously, uh, and inadvertently.
And it's been estimated, for example,

338
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:46,441
that 10,000 species are being
moved every day around the world,

339
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,920
just in ballast water.

340
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,840
And this is another way that we're sort
of running geological Lee geological

341
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:55,600
history backward and at a very high speed.

342
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,550
So what you're looking at here is,
um,

343
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,660
the configuration of the continents
about 250 million years ago when they all

344
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,190
crashed together and formed
one supercontinent, which
has become known as Pangea.

345
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,030
And then they drifted apart. I mean
to t plate tectonics, you know,

346
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,190
and we got the world as we have it today.

347
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,030
So all of these things have
been evolving separately, right?

348
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,450
The species in South America and Africa
and India and Australia, you know,

349
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:25,390
have been evolving separately
for tens of millions of years.

350
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:27,370
And when we bring them all together,

351
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,330
it has the effect of crashing this
continence, uh, back together again.

352
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:35,380
And you'll hear this phrase, you sometimes
hear this phrase that biologists use,

353
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,900
that we are creating the new pangea.

354
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,190
And oftentimes this has no particular
result when you bring species together

355
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:49,360
that had been long separated, uh, and
sometimes it has sort of, uh, uh, uh, not,

356
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,610
not benign result, but no, you
know, not very dramatic result.

357
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:53,740
They just sort of coexist.

358
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:57,580
But every once in a while you
get really disastrous results.

359
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,770
And when you think about it, if, if,

360
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,100
if you're moving at least 10,000
species around the world every day, uh,

361
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,530
you don't need a very high proportion
of those interactions to be disastrous

362
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:11,290
before you have quite a big problem.

363
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,700
So this is actually the,
the species that are begin the book with.

364
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:18,640
So we've worked our way sort of
from the end, the beginning. Uh,

365
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:22,840
it's a Panamanian golden frog. It's a
very beautiful animal. As you can see.

366
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,080
Uh, it was considered a
lucky symbol and Panama,

367
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,840
he used to be printed on lottery tickets,

368
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,870
which is rather ironic because the
golden frog and really all frogs,

369
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,790
uh, in Panama started
disappearing in the 1990s.

370
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,760
And scientists eventually figure it out.
I mean,

371
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:46,880
this is sometimes called the amphibian
crisis and it truly is a crisis. Uh,

372
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:51,320
and scientists figured out that they
were being killed by a fungal disease,

373
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,100
uh,

374
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,100
that had probably almost certainly
been ferried around the world on frogs,

375
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,390
by people moving animals around the world.
And one when theory,

376
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:04,460
which has not been proved.
Uh,

377
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,550
the one theory is that it
was moved around the world.

378
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,720
I'm on these things on these
frogs called African clawed frogs,

379
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:17,170
which were used as early pregnancy tests
because if you inject a female African

380
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:20,360
clawed frog with the urine
of a woman who's pregnant,

381
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,640
she will lay eggs within a couple hours.

382
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:27,620
So obstetricians actually used to have
tanks of these frogs in their office and,

383
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,990
um,
a lot of them were let go.

384
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:33,830
You now have naturalized populations of
African clawed frogs around the world.

385
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,240
Uh,

386
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,240
so one theory is that the fungus moved
on on African clawed frogs and anyway,

387
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:43,880
it was moving through Panama and it was
this interesting moment where people

388
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:45,200
could actually watch it move.

389
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:49,120
They actually could see
the frog's disappearing and
they, they realized or they,

390
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,810
they hypothesize that it was moving east.
Uh, sort of along this, you know, the,

391
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:56,020
the way that the river's move.
Um,

392
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,170
and they decided to try to
get a population, uh, of,

393
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,950
of these particularly beautiful
frogs and also some other species,

394
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:08,900
native to central Panama out of the
frame forest and into, you know,

395
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:12,800
some kind of protected facility. And
they didn't have any place to put them.

396
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,090
They went out and got the frogs,

397
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:18,200
but they didn't have any place to put them
initially. And so initially the frogs,

398
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:21,450
literally a had to be put up at a hotel.
Um,

399
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,350
then they built this facility.

400
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:27,560
This is the El vie amphibian
conservation center. Are,

401
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:31,430
you might be able to see some
little golden frogs in those tanks.

402
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:35,450
And this is one of the few places
that the golden frogs exist anymore,

403
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,780
and they're now extinct in the wild,
like the [inaudible].

404
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,820
There's some in zoos and there's
some at this conservation center.

405
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,490
So this is, I'm going to, I'm
going to sort of wrap up, um,

406
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,950
at the beginning of the book,
um, you could in some ways say,

407
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:59,500
you know, that this is a heartening
story. Uh, like the LLR. Um,

408
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,390
it shows that people really are,
you know,

409
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,140
concerned about other species to use
the words of Rachel Carson that there,

410
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,220
that they care about what Rick Carson
called the problem of sharing our earth

411
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,210
with other creatures. And in the
course of, of reporting the book,

412
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:16,340
I did spend a lot of time,
you know,

413
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,800
with people who are really devoted
their lives to this problem. Um,

414
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,090
a lot of them are scientists,
you know,

415
00:26:23,091 --> 00:26:27,650
like the woman who was trying to
get Cannoli, uh, to, to deliver.

416
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,060
Um, but a lot of them are also, we're
also ordinary people for ample at,

417
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,900
at the El Vi, uh, Amphibian
Conservation Center.

418
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:39,710
I met volunteers who had
come down from the states.

419
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,450
They'd paid their own way,
you know,

420
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:45,690
they were using their vacation days to
help out because they wanted to help out.

421
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,760
Um, and obviously even people you
know who are not directly involved in,

422
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:55,350
in conservation give a lot of money to
groups like the World Wildlife Fund and

423
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:59,310
the National Wildlife Federation,
Defenders of wildlife. You know,

424
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:02,340
the list goes on and on. And I'd, I'd,

425
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:06,990
I'd like to sort of be able to end on that
upbeat note. You know, that if we just,

426
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:12,000
if more of us just got involved in
efforts like this, then, you know,

427
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:15,180
that would be, that would
be sufficient. But, um,

428
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,950
I'm going to be frank with you and say
that's not really where I come out in the

429
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:23,190
book. Um, you know, one of the
central points of the books,

430
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:28,170
really nice central point of the
book is that our involvement,

431
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:31,320
our carrying is not really the issue.
Uh,

432
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,440
what's really the issue or the many ways
in which we are changing the planet.

433
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,620
Um, and this is what makes
us, you know, comparable, uh,

434
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:44,280
in our impacts to an asteroid.
Uh, and unfortunately,

435
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,970
unless and until, you know, we
really confronted that fact,

436
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:52,620
the magnitude of the impacts that we're
having. And then I'm afraid, you know,

437
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:57,480
we're not really, uh, fessing up
to the problem, so thanks a lot.

438
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,150
Okay.
No,

439
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,170
Hey, uh, you showed a graph
earlier was an animation.

440
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,650
We showed the dividend parts of the
world becoming warm and cold and warm and

441
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:20,030
cold. And I ended with like the not
part of the globe being very warm.

442
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,210
Was that relative temperature?
Yes.

443
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,040
That is, um, off of, uh, uh, a median.

444
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,780
Did they choose some year? I can't
remember exactly the year, but yes,

445
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:35,610
everything is, is temperature
deviation from this, from this medium.

446
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,353
Okay.

447
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:49,960
So you, you talked about,
um, uh, fossil fuel use it,

448
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,830
that's usually the biggest shoe, but
there's also a lot happening in, uh,

449
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,870
in the world moving away from
fossil fuels. Um, so first of all,

450
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:03,710
are there any other, you know, we do a lot
of other stuff besides burned fuel. Um,

451
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,710
so are there other version a lot
of fuel, um, but is that, you know,

452
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,510
does that sort of a hopeful thing that we
are, are starting to use more, you know,

453
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:13,344
green energy?

454
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:19,660
It's a hopeful thing, but, you know, in
terms of actual numbers, you know, uh,

455
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,480
you know, we, we can go back to,

456
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:24,843
uh,

457
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,910
we're using more of more renewable energy.
We were also using more fossil fuels.

458
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:33,300
I mean, you know, if you just
look at admissions trends are,

459
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:37,040
they're not leveling out worldwide.
They have leveled out in the stairs. Uh,

460
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,550
but worldwide they're actually tracking.
I'm very high end of 'em.

461
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,710
There are these scenarios which people
may or may not be familiar with.

462
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:49,030
The intergovernmental panel on climate
change had these scenarios like, okay,

463
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:52,930
this is what the future's gonna look like.
Here's low and low emissions future.

464
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:55,810
Here's a medium emissions future,
here's a high, and there's the future.

465
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,340
We are tracking the high emissions
future. Okay. Uh, so you know,

466
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:04,420
until that graph, you
know, levels off, uh,

467
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,370
it on some level,

468
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,250
I don't want to say it doesn't
matter if we're using more renewable,

469
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:11,350
obviously it does, it's
taking away from, you know,

470
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,940
what that trend line would look like.
A, but until we turn that around,

471
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,920
uh, you know, we haven't really

472
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,440
gotten a handle on this problem.
Um,

473
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:26,080
so I do think it's very
hopeful. Obviously, look,

474
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:31,081
if we could convert our economy
to not running on fossil fuels,

475
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,860
uh, that would be huge. That
would be making an impact
or that really would be, but

476
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,850
I don't see signs that were, we're really
on that kind of an actual, you know,

477
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:47,200
transformative course
yet. How's that? And I, I,

478
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:51,010
I'm not alone, you know, it's like not
my pessimism. I don't think anyone,

479
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,960
I see signs of that at this point.

480
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,580
Okay.

481
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,990
I know,
I know this wasn't a short talk.

482
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:57,730
You've talked a lot
about the carbon cycle,

483
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,600
but do you also talk in the book about
nitrogen and some of the things that

484
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:02,560
agriculture is doing?

485
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,890
I do not get into the nitrogen cycle,
but I could have, I mean, you know,

486
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:10,700
one of their kind of interesting things,

487
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,310
if you want to call it interesting,
I didn't know what the right adjective is.

488
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:16,940
I could have chosen different ways in
which we're changing the world on a

489
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:21,770
planetary scale. And the nitrogen cycle
could have been one of them. Um, you know,

490
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,770
we are,
we fix more nitrogen and people,

491
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,120
you know, remember their high
school bio once again, but you know,

492
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:33,770
you need to fix nitrogen plants can't use
the nitrogen from the air because it's

493
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,180
bound together an end to,

494
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,360
so we need nitrogen fixing bacteria to
transform nitrogen into usable form.

495
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,830
And when we figured out,

496
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:46,700
people figured out early in the century
and German chemists figured out how to

497
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:50,720
take nitrogen from the air, uh, and
convert it to ammonia and fixed nitrogen,

498
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,260
that was the beginning of nitrogen
fertilizer. I, it's exactly a century ago.

499
00:31:54,261 --> 00:31:58,050
In fact, we just celebrated the
century of nitrogen fertilizer. Uh,

500
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,660
we now fix more nitrogen than all
terrestrial ecosystems combined.

501
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,550
That has huge, huge impacts, you know,
on, on living things. It's why, uh,

502
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,091
for example,

503
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:11,810
we have a dead zone every summer in
the Gulf of Mexico cause all of that

504
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:16,790
fertilizer, uh, comes down the Mississippi
River River. It fertilizes the Gulf.

505
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:19,650
You get these huge algae
blooms, algae dies. Uh, it,

506
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:24,290
it drops to the bottom and you
have deoxygenated water. So,

507
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,550
and dead zones are increasing worldwide
and it's all a function of nitrogen

508
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,970
fertilizer runoff. So that would
be a whole other way, you know,

509
00:32:31,971 --> 00:32:33,470
that we could have this conversation.

510
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,190
So speaking of agriculture, um, I read

511
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:45,190
that even if we stopped
using fossil fuels for power,

512
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,740
the agriculture that we use to produce
meat would still contribute like more

513
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,530
than half of the greenhouse gases but
not carbon dioxide. Different ones.

514
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,300
Like is that accurate?

515
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,760
Um, I don't think so as that,
I mean of course, you know,

516
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,440
our, our cows and things like that are,
are, are burping methane for example.

517
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:14,730
That's one way that that I recalled her
just produces c or two without actually

518
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:19,260
burning fossil fuels. But I think maybe
what you're referring to is, you know,

519
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:22,950
studies have shown that meat
production in general, which is pretty,

520
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,860
pretty fuel intensive, um, and pretty,

521
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,130
pretty crop intensive obviously,
uh, and also has these
other, you know, effects of,

522
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:36,060
of, of, of methane emissions. Um,
they are a major source of, uh,

523
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,680
of initiatives. So, you know, a lot
of people, smart people, you know,

524
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:45,510
have sort of advocated that we all eat
either a lot less meat or no meat and

525
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:49,980
that that would have a significant impact
on emissions. And I, I think it would,

526
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:54,180
it's not going to eliminate the problem,
but it would have an impact.

527
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,100
Hi, I'm, I'm wondering if
you've encountered a lot of, uh,

528
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,160
climate change deniers or human impact
deniers and if you have, you know,

529
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,810
what sort of arguments have swayed them?

530
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,860
Well, I, um, you know,

531
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,770
climate change denial is such a weird,
um,

532
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,490
sort of WWE world counterfactual
world. Um, you know,

533
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,353
here,
here's,

534
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,330
here's the graph showing you what's
happening to see what she levels in the

535
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:29,750
atmosphere. And if you notice
you're choosing greenhouse gas,

536
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:33,320
which we know we've known for
150 years, uh, and you know,

537
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,410
you're increasing it very rapidly
and very radically. You'd say, okay,

538
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:39,320
well I kind of expect the
world to warm up. So, you know,

539
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:41,970
we just have these ridiculous
arguments. Like, you know, it's,

540
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,830
it's cold in New York this week so there
can be no climate change. You know,

541
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,430
it just, it just, it's
impossible. People have people,

542
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:51,920
much smarter people than I have
spent a lot of time thinking,

543
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:56,810
how can you counter, you know, such, you
know, ridiculous arguments at this point.

544
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,780
Um, and it's very hard. I
don't have the answer for that.

545
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,940
But in terms of other human impacts,
you know, interestingly enough,

546
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:07,760
[inaudible] you very rarely
hear people saying, you know,

547
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:11,430
being ocean acidification
deniers. It's just really, I,

548
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:15,800
it's either too complicated or it's just,
it's just irrefutable. You know, we,

549
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,940
you increase [inaudible] two
levels in the air, you know,

550
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,440
very basic chemistry tells us you're
going to be increasing carbon dioxide

551
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,550
levels in the oceans. Uh, we can
measure it. We are measuring it.

552
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,890
The Ph of the surface waters or
the urgent is declining. Um, it's,

553
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,560
it's pretty irrefutable. Uh, and you
know, once again the list goes on.

554
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:41,490
We were obviously all during the
nitrogen cycle. Uh, it's not,

555
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,430
it's not really possible to deny that.

556
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:48,990
So the weird way that we're sort
of fixated on, on climate change,

557
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:51,750
yes or no, I think is
a complete, you know,

558
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:54,810
function of a bunch of,
of,

559
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,380
of increasingly battled,
you know,

560
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:03,120
just information sources which have
been funded by all the usual suspects.

561
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:07,680
I mean, all of that is
true that you read. Hi,

562
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,710
thanks for coming to speak with us today.
Um,

563
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,060
that picture of the stark differences
in what the ocean looks like is almost

564
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:18,200
enough to make someone want to cry.
And it should,

565
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,350
I think there are a lot of smart people
who realize that change is happening,

566
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:25,920
but it feels so impossible
to make any change happen.

567
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,720
And I guess my first answer or my first
question to you would be what could

568
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,960
change things? But I guess in
thinking about my question to you,

569
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:37,800
it's more a question of do you think
there's anything that will change this

570
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:39,780
trajectory and what would that be?
Because it,

571
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,760
it feels almost like an
insurmountable issue. Well, I mean, I,

572
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,770
yes, yes, it does feel that
way. Um, I think, you know,

573
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,150
one of the reasons I,
you know,

574
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:55,920
I'm glad to be here and talking to
you folks at Google is because, um,

575
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,560
you know, Google has been, you know,

576
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,700
they're very smart people at Google
who are very aware of this problem and,

577
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:05,880
and know what it takes to, to, you know,

578
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:10,881
for Trans transformative
technologies to enter our world and,

579
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:12,091
and, and, and,

580
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:16,140
and really change the way we think
about things and the way we do things.

581
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,800
And I think that that is,
you know,

582
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,400
one possibility there is one possibility.
I mean, some gentlemen said before,

583
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:24,600
you know, we, there are,

584
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:29,490
there are renewable sources of energy
out there that are increasingly being

585
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:33,930
deployed. And that is true, not in
a transformative way at this point.

586
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:38,430
Um, but it seems to be not impossible
that that could happen. Uh,

587
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:42,900
if very smart engineers like those, you
know, a Google put their minds to it. Um,

588
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:46,110
it seems to me that that is a possibility.
I am not an engineer,

589
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,550
so I don't claim to know
what that's going to be. Um,

590
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,110
but you know, there are very,
very, very big forces at work here.

591
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:59,670
There's 7.2 billion people on the
planet. A lot of people, you know,

592
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,050
want to raise their standard of living,
which unfortunately right now, uh,

593
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:08,340
you know, tracks global GDP and
global carbon track each other.

594
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,110
And until, and unless, you know, we
uncouple those or decide, you know,

595
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:15,870
to have a lower GDP, uh, you know, we're,

596
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:19,440
we're in this cycle where emissions
are just going to keep going up.

597
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,350
Impacts are just going to keep
increasing. And, you know,

598
00:38:22,351 --> 00:38:26,160
I certainly don't claim to have the
answer how we're going to break that

599
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:29,170
connection or if we're going
to make that connection. Um,

600
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,460
but it doesn't seem to be
impossible that that could happen.

601
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,130
I,
I'm curious

602
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,670
about the, uh, besides for
domesticated and invasive species, uh,

603
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,150
what kind of animals or species are
benefiting from human impact? And,

604
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,160
um, is that change in scope
or population count? Uh,

605
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,630
is that a big effect relative to the
first order effects of human impact or,

606
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,200
that's true. That's a
really good question. And I,

607
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:02,640
I don't have a great answer for that. Um,
that it's a really interesting question.

608
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:06,930
I mean, you know, people
have, you know, for example,

609
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:10,710
rats seem to do really well,
you know, uh, you know, all the,

610
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:15,060
all of the species that we know
benefit from human disturbance, um,

611
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,730
you know,
seem to do really about,

612
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:21,810
so rats have been taken around the world
by people. They are now on islands. Like,

613
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:25,080
you know, like the Hawaiian islands
where they never were Hawaiian ons,

614
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:27,020
had had no mammals.
Uh,

615
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:30,930
they're on really tiny distant islands in,
uh,

616
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:36,110
the Alaskan peninsula where people never
bothered to settle the date they left

617
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,240
rats and you know,
so Roger everywhere.

618
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:44,180
And one of the guys that I went out
within the book or British geologists, uh,

619
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:48,060
sort of speculating and it was tongue in
cheek, but only half tongue and cheek.

620
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,670
You know, that, that rats will inherit
the earth. That, that, that will be, uh,

621
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,470
in become sort of the dominant,
you know, group. And I,

622
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,220
but I think it is a really interesting
question because clearly, yes,

623
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,390
echo space that's being emptied,
you know,

624
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,110
by other species may or may not
be being taken up, you know,

625
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,300
by species that that benefit from human
disturbance is not, it's not clear that,

626
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:13,530
you know, your total biomass is always
going to remain constant, you know, so,

627
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,770
so I'm sure there were people
doing interesting work on that,

628
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,460
but I can't give you any
great statistics on it.

629
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,510
Clearly. Also domesticated
animals now make up, you know,

630
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,810
a phenomenal proportion of
the world's biomass. Well,

631
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:33,360
if there are no more questions,
let's thank the speaker again.

632
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,110
Thanks a lot.
