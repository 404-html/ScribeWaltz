1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,250
Oh, this is really cool. I also just
have to say it's really neat. Uh,

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,780
coming from Canada, I'm from like a
small island on the west coast of Canada.

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,900
So did we standing uh,
a Google London is kind of wild.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,110
It's like talking about my
little book. Um, so, uh,

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,080
my name is Kate Flanders. Uh, thank
you to Nicola for inviting me here.

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,050
I have been a personal finance
blogger for the past, gosh,

7
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:37,810
like seven or eight years at this point.
Um,

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,040
my last job that I had was I was managing
editor of a financial startup for

9
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,250
about three years and I've done a lot
of freelance writing and the personal

10
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:47,320
finance space,
so for other financial startups,

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,860
a different banks and stuff like that.
Um,

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,180
and now I am an author, which
is pretty wild. Like I said,

13
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:58,690
cause I'm just from a little island
on the west coast of Canada. Uh,

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,980
and now I'm like,

15
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:02,800
you guys are holding a book that became
a Wall Street Journal bestseller and

16
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:07,170
everyday I'm just sort
of like what? But, uh,

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,040
it's really amazing to be here today.

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,220
So I will take you a
little bit step backwards.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,260
Having a career in personal finance is
something that I never ever set out to do.

20
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,500
I can honestly say looking back on my
life and the different interests that I've

21
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:23,230
had, I never thought that
that is something I would do,

22
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:26,530
that I would be writing about how
people could be better with money. Um,

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,160
and I say that because I have
not always been good money. Uh,

24
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,620
so I grew up very fortunately
with a family that talked
about money all the time.

25
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,650
Actually we say, and it's aligned
in the, in the book, but it's true.

26
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:40,690
So my dad's a Steeler and
when your dad is a sailor,

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,520
no topic of conversation is taboo. Like
you basically talk about everything. Um,

28
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,350
but money was the biggest one.

29
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,400
So I remember things like growing up
in my dad would tell me things like how

30
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:55,980
much he made, like how much my mum made,
what they paid for their house. Um,

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,150
and actually knowing things
like how much stuff costs.

32
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,670
Like I remember going to the grocery
store and then actually pointing out like

33
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:04,180
how much things cost. So we knew
like, okay, for a family of five,

34
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:08,080
this is what groceries cost A.
I remember looking at their bank accounts,

35
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:10,480
like all kinds of stuff.
Like we talked about money all the time.

36
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,190
My Dad was also someone
who had this really,

37
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,170
I will say annoying when you're like 13,
14,

38
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:21,370
15 years old habit of every morning he
would read the newspaper and when he

39
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:23,870
would find an article about
anything personal finance related.

40
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:28,120
So whether it was about retirement
savings accounts, uh, real estate markets,

41
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,970
the economy,
just anything that was going on,

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,490
my dad would cut them out and leave
them on my bed for me to read,

43
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,240
like when I got home from school.
So I would like walk into the house,

44
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:41,080
walk into my room and see these and
immediately roll my eyes and Groan and be

45
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:45,670
like, I have no interest in reading this
right now. Uh, and unfortunately didn't.

46
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,510
I will say that even though my dad
talked to me about money all the time,

47
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,400
I still made a lot of mistakes.

48
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:54,190
And I think that's sort of just
something that happens in life.

49
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:58,480
We don't do everything just the way that
our parents have hoped that we would.

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,400
So I will say right now, I'm
32 years old. When I was 25,

51
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:07,000
I was maxed out with
close to $30,000 of debt.

52
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,190
And that was basically just consumer
debt. So it wasn't even, um,

53
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,360
student loans.

54
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,600
Like I didn't even have a great excuse
for why I was in that amount of debt.

55
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,390
And if I were to switch that into pounds,
I mean, you guys might know this stuff.

56
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,010
I'd say it's probably like 16,
17,000 pounds of like just consumer debt.

57
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,510
And when I say maxed out,

58
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,660
I was truly maxed out at $100 left in my
bank account and $100 left on one of my

59
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,990
credit cards. And I somehow had to
make that last me for six weeks.

60
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,540
So I had no choice at that point.

61
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,170
But to start taking my finances seriously
and to start paying off my debt. Um,

62
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,660
and so I started this little blog that
I wrote anonymously for a long time.

63
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,530
Uh, that I thought was just going to be
this little place on the Internet where I

64
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,490
could document my debt repayment journey.
No one was supposed to read it.

65
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,900
Like I never intended to ever have an
audience or readership or anything like

66
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:02,560
that. All I wanted to do, and
it was as boring as this is,

67
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:06,610
I would write these weekly spending
reports so we could have spinning reports

68
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:11,230
literally looked like, just like Monday
I spent $2 and 91 cents at Starbucks.

69
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,800
Tuesday I spent $2 and
91 cents it Starbucks,

70
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,700
maybe I spent some money on groceries
or something else Wednesday,

71
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,380
Thursday cause I like it.
That's all it was.

72
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,640
I would post these every Sunday
was nothing exciting about them.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,850
But then people started reading them
and commenting and I was like, why?

74
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,990
What's going on here?

75
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,560
And then I found this whole world
of personal finance bloggers,

76
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,970
a lot of people doing the same thing.
So this was 2011,

77
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:41,020
2012 a couple of years after
kind of financial crash.

78
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:44,290
So I think everyone is sort of finally
coming to this place of like, okay,

79
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,050
it's time to really start getting serious
with what we're doing with our money.

80
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,110
What I will say is about being maxed
out at that point is that it weighed so

81
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:56,800
heavily on me that I became extremely
aggressive about my debt repayment

82
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:57,430
approach.

83
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,510
So I can't say that I had like the best
techniques for the way that I paid off

84
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:05,770
my debt. I also look back at it
and think that it was extremely,

85
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,300
um, not just aggressive. Like
I was really hard on myself.

86
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,030
So I think I used to say to myself
when I was in debt was like,

87
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,320
you're a bad person.

88
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,260
You've screwed up all your chances
of having a strong financial future.

89
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,460
Kind of like,

90
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,120
I deserve to be punished and not have
any sort of fun money or free money

91
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,960
because I had just gotten myself into
this horrible situation and so I had just

92
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:28,330
deserved whatever it
took to get out of it.

93
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,430
And I paid off my debt in two years.
And that sounds great on paper,

94
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,850
but the problem then was that
throughout those two years,

95
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,940
I hadn't taken the time to learn why
I had actually gotten into debt in the

96
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:42,550
first place. So I didn't
understand what my habits were.

97
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,450
I didn't know actually what I had been
overspending on all those years before.

98
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,500
Like I kinda had this record of the past
two years when I was paying off my debt,

99
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,190
but I didn't really know anything about
myself as a consumer because just for

100
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:57,190
those two years I was just like
anti consumption, anti everything,

101
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,540
which we can talk about that. Like I'm
more in the mindful zone of that now. Uh,

102
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,190
but I, I didn't know anything
about myself. So on top
of being super aggressive,

103
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:09,380
being hard on myself and
not learning anything,

104
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,470
it's not that surprising to
me that once I was debt free,

105
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,470
I actually just went back to
spending basically all of my money.

106
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,910
So there were months when I was paying
off my debt where I would put up to 55%

107
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,600
of my income towards debt repayment.
And that was great. But again,

108
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:26,420
a little bit too aggressive,
like not quite, uh,

109
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,330
something that could be sustainable.
Cause again, I had no fun money.

110
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:32,030
I didn't allow myself to do
anything just for pure pleasure,

111
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:35,570
like the simplest things that you enjoy
it. I didn't let myself do any of it.

112
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,720
So there were months back then,

113
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:43,721
55% of my income going towards debt and
then the first year that I was debt free

114
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,470
and I should have been set up right,

115
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,200
like to have this much more
successful financial future,

116
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,090
I should have been able to
achieve all kinds of goals.

117
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,700
And instead I was saving maybe 5% of
my income and I would write these blog

118
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:58,910
posts then where I would say
at the beginning of every
month that I wanted to be

119
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:03,440
saving 20% of my income. And then at
the end of every month I would be like,

120
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,730
oh hey guys.

121
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,350
Remember when I said that thing
I actually saved like 3% or 5%?

122
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,980
I think like the most was
about 12, uh, an entire year.

123
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,360
And it's not that I was saving nothing
but it's that writing that down every

124
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,440
single month did not feel good.

125
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,290
Like it didn't feel good to share it
and have to tell people that had not

126
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,980
achieved my goal but also just didn't
feel good for me cause I knew that I could

127
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,930
do better and that I really wanted to.

128
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,040
So I will tell you about this challenge
that I decided to sort of set out for

129
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,410
myself. But everyone upfront
like a question is always like,

130
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,190
oh why did you start doing it? Like what
was the goal? And I'm like, to be honest,

131
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:37,920
like I think we,

132
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,330
we wish it was sort of like
a more dramatic story or
we wish that there was some

133
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:45,620
like huge I a rock bottom moment or
something like that. But I think for me,

134
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,840
something I've learned
about myself is that I'm,

135
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,380
I usually create change in my life
after I've been thinking about it for a

136
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:54,560
really long time and eventually get
to a place where I'm just really

137
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:58,700
uncomfortable and have to make
a change. So for me, all it was,

138
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,460
was that once a month
for 12 months in a row,

139
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,250
I would think like I
can do better than this.

140
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,320
I don't know exactly
what that looks like yet,

141
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,830
but like I'm not happy with what I
just did. I know I can do better.

142
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,050
So what does that look like?

143
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,500
And then after a year of being debt free,

144
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,700
not that surprisingly how to another
money conversation with my family.

145
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,650
My sister at the time was 20 years old
and I was 29 and we're sitting at my

146
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:25,281
parents' house,

147
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:28,550
we're all just kind of hanging out and
my sister starts telling us about how she

148
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:32,120
had just bought some camera or
something for like $500 I keep in mind,

149
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,860
she's like a full time university student.

150
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,530
She has working part time but she
doesn't have a ton of extra money.

151
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:38,840
So we're all just kind of
picking at her and being like,

152
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,830
oh like you should save more
of your money. Like don't
spend it all. And she goes,

153
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:46,010
yeah, but I saved 20% of my income so
I can do whatever I want with the rest.

154
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,800
And so first of all I'm like, wait, what?

155
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,670
How has my sister figured
this out before me?

156
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,880
How she's even 20% on her part
salary and I can't even do that.

157
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,950
Making a decent income at
a financial startup. Okay.

158
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,130
But then the words that came out of
my mouth were just automatic. I don't,

159
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,810
I didn't even think of them before I
said them. I just said to her, yeah,

160
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,040
but you live at home.

161
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,820
Like do you really need 80% of your
income or could you live on less?

162
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,930
And then like it was one of the things
where I have no idea what anybody else

163
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:21,900
said for like the next five minutes.
And in my head I'm like, Whoa,

164
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:26,220
like where did that question come from?
Why have I never asked myself that?

165
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,260
Like do I need 90 or 95% of my income
or could I be living on less than that?

166
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,080
And so the wheels just
started turning from there.

167
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:35,310
And within like a couple of weeks,

168
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:38,910
I just sort of wrote down these rules for
something that I called a shopping ban.

169
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,610
When I think about the shopping ban now,

170
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:44,610
I sort of wish I had called it something
different because it sounds incredibly

171
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:47,920
restrictive upfront. It's like no
shopping, you can't buy anything.

172
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,810
That's not what the goal is. And that's
not even what that year looked like.

173
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,160
I just sort of had this idea that I
didn't want to buy anything unless I

174
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,050
absolutely needed it. And also knowing
like I had never shopped like that before.

175
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:02,310
I'd never spent money like that before.

176
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,380
Like waited until I
actually needed something.

177
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,290
I used to be someone who made a
lot of preemptive purchases, right?

178
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,740
Like you just buy things because
you think I'll need it one day.

179
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,720
It will help me in that scenario.

180
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,760
But I never waited until I just needed
the thing and then you buy the thing.

181
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,540
So I just wrote these
rules down and I will say,

182
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,710
so there were three different lists.

183
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,570
The first list was the things I
was allowed to buy. So basic stuff,

184
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,640
I could,
you could call it even like consumables.

185
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,530
So I was obviously allowed to buy
groceries. I can put gas in my car.

186
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,440
Uh,
buy toiletries when you run out of them.

187
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:39,690
Like I'm always like if you run
out of deodorant and toothpaste,

188
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,210
everyone in your life wants
you to buy more of that stuff,

189
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,800
so please buy more of it. So anything
that you are using often and run out of,

190
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,150
buy it, buy more of the stuff that you
need, that's fine when you run out of it.

191
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,720
The things I could not buy a,
that list was a lot longer. Um,

192
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,690
so I couldn't buy clothes, uh,
shoes, books, magazines, um,

193
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:04,610
electronics, things for around
the house. And then I added, um,

194
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,800
take up coffee to that list of things
I couldn't buy. And I will say,

195
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,920
I'm not a personal finance writer who's
like, you're not allowed your $5 latte.

196
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:15,420
Like, I just had a $5 Latte,
we'll a $5 Canadian law day.

197
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,020
So I'm not one of those people who says
that I was just at the point with my

198
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:22,290
finances where I was no longer comfortable
with how much I was spending on it

199
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,300
and I was doing it strictly out of habit.

200
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:27,560
Like it wasn't because I genuinely wanted
the coffee even it's just like this

201
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,920
thing that I did all the time. And so I
was just still doing it. So I was like,

202
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,300
no more ticket coffee either.

203
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,490
I also created this other short list
because I decided to do this for an entire

204
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,323
year.

205
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,920
So I started trying to look ahead a
little bit and just think of a few things

206
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:48,360
that I might need in that
upcoming year. Um, so one was, uh,

207
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,050
I had five weddings to go to and I'm
not really someone who dresses up in

208
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:55,530
general. So I was like, I
need an outfit, one outfit,

209
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,500
dress shoes or whatever and that
will be for all of the weddings. Uh,

210
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:03,130
I knew that I had no kind of winter
boots and actually these are the ones I

211
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:07,960
bought. So I bought these in 2014 and just
still wear them now, which is great. Um,

212
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,040
and there was something else I really
wanted, it was if I could save the money,

213
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,490
I really wanted to buy a new bed that
year because my bed was 13 years old.

214
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,890
And I think because it
was a bigger ticket item,

215
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,670
I could never seem to save and
actually afford to replace it.

216
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,310
So interesting to look back
at the psychology of that.

217
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:28,990
Like in all my years previous, I was
so quick to spend $20 here, $30 there,

218
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:31,690
et Cetera, et Cetera, et Cetera,
how quickly that stuff adds up.

219
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:35,710
And I could have just had $1,000
to buy a bed back then. But anyway,

220
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,870
so I was like, if I can save the money,
I would really like to buy a bed.

221
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:39,280
That just was important to me.

222
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,360
So I started this challenge
on my 29th birthday,

223
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:47,440
so it was July of 2014.
Um, right up front.

224
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,090
I also decided to start sort of a
secondary challenge, which again, like I,

225
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,270
I still think I, or wish I had a
better reason for why I started it,

226
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,180
but I just sorta got on
that kick of decluttering.

227
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,080
I definitely recognize the fact that I'd
been spending a bunch of money on stuff

228
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,330
that I probably didn't really need,
wasn't even using.

229
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,990
I could look around my home and see that
I had more than enough stuff and there

230
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,350
was so much that I wasn't wearing any
more. It wasn't reading it, touching it,

231
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,300
whatever.
Like I just wasn't using this stuff.

232
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,030
So at the same time that I
decided to stop shopping,

233
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:20,340
I also decided I was going to declutter,
which sounds really counterintuitive,

234
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,340
but it ended up being,
uh,

235
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,490
like the very weird and great challenge
to do together because it all taught me

236
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:31,690
about becoming a more mindful
consumer in general. Uh,

237
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,420
so I set out to do that
when I started decluttering.

238
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:37,000
I will say like that was the
very first thing I sort of did.

239
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,660
Like the starting the shopping ban
felt easy in the first few weeks. Um,

240
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,450
but when I, I started decluttering
at the exact same time,

241
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,650
what was so interesting about
that was that I took inventory,

242
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:49,240
which sounds so boring,

243
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,330
but I took inventory of not only the
amount of stuff that I got rid of,

244
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,370
but also the things I was keeping.
Now,

245
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,380
the reason that was ended
up being so important,

246
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:58,390
like I was strictly doing
it for a data point.

247
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:02,520
Like I'm so nerdy that throughout this
entire process I was literally tracking

248
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,890
percentages of how much stuff I got rid
of, how much stuff I kept. And it was,

249
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,490
it was just purely for me. Like it,
it didn't matter for anyone else.

250
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,850
I was just super curious how the
numbers were going to add up. Uh,

251
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,740
and so the first couple of months,

252
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:18,550
like I ended up decluttering 43% of my
belongings in like just maybe a month and

253
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:21,670
a half, two months. And it
was really easy at first.

254
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:24,160
But that list of inventory
of the things that I kept,

255
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:27,860
the reason it ended up being so important
was because it helped me stop or it's

256
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,700
helped stop me from making
a lot of impulse purchases.

257
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,260
So throughout the shopping ban,

258
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:34,990
there were numerous times where
I did think about buying things,

259
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,980
but then I was able to just sorta
late sort of mentally check and go,

260
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,480
you know what?
When I started this,

261
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,690
I actually still owned over 50
books that I haven't even read yet.

262
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,840
I do not need to buy more books. Uh, and
the same thing just for like toiletries,

263
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,110
kind of the things you have the most of.
So when people ask me now like, well,

264
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:53,090
what should I do if I was going
to start a shopping ban? I'm like,

265
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,620
don't even start one to be honest.

266
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,840
Like start by taking inventory
of the stuff you own,

267
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,880
because I think that alone will
help people to start making more,

268
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,860
some of the impulse purchases there
they're more inclined to make.

269
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,130
So I decluttered took inventory.
Um,

270
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,220
and then I noticed kind of month two,

271
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,520
that is where the first time things
really started to feel like they were a

272
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,850
little bit trickier. And
when I say this, okay,

273
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,090
journalists keep asking me like what
the hardest part was. And I'm like,

274
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,610
to be honest, like the hardest part was
really changing habits and the things,

275
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,040
so the things you do all the time.

276
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,650
So one of the hardest things for
me was to give up takeout coffee.

277
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:31,130
And then journalists laugh at that
sometimes like, oh, how silly.

278
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:35,150
Like you're just like, what a frivolous
thing. And I'm like, no, you don't get it.

279
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,490
Like it's not about the takeout coffee,

280
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,020
it's that that is something I was doing
habitually, almost every single day,

281
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,010
which means that every single day I'm
then in that moment where I'm like, oh,

282
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,500
I want to do this thing. Oh, but I can't.

283
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,620
And so you have to stop and start figuring
out like what your triggers were and

284
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:56,210
why you were thinking of doing that. Uh,
and, and just and change your reaction.

285
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,450
Like I had never thought of changing my
reaction before. I always just like one,

286
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:01,700
I thought of getting to a good coffee,
I just immediately got it.

287
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,080
So it was the first time that I really
had to start thinking about why I was

288
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,340
even considering getting takeout coffee
and then changing my reaction to that.

289
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,480
Uh, Gosh. What was like
the hardest part's yeah,

290
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,840
take up coffee books where the next
biggest one, and again it's a habit,

291
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,660
like I used to have this really bad
habit and it's so easy with stuff like

292
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:24,440
Amazon, like you just hear of
something online and you are,

293
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,010
you can hear it from anywhere and you
immediately click over and you go to buy

294
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:31,610
the thing and then back then it was like,
you need $25 to get the free shipping.

295
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,850
You just like add something
else. It sounds kind of
okay, get your free shipping,

296
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:38,180
bing, Bang, boom. I do that like
once a week or once every two weeks.

297
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,590
I did not read that many books like I
really wish that I did, but I never did.

298
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,340
It's very rare that I read that many
books, but I did it all the time,

299
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,740
which meant that at least once or twice
a week I was kind of sitting there being

300
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,980
like, well that book sounds
good. What do I do now?

301
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,450
And so the in the beginning like noticing
that those were the two toughest ones

302
00:16:56,451 --> 00:17:00,080
for me that would look different for
everyone because everyone's spending is so

303
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:01,310
personal.
And that's why again,

304
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,950
like people ask me what shopping bans
are doing something similar all the time.

305
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:06,320
I don't think yours is going
to look different than mine.

306
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,050
And what's hard for you is going to look
different than what looked hard for me

307
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,450
because everyone's are different.
Like the things that we have habits for.

308
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:18,470
Some of them are kinda similar but
often not like everyone's values are so

309
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,800
different.
So those were the toughest parts.

310
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:26,390
The changing the habit part is what then
became the most important thing for me

311
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,040
was like with the tater coffee. Pretty
easy. Honestly, when you guys are lucky,

312
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:35,270
like at work it would just be here
for you. For me it was like, okay,

313
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,190
well instead of going up
to get takeout coffee,

314
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,410
I just have to kind of
leave all the stuff for,

315
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:43,640
take it like making coffee on the counter
at all times. Like if it's just there,

316
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,810
then you do it and then that becomes
a habit and like an enjoyable habit.

317
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:51,510
I started enjoying coffee every morning
and almost noticing it became this like

318
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,770
really nice routine because I was working
remotely for the startup that I was at

319
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,390
and I would just enjoy my kind of slow
mornings getting up, making the coffee,

320
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:02,000
kind of listening to a
podcast or something,

321
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,850
just relaxing a little bit
and then starting the day
it was so much easier than

322
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,910
just an actually isn't that even were to
think of it like I was working remotely

323
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:12,300
and somehow it used to seem easier to
get dressed and go downstairs to get

324
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:16,720
coffee rather than just to make
coffee. But it was just a habit. Uh,

325
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,100
so changing that habit was easy.
The are easy over time.

326
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,190
The books one was tough. Like I
thought about buying books for a long,

327
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,490
long time.
Uh,

328
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:31,491
I will say that I became very good friends
with my library and I actually had to

329
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:34,500
get a new credit card that year because
mine like had been compromised and so

330
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:37,200
they have to send you a new number
and all of that. Still to this day,

331
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:41,040
it's been almost four years. I do not
have that credit card number memorized.

332
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,880
I used to know all of them off by heart
because it was just so easy to do online

333
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,800
shopping.
I still don't know what that one is,

334
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:51,801
but I memorized my library card number
within probably three weeks of having it

335
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:55,800
because I used it all the time.
Uh,

336
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,150
and then another question I get, so
aside from like my personal habits is a,

337
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:01,620
how did friends deal with it?

338
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,040
That's probably the most common question
I get at any kind of event that I do

339
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,230
now. Like what had friends
do? What had family do?

340
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,260
I feel super fortunate that
my friends and family, uh,

341
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,770
were mostly pretty supportive family.
Definitely.

342
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,850
I think also because over the years the
thing that they had watched me do was

343
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,310
sort of take on these big challenges.
And just do them.

344
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,760
Like other things I'd written on the blog
was not only paying off my debt in two

345
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:25,050
years,
um,

346
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:28,320
but I also quit drinking in those two
years and I'm very open and honest about

347
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:31,830
that in the book. So if you do read it,
you will find a lot of stories about that.

348
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,930
Um, and I also decided to sort of take
control of my health. I lost 30 pounds.

349
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:38,700
I started training for
my first half marathon.

350
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:41,790
Like I was just doing these
big challenges. So family
was just like, oh yeah,

351
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,740
like you'll do this thing.
No problem.

352
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,360
What was more interesting with friends
is that at first I will say our struggle

353
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:51,540
was more just that friends didn't
really seem to get the point.

354
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,930
So I would find out all my friends had
gone out for dinner or something like

355
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:56,820
that. I'm like, wait, where was my invite?

356
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,920
And then they'd be all confused and be
like, well, I thought I wasn't a lot.

357
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,340
You weren't going to dinner. I'm like, no,
I can go to dinner and beg me to dinner.

358
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:06,090
Like I'm allowed to do that if I want
to do that. So they're like, oh, okay.

359
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,770
So friends seemed confused all the time.

360
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,140
What was more interesting was when
I would find myself listening to

361
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:14,370
conversations with friends,

362
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:18,090
where they were talking about how much
stuff they had bought or like the deals

363
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,950
they had got or where they'd
bought something from.

364
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,390
And I don't think I had ever realized
how socially normal it is to talk about

365
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,790
shopping.
Like I was really naive when I started.

366
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,460
I just kinda thought no one would
care and it wouldn't be a big deal.

367
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,850
And then this is something I also noticed,
obviously when I quit drinking,

368
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,980
like drinking is very culturally normal.

369
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:37,860
And so you're in a lot of conversations
where now you're like, okay,

370
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,500
I'm not part of this conversation anymore.
Like I can't,

371
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,520
I can't add anything to it.
I can't participate in any way.

372
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,160
And we shopping, I just didn't
think that was going to be a thing,

373
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,460
but it came up all the time.
And it can be as simple as like,

374
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:53,380
where did you get your shoes?
Where did you get your bag? Oh,

375
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,120
what book are you reading right now?
Where did you get it from?

376
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,160
Who did you hear about?
Like just anything.

377
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,740
People talk about the stuff
that they buy all the time.

378
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,290
And so it's not that friends cared.

379
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,920
It was really that it was one of those
moments. And I, I think about this a lot,

380
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,390
like when,
especially when you're sober,

381
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,690
you often find yourself in situations
where you feel like the only sober person

382
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,820
in the room because
you genuinely are like,

383
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:16,900
it's the only one who isn't participating.
Uh,

384
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:21,520
and with these conversations that ended
up being the same. Uh, so I will say,

385
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,280
I mean the first six months or
so of the shopping ban, we're,

386
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,050
we're just tough. And in terms of
like figuring out what my habits,

387
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,180
where I had to change them,
uh,

388
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:34,270
and then also starting to question a
little bit more what my value is actually

389
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:36,760
were and the things I actually
did want to be spending money on,

390
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,070
but it got a little, little bit
tougher about halfway through. Um,

391
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:43,480
some of the book,
I talk about it a lot,

392
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:46,950
but my parents ended up announcing that
they were getting divorced that year and

393
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,380
I think it was the first time that
I really recognized that I was more,

394
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,330
I'll just say like an emotional consumer.

395
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,470
So I think what I realized that year was
that in the past what I would've done

396
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:58,960
was probably drank my way through that.
Um,

397
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:01,660
I'm also pretty honest about like
when I was younger like binge eating,

398
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:06,250
things like that and because I didn't
have those and now I also didn't have

399
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,210
spending as an option a,
I had to do the tougher part,

400
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:14,020
which is you just have to feel the hard
feelings and that's not great advice.

401
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:15,850
Sort of like people are always
like, okay, if you couldn't do that,

402
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,930
like what did you do? And
I'm like, I cried a lot that
year. Like it was really, no,

403
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,380
not that exciting. It wasn't a great
year all around or for all parts of it.

404
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:26,680
But it was a really hard year and I had
to learn how to feel feelings for the

405
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:28,180
first time and just like get through it.

406
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,780
So what ended up getting easier after
that was finally coming to a place where I

407
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:38,860
had a goal, like I didn't have a
goal really when I got started,

408
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:40,570
I sort of wrote these few things down.
I'm like,

409
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:42,070
I want to spend less
and I want to save more.

410
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:45,340
And it was definitely just this kind
of financial journey that I was on.

411
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,160
But then I just thought I'd or,

412
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,000
and the other part of that was that I
said I wanted to also become more mindful

413
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:54,100
consumer,
which I truly was just kind of making up.

414
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:56,320
Like I didn't even know what
that really meant when I'm like,

415
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:58,960
that sounds like a good thing. Like
if I could be a more mindful consumer,

416
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,080
that sounds great,
but I didn't really have a financial goal.

417
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,470
So at halfway through like I was doing
pretty good. I was saving typically,

418
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,510
but like 20% of my income every month.

419
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,120
And I was spending a bit on
travel for the first time,

420
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:13,030
which felt great because travel was
something I'd always wanted to do,

421
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,940
but I'd never seem to have the money
to do it because I was sorta just

422
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:20,140
mindlessly spending money on whatever
else. Um, so he's spending it on travel,

423
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,870
living on much less than I had been
before. Uh, but then I decided,

424
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,490
or sort of in looking at my
finances, realize that not
only was I living on less,

425
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,950
but I was also doing a bit more freelance.
Um,

426
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,550
to the point that I realized
I was actually earning
the amount of money that I

427
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:38,350
was living on at that time.

428
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,180
So it started to become an option to me
that I could maybe quit and either work

429
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,800
for myself or just figure something out.

430
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,810
And that is a position I had never been
in and never even imagined being in

431
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:54,590
before. Like, I'd never thought to
myself that I would work for myself.

432
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:58,070
Like I grew up with parents who worked
in the public service and so I just

433
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,840
entrepreneurship or whatever,

434
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:03,740
like it just wasn't something I ever
aspired to or thought would be part of my

435
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:04,574
future.

436
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,150
But once I realized that my spending was
exactly how much I was already earning

437
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:09,800
just on the side, I'm like, okay,

438
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:12,290
like there's a little bit more
motivation here to keep going.

439
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,970
And I sort of kicked it into high gear at
that point. Um, in the last six months,

440
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:20,690
you know, I, I made this decision
to quit my job and I ended up, uh,

441
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,480
on those months, I don't know,
like there were months in there,

442
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:28,280
I probably stayed up to 45% of my income
and by the end of it had enough money

443
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:32,510
that I felt completely
comfortable quitting and knew
that even if I could only

444
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:35,090
do it for like six or eight months,
I had tons of money.

445
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,320
Like I had lined up a ton of work and
I had tons of money in the bank. Um,

446
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,450
and that I could at least make it work
for probably six months to a year.

447
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:43,280
And that it just would
have been worth trying.

448
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,250
And I was someone who never
took chances on myself before.

449
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,100
Like when I really look back at
the kind of consumer that I was,

450
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,820
I used to buy things for all the wrong
reasons and I had an even when as a

451
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:53,390
drinker too,

452
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,950
like I wrapped so much of myself worth
up in the wrong things and in trying to

453
00:24:57,951 --> 00:24:59,630
be someone that I actually wasn't.

454
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,660
And in that year I ended up
decluttering 70% of my belongings. Um,

455
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,481
as part of that,

456
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:08,840
I remember the toughest part right towards
the end of decluttering was realizing

457
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,930
that everything left over
was stuff I actually used.

458
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:15,980
But there were these few items that I
had held onto that was sort of for this

459
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,290
more like aspirational version of myself.

460
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,260
So I used to buy books that
I would think like I dunno,

461
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:25,190
like a smarter or just more interesting
version of myself might read or I buy

462
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,850
clothes that like a more professional
or put together version of myself might

463
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:32,360
wear um, creative projects where a
big one, I had so many different,

464
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:36,560
like everything from a DSLR camera to
scrap booking stuff to painting stuff.

465
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,400
Like I had all these different materials
for creative projects that I thought I

466
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:41,660
might do one day,

467
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,740
but I never did any of them because the
real me wasn't actually interested in

468
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:46,574
any of it.

469
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,110
And so I remember in letting go of all
of that and sort of letting go that

470
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:54,680
through that entire year of just
all the stuff that I didn't need,

471
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:58,880
I realize the things that I actually do
value and who I really am as a person.

472
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,870
And it became a lot easier to start
making spending decisions once I actually

473
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:07,850
knew who I was already. So I don't want
to like cut it short there, but I'm like,

474
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,190
there's more I could
say, but I, I don't know.

475
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:12,710
I've seen like a few phases where I'm
like, are there any questions yet?

476
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,910
Oh, no. Uh, okay. Well,

477
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,920
what I'll say is that when I finished
the year, uh, I had quit my job.

478
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,920
I had lived on an average
of 51% of my income.

479
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,960
I saved 31% of it and I spent 18% on
travel, which was a lot of money. Um,

480
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,610
but I'd never been able to do that before.

481
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,830
And so even if we had cut that out though,

482
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:41,210
like if I hadn't spent anything on travel,
I would've saved 49% of my income.

483
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,830
And a lot of that just came back to
making more mindful decisions every day,

484
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:50,830
every week. Not that I was buying
nothing. I also want to say I,

485
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,270
I don't believe that buying stuff
is bad or spending money is bad.

486
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:57,150
I buy things now and I spend money.
I'm obviously,

487
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm on a six week vacation right now and
I've bought books since I've been here

488
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:03,990
and, and a few other things. Like I
don't think it's about that. It really,

489
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:08,400
for me it was about getting to a place
where I could figure out like who I was

490
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,120
and it make spending decisions so much
easier because now I know when I make a

491
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:15,780
purchase it's for something I actually
need or I really want it in that moment.

492
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:19,350
Like it feels really amazing to buy a
book because you genuinely really want to

493
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:22,350
read it. And like that day you sit down
and read it in three or four hours,

494
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,310
I feels really good. And that is
something I can't say about past me.

495
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,810
I never knew how to do that, but uh, yeah,

496
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,830
I'll leave it there for now.

497
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:33,680
Yeah.

498
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,260
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

499
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,053
Thank you.

500
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,310
So the only part you haven't mentioned
yet is when you decided to write the book

501
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:49,020
and how you went from kind of this
experiment to becoming an author.

502
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,120
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the question, uh,

503
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,620
just being about when I
decided to write the book, um,

504
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,610
I don't know that that was a decision.

505
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,700
It was this really amazing twist of
events that happened after I finished the

506
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,540
year. So, um,

507
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,600
I earlier that year I had done an
interview with someone at Forbes and the

508
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:11,190
interview was about someone else.
She was like,

509
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,070
I know cause I knew kind of everyone
in the personal finance space and she's

510
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:16,110
like, I know that you have a good
relationship with this person.

511
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,800
I'm doing a profile on them and I'd really
love a couple of quotes of just like

512
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:23,100
what they mean to the community.
So we did this great interview,

513
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,110
she got the quotes and at
the end of it she goes,

514
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,410
now when you're done doing like
the finger doing like let me know,

515
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:29,760
we can write a profile about it.

516
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,200
So I reached out to her about a month
before because I knew like the last couple

517
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,880
months especially, I was like,
I've got this in the bag.

518
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,400
Like this shopping ban thing is
just like a way of life. Like,

519
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:41,550
I'm saving as much money as I can
so I can quit my job. This is easy.

520
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,200
So I emailed her to say like, Hey, I'm,
I'm almost done. I'll be done soon.

521
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:49,140
Let's do the interview.
And the date came out,

522
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:53,340
which was actually the last day of
the shopping. Bam. Uh, it came out,

523
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:55,560
she emailed me the link that
morning and goes, just Fyi,

524
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:58,710
these things have a tendency
to go viral and I'm like, what?

525
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:04,950
And within two weeks I had been contacted
by six different literary agents. So I,

526
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,690
I never made that decision.

527
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,220
Like that was sort of something that came
after and it's been really interesting

528
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:14,070
because I, I think, um, as a
writer, like as a creative,

529
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:17,490
you sort of struggle with like
I didn't set out to do it,

530
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,420
but at the same time I was writing about
something that people are obviously

531
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:24,270
thinking about. And so I mean, publishers,

532
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:27,450
literary agents just like saw that and
it just became an option. It sort of,

533
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:28,021
one of the things too,

534
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:30,420
like it was like quitting my job
was never the goal either. Right.

535
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,830
And it just became an option.

536
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:34,440
It was the first time where I was really
in a position where I could take an

537
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:38,880
opportunity and kind of move forward
with it. So it just became an option.

538
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,010
Right.
You gave that buying the book.

539
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,280
It is.

540
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,790
Although I will say about that too is
like I don't tell anyone to just like go

541
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:53,240
out and buy the book and always
like I talk about this now,

542
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:55,400
like I buy books when I
know I'm going to read it.

543
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,650
So if it feels like something
you want to read now,

544
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,900
then buy it or ask your
library if they have it.

545
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,550
I don't know how the library
system works over here,

546
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:04,520
but like in North America you can just
go and ask your library to get the book.

547
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,930
And that also helps authors, like
authors, not maybe in over here,

548
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,600
but in North America,
author is actually like a small amount,

549
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,560
like get paid out every single time your
book is checked out. So just an Fyi,

550
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:19,160
like it's just as not maybe just as
good, but it's all helps. It all helps.

551
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:22,520
And so I'm, yeah, I just
always think about that. Like,

552
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,900
I would never go out and tell
anyone to buy, buy any book.

553
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,350
But yeah, no, the irony is
real and it is not lost on me.

554
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,440
Come up.

555
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,660
What would you say are some of
the treats that you've kind of,

556
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,940
so you mentioned travel,
but just aside from that,

557
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:45,120
what would you say that you're doing
now that you haven't done before that is

558
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:48,000
maybe a splurge or an expense that you
wouldn't have considered? Like a, yeah,

559
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:48,834
like a tree.

560
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,130
Um,
well it's funny like the word treat,

561
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:53,480
and I talk about this a
little bit in the book,

562
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:56,600
the word like treat or treat yourself.
Things like Yolo,

563
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,270
like all just sorta different
phrases that are out there.

564
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,810
The reason I don't like them just
sort of in general, like not,

565
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:04,100
not even just that we
say them to each other.

566
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:08,900
Although part of that that I don't like
is that like I think everyone truly

567
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,660
wants to be saving more money and yet
we've created these little phrases where

568
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,270
we're all encouraging each other
to spend more. It's really weird.

569
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,800
So I don't like that word because for
me it makes it still feel like it's

570
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,400
something I shouldn't be
having, sort of. So for me,

571
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,580
I actually believe like I don't really
have thoughts on like needs versus wants.

572
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:29,630
Like if you really want something, it's
just a need. If it fits in your budget,

573
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:33,980
it's a need. So I would
say now as a consumer, um,

574
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,590
I mean I pretty much never buy clothes.

575
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:40,580
There's all these things that like I just
realized I don't care about. But I do,

576
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,390
I mean I buy books,
I don't buy more than I read,

577
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,350
but it feels really amazing now too.
Um,

578
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,530
I would say I buy more
books in bookstores.

579
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,200
Like I don't buy anything
online really anymore.

580
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,450
And that for me has
come from this place of,

581
00:31:56,451 --> 00:32:00,980
it's so much different to walk into a
bookstore, really read a few pages of it,

582
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:04,880
like get an actual feel for what the
book is like and then making the decision

583
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:09,350
to buy it rather than just like hearing
about it immediately getting it online.

584
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,420
Um, so I probably spend more on books
because I do it that way. But I also,

585
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:17,700
it's like something that's super
weird or like people keep calling me a

586
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:18,534
minimalist.
I'm like,

587
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,640
I don't even know if I would call myself
one because I do like tangible stuff.

588
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,860
Like I like real books.
I don't really like Ebooks,

589
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,000
so probably just bookstore
just differently.

590
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,130
It's just a lot different buying
them now than it used to be.

591
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,103
Yeah.

592
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,910
One of the things, uh, uh,

593
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,210
people say it's never with credit cards
and online you mentioned that you don't

594
00:32:45,211 --> 00:32:47,730
actually track the money you're spending.

595
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:50,330
It's very easy because you don't
actually physically experience that in.

596
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,060
Do you use any tricks like playing more
with cash or something like this or any

597
00:32:54,061 --> 00:32:57,650
kind of similar things you mentioned
going to the actual bookstores?

598
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,310
Yeah. And anything else? Um,
it's funny that tea, I like,

599
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:06,450
I love that question because my answer
is still is not great in the sense of,

600
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,490
I think it's going to be
personal for everyone.

601
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,190
So I remember trying a cash budget,
uh,

602
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:14,310
years ago actually when I was trying to
pay off my debt and it just did not work

603
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:16,050
for me,
or at least like the way I was doing it.

604
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,570
I think because I had tried
to really restrict myself.

605
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:20,370
Like this is the amount of
money I'm allowed for two weeks.

606
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:24,630
But then like things genuinely do
come up in that time. You're like,

607
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,750
even if it's only $20, you're like
actually really need that money.

608
00:33:27,751 --> 00:33:32,040
Like what am I supposed to do now?
Um, so cash doesn't quite work for me.

609
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,930
I would say now, like I basically pay for
everything with credit, but it's comes,

610
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,790
it's, I mean that's been a cycle. Like
when I paid on was paying off my debt.

611
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:44,850
I never used my credit for
about a year after that.

612
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:46,470
I didn't really love using it.

613
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,990
And then now I'm just at a place that
I'm really comfortable with my spending

614
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:50,970
because I,
I know I won't overspend.

615
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:54,600
Like I trust myself and
look at my spending weekly
and so I just know that I'm

616
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:58,020
doing okay. But I think it really, um,

617
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,180
it's really personal for everyone.

618
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:04,590
The one thing that I have done for a long
time and still do that to this day is

619
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,980
I actually put pen to paper
and write things down.

620
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,750
So in a journal I will literally write
down how much I spend everyday on,

621
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:14,900
on what, um, and I don't do
that quite as much anymore,

622
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,150
but I did it for years because for
me there's something so different.

623
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:20,100
It was the same way as like
publishing on the blog.

624
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,480
Like knowing that I had to write down
the exact amounts and put it out there,

625
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,260
I naturally just started to spend less
because you'd see like, Oh, you know what,

626
00:34:28,261 --> 00:34:31,380
it actually doesn't feel great to be
spending money on Starbucks like every

627
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,790
single day. It's maybe I'm going to cut
it down just a little bit. Um, so I would,

628
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,330
I don't know, like I'm super old school,
I love technology for so many things,

629
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,360
but there's something about spending
like writing it down by hand.

630
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,120
It just helped me become more
mindful of it over the years.

631
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,463
Okay.

632
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,933
Hi.

633
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,910
Um, so I guess it's been quite a bit of
trial and error through the process. Um,

634
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,400
my question is more about like,

635
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,790
is there anything over this
amount of time or like are there,

636
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,260
is there one thing that you would have
done differently or like anything that

637
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:14,930
you particularly regret around
decisions that you made?

638
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,410
Good question. Um, I don't know
about doing it differently.

639
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,620
I guess I actually forgot about one story
and this is that it was I guess four,

640
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,410
four and a bit months into the first
year of the shopping ban. Cause I will,

641
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,450
I actually didn't even say this,
but when the first year was over,

642
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:35,220
I ended up doing it for a second year. Um,
and again just for sort of data points,

643
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,240
which is super boring,

644
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:39,510
but I was super about things like
how much stuff do I actually use?

645
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:44,511
Like how many things of toothpaste do I
actually use in a year or deodorant or

646
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:48,510
lotion or cosmetics, like
things like that. Um,

647
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,210
so I will say it was a
regret in the first year.

648
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:53,280
I sort of wished I had
kept track of all of that.

649
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,620
And not because it's like
earth shattering information,

650
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:58,260
like it doesn't even matter
to anyone else except for me.

651
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,320
But having that information now,
like tracking that for a year,

652
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,940
it really helped me figure out,

653
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:06,060
it's sort of like an semi
average female consumer.

654
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:07,770
Like how much stuff am I actually using?

655
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,610
Which then it just keeps preventing me
from making impulse purchases. Right?

656
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:12,180
Like I'm like,

657
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,230
I know that I don't need to go stock up
on stuff because it takes a long time to

658
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:19,470
actually use things up. So
that was sort of a, a regret.

659
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,870
But one thing that did happen was four,

660
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:24,240
four and a half months into
it on black Friday came up.

661
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,280
And one of the things that I had done
when I started the shopping ban was I

662
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:30,870
unsubscribed from basically everything.

663
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:34,700
And I also unfollowed like all
retailers on social media. Um,

664
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,090
so I thought I was doing great.

665
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:37,770
Like I wasn't really getting
those emails anymore.

666
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:40,350
I wasn't being told about all
the different things I could buy.

667
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,580
So I thought it was doing good.

668
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:46,581
And then somehow in black Friday I got
an email from my favorite bookstore and I

669
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:50,580
actually talked myself
in to buying something.

670
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,940
So I talked myself into and like it
was really this exercise after that,

671
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:59,580
like, cause it happens so quickly and
like people call the impulse purchases.

672
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:00,720
And in that moment I was like,

673
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,240
I've actually done this a lot before
and it feels a lot more like a blackout

674
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:05,730
purchase where like it's so quick
and then all of a sudden you have a

675
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:08,730
confirmation email that's like, here's
this thing you did. You're like, wait,

676
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:11,190
I did what?
Like how much did I just spend?

677
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,190
So on black Friday that happened.

678
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,820
So all of a sudden I see that I have
an ereader, like a confirmation.

679
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:21,480
I have bought a new ereader, I immediately
canceled the order and then go,

680
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,740
what just happened?

681
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,330
And I realized there are so many stories
we tell ourselves to justify something.

682
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,520
And it's not that the ereader would
have been bad per say. Mine was broken.

683
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:36,000
So these are like the stories
I was telling myself. Mine
was broken. It did work.

684
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,380
But you had to, um, you know,

685
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,770
like the reset pin or like little
hole you have to stick a pin in.

686
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,900
I had to do that every time
I wanted to turn it on.

687
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,050
So I sort of had to have a
pin available at all times.

688
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,620
So it's sort of would have helped me but
I didn't need it and I didn't actually

689
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:52,951
need it.

690
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:55,230
So I'm telling myself all this stuff
and like you haven't bought yourself

691
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,980
anything in so long and you've never
seen it this low before in price and,

692
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,760
and all this stuff. It happens so quickly
and then you just make the purchase.

693
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,890
And so I think it wasn't a regret because
actually something I realized that

694
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:12,360
year was that passed me anytime I would
have sort of like screwed up a challenge

695
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:13,470
or like gone off track,

696
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,190
old me would have been really hard on
myself and sort of just shamed myself and

697
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:19,080
made myself feel really,
really bad for it.

698
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,080
And that was the first time I was
like a have to take this as a learning

699
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:24,660
experience instead,
figure out what just happened.

700
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,800
So that going forward I can just start
changing my behavior or becoming more

701
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:29,341
cognizant,

702
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:33,030
like in that specific example of like
what are the stories I tell myself before

703
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:34,650
thinking about making a purchase?

704
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,880
Hi. Uh, this is probably quite a
difficult question, but I wondered,

705
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,210
having gone through everything you've gone
through and thinking about everything,

706
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,860
uh,
in the way that you have,

707
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,920
what are your thoughts on how far your
behavior in the past was kind of innate

708
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:55,640
human behavior?

709
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:59,420
Or how much was it based on the context
we all find ourselves in now where

710
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,160
there's so much stuff available?

711
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,240
No,
it's a really good question.

712
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:07,470
So it's sorta two parts or
just like part of it is,

713
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:12,471
I don't know because I don't know what
my old spending was like when I got into

714
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:16,560
debt, especially I never tracked
spending in my life. Right.

715
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:20,070
I just kept seeing that my balance
was growing and I stopped. I truly,

716
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,230
it was so bad.
I stopped looking at my credit cards.

717
00:39:22,231 --> 00:39:25,410
I just saw that the balance was growing
and as long as I could make the minimum

718
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:28,770
payment, I felt like I was going
to be okay. And so I don't know,

719
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:31,800
honestly what old me
really spent money on. Um,

720
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,790
I'm guessing there was probably not only
social like influence from things like

721
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,950
social media,
but just generally social influence.

722
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:40,850
Like when your friends are doing
something, you just do it too. Um,

723
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,580
I also know parts of my debt came from
partying too much or just in the sense of

724
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:48,090
like, I never wanted to say no. So
anytime's a friends asked me to hang out.

725
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:52,500
I would just say yes even if it
meant I was putting it on credit. Um,

726
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,920
so I dunno, like I'm sure there's
a mix of kind of both there.

727
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,940
But I do know at the end of the day when
I look at some of the things that I was

728
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:02,310
buying and some of the stuff I was
spending money on and especially with

729
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:03,144
partying,

730
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,360
like so much of my self worth was wrapped
up in the fact that I was a really

731
00:40:06,361 --> 00:40:08,490
good partier and people
loved partying with me.

732
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,830
And I truly like as
soon as I quit drinking,

733
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,430
I almost had like an identity crisis
of just like I don't even know what I'm

734
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:17,370
good at or why people would want to be
friends with me or want to hang out with

735
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:19,920
me. Um, because that was my life.

736
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:23,340
My life was so revolved around
partying that I just didn't get it.

737
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,090
So not only in trying to figure that
out and then decluttering and looking at

738
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:27,811
some of my stuff,
I'm like,

739
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:30,870
there's so much stuff I used
to do for the wrong reason.

740
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:33,720
Like I just didn't understand
who I was as a person.

741
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,020
And in starting to just
like kind of let stuff go.

742
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,360
That was the first time I really
started to figure it out and I'm like,

743
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:42,780
the answers were so simple. I'm
like, I'm a writer, I'm a reader.

744
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:46,410
So like I like books, like a
writer. I'm a reader, I hike a lot.

745
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:51,600
I'm a sister, I'm a friend,
I'm a daughter, like who I am.

746
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,460
They're actually all pretty simple things.

747
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,570
And so once I sort of figured that's about
it, it just made spending easier now,

748
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:01,050
but old me, I dunno, I'd say a big macs.

749
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,960
Oh,
I'm sorry.

750
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,780
Um, like how regimen did you gain? Like
when you first started, like did you,

751
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,200
were you like watching how much we'll
see you are using in the shower and that

752
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:15,780
Sorta

753
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,040
oh, is it just spending just Benning? Just
finish it? Yeah. Yeah. No, just Benning.

754
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:21,691
Yeah.
No,

755
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:24,900
that's a good question though because
that's sort of a topic in general that's

756
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:25,920
pretty hot right now too,

757
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:29,130
of like extreme for gallery and the
things that people will do to sort of cut

758
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:30,640
back.
Um,

759
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,470
that for me has never quite aligned
like who I am or whatever about,

760
00:41:34,471 --> 00:41:34,971
because like I said,

761
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:38,690
I still went to restaurants and I
bought something if I needed it.

762
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,240
Like there were a few things that year
and I think women can probably relate to

763
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:41,430
this.

764
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:46,070
Like I only owned one pair of jeans and
they ripped in the inner thigh and like

765
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,420
that only lasts for so long.

766
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:51,920
Like you can only fix that so many times
for you have to replace that. That uh,

767
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,040
so, so no, it wasn't about
like spending no money.

768
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,460
It was really for the first time like
having to ask myself like why I'm thinking

769
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:01,880
of buying something. I almost
think to like make a visual of it.

770
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:05,450
Like it was kind of putting a barrier
between me and every single purchase where

771
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:08,420
you almost were like hitting the pause
button and like asking yourself a few

772
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:09,920
questions before you're doing it.

773
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,550
So instead of just automatically
making the purchase, getting the thing,

774
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:15,800
it was kind of like hitting
pause and just going, Huh,

775
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,830
like do I really need this thing?
What's going on in my head right now?

776
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:20,660
How am I feeling?
What's going on in my life?

777
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,280
What influencers are around me right
now? Like what's going on? Um, but yeah.

778
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:34,443
Yeah.

779
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,880
Thank you very much,
Kate. Thank you. Clothes.

780
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,230
[inaudible].
