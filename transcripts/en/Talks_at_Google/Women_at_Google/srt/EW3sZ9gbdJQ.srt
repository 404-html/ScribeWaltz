1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,750
Thanks for having me.
It's really great to be here at Google.

2
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:11,750
I'm always curious as to what
Google is up to. So maybe, uh,

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,630
I get to ask you guys questions
after the talk. Um, it's,

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,440
uh, it's about this detection
that I, that I want to talk today.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,670
I don't know if people heard
on February 11th, 2016, uh,

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,760
just this year there was an announcement
made about an otherwise very obscure

7
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:34,210
experiment nobody had
heard of before. And, uh,

8
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:37,180
and suddenly it was on the cover of
all the newspapers internationally.

9
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:41,570
It was reported everywhere, a
radio and television that, uh,

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,450
this obscure experiment had announced
the discovery of the century,

11
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:51,451
the first human procured
recordings of gravitational waves.

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,260
Did you hear this? And, um,

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,790
and gravitational waves were cited
as ripples in the shape of spacetime.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,810
That's what everyone always says.

15
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,900
They're ripples in the shape of space
time there literally a squeezing and

16
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:06,040
stretching of space.

17
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,630
The recording that was captured was of
the collision of two black holes that

18
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:12,970
rang the space and time around them,

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,600
like mallets on a drum ringing
the drama of space time.

20
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,030
Those waves in the shape of space emanated
out traveling at the speed of light,

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,150
although they are not light, which I
think is very important distinction.

22
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:30,151
I'll try to emphasize and they took a
1.3 billion year journey before sloshing

23
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:32,650
over the earth and
striking this experiment.

24
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,330
Did you hear the gravitational
waves? Okay, we're going to listen.

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,160
So anyway. Yeah, that's loud. That's good.

26
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,780
That was good.
That's okay.

27
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,930
So that sound,
uh,

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,430
was not so loud.

29
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,300
They were actually listening to the
detector and the Control Room when they're

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,360
struck and it was too quiet to hear
would actually probably have been loud

31
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:08,620
enough to hear by the human ear through
the speaker system in the control room.

32
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,150
But um,

33
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,770
but it happens so fast that the operators
in the control room couldn't have,

34
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,230
couldn't have parsed it really.
It happened too fast.

35
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,490
But I want to discuss why we're
talking about this as sound. Really.

36
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,980
That's the part I want to emphasize.
I know people have heard this,

37
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,130
they've heard the recording,
they saw the discovery in the papers,

38
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:30,310
but I think that people are still
quite unsure what it all means,

39
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:33,490
why it's a sound, why it isn't a
picture and what this discovery means.

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,510
So that's kind of what I want to pick
apart today before we do the Q and a.

41
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,540
Um, here is, uh,

42
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,970
the universe sort of as we know it.
This is from the Sloan digital sky survey.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,040
Everything, every object in this
survey has been observed. These are,

44
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,610
this is not a cartoon. These
are real observations. Uh,

45
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,350
those objects are all galaxies.

46
00:02:56,351 --> 00:03:00,610
So each galaxy has 100 billion stars more.
And um,

47
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,760
and there are 100 billion galaxies
in the observable universe.

48
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:06,580
As many galaxies as there are
stars in the Milky Way. And,

49
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,480
and it just goes on and on forever.
Every one of these being an entire galaxy.

50
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,180
Nope. So much of what we
know about the universe,

51
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,270
almost everything that we know about
the universe comes to us from light,

52
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,800
from things like telescopes, right? We
sit on this planet for the most part.

53
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,030
Occasionally we put something in
orbit around the earth or the sun,

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,350
but we just from the confines
of this rocky planet,

55
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:37,070
basically we collect light and
take pictures of the sky. And A,

56
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,090
we've amassed this incredible story that
the universe is 13.8 billion years old,

57
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:46,780
that it's full of galaxies, that we
are not at the center of the universe,

58
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:48,970
that the universe expands.
Um,

59
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:51,910
that there was a big bang
13.8 billion years ago.

60
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,560
We know that there are black holes,
maybe, uh, hundreds of thousands,

61
00:03:56,561 --> 00:04:01,330
maybe millions in every galaxy. We think
there are supermassive black holes,

62
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,140
millions or billions of times the mass
of the sun and their centers are these

63
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:08,740
galaxies. We know that there's dark
matter matter that we can't see,

64
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,800
but we only indirectly see its
effects and dark energy. Um,

65
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,550
but what else is out there
is sort of the question.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,670
If we know that there's
dark matter and dark energy,

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,400
are there other dark things
that we simply can't see?

68
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,510
And black holes are an example of
dark things that usually we can't see.

69
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,820
So I'm here is uh, astronomical
image. Again, this is not a cartoon.

70
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,210
This is a real image of a galaxy
and the direction of Hercules,

71
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:38,620
the constellation Hercules'.
It's an entire galaxy,
hundreds of billions of stars.

72
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:40,210
It's actually a very big galaxy.

73
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:45,211
It's bigger than that in the center is
a supermassive black hole we suspect.

74
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:47,050
And why do we suspect it?

75
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:52,051
Because we see these huge jets coming
out of the galaxy that are powered by

76
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:57,331
material being taken down by the black
hole and spat out before it falls in.

77
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,200
People often ask me, how did the material
get out from inside the black hole?

78
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,430
Nothing can escape a black hole. They, it
doesn't come from inside the black hole.

79
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,140
It actually never makes it inside.

80
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,460
It gets shot out along these tremendous
jets and those jets are millions of

81
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:13,390
light years across.

82
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,570
And we see them from this great distance
and that's how we figured out black

83
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:19,390
holes are out there. But essentially, uh,

84
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,950
black holes should be
invisible to us usually.

85
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,520
So there's lots of black holes out there
that we simply couldn't see that are

86
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:31,450
too dark to possibly see. And that's
where the gravitational waves come in.

87
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:34,990
So gravitational waves are a
way of observing the universe,

88
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,490
but not through light.

89
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,720
The gravitational wave observatory that
made that discovery is not a telescope

90
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:43,510
of any kind.
It doesn't take pictures of the sky.

91
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,950
It actually makes recording of the
ringing of the shape of space time.

92
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,060
So you want to try to get into the answer.
So let's try to get into that stuff.

93
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,010
Um, it was interesting that all
of this does come from Einstein's.

94
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,860
So a lot of people were
saying very excitedly, um,

95
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,920
this was the confirmation of
Einstein's theory of relativity,

96
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:11,630
but nobody was that surprised about this
particular conformation in some sense.

97
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,950
Uh, it was much more the fact
that it could even be done at all.

98
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,600
So here's an example of spacetime. You
know, if we're in this space of this room,

99
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,290
we don't see curves in space time.
This is Einstein's theory.

100
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,400
Einstein's theory is that space time is
curved in response to mass and energy.

101
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,750
But we can't see these curves.

102
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,700
If you were to float in empty space and
you were to like throw objects and empty

103
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:37,850
space, they would trace
straight lines, right?

104
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:42,110
If you're an astronaut and you're far
from the earth and you can't see any stars

105
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,020
and you were to just throw,
I don't know what,

106
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,920
what astronauts have their hands on, I
don't know, a bolt, something, a tool,

107
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,020
it would travel in a straight line,
right?

108
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,090
So if I imagined painting those
curves and space time, uh,

109
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:58,940
I would imagine painting a
straight line grid. Okay.

110
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,540
This is a way to give you an explanation
of what curved space. I mean,

111
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,870
intuition for what it's
like Einstein's theory says,

112
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,550
if I put a big mass in that space time,
like a star,

113
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,960
it will curve the shape of space around
it. And you already know that to be true.

114
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,810
If I take this clicker and I throw it,
you know,

115
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,180
it's not going to travel
in a straight line, right?

116
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:24,950
It's definitely going to trace an arc
and fall to the, to the earth. And, uh,

117
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,600
if we could paint all the paths that
I could imagine of throwing probes,

118
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,730
you could actually paint the curved
space time around it. And so intuitively,

119
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,780
uh, it's actually, it seems
like such a huge leap,

120
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,030
but yet intuitively we all know it's true.

121
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,060
We live in a space time where things do
not travel on straight lines and those

122
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,430
paths that things travel
along when they're free and
wait lists like this would

123
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:54,860
be if I let it drop or like
it would be if I through it.

124
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,330
Those are the curves in spacetime. So
an Einstein proposes a theory, you know,

125
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:03,470
it takes him forever. He really
struggles, uh, with the mathematics of,

126
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,200
of general relativity.
But when he comes up with the theory,

127
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:11,330
the first thing he turns to, um, it's
the topic of gravitational waves.

128
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,790
And, um, and here's the reason why.

129
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,570
If space time is curved by heavy masses,

130
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,430
then if those masters move,

131
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,120
the curves have to move and
adjust to follow it around.

132
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:27,440
Surely if the sun were to go
halfway across the universe,

133
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,800
the curves it creates around,
it must also move.

134
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,040
And those are the gravitational waves.

135
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:39,041
What happens is the curves
in space actually have to
move and adjust slower than

136
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:44,000
the speed of light or at
the speed of light. In this
case, because no information,

137
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,930
not even gravitational information
can go faster than the speed of light.

138
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,050
So these waves curve and adjust and
follow the mass and then wave outward

139
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,740
throughout space.
Now,

140
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,880
Einstein many times said
gravitational waves are real.

141
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,040
They're not real. They're
real. They're not real.

142
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,100
Over decades he was changing his
mind and writing different papers.

143
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:09,570
Sometimes he would write a paper that
said gravitational waves are not real.

144
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,290
And between acceptance of the
paper for publication and print,

145
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,370
he would write it saying, which one
did I say? Not that they are okay.

146
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:21,870
So he changed his mind. Uh, many
times. This is not simple stuff.

147
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,300
So this is from 1915,

148
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,210
1916 in the 30s,

149
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:31,770
people are still arguing of gravitational
waves are real. Um, in some people,

150
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,890
even in the 60s,
in the early seventies,

151
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,370
very visionary people that Kip
Thorne start to become convinced that

152
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,640
gravitational waves are real.
Um,

153
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,230
and that somehow they're
fundamental to our whole, uh,

154
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,770
theory of gravity hanging together.
Um,

155
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,850
this is a computer simulation now modern
times of two black holes colliding and

156
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,370
it's a very formal mathematical,
a system based in relativity.

157
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,750
This problem even on a computer
since you guys like to code a lot,

158
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,360
we'll appreciate,
was so hard.

159
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:09,300
Even though we know Einstein's
theory of curved space time,

160
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,470
we can write the equations down,
we can plug them into a computer.

161
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,240
It doesn't just run. It was, it was a
numerical problem that seemed insoluble.

162
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:21,380
And that's because of gravity
is very nonlinear. As a space,

163
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,240
time would curve and change
with the two black holes.

164
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,290
It would feed back into itself in such
a complicated way that they couldn't get

165
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:32,570
the codes to run. It took 30
years, three decades for them to,

166
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,730
to write the codes properly, um,
and solve that numerical problems.

167
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:40,380
So here is a beautiful, uh, uh,

168
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,920
visualization of that one
of the numerical solutions.

169
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,480
It shows two black holes.

170
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,460
They've helpfully painted the curves in
space time around at kind of contours.

171
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,770
If you can see the red coming out,

172
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:56,370
those are the gravitational waves
emitting as two black holes,

173
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,010
Bang on the drum ringing,
space time,

174
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,960
sending the waves outward at the speed
of light. The two black holes collide.

175
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,880
They make a bigger black hole,

176
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:10,230
which just settles down to this
perfect shape and goes quiet.

177
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,810
And that's the prediction.
This prediction has already I,

178
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,300
this must be this many years old, this,
this simulation may be 10 years old.

179
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,620
And um,

180
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,680
and it's an incredibly accurate prediction
of what the gravitational waves,

181
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,310
uh,
would sound like.

182
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,800
They would travel through the universe
getting quieter and quieter, um,

183
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,200
until it hit the earth. This is, um,

184
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm going to show you a
much less sophisticated a
simulation that's based more

185
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:44,550
an analytical calculations. I'm going to
show you the orbits of two black holes.

186
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,580
I'm not going to show the,
the contours of the space,

187
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,170
but we're going to listen to them.
Okay?

188
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:53,010
So this is what it would sound like if
you could record the ringing shape of

189
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,680
drum. So one of the black hole
paths is yellow, one is red,

190
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,650
and they're going to start
to spiral in together.

191
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,740
So these two black holes are equal in
mass. Just why they're both moving.

192
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,750
One's not heavier than the other,

193
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:14,890
so they're both whirling around
and as they get closer together,

194
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,330
you can hear the frequency goes up

195
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,040
and eventually they're going to merge.

196
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,540
So you heard that Chirp and that's a
lot like the Chirp in the actual signal.

197
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,200
You see how similar,
that's the,

198
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,480
what's called the trip is when it sweeps
up and frequency as they collide. Now,

199
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:35,580
even now, you sort of maybe have a
better intuition of what the waves are,

200
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,100
but why are they sound?

201
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:42,101
If you were an astronaut floating
nearby those two black holes colliding,

202
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:46,700
you would not be able to see them, but
it could wring your eardrum. I mean, I,

203
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:50,780
you know, I always say that I'm not,
uh, I don't know anatomy that well.

204
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,213
So,
um,

205
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,330
I have talked to people who study the ear
in detail and they say it's plausible.

206
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:59,330
You know, I've never tried to do the
experiment floating near a black hole,

207
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,930
but um, but you, if you heard that you'd
like want to get out of there. If you're,

208
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,600
if you're floating near darkness
and you hear this chirping up,

209
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:11,840
it's like time to scoot.
Um,

210
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,730
so technically it is very much like sound.
It's not just a weak analogy. You know,

211
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:20,270
I can take any kind of light waves
and translate them into sound.

212
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:22,640
That's not what's happening.
This is not light.

213
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,190
It's literally vibrations on the drum.

214
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:29,390
And so it's like almost like having
an electric guitar where you pluck the

215
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:33,080
string and it makes no sound
until you amplify it, right?

216
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:35,960
Until you record the shape of
the string and you amplify it.

217
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,100
That's kind of what this instrument does.
It records the shape of the ringing.

218
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:43,280
John, we'll talk about that
more and it plays it back, um,

219
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,260
as sound.
Here's another pair of black holes.

220
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,970
One is much heavier,

221
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:54,800
so it's orbit is in yellow at hardly
moves because it's 10 times heavier than

222
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,230
the other. Um, the other moves much more.

223
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:59,930
You can see the orbits of
black holes are pretty crazy.

224
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:03,050
They're not like solar system orbits.
When they get close together,

225
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,340
they get pretty wild. And you can
hear the difference between these,

226
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,940
this one and the previous one,
how it gets quiet and then louder.

227
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,750
So we can hear that the whole
systems moving like this,

228
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,560
we can hear that they're
not on circular orbits.

229
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,910
We can even hear that they're
spinning if you know how to listen.

230
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,930
Okay.
And then they emerge.

231
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,220
But it's still chirps that Cerp is a real
characteristic of all these black call

232
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:37,380
systems. I'm sorry, I did a
touch the volume. Okay, wait,

233
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:39,510
before I do that,
let me go back for a second.

234
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:46,010
At the time that people decided to build
this instrument Lygo so the experiment,

235
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:49,740
this obscure experiment no one had
ever heard of that made this detection.

236
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:54,170
It's called Lego. It's the interferometer
gravitational wave observatory.

237
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,710
Um, it actually made the
detection in September,

238
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:01,730
September 14th, 2015. Uh, they
didn't announce it until February,

239
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:06,480
but it made the detection in September.
This experiment was dreamed up in the, uh,

240
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,030
late sixties.

241
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:13,031
And in a sort of started
to spread different ideas.

242
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:17,480
We're spreading, um, about
trying to do something like this.

243
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,910
But one of the original
architects was Ray Weiss.

244
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,680
He was a young professor at Mit.

245
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:25,460
He didn't understand the general
theory of relativity. He, uh,

246
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:27,830
was trying to teach it because MIT said,

247
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:31,790
you're running a gravity research program,
you should teach general relativity.

248
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,820
And he says, I couldn't tell them I
didn't know general relativity. Right.

249
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,690
So he starts to teach this
class. He says, I was bumbling,

250
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:41,330
but the students didn't walk out.
And the reason they didn't walk out,

251
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:45,620
it's cause he was dreaming up ways to
actually do experiments with the theory.

252
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:48,950
And that's when he dreamt up this idea.
Look, if there are gravitational waves,

253
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,230
he thought and they come across the earth,

254
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,770
then things will Bob on the
wave by the time they get here.

255
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:57,680
If I could suspend
mirrors very delicately,

256
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,260
they would sort of Bob as the wave past.

257
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,650
And if I could keep track of the
distance between those mirrors,

258
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,070
I would know if they hadn't
moved slightly apart and in,

259
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:09,380
and I could record the
shape of the ringing drum.

260
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,490
So if you could time had
extremely accurate clocks,

261
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,470
you would be able to do that
with what we call just one arm,

262
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,260
just to mirrors in a vacuum.

263
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:24,800
So the laser light doesn't get scattered
and shine the laser light between the

264
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,660
mirrors and with a very precise clock,

265
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,940
you could keep track of
where those mirrors are.

266
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,020
We don't have such precise clocks.
So instead he thinks of an interferometer,

267
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:38,170
which is two arms in an l shape and you'll
see the lego instruments in a second.

268
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,430
Um, and the light comes back and goes
down the two arms and comes back.

269
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,150
And if it traveled the same
distance in both directions,

270
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,680
then the light would interfere perfectly
and for travel different distances,

271
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,530
then it would interfere imperfectly.

272
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,840
And the waves would create
what's called a fringe pattern.

273
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:00,980
And so it's a much simpler detection to
look at the fringe pattern than it is to

274
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:03,890
try to use a clock.
And a,

275
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,000
he started building this machine.
It was 1.5 meters.

276
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,340
He was building in a place
called the plywood palace.

277
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:14,210
It was this ramshackle structure that
was thrown up during World War II and it

278
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,190
was supposed to be torn down
and they didn't tear it down.

279
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,920
It's supposed to last for 10 years.
It was,

280
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,510
it wasn't torn down for another 50 years.
And you know,

281
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:24,140
they used to punch holes in the ceiling
and break the pipes and they would

282
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:27,470
literally perform experiments and
go right through several stories.

283
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,090
And it was a crazy place.

284
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:33,590
Nine Nobel prizes came out of the
plywood palace and it was almost the

285
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:37,970
crappiness of the structure that
allowed them right to just be free to

286
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:41,840
experiment. He describes that
when he began these experiments,

287
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,340
everybody thought he was crazy. First
of all, they said it will never work.

288
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,020
Technologically.
It's impossible,

289
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:53,021
which are trying to do because by the
time the gravitational waves get here,

290
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,670
they're, uh, variations in distance, uh,

291
00:17:57,671 --> 00:18:02,671
that we expect it to affect is a billionth
of a trillionth of the length of your

292
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:10,290
machine. Okay. A billionth of a
trillionth of the length of your machine.

293
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,490
So a 1.5 meter machine
isn't going to get anything.

294
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,310
One of his colleagues from Mit said,
uh,

295
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:19,320
you couldn't even record
the sun exploding.

296
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:22,620
I could look out the window and
do better, you know, and um,

297
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,420
and eventually he ran out of funding.

298
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:29,421
His grants were turned down and then
he found out after he had been declined

299
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:32,070
from his grants and people
started telling them,

300
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:34,230
you're not going to get tenure
and you're not going to succeed.

301
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,990
He found out that a German group,

302
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,530
which had read his grant to review it
for the National Science Foundation had

303
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,780
started to build these instruments,
but bigger and better. Okay.

304
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,900
So there he is in this ramshackle
structure with no money.

305
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,780
People are against them. They don't even
believe gravitational waves are real.

306
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:56,760
They certainly don't think black holes
are we all at this stage and time and um,

307
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:01,470
and he's about to lose out, right? He's,
he's about to lose out. And he says,

308
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,870
then what happened is I met Kip,
Kip Thorne.

309
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:08,100
Kip Thorne is the iconic astrophysicist
from your part of the world.

310
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:12,630
He's a caltech professor. Um, very
theoretical, very brilliant man.

311
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,440
And, um, and they go on this
campaign together. Okay.

312
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:20,400
So skipping ahead a bit.
50 years later,

313
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,030
800 people invested in the experiment.
Uh,

314
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,770
nearly a billion dollars.

315
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,180
Two instruments that each
spanned four kilometers, uh,

316
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,890
make the detection of the century and
they, and it's not an easy 50 years,

317
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,760
it's an arduous 50 years.
Here is the full scale detector.

318
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,180
This is an instrument in Hanford.
These are the arms.

319
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,250
The mirrors are suspended at the ends of
these arms and the laser light travels

320
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:49,470
along this vacuum.
So that's the site and Louisiana.

321
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:50,880
And you can tell cause it's swampy,

322
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,070
there are alligators and bass and
things like that and the swamps. Um,

323
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,420
and uh, so here we're going to see the
laser light. This part is a cartoon.

324
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:04,260
Obviously you can't go inside
the beam. Um, but those,

325
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,940
that vacuum,

326
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,420
so the wasn't built until 1998.

327
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:10,980
It has stayed in a vacuum.

328
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:15,420
It's two of the largest holes in the
earth's atmosphere, um, ever made.

329
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,310
And these are the chambers of the corner
stations where the mirrors are and the

330
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,710
beam splitters and all of
the optical components.

331
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:27,480
But the rest of it's just vacuum and
laser light. So if that vacuum is broken,

332
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:31,620
one of the heads lead scientists
told me we'd all go home.

333
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,830
It would all be over a lot of
the expenses and keeping that,

334
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:37,470
that vacuum alive or,
or building it in the first place.

335
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,280
There's the physical difference between
the two sites and they put them as far

336
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,730
apart so that there's not the
possibility of coincidence, false alarms.

337
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,770
And they're basically recording.

338
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,350
So we imagine some ripple in the
shape of space comes from far away.

339
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:56,650
It rings the instruments, they record
it, and they literally play it back.

340
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:57,910
A sound in the control room.

341
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:01,780
You can listen to the detector and the
control room and it's constantly noisy

342
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:04,570
and humming to hear earthquakes in China,

343
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,480
they hear wins from the Gulf.

344
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:12,340
They have all kinds of seismic activity.
Um, planes, the moon, the sun, tides,

345
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:14,920
everything rings. This
machine, it's very noisy,

346
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,240
but the billionth of a trillionth
of an arm, a four kilometer arm,

347
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,700
amounts to tiny variations in distance,

348
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:26,380
less than a 10000th of the width of a
proton. And that's what they recorded.

349
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,000
Just quite remarkable. This is a sound
of the instrument and the control room.

350
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,130
This is the noise. This is what it
sounds like. Most of them, it's the

351
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,600
time. You can hear different
modes in that. Okay,

352
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:41,980
so this is what happened
on September 14th.

353
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,670
There's ray himself 50 years later is
still at the sites working on the machine.

354
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:52,770
He was there on September 13th,
um,

355
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,290
looking for radio interference and they
were not ready to, to run detections.

356
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,820
The machines were operational.

357
00:21:57,821 --> 00:22:01,720
They were ready with some
of the algorithms weren't
ready for the data analysis

358
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:06,280
and they were, um, they were still
doing what the Kulin engineering run,

359
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:10,270
which is you run tasks and you interrupt
the machine and you see how it responds

360
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:13,870
to certain vibrations, trucks
breaking, banging on it with hammers,

361
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,500
whatever they're doing. Ray,
luckily his wife says, come home.

362
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,580
So he puts down his tools and he goes
home in the middle of the night on

363
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:25,140
September 14th and Louisiana and
the middle of the night in uh,

364
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,120
Hanford Washington,
where the other instrument is the,

365
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,560
the young scientists that the people
working on the sites and the graduate

366
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,780
students there,
they're running their tests,

367
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:36,220
they're taking the machine on and offline.

368
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,280
They finally decide they've had enough.
It's two eight and they go home.

369
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,320
4:50 AM coming from the southern sky
after a 1.3 billion year journey.

370
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,820
Within a span of an hour of them leaving
the instrument in observing mode,

371
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,420
it strikes Louisiana
10 milliseconds later,

372
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:55,420
maybe a little less at cruises across
the continent and rings the Hanford

373
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:58,570
machine. And it's this spectacularly
loud beautiful of them.

374
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,270
And this is what it was. If you
pointed a telescope, this is not,

375
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:07,120
this is a computer simulation,
not a picture, not a movie.

376
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:09,320
We couldn't possibly
see it with a telescope,

377
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,750
but this is what it would look like.

378
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,950
If you could look at the lending of
the light behind the two black holes.

379
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,300
One was about 29 times a mass.
This on one was 36.

380
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:22,450
I think they're pretty big black holes.

381
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:27,130
They're orbiting each other and the final
seconds of their life together there,

382
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:31,450
this is vastly slowed down.
They're going at a half,

383
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,230
2.7 of the speed of light. Do you guys
want to see that again? It's pretty great.

384
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,213
Let's see that again.

385
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,030
They're going about a half the
speed of light up to almost 0.7.

386
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:40,691
The speed of light,

387
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:45,691
like 70% of the speed of light there are
about 200 kilometers across roughly in

388
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:50,960
size. And um, and all we caught
was the last four orbits.

389
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,190
That was the only part that was allowed
enough to detect the event horizons are

390
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:58,010
empty space.
These are just holes in space time,

391
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,450
the event horizons touch and coalesce
and make a bigger black hole.

392
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:06,710
You can see how deformed it looks and
eventually that bigger black hole rings

393
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:11,711
down and becomes quiet and we'll
hear will hear it again in a second.

394
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:17,280
So it's quite spectacular how distorted
they start to look and then they wobble

395
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:21,710
together and they form a one quiet,
spinning black hole.

396
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,480
You can't even tell that
black hole spinning.

397
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,960
So here's what happened at the
observatories 1.3 billion years later.

398
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,160
So that's what they hear.
And again, it's slowed down.

399
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,760
They only hear it once.
Of course,

400
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,660
it's just for a fact that they
like to repeat it. They had a half,

401
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:49,290
they had 200 milliseconds,
a fifth of a second.

402
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,850
So you got to play it four times to
get any kind of, um, feeling out of it.

403
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:58,140
So it took them a months
to analyze the data.

404
00:24:58,141 --> 00:24:59,430
But that morning and Europe,

405
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:03,030
people wake up and they see this candidate
event and the data and there starts

406
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:05,910
to become a lot of chatter.
People start talking about it.

407
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:07,650
People wake up eventually,

408
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:12,330
8:00 AM a few hours after it happened
in the east coast and eventually in

409
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:16,920
Hanford, and they start to hear all
this chatter and everyone's incredulous.

410
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,280
Somebody said, you know, we just
turn the thing on. There's no way.

411
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:24,540
People told me it wouldn't be until 2018
that the first detection was made and

412
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:28,230
everybody told me it wouldn't be black
holes except for Kip Thorne. Okay.

413
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:31,680
Kip always said it's going
to be black holes first. Um,

414
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,510
and Ronna who's one of the
experiment list said, um,

415
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,830
this time we're going to detect
something. And I said, Ronna,

416
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:42,610
how can you be so sure? And he said, I
always say that I see ahead every run. Um,

417
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,311
and uh,

418
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:48,210
and he said it didn't mean he didn't even
look at the data for a day because he

419
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:52,740
was so incredulous. He thought, this
is ridiculous. It's not real. And, uh,

420
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,800
they worried that it had
been intentionally injected
into the data as a false

421
00:25:57,841 --> 00:26:01,920
signal, which is something that the
experimentalists do on purpose to test the

422
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:06,060
experiment. They inject false signals
into the data. So everyone thought,

423
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:10,680
Oh God, it's a blind injection.
This is ridiculous. Oh, Mike Landry,

424
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:13,620
lead scientist at Hanford
said he sat down that morning.

425
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:16,230
He was kind of pissed off at the
team of injector as he's like,

426
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:18,920
what are you guys doing? We're not
ready for this yet. He sends down,

427
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,530
he sits down next to the guy and says,
are we going to phase of blind injection?

428
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,340
And the guy, he was like,
no. And he starts to ask,

429
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,600
he's not allowed to ask,

430
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:30,960
did you do a blind injection of two
black holes colliding? You know,

431
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,910
but he can sort of ask,
are we in a phase?

432
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:37,590
And He permutes the question until
few times and he keeps getting no.

433
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:38,670
And finally he says,

434
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,260
are we in a phase of injections
of any kind anywhere?

435
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,400
And the Guy Says No. And he says, I
got cold is what he told me. He said,

436
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:50,760
I just went cold.
So on the telecomm that day,

437
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,680
everyone's talking and many people are
raising the possibility that supply and

438
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:59,330
injection. And somewhere in
the phone call, Mike says,

439
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,400
I don't know how many people are on the
line. Many, many voices on the line.

440
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:05,400
This is an 800 person international
collaboration. Mike says,

441
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:08,680
it's not a blind injection. Someone
else says, sorry, Mike, you know,

442
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,730
can you say that again? And that's when
they started to take it seriously. Um,

443
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,940
which is pretty remarkable,
pretty, pretty fortunate that, uh,

444
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,210
it just shows that quitting and going
home and be a very effective technique.

445
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,320
So here, just to wrap up is another
view of our universe. Again,

446
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:31,080
this is not a cartoon.
This is real data from the Hubble.

447
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:35,610
Everything you're seeing here is,
um, is a, is an entire galaxy.

448
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,480
And again,
we can see a lot in the universe,

449
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:41,970
but we know that all the
light that we receive,

450
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,240
that the constituents of the universe
that are luminous is less than a 5% of

451
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:52,890
what the universe has in it.
Everything else is dark, dark energy,

452
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:54,600
dark matter.
Um,

453
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,460
among that 5% black holes were
actually part of that small 5%,

454
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:03,930
but it just means that the universe is
a vast amount of dark phenomena that we

455
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:08,610
will never see with telescopes that
we hope we could only hope to record,

456
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,610
uh, with something like a
gravitational wave observatory.

457
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,860
So as the universe expands and
eventually it gets darker, um,

458
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,600
the universe will also go quiet.
But in the meantime,

459
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:22,770
what we're really hoping for from these
experiments is that they'll detect

460
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:26,640
things we haven't even thought of before.
Not just black holes colliding,

461
00:28:26,641 --> 00:28:29,970
neutron stars, supernova. These are
all game for the gravitational wave.

462
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:31,590
Observatory is a neutron,

463
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:35,030
stars are stars that didn't quite become
black holes that died and collapsed,

464
00:28:35,031 --> 00:28:36,000
but conformed black holes.

465
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:40,230
We expect to be able to record a whole
range as long as it's kind of cataclysmic,

466
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,090
big astrophysical phenomena.

467
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,720
But I think the real hope is that
we'll detect something we've never even

468
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:48,900
thought of before. Okay. Thank
you. I'd love to take questions

469
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,480
people.

470
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,743
Hi there.

471
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,710
I was curious how you were able to locate
the event in three dimensional space

472
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:05,010
with two and for Rongeurs.
Um, it's not easy. So, uh,

473
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,480
I always liken this to um,

474
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,340
listening for your phone.

475
00:29:10,341 --> 00:29:13,100
If you don't know where your phone is
and it's ringing and you can't see it,

476
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:14,390
it's really hard to find your phone.

477
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,650
So you need two ears for any
kind of location ability. Um,

478
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,630
and to interferometer is helps.
If you only had one,

479
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,000
you would be saying it's
Kinda from over there,

480
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:30,020
like a whole huge patch of the sky.
With two you can do better.

481
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,500
Um,
but it's not great.

482
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,400
And so the future is expecting many
more interferometer as a whole network.

483
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,920
On the earth that there's
going to be an underground, uh,

484
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,740
instrument built in Japan.
There's one in Italy that's almost online.

485
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,230
It's not as sensitive,
but it will really help with location.

486
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,310
There might be one in India, which
is going forward. So, um, so that's,

487
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,330
that's gonna help a lot.

488
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:57,560
Yes. Hi. All right, so many questions.
I don't know where to begin.

489
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,520
Let me ask this one.
Um,

490
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,770
we know electromagnetic radiation
attenuates with distance. Yes.

491
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,540
That's true of
gravitational waves as well.

492
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,470
Yeah. It, um, it gets
quieter with distance.

493
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,390
So the closer you are, the louder
the event would be. Definitely. And,

494
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:18,740
um, also, uh, I should point out
that this was the most energy,

495
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,220
most powerful event we've had since the
big bang that we've detected since the

496
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,180
big bang.
Uh,

497
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,190
the power that came out was many billions
and trillions of times the power that

498
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:32,780
comes out of the Sun and light. Uh, so
this is an incredibly powerful event,

499
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,210
yet it's very quiet.
So if you blew up a nuclear,

500
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,200
a nuclear bomb, you would not be able to
measure the gravitational waves from it.

501
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:43,610
It would be totally insignificant.

502
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,503
Yes.

503
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,300
So you got this event,
uh,

504
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,470
within a few hours of turn
the instrumental on and
now it's been on for half a

505
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,790
year.
Have you gotten many more?

506
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:53,571
Okay,

507
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:58,130
well I have to clarify that I'm totally
theoretical physicist so I don't build

508
00:30:58,131 --> 00:30:58,581
the machine.

509
00:30:58,581 --> 00:31:03,020
And part of what happened
is that I started following
so closely this experiment

510
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:05,060
out of fascination because it was other,

511
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,210
I do a lot of theoretical work about
the colliding black holes in the

512
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:09,044
predictions,

513
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,750
but the idea that anybody would take
it seriously enough to try to build a

514
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:15,410
machine just seemed ridiculous
to me, you know? And um,

515
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,940
and so I am technically
not supposed to be privy

516
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,990
to the t detections.
They did tell me though,

517
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,850
I think I was the only person that was
officially told of the detection before

518
00:31:28,851 --> 00:31:30,650
the formal announcement in February 11th.

519
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,800
And I can tell you that in that
February Lambath announcement,

520
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:36,020
they did talk about another bump,
right?

521
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,210
Another signal that looks like, uh,
sounds like two colliding black holes,

522
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,800
but it was nowhere near loud enough or
significant enough for them to have made

523
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:50,450
a claim of a first detection with
that. Um, it came, it came a later,

524
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,660
but it was significant enough that
it's helping them assess how often this

525
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:58,110
happens.
And um,

526
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,770
and so it looks like there's going
to be a lot of black hole black hole

527
00:32:00,771 --> 00:32:05,240
collisions and the machine is down
right now. It's been down since January.

528
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,330
It was not at advanced capability.
It was at,

529
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,540
it was better than the previous
generations and machines, but that's also,

530
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:15,510
I nobody really expected it to
do anything. Uh, right away it's,

531
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,250
it still needs to become more sensitive
by at least a factor of three or four.

532
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:22,100
So they take it down and they tweak it
and they work on it and they're going to

533
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:25,550
bring it back up probably late
summer. And when we expect, yes,

534
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:30,200
we fully expect maybe monthly we're going
to be hearing things like black hole

535
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:34,190
collisions. We don't know if we're
going to hear anything else. Yes.

536
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,980
Related to the attenuation.
So if

537
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,080
you take a bowl of water and you tap it,

538
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,440
you'll see your waves and they will
still after a little while. So is right.

539
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,920
Is there a analog of
viscosity in space time?

540
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,630
Not really. It's
interesting, nor for light.

541
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,590
So we still receive light from the
big bang that's been traveling too,

542
00:32:55,591 --> 00:33:00,090
as for 13.8 billion years.
It's, it's colder, right?

543
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:02,460
It's redder than when it was created.

544
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:06,600
That has to do with the expansion of the
universe. But light never tires, right?

545
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,890
Light never slows down like what you're
describing and there's no friction.

546
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,580
Okay. And in the same way, there's
really not for gravitational waves.

547
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:19,560
They travel at the speed of light
and they also never tire or,

548
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,160
or slow down. Um, if, uh,

549
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:27,000
it's a way that we say that all particles
that are massless travel at the speed

550
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:30,120
of light. So you know, the wave
particle duality for light waves,

551
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,670
there's a quantum particle
called the photon.

552
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:36,390
And as long as that photon is massless,
it will travel at the speed of light.

553
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,280
If it has any mass, then yes, it will
slow down and stop. And the Graviton,

554
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:43,320
which is the particle,
uh,

555
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,330
analog or the particle compliment to the
gravitational wave is massless as far

556
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:52,890
as we understand. If it does have some
small mass and we're wrong about that,

557
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,670
then maybe they would eventually slow
down and stop and there would not be

558
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:57,690
traveling at the speed of light.

559
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,823
MMM.

560
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,750
Any other questions? Okay, please.

561
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,260
You just a quick phone him
up to a microphone real
quick. Fall into that. Yeah.

562
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,970
We've not detected anything
like I'd grab a time, right?

563
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,650
No, it's way too hard.
So gravity is so weak.

564
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:13,170
We're nowhere near the regime
of probing the quantum scale.

565
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,980
What would the, I mean, we kind
of understand the, you know,

566
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,040
a Photon, you know, how, how waves,
electromagnetic waves and photons

567
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,280
can, can be, you know, convert. Yeah.

568
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,340
Back and forth between each other.
Theoretically.

569
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,580
What would the gravitational waves that
they detected look like for gravitons?

570
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,623
Um,

571
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,620
you mean if we could probe the
quantum level or, yeah, so,

572
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,240
so the light in this room is made up of
so many photons that it's really hard to

573
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:49,900
notice the particulate nature
of it. Um, and similarly,

574
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:53,350
the gravitational waves are made up of
so many gravitons that it's impossible to

575
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:55,090
notice.
The particulate nature of it.

576
00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:00,070
We haven't really very well thought of
an experiment where we could do that.

577
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,300
And probably the energy scale you'd
have to get to is something like,

578
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,620
uh,
um,

579
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,660
let's see a million times the
large hadron collider energy,

580
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,640
something like that. So it's, it, it's
not an ambition of the near future.

581
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:22,150
I mean this was pretty crazy, but
that would be really crazy. Yes.

582
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,710
Ah, so it sounded like, I'm not
sure if I understood correctly,

583
00:35:26,711 --> 00:35:30,670
but part of the reason your software
was able to detect this event and notify

584
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:32,620
you guys cause you kind of knew
what you were listening for,

585
00:35:32,621 --> 00:35:34,360
you kind of had a prediction
for what it would sound like.

586
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,970
Yeah, correct. Well, that
is correct. A lot of,

587
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,800
one of the difficulties in
this experiment is that, uh,

588
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:44,340
the sound will often be quieter
than the noise. And so, um,

589
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,510
they'll have to sometimes
run the predictions, uh,

590
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,680
especially the numerical ones in through
the data and filter it that way and

591
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:55,550
pluck it out. But this one
was so loud, it's just you.

592
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,530
It's just right above the noise.
It's actually really loud.

593
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,860
So it's not as reliant on that as,
uh,

594
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,200
as we fully expected things to be.

595
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,240
So is it that you guys are actually just
writing straight up anomaly detection

596
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:10,090
and that's what you want to use to like
possibly detect other events in the

597
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:11,650
future? Yeah, there's, there's,

598
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,560
there's three or four different
teams within the collaboration that,

599
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:17,800
that use different models to pluck
out different kinds of signals,

600
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:18,930
summer bursts signals.

601
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,660
Some are these what we call compact
binary coalescence things like black holes

602
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:25,990
and neutron stars and
white dwarves. Um, and uh,

603
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,350
and some stochastic which
just, you know, noisier.

604
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,870
So there's all of these different
algorithms that people, right.

605
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:35,200
But I don't think anyone expected
the first signal we detect to be just

606
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:39,880
noticeably loud. Yeah,
sure. It was just fast.

607
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:43,840
If it had been slower, um, I think they
would have heard it in the control room.

608
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,150
It was that loud.

609
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,710
What is the range of events that you
expect to be able to detect with Lego?

610
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,940
I understand their potential.

611
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:54,030
He's like solar system scale and
barometers for rejecting more,

612
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:59,180
less energetic events are more energetic
events. Right? So the, the scale,

613
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,800
so it happens at Ligo is sensitive
to the human auditory range.

614
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,790
And that's just strange coincidence.

615
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,490
But these black holes about this size,

616
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,720
that's the natural frequency at which
they would emit gravitational waves.

617
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,310
But I think when they designed
the instrument, you know,

618
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:20,420
this has been going on for 50 years. They
were looking for Supernova. They were,

619
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:23,000
they were hoping to hear things like that.
So,

620
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:27,170
so it turns out that the Supernova might
be too quiet or too difficult and that

621
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:31,580
these are much more uh,
populous. And so, um,

622
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,510
but yes, if you send something
in space and there is a project,

623
00:37:34,511 --> 00:37:37,220
it's done something into space,
millions of kilometers apart,

624
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,200
they would be way outside of the human
auditory range, way lower in frequency.

625
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,890
And they would be detecting things
like supermassive black holes colliding

626
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,000
bigger things and lower frequency stuff.
Yes.

627
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,370
Hi. I've had to have been to the
climbing black holes for them to kill us.

628
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:00,520
MMM. MMM. That's an
interesting question. Um,

629
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,650
it would be pretty hard to kill us with
gravitational waves. There are so weak,

630
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,260
it would be really hard like,
um,

631
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,960
to be squeezed and stretched like

632
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,700
you can you with your bare hands,
you could squeeze in,

633
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:19,350
stretch me billions of trillions of times
harder than a gravitational wave could.

634
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,820
So, um, I think, uh, it,

635
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,490
I'd be much more worried just about
being near the black holes generally.

636
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,600
So I'm, but black holes aren't really
the engines of destruction that they were

637
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:34,350
portrayed to be. A first son was
replaced with a black hole tomorrow. Uh,

638
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,740
we wouldn't sucked in
like a vacuum cleaner.

639
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:39,160
It would suck us in where we
would actually orbit just fine.

640
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:42,250
The orbit would be exactly the same.
It would be totally fine. I mean,

641
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:44,140
we'd be dead because it
would be cold and dark,

642
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,640
but we wouldn't fall in and we were
actually very slowly falling into a black

643
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:54,220
hole. Now there's a supermassive black
hole at the center of our galaxy 4 million

644
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:57,190
times the mass of the sun. And we are
in fact falling into that black hole.

645
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,390
It's going to take a very long time.
Very long time.

646
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:04,980
I really am worried about other things.
Yeah.

647
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,670
If you had an infinitely
sensitive detector,

648
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,920
where would you see
gravitational waves from?

649
00:39:09,921 --> 00:39:11,660
Would it be from everything or is it just

650
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,170
everything? I would make
gravitational waves right now. Um,

651
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,250
infinitely sensitive
detector would, um, would,

652
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,880
would pick up gravitational waves from
all of us moving around and you'll be

653
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,090
moving.
You have to be moving.

654
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:29,560
So a black hole just sitting there is
not going to create gravitational waves.

655
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,920
And it's just a funny thing that if,
uh,

656
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,610
if like a star exploded perfectly
symmetrically in all directions,

657
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:38,680
it actually would not
create gravitational waves.

658
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,000
So you need a what's called a quadripolar
or a certain kind of asymmetry and

659
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:47,680
accelerations of masses. Yeah. But I'm,
I'm, I'm not spherically symmetric,

660
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,170
so I am making gravitational waves

661
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,990
above the one that I've been did.
They did,

662
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,150
I'm curious about what we knew about them,
their relative size,

663
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,710
the black holes. You mean
the one that we have? Yeah,

664
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,560
some what,
what can we knew about them?

665
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,210
Yeah,
it's pretty amazing.

666
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:12,010
So the details that we seem to be able
to extract as one was about 29 times the

667
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:15,860
mass of the sun to begin
with. One was over 30. Um,

668
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,400
by the time they collided,
they made a black hole,

669
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:21,280
maybe about 62 times the mass of the sun,

670
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,580
which means some of the energy that we
call e equals MC squared energy was he

671
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:28,480
admitted in the gravitational waves,

672
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:31,900
a few percent of the energy was
admitted in the gravitational waves.

673
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:36,070
And that's a tremendous amount of energy.
That's just a huge amount of energy.

674
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,720
Um, and that black hole is
out there right now spinning.

675
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,480
They think they know it's
spinning very rapidly,

676
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:47,860
probably hundreds of times a second.
We saw the last four orbits or sell.

677
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,600
So, but that we know the
location. Now, this black hole,

678
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,230
not very well, not very well.
It came from the southern sky.

679
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,730
Somewhere over there, they have
a map, a kind of splotchy map.

680
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:05,050
It sort of came from over there. It's 1.3
billion years away, right? To find it.

681
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,500
Um,

682
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,260
they can't find it anymore because
a telescope can't see a dark object.

683
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:16,290
And so what they could try to do is
pinpoint the galaxy that it lives in Egypt

684
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,190
and then that would tell it,
uh,

685
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,400
how something about the galaxy might
tell us something about the black holes.

686
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,270
Very surprised that they were that big.
That was something that surprised people.

687
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:29,230
I wasn't particularly surprised.
I work on this a lot and I, uh,

688
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,680
I never been had a prejudice
against big black holes,

689
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,880
but a lot of people did. They just thought
it will be hard to make them, but we,

690
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:40,730
the details of how to make black holes,
it's so hard.

691
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:44,430
I always thought we're probably not
write about a lot of that stuff. Um,

692
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,840
so this was real astronomical
information from the first detection.

693
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:51,680
It wasn't just we recorded
gravitational waves. It was,

694
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:56,681
we've discovered the first black hole
system and we've had discovered the first

695
00:41:56,841 --> 00:42:00,910
collision of black holes and we know
things that we didn't know before. Cool.

696
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:06,110
Yeah, it's very cool. They're
very lucky. Very lucky. Yes.

697
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,730
What other

698
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,440
like gravitational wave detection
systems are coming online soon?

699
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,830
Yeah. So, um, there is this
one called [inaudible],

700
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,460
which is going to be underground and
that helps isolate at seismically. So,

701
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:22,590
so that will be helpful at some level.

702
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,310
The experiments are limited just by
quantum noise that there's nothing you can

703
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,830
do about quantum mechanics.
You know, quantum fluctuations,

704
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:31,640
if you've heard about tides
and bourbon certainty,

705
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:33,930
prince will makes it impossible at some,

706
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,830
in some regime they're working
on suppressing quantum effects,

707
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:41,370
but eventually they'll hit some
fundamental physical limit where,

708
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,050
where the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
says you can never precisely locate

709
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:51,180
an object on, they'll be up against that
limit with the mirrors. Right? It's just,

710
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:56,430
it doesn't exist in a precise enough the
location anymore. Um, technically. So,

711
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,320
um, but cargo will help with seismic
stuff. And so there is Virgo,

712
00:43:01,321 --> 00:43:05,270
which is in Italy, which will hopefully
come online this summer as well. Um,

713
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:09,070
and then I mentioned the one in
India and, uh, there's Geo, um,

714
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:13,710
and I can't remember all of the others
right now. Tama I think is offline now,

715
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:18,540
but there's a whole network of
them eventually in space. Um,

716
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,180
that would be very exciting. Do you
mean just gravitational wave by the way?

717
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,740
Or any gravity experiments? Yeah, so,

718
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:30,570
so these are the ones, they're all of
the lego variety except the space born,

719
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,320
uh, Lisa, which would
put three spacecraft, uh,

720
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,380
disconnected millions of
kilometers apart from each other,

721
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,440
freely floating in space for
gravitational waves passes.

722
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:43,470
They all just Bob and they keep
track of each other with a laser to,

723
00:43:43,471 --> 00:43:45,360
it's a really clever experiment.

724
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,610
There are some people who are
trying different ideas. Again,

725
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:50,970
going back to atomic clocks and
timing experiments, but I, you know,

726
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:51,781
they're are very new,

727
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:56,730
so it would be interesting to see if
anyone makes progress with that. Um,

728
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,080
we, uh, I put the clock at if
we're counting down to one,

729
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:04,290
but I think we could take one more
question if, if somebody wanted to. Yeah.

730
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:07,500
Or two more.
Yes.

731
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,180
So it's thinking about you, the earlier
question about the gravity waves.

732
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:16,580
So they were formed by the black holes.
They came by, they'd already tucked did.

733
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:19,670
And as they spread out,
they get weaker and weaker,

734
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:23,240
but so they don't really dissipate
because there's no friction.

735
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:26,210
So what happens to them?
They just keep going on.

736
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:31,020
Well, just imagine a light bulb, um,
up close is very bright and far away,

737
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,003
very dim,

738
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,470
and it's just cause you're
really intercepting less of
it to some extent, right?

739
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:37,980
And you're up close, you're
intercepting a whole lot of the light,

740
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:40,110
but it's very far away.
You're getting very little of it.

741
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:44,580
The rest went to other planets in
other galaxies and, and uh, you know,

742
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,710
the farther out it spreads,

743
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,520
the less any small patch
of sky is going to get.

744
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,960
Just like a light bulb

745
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,470
if they would ultimately
just keep going forever.

746
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,440
Yeah. Okay. And if the universe is
finite, they'll come back again.

747
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:03,950
Eventually we'll wrap around and
then they'll come back again.

748
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,840
We'll hear it a second time.
Even quieter.

749
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,320
The picture of the,
um, the wave showed up.

750
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,880
Vertical Axis frequency oscillating
around 20 hertz, I noticed. Yeah,

751
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,720
last 0.4 seconds.
Yeah.

752
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,420
Surely the two objects were actually
orbiting much faster than that. Right.

753
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,490
So how does that relate
to their actual orbital?

754
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:25,340
Um, it actually 20 hertz. Uh,

755
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:26,751
it also,

756
00:45:26,751 --> 00:45:31,751
so the gravitational wave is
directly related to the orbital rate.

757
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:36,860
Um, uh, so if you think about that,

758
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:41,230
that's extremely fast,
right? 20 Hertz, um,

759
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:45,020
is really fast because you're talking
about something 200 kilometers,

760
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:50,510
traveling several hundred
kilometers and doing that orbit,

761
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,040
uh, many times a second. So it's
actually incredibly fast. Okay.

762
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:55,910
Um,

763
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:59,240
and so you are going near the speed of
light to be able to hit that frequency.

764
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,340
And that's how, uh, there was a previous
question about what sets the frequency.

765
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:05,750
That's sort of one way to think about it,
you know,

766
00:46:05,751 --> 00:46:10,130
how far is it going in an
orbit and how fast is it going?

767
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,400
And that will set the frequency. Um, it's,

768
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:16,370
the gravitational wave is twice the
orbital frequency is their relationship.

769
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,570
Um, I think that's it. Thank you.

770
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,440
Thanks for.
