00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,300
Hi Chris. So much guys for
taking the time to be here. I'm,

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,910
I'm delighted to be here.
But more importantly,

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,480
I hopefully I will impact at least
one person here, IDD, all of you.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,170
But I would like to impact one person
at least. So the, when you leave here,

5
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:22,770
you go out with a better mindset and a
better attitude towards life and also

6
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:26,110
towards your career. Does
that sound good? Wonderful.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,030
So I'm just going to tell you a little
bit about me and then I got to tell you

8
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:33,000
where I was and how I
bridge the gap in between.

9
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,300
Because all of us want to
get somewhere in our lives,

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,990
whether that be in our personalized or
whether it be in business or a career,

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,660
but sometimes we just
don't know how to do that.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,420
So I'm all about the how
because at one point in my life,

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,700
I didn't have the house
I just had. Oh, ish.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,150
So I'm just going to show you a little
bit about my life at the moment.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,270
And this is my little
boy. Um, I Christmas,

16
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,100
this is how we agree
while scared his presence.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,760
And I just love doing anything to do
with adrenaline. But on the flip side,

18
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:03,810
I love doing art. Um, I love
media stuff. Anything really,

19
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,300
the kind of gives me a little bit of a
boss or a feeling of purpose for life. Um,

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,800
that's me. At one point
in my life, this was me,

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,040
so I was literally half
the weight I am now.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,490
And so if you imagine if he split me
down in the middle and what you get,

23
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:22,470
I know the tied to belief, but that
was, uh, I know it's horrible. Um,

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,920
but this basically it was this a physical
representation of [inaudible] need and

25
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:33,510
a response to my environment.
That's all it was. Can
everybody see here? Yeah. Okay.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,950
So that's what it was. And sometimes, you
know, I know this is physical graphics,

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,000
graphic representation, um, and
not all of us go in that route,

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,780
but our responses or behaviors
can be as destructive.

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,250
It could be anything from procrastination
to alcohol abuse, drug abuse, um,

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,830
being shy,
not putting yourself forward.

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,780
All those kinds of things are just
results of unmet needs and our reaction to

32
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:01,950
our environment. Because would you
agree? Have you ever met a negative baby?

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,440
No. Have you ever met, you know when
people say, Oh, I'm just a worrier.

34
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,530
Have you ever met a worry or a baby
or an anxious baby or a baby who is?

35
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:18,480
I'm just one of those pessimistic people,
never,

36
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,740
so we're born happy and successful. We're
just conditioned over time not to be,

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,910
and I'm going to show you proof of that
and how you can actually rise above that

38
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:30,390
conditioning and become the best versions
of yourself because that's what I

39
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,530
wanted. What I want here for you today is
to become a better version of yourself.

40
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,110
It's not up to me to decide what
it is you want in your life,

41
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,030
but I'm going to help you to get there.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,480
This is what I want you to understand.
Life happens.

43
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,930
Every single person here has had an event
in their life that they haven't liked.

44
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,620
Some small events, some big events,
but you can't really compare a pain.

45
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:54,420
You can't really compare events as such,

46
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,160
but everybody has had some kind of thing
in life that has halted them to stop

47
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,620
them becoming the person that they're
really two are truly capable of the

48
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:04,420
calming and reaching your full potential.

49
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,140
And I'm going to tell you this
actually happened to me more than once.

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,580
And it's good to know that
because sometimes when you
become successful and by

51
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,560
successful,
I mean being the best you can be.

52
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,560
Sometimes when you become successful
you think you've made it and all of a

53
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,430
sudden you're flung back to the way
you were. So people often ask me,

54
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:25,270
why is it that I put my body like that?
It's not out of vanity.

55
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,730
That is not attractive,
which you all agree.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,630
I put myself like that because when I was
seven I was raped and they didn't know

57
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:36,160
what to do with it. So I kept it in my
mind and that was the results of it. Okay,

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,230
you're going to flip from that image
because it's not very nice to look at. Um,

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,390
but that was the result of it.

60
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,880
I didn't know how my life just
went totally out of control.

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,040
So because I couldn't control it,

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,610
I came upon this thing called getting
the numbers down on the scale and that

63
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:52,960
happened to be at my felt in control of
my life. Control is a normal human need.

64
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,370
If it's torn off balance,

65
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:58,000
we do everything that we can to get
it met and we've lots of other needs.

66
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,850
And if we can't,
we go for the second best alternative.

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,990
And that's why we all go for second best
alternatives when our needs aren't met.

68
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,380
So eventually I did get better.

69
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,160
And the only reason I'm telling you my
story is not to impress you or to show

70
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,700
you where I am today is to impress upon
you that no matter where you are or what

71
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:18,760
you're doing, you can get what
you want with the right mindset,

72
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,140
the right skills in the right attitude,

73
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,660
skills and strategies that
can be learned for easily.

74
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,720
It's your attitude and your mindset
that actually predict her well.

75
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:26,554
You use those skills.

76
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,870
So when I got better and I
genuinely was better, I was healthy.

77
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,010
I was a leaving cert. I had a
boyfriend, I thought I had it made.

78
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,390
And relative leaving Cert,
I've gone out,

79
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,990
I was Mitch and skill to jumping
off the period you're in school.

80
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:43,780
And it was just, I really, really
was healthy and productive.

81
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,880
I got into first year in college,

82
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,720
it took a lot cause it was psychology
was very competitive, believe it or not.

83
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,410
And I thought I had it made.
Um,

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,170
and then in 1998 I had a car
accident and I hit my head, um,

85
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,840
during the [inaudible] I hit it here
on the side and my temporal lobe.

86
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,590
And about two weeks later I started
to experience kind of funny symptoms.

87
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:09,790
I was losing track of time. I
just wasn't myself. Um, you know,

88
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:14,350
and it was also hearing kind of mumbles
in my, in my mind. So I said to my mom,

89
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,230
I know there's nothing
psychologically wrong with me,

90
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,280
but there's something not right. She
said, yeah, I agree. So go to the doctor.

91
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:24,460
So I went to the doctor and the doctor
said to me, take antidepressants.

92
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,200
And I said,
suppose I'm not depressed.

93
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,250
And I genuinely wasn't cause I had
overcome all that stuff and but they said,

94
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:31,270
well take them.
Anyway,

95
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,680
the automatically jumped to the conclusion
that it was because of my earlier

96
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,550
years where I guess I was feeling low.
Um, so I talked the antidepressants.

97
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:40,450
Long story short,

98
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,040
I ended up in a psychiatric unit two
weeks later on 24 hour supervision,

99
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,090
which means if I walk over here,
I have the human shadow.

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,780
If I go to the bathroom, if I have a
shower, if somebody caught so many,

101
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:56,770
literally following me, they told
my parents that I had schizophrenia.

102
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,240
I to go on the medication,

103
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,680
highest office as quickly as possible
and to be committed on 24 hour

104
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,130
supervision. Both I and my parents,
new words in her schizophrenia.

105
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:11,420
But at the time my parents had used up
the insurance from my earlier years so

106
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,171
they couldn't use that.

107
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,590
You can't use the same insurance
on the same illnesses such, um,

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,850
so they didn't have the insurance
to cover my hospitals today. Um,

109
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,810
and are different to get a second opinion.
So I was there on in three months,

110
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,610
I was on 14 different medications.

111
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,560
You know when you see that person in like
say Phoenix Park or on Grafton Street,

112
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,590
Henry Street, and they're like this
and they're dribbling in the gut,

113
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:37,940
Crohn's under a tarp and stuff. I know
it's hard to believe that that was me.

114
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,950
So never judge a book by its cover.
I had,

115
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:44,951
my face was all puffy and I dribbled
with 14 different medications and

116
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:48,830
eventually my parents said, look, this
is, it's just not, not on, it's not right.

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,370
And they asked for a second opinion,
they pulled a few strings,

118
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,870
they're very good friends with a doctor.

119
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,520
They pulled a few strings and they got
me into another hospital and the doctor,

120
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,310
Pi, God, the doctor that I
was under, he says, look,

121
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,040
I'm going to talk to different
people are senior. And he did.

122
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,130
He asked my parents different questions,
um,

123
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,460
and he looked at my file and my dad said,

124
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,440
can you tell me this before the accident,
Donna was absolutely fine.

125
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,830
And after the accident, she's not
normal. It's the way he put it.

126
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,090
Can you not like accident shortly as
something to do with it. And they said,

127
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,070
what accident?
It wasn't in my file.

128
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,630
The scan that was taking of my brain
had shorter left him or left or my left

129
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:31,130
temporal lobe,
a Hematoma,

130
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:34,250
which is bruising of the brain
that also wasn't in my file.

131
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,410
So on paper it looked like
it's something very different.

132
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,850
So I spent another three
months in a psychiatric unit
because to take me off all

133
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:41,990
the other junk that I was put on.

134
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,860
So it got to a point in my life where the
first time when I had really difficult

135
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:49,460
times,
I was given a week to live.

136
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,340
So as that rock bottom and I had
to learn to build myself up again,

137
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,460
gratitude helped me to get that.
Believe it or not,

138
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,100
I started to have to think
about what is it that I do have,

139
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:58,940
not what I don't have.

140
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,110
But the second time round when I was in
the psychiatric hospital and the doctor

141
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:06,700
said, I have epilepsy, I said I
don't have epilepsy. And I was sick.

142
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,510
People telling me what I have and
I'm, I'm quite stubborn. I said,

143
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,810
I don't have epilepsy,
just give me proof that I have it.

144
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,770
So he sent down to the hospital
library and they bought,

145
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,680
brought up documents but this tick and I
sat in the bed and honestly I cried for

146
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:22,190
about an hour and it was just
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

147
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,380
All the symptoms that I was experiencing,
I had.

148
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,340
So the automatically jump to conclusion
that it was psychiatric when in actual

149
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,390
fact the head injury caused in your
logical disturbance in my body.

150
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,170
And I have epilepsy and I,
I still have epilepsy. Um,

151
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,150
so I had to build my life up from
where I was to where I am today.

152
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,350
Um, and thankfully I've learned
after different strategies,

153
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:48,290
I learned and worked with lots of
different people that you consider very

154
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:52,340
successful. I'm at 23. I
opened up my first company, um,

155
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,380
and in the first year of turned over
a million euro. Now you might think,

156
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,370
why am I even telling you that?
It's just to show you that,

157
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,420
that you can go from absolute disaster
to being happy and genuinely confidence.

158
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,790
And that's what I'm
going to show you today.

159
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,030
There's a difference between
being cocky and confidence.

160
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,290
If you want to be cocky or you want to
have the cello confidence just becoming

161
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,900
good actor, it's very easy to do. Um,

162
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,600
but if you wanted to have a genuine sense
of confidence where you don't have to

163
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:22,020
shout about it so much, you can just
be confident and feel good in yourself.

164
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,570
When you wake up in the morning
with a genuine smile on your face.

165
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,100
That's what I want you to have.
Would you like to have that? Okay,

166
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,880
so this is about, you got to decide.
You've got to look at your mind.

167
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,140
I'm going to show you how it works.

168
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,630
And then you've got to decide
whether you need to change your mind,

169
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,580
which is what I had to do.

170
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,270
And this is a question
you need to ask yourself.

171
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,460
Are you becoming a victim or a victor?

172
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,380
Everything happens to everybody in life,
different things.

173
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,120
But at the end of the day,
stuff happens to us.

174
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:54,540
It doesn't have to be majorly
traumatic or anything. Stuff happens.

175
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,690
But if you want to get to where you
wanted to get, you need to decide.

176
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,050
Are you going to become a victim
of your circumstance or a victor?

177
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,870
You may not know how to get
what it is that you want,

178
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,480
but the how was just a
strategy that can be learned.

179
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,120
You've got to make the decision
for us to become a victor,

180
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,570
so which are we going to be in the room?
Victories or victims?

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,270
Hands off. Anyone who would like to
be a victim. Look around the room

182
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,070
admittedly are some of you, you don't
have to put up your hands. Admittedly,

183
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:25,740
as some of you are looking or
feeling like a bit of a victim,

184
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,610
blaming the world for your problems.
If only they would do this,

185
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:33,060
then I could do this. If only I
were came from a better background,

186
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:36,330
I could achieve more. If only you had
better brains are more intelligence,

187
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,250
I would be better or whatever.

188
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,480
We're constantly doing comparisons because
we are a society of comparisons in my

189
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,290
opinion,

190
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,070
so it's so important that you literally
take ownership of your own life and your

191
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:50,820
own choices. No matter what background
you have, no matter where you came from,

192
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:54,660
who you know or watch your
current circumstances is
if you want to improve and

193
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:57,720
get to where you want to get to,
that's what you need to decide.

194
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,240
And if all decided here today that
you're going to be victorious.

195
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,950
So here's what you got to do.
You've got to decide and on your own life,

196
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,160
and I put business up there simply,
you can refer to your career or if you,

197
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:11,370
if you have a business or whatever,
you need to choose a new focus.

198
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,330
So when I was sitting on my bed and
I was crying and I thought, okay,

199
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:18,060
I've got to do something here,
I didn't want to get back to baseline.

200
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,300
I want to go more than that
because I thought, I'm not
going back to where I was,

201
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,980
but I knew how to get there from
the first set of events. Let's see.

202
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,110
But I guess it was harder the second time
because when you're knocked back once

203
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:32,930
and twice and you're kind of think,
well,

204
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,030
maybe it'll happen again or something will
happen again. It's a natural question.

205
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,400
And,
but I had to decide that's liberty.

206
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:43,401
I had to get stopped with myself and I
have to say quit the crap and really just

207
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,370
own your own life and become responsible
for your own life and become greater

208
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,560
than your problems.
This is what y'all want you to understand.

209
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,860
You are not your problem. If you
make your story, your identity,

210
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,960
you will never do anything
worthwhile in your life. Effort,

211
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,430
not to the full extent that you can really
achieve what it is that you want to.

212
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,370
So decide what you do want. Most people
look at what they don't want. Well,

213
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,970
I don't want to be sad anymore or
I don't want to be shy anymore.

214
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,540
Don't want to be anxious anymore. I
don't want to be this, that or the other.

215
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,060
If you want to get what
it is that you want,

216
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:20,410
you've got to decide with clarity what
it is that you want. You're all Googlers.

217
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,050
If you decide you want to
search something in Google,

218
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,890
do you put in something that you don't
want? That's kind of Dolton, isn't it?

219
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,340
So you've got to put in
exactly what you want.

220
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:33,490
So you've got to tell yourself what you
want. Put yourself in a strong state.

221
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:36,280
Look at the resources around you.
You have so many resources.

222
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,510
What can you use no matter how small
to get you to where you want to get to.

223
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,140
I create a why I put
that back there as well.

224
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,530
If you've got to Hawaii to do something,
you will do anything.

225
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,090
How many people here admittedly get in
better shape when they have a holiday or

226
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:56,170
a wedding coming up? They go, well I'm
not going to sit in the back on the beach.

227
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,981
Look and like you know,

228
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:00,040
everybody else is there out there with
their beach buddies and it gives you a

229
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,650
motivation to do it.
Admittedly are a wee bit like that.

230
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,140
And if we want to give up cigarettes,
we have to put up a why behind it.

231
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,430
So when you get to Hawaii,

232
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:12,130
when you get a bit of an engine
behind what it is that you want to do,

233
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,700
you'll be able to do it a lot easier.
So look at what it is that you want to do.

234
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,720
If it can identify it. If not just play
around with what you might like to do.

235
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,220
I put a why behind it, so I had to
get a Hawaii behind getting better.

236
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,260
My why was, I was sick of seeing my
parents cry honestly, and then I thought,

237
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:31,930
I'm going to be stubborn. I'm going
to get what it is that I want to get,

238
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,560
but I've got to get my white and that
was my initial way to get an initial why

239
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:39,970
and then build it up.
This is what you've got to decide to.

240
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,280
Are you going to be
interested or committed?

241
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,010
How many people here turned
on the computer this morning?

242
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,770
Where your you interested in doing
this or were you committed to doing it?

243
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,780
Try and put your hand up.
Please

244
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,620
try and put your hat time.
Put your right hand up then.

245
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,590
Okay. Just try and put your
right hand off. I'm not,

246
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:09,950
I'm not asking you what your interests
are committed. Just put your time.

247
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,260
Put your right hand off.
Okay.

248
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,250
I said try. I didn't say put it up. Okay.

249
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,350
Most people will put it up. Try and
doing are two totally different things.

250
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,660
If you want to get a result,
you've got to commit to it.

251
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,250
You don't have to be interested.

252
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,210
I think it into my car and got one
so interested in driving. Yeah,

253
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:31,530
maybe I'll do it.
Maybe I won't.

254
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,160
Or I say put the key in and just put
my foot on the accelerator. Then you,

255
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,250
then you get somewhere,
so you have to become not interested.

256
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:42,420
You need to become committed to what
you're doing. Remember these three ps?

257
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,600
I don't know how well they're highlighted
here. Plan, prepare and proceed.

258
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,820
Google maps. If you want to
get somewhere, you need to,

259
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,590
first of all, you need to type it in.
You need to decide if to size for you,

260
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,440
which is the best route to get
there. That's smart, isn't it?

261
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,310
If you don't decide where you want to go,
you'll end up either.

262
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:02,990
Nowhere are so many you don't want to be,

263
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,020
so identify the best route to get there.

264
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,600
Look at the skills and
the support that you need.

265
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,590
Now imagine like driving a car.
If I'm driving a car,

266
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,360
I've got certain boundaries in the car,

267
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,920
I need to make sure that I've got things
with me in case I break down or I've

268
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:22,010
got some resources or I've got some kind
of maybe telephone numbers that I can

269
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,580
ring in case I break down or a case I
hit it hit an obstacle. That's smart,

270
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:28,700
isn't it?
Most people don't put those in the lives.

271
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,350
Most people do not prepare for. If
something happens, what will I do?

272
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,500
So for example,
let's say I meet an event in my life,

273
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,890
which is very likely where my life goes
totally out of control for whatever

274
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:41,570
reason or perceive it to be that way.

275
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,490
Do you think I could go back
to the way I was? Absolutely.

276
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,270
I could. Do you think I will? No Way.

277
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,600
And the reason I won't is because
first of all, I've chosen not to.

278
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,710
I've committed not to,

279
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,730
but most importantly I've strategies
in place that if I feel like that way,

280
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,720
if I feel vulnerable,

281
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,940
I know exactly what to do to
prevent me from going back there.

282
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,070
So this is why you've
got to have strategies.

283
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:08,990
And skills in place to get you to
where you want to go. Focus forward.

284
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:13,880
If you're driving a car, do most of your
drive here, okay? If you don't drive,

285
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,710
you been in the car with
somebody who does drive.

286
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,720
If they drove looking in their rear view
mirror, what would you think of them?

287
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,870
Let's drive. What would
you think? They're insane,

288
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,450
right?
So you'd want them to focus forward.

289
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,520
Most people in the lies focused backwards.

290
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,030
They're constantly looking in the rear
view mirror where I do, I want to do this,

291
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,790
but this happened before I
wanted to do this, but you know,

292
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,650
it didn't work out the last
time or whatever. Focus
forward on what you do want.

293
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,560
If you meet obstacles along the
way, so [inaudible], that's life.

294
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,500
You just learn how to overcome them.
If you need help to overcome them,

295
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:51,620
you get that head to overcome them.
But everyone has those obstacles.

296
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:54,080
But as long as you're focusing
forward in the right direction,

297
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,740
you have a good chance of getting to
where you want to go. I have done here,

298
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,730
choose your team. Most people in
their lives do not choose their team.

299
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,200
Imagine if you're in a car and you've
got a bunch of people and one is shouting

300
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:08,930
at you from the back.
One is firing papers at you.

301
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,870
One is putting the hands of your eyes.
What would you say to them?

302
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,230
Stop or get out of the car.
So imagine that your life is like a car.

303
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,630
You either have to tell people to stop
or remove them. It don't mean kill them.

304
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,670
I mean just not delete
them. Just a disclaimer,

305
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,500
but just maybe to step aside from them
or limit your time with them if people

306
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:38,360
aren't in line with or matching
what it is that you want to do. Now,

307
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,610
here's the thing.
Everybody has a family.

308
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,220
So some of us have bigger families than
others and I have what you might call

309
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,380
liquids, Arthur or
thoughts, all sorts. Um,

310
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,410
they're not all pro my goals. Some
of them think they're mass. Um,

311
00:17:56,411 --> 00:18:00,660
some of them are very straight forward.
Some of them are very eh straight.

312
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,990
Some of them are very
hippie like or whatever.

313
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,070
But I've got to choose who I
need to have in my life. Family,

314
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:09,720
you can't really get rid off such as,

315
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:14,190
limit your time with the ones
that you don't enjoy with towards.

316
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,940
He blame me. Um, but choose
who you want to be around.

317
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,570
But that's not a snobbery thing at
the end of the day, and it, there's a,

318
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:23,700
there's a phrase which I
think is a wonderful phrase.

319
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,060
If you're in a plane and the
pressure drops, what do you do?

320
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,240
Put on your own air mask first.
If you're not looking after yourself,

321
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,580
you can't look after other people.

322
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,870
Everyone has their own individuals lives
to lead and they are responsible for

323
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:43,410
their own lives.
So stop being responsible for their lives.

324
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Be responsible for your own on your own
life and make sure that who you surround

325
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:51,750
yourself with are people who actually
are going to help you get to where you

326
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:56,340
want to get to. Find an expert.
This is something that I had to do.

327
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,410
I had to find experts because they didn't
want to kind of do it the slow route.

328
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:05,100
Again, I wanted to get to where I
wanted to get to, but I didn't know how,

329
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:05,934
as I said,

330
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,060
so I had to find people who had what
I wanted regardless of circumstance.

331
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,271
So I thought,

332
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:17,271
what if I could find people that had
been through Robert Circumstances but had

333
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:24,471
become successful despite them and I
figured if I modeled their results or if I

334
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:29,190
model their strategies,
I should come up with similar results.

335
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,180
That's the be correct.
If I want to be a good chef,

336
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,030
would I find a mediocre chef or what I
find the best if I want to become really

337
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:42,900
good at it, you find the best.
So if you want to do something,

338
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:46,290
you've got to find the best at
it and model their strategies.

339
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,620
So learn from experts.
When I learned to drive,

340
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,620
I made sure I learned from
somebody who knew how to drive.

341
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,640
It wouldn't be very smart order to learn
to drive from somebody who hadn't a

342
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,920
clue what they were doing.
No,

343
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,340
but most people learn from people who
haven't a clue what they're doing.

344
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,110
Believe it or not.
In my industry.

345
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:08,850
There are a lot of people teaching or
explaining and they actually don't have

346
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:11,820
the results that they're talking about.
You will be shocked.

347
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,990
There are so many experts teaching
stuff and they don't have the results,

348
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,930
so for me,
it's more important to find somebody.

349
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:21,960
I don't care what education somebody has,
I don't care where they're from,

350
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:25,230
who they know. As long as they've
got the results that I can follow.

351
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,140
That's what I'm interested in
and everyone knows one of those.

352
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,180
You may not know them personally if you
don't find them and model exactly what

353
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:37,770
they do. You do not need to have
all the answers. Nobody does.

354
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,830
Even if they say, everybody says,
Oh, I know it all in their minds, no,

355
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,540
you don't throw any Noel's here.
Everyone's going, yeah, he is. Yeah,

356
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:49,090
she is, but the fact is nobody knows
everything. I'm still learning.

357
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,260
Everybody is still learning

358
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,000
and practice your actions.

359
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,790
There is no point
thinking about something.

360
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,000
You've got to do this and you got
to practice it and practice it.

361
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,850
Remember when you first got your
computer and you learn to use this,

362
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,800
are you better now than you were
at the beginning? Of course,

363
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,470
some people don't know.

364
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,560
Think of that image council workers.

365
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,390
I hope nobody here is a council worker
Prac time, but in the event that you are,

366
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,250
there's no point staring into a whole,

367
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,970
staring into a mess and looking at it
and have when all your other people that

368
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:27,270
you don't want in your life join,
you were looking at and say, Oh God,

369
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:29,770
that's such a mess. That's
such a mass. Or what do we do?

370
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,480
Let's all join in and talk about it.

371
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,510
Let's talk about people
who were also there before.

372
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,460
You know that doesn't get you anywhere.
Your brain is their most valuable asset.

373
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,820
People learn strategies all
of the time sort of way,

374
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,100
but unless you have your brain behind it,
your engine behind it,

375
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,220
it is like turning on a
computer with no power.

376
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,320
You don't get results. You have
to have your mindset, right first.

377
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:00,610
Mindset equals money set
mindset equals blank set.

378
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,450
Everything you do is based on your
mindset. Do you perform better?

379
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:07,900
If you're feeling better,
if you've had a really,

380
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:10,960
really crappy evening and you're coming
to work and you just don't want to talk

381
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:15,940
to anybody, nobody does that
today. Everyone has those days.

382
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,970
So you've got to put power
behind what it is that you want.

383
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,470
And I'm going to show you this
using an analogy of a computer.

384
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,640
You can all relate to this right now,
if I pick up my phone

385
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,690
and I have here on my phone,

386
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:34,480
I said I actually called my phone
because my son likes to get us.

387
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,410
If you look at all of those apps
on my phone, how do they get there?

388
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,290
So more put on when I got it right.
And so my put on,

389
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,330
so maps actually arrive on my phone.

390
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:49,280
I've absolutely no idea
where they came from.

391
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:54,860
Ads for products that I have no interest
in that just pop up on my phone.

392
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,210
I don't know how they got there,

393
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,790
but there's something been
downloaded all the time.

394
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:03,780
You're probably responsible for.
So actually that has just gone.

395
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,020
It was here. Look in your face. They gave
it away. So I want you to imagine this.

396
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:13,550
Imagine somebody as a total novice,
they don't know anything about computers,

397
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,540
which you are one time.

398
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,490
And we go into a computer store
and we ask the computer person,

399
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:22,640
they person in the store,
look, can you help me? They're
the expert. And they said,

400
00:23:22,641 --> 00:23:26,000
no problem. And they feel wonderful about
themselves. They come over and you said,

401
00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:29,750
well will you pick out the best computer
for me please? So they go in there,

402
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:34,640
pick out the best computer that they think
is the best one. So this is wonderful.

403
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,130
And you say, well, I don't
know how to use emails,

404
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:39,980
but I hear everyone else's using them.
So can you just put that on too?

405
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,080
And Microsoft word or whoops Google,
but for,

406
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,490
for chrome and private, whatever you
want on it, I don't know how to use it.

407
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:51,590
So will you do it?
So they're saying no problem at all.

408
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,420
So they put all their stuff on and
then this happens. We get home,

409
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,290
we become frustrated. It's not
working. Things start to crash.

410
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,910
Email staff to arrive for everything
you could possibly imagine.

411
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:07,370
I have gotten emails from
people that I don't know.

412
00:24:07,371 --> 00:24:09,050
I have won the lottery so many times.

413
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,590
There are people in Algeria who
wants to give me a million euro.

414
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,080
I don't know who they are,
but they arrive all the time.

415
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,110
And if I don't know anything
about computers, what'd you think?

416
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:22,190
I'd open those junk math.
Of course you would at the beginning.

417
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,160
Now you may not know because he know
better, but at the beginning you're open,

418
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:29,090
everything don't Ya. And program
staff to crash. And we think,

419
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:30,470
is this something wrong with us?

420
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,590
So imagine when you first use a computer
and just stuff wasn't working or if for

421
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:38,270
now if a program, is it working for you,
it kind of, it's frustrating isn't it?

422
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,510
And sometimes you kind of thing,
what? What is wrong with me?

423
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:44,720
Why can't it just get this?
Right? So using that analogy,

424
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,090
and I like to use analogies
because it simplifies things.

425
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,910
I want you to imagine the computer,
like your brain when you were born,

426
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,470
when you're born, we have a basic
computer with a basic brain.

427
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,510
We have the ability to learn the language,

428
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,990
the ability to move and the
ability to feed. That's kind of it.

429
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,780
How do you think you have
the accent that you have?

430
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,160
You learned it and you
constantly exposed to it.

431
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:12,260
Some of you here have been exposed to
second language rather than your first

432
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,930
language because you're around it.
The more you're around it,

433
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,793
the better you get at it.

434
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,240
And all information comes into us
like apps on a phone or a computer.

435
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,460
It comes in constantly. Our accent,
our walks, I got the raw deal.

436
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:29,390
I got a mail accent,
like seriously flat,

437
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,970
as a whatever.
Um,

438
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,140
but everybody has an accent simply
because it came in to your brain.

439
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,370
Every opinion you have,
every cultural opinion you have,

440
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,660
every religious opinion you have,

441
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,800
everything that you have in your brain
was downloaded either by your environment

442
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,450
or by somebody else. You just let it in.
Same way the stuff gets into my phone,

443
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,590
somebody put it in there. Sometimes
I download stuff that isn't good,

444
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,060
but of course in there, and that's
the exact same as our brains. Now,

445
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:01,160
this red thing here represents emotions.

446
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,220
Sometimes our brain has emotional tanks,

447
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,390
but what that means is you're here.
There's lots of information going on,

448
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,880
the lights of the fan,
the camera, everything.

449
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:14,690
You couldn't possibly focus on it all at
the same time, you will go crazy, right?

450
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,990
So we filter information,

451
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:19,250
we narrow it down to the things
that are important to us.

452
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:21,770
The things that you could focus
on that you need to focus on.

453
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,470
And sometimes there's emotions tanked
to information. It's like a guest,

454
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:30,140
an app or a CD if you imagined
or or a DVD, whatever.

455
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:31,400
You just put it into your brain.

456
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,220
So if you imagine you go
through life for example,

457
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:37,430
and you get into school before you go to
school, you think you're really smart.

458
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,030
Like my four year old at the minute,
he is a genius as far as he's concerned.

459
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,370
He actually did a picture yesterday,
I have to say, he's very creative.

460
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:48,990
So I did call him a genius on Facebook.
He is wonderful and I give praise.

461
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,470
I'm totally bias.
Now what happens when he goes into school,

462
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,220
do you think is going to start
getting color inside the lines?

463
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,350
Make sure you do this correctly. If you
get an a, you're a god. If you get an F,

464
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,580
you're a real rubbish.
He gets all different information.

465
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,460
Hopefully I'll be able to prevent
or at least reframe some of that.

466
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:10,490
But he got all that stuff. So we
actually monitor and I guess equate what,

467
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,590
how we are and how valuable we are in our,

468
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,430
your identity to our performance in
society and what society tells us as good.

469
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:23,270
So let's imagine I'm in school and my
teacher tells me that I'm stupid or I get

470
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:26,670
an f or I get it a g or you get whatever.

471
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,210
And automatically my brain tells
me that means I'm not good enough.

472
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,680
So I download it and it's emotionally
tact. Now here's the thing.

473
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,500
All of our senses are involved in
this. Our feelings, what we see,

474
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,370
everything. So of course in like
almost like just like a, um, a movie.

475
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,210
It goes into our minds and a place,
if there's a lot of emotion tag to it,

476
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,970
it would play a lot.
If there's not really much emotion,

477
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,110
you're probably don't even notice it.

478
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,890
Our brains purpose is to keep us alive
and safe. It likes to keep us comfortable.

479
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,030
So if it recognizes something in the
environment that it doesn't like it,

480
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:07,560
we'll try to avoid it or try and deal
with it. It's called fight or flight.

481
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,070
So if we have an emotional tank,

482
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,670
two piece of information or to something
that happens in our lives that makes us

483
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:19,410
feel uncomfortable, if we come across
that again or something similar,

484
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,540
your brain has to generalize.
How did you know to sit on that chair?

485
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,130
Because we've sat in a chair before
and you know what a chair does.

486
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,660
How do you know when you walk into a
door that opens this way or that way?

487
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,020
The first time you walked into
a door or not into the door?

488
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,600
Through the door and the
first time that you did that,

489
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:41,420
maybe when you were a baby you had to
kind of figure out what does this do.

490
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,790
But our brain generalizes generalized as
positive and negative. So for example,

491
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,600
when that happened to me when I was
younger, it was a one off event.

492
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,780
There was lots of emotions
obviously tagged to it,

493
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,950
but my brain in order to keep me safe
and comfortable, said from now on,

494
00:28:57,951 --> 00:28:59,990
if I experienced anything like this again,

495
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,160
trigger all those same emotions and then
I have a chance to decide what to do

496
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:08,060
with them. So can you imagine if I went
into a situation and I got bullied,

497
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,510
which is kind of control
taken away from you as well,

498
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,130
how do you think they'd react?

499
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,010
Yeah,

500
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:18,910
no. If you imagine if somebody started to
ask me where you're going and what time

501
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:22,600
will you be back, do you think
that might have bothered me then?

502
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,360
Yeah, because I felt they were
controlling me. There probably weren't,

503
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:29,780
but I felt that they were so it
generalizes. It's like a Hoover,

504
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:31,940
it sucks everything off.
And then says from now on,

505
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:34,850
anything I see or hear or
smell or taste or feel,

506
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,690
I'm going to trigger those same emotions.
And that is why if somebody,

507
00:29:38,691 --> 00:29:40,850
for example,
is afraid to give a presentation,

508
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:46,000
it's probably because at some point
in your life you would have seen or

509
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:50,770
experienced judgment at a presentation
and you didn't like it or you saw

510
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:53,410
somebody that maybe people
laughed at or something like that.

511
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,060
If you're afraid to do something,

512
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:58,150
it's because somewhere in your mind
you've got a CD playing or a movie playing

513
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,870
the Tattoo. If I did this, this
is what happens. We all got those.

514
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,723
Everybody does.

515
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,290
That happens in the limbic system.

516
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,110
The limbic system is basically a really
primitive part of the brain. It's habit.

517
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,150
It is very, I'm not saying
that came from x by the way.

518
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:19,970
I'm just saying that it's as primitive.
It's as dumb as an ape.

519
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,430
It's very black and white. It doesn't
see the difference. Reasoning or nothing.

520
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,230
Reasoning is part in a
different part of our brain,

521
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,200
so it's all to do with emotions,
to do with memories,

522
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:33,190
to do at responses to do
reward and desire. La Memories.

523
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,780
Everything is all banked in the
limbic system and what it does.

524
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,740
This is how it works,

525
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:40,810
and this is really important
that you pay attention to this.

526
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,210
It can't tell the difference between
what's real or imagined at a neurological

527
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,540
level. Admittedly, I'm
guys can admit this too.

528
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,530
If you're in a movie or watching a DVD
and it's a horror movie and all of a

529
00:30:55,991 --> 00:31:00,991
sudden something starts to happen and
your heart starts to beat and your sweat

530
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:06,340
glands start to activate and your blood
pressure goes up and you're like, Oh God,

531
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,660
I don't want to see this.
Even though you know it's green screens,

532
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,590
all special effects and they're acting.

533
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,060
So why would your body physically respond
because of the New York neurological

534
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:16,370
level?

535
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,960
The limbic system cannot
tell the difference between
what is real or imagined.

536
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,580
So it responds anyway. And the more our
body physically response to something,

537
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,320
the more adrenaline and
cortisol is released, the
more we shy away from things.

538
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,980
If the emotion is negative.
Also,

539
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:36,610
it does not filter information.
Now, do not, and I'm telling you,

540
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:41,410
do not think of a pink elephant.
I said,

541
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:42,820
don't now.
Whatever you do,

542
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:46,210
I don't want you to think of Grafton
Street and you're going up and wow,

543
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,770
there's a red dress in the shop window
and then all of a sudden you see a yellow

544
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:55,570
football on the ground. Don't think of
that. You've all thought of it, right?

545
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,540
So our brain doesn't differentiate.
It's like a junk mail. It just,

546
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,120
everything just comes in.
It's up to us what we engage in,

547
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,510
but everything comes in.
So everything somebody says to you,

548
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,290
your register almost like as a download,
it's off to you what to do with it.

549
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,610
But if you've got these programs going
on in your head that's emotional or

550
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,640
emotionally tagged, it kind of makes
a deal with it ineffectively as I did.

551
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,810
Here's the other thing. It was responsible
as it said, for the fight or flight.

552
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,160
Do I deal with it or do I run away
programs?

553
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:28,000
Our behaviors and habits and it's
strengths strengthens a responses to

554
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:32,620
repetition. If I have a dumb bell here and
I do that, it strengthens my arm. Right?

555
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,990
But I won't really know what a sec,
cause there's only done once.

556
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,530
What if I keep doing it?
What happens?

557
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,230
You're all judging my arm right now.
No, I do not go to the gym too much,

558
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,800
but it's suppose to get stronger.
You all speak the language,

559
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,150
you speak because we've practiced it.

560
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,410
You all can do this because you've
practiced it. The more you do it,

561
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:57,200
the better you get at it. And this
includes our thinking and our mindset.

562
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,650
The more we talk to ourselves.
Admittedly,

563
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,580
have you ever felt a bit of a sniffer,

564
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,140
like a cold and you didn't really want
to go into work or he didn't want to do

565
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:10,220
something and it's all God, I fed off the
cold. I can feel my sinuses blocking up.

566
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,840
Yeah, I think my throat is going as well
and they start coughing and you start

567
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:17,960
actually talking yourself into it.
We do it all the time.

568
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:21,950
We don't even realize that part of the
brain is like an engine in the background.

569
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:23,630
We don't realize what is happening.

570
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,350
So this is about becoming
conscious of what you're doing.

571
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,480
Become very aware of what you're
doing and things can change.

572
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,510
Change perspective. Now
I'm going to normally,

573
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:38,300
I don't wear sunglasses, so I thought
I put them there just in case.

574
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,470
When you signed up for a minute please.
Oh No.

575
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,110
If you were four, do you think you'd
have, you'd mind standing up? No.

576
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,510
Okay. Put those on. Turned around. She
looks lovely. It doesn't shake. Okay.

577
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,790
Now just turn around there for a second.
The room is the way it is right now.

578
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,000
How does it look now?
A lot darker now.

579
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:04,130
Can you imagine if she walked
around with the sunglasses,

580
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,580
what she would look at and what you
would see us take them off now? Okay.

581
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,613
It's the fact that

582
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,220
what we see in the world is predicted by
what filter we have. If I walk around,

583
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,850
for example, with this phone in
front of my eyes, all my downloads,

584
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,230
that's how I'm going to see the world.

585
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:25,100
So it's not necessarily the
people think of you a certain way.

586
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,200
If you have programs
learning in your mind,

587
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:32,510
you think that they do you perceive
that they do cultural differences,

588
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,640
race differences, um, everything
from, you know, the way people look,

589
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:39,740
the way people dress,
the way people speak.

590
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,960
We all perceive that they're going to be
a certain way because of our downloads,

591
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,910
because of the information
we grow up with. We perceive
various different things.

592
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,350
So do you think that I could perceive
the people were controlling my life after

593
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:59,090
that event happened? Absolutely.
Where are they controlling my life?

594
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,553
No.

595
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,000
When somebody said to me when I was at
my lowest weight and someone said to me,

596
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:08,390
Donnie and I was getting back up
and you're starting to look better,

597
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,480
I hated them.
I absolutely hated them.

598
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,680
Yet to look a little bit better would
have probably be healthier. Right?

599
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:18,020
So it didn't make any sense that
I would want to look better.

600
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,850
So I used to think everybody was
telling me if they said I look better,

601
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:26,510
it meant there were telling me I was fat,
which was just a perception.

602
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:32,060
That's odd. So everything that you do
in your life is a perception of reality.

603
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,960
It's not necessarily reality.
Does that make sense?

604
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,700
So you've got to change the
perceptions that you have and be all.

605
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,930
Put your mind to new thinking,
open your mind to different opinions.

606
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,980
Open your mind to different
ways of looking at what
you want to achieve and how

607
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:47,850
you might achieve it.

608
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,220
Understand the perspective
is not the same as reality.

609
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,010
And this is a question you need to
ask is are you prepared to allow your

610
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:02,100
perceptions or your programs to
determine what you do in your life?

611
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,530
If somebody calls you stupid,

612
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:07,350
are you prepared to allow them
to control what you achieve?

613
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,530
If you grew up in a
really disadvantaged area,

614
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,040
are you going to allow that to
dictate how wealthy you become?

615
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,310
If you decided that you want a promotion
but you don't think you can because

616
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:24,540
your sister told you that you probably
won't get it, are you going to dictate?

617
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,250
Allow that to dictate what you do?

618
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,810
That's your decision that you have to
own your life and allow yourself to make

619
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:33,990
decisions based on your new reality.
If that makes sense?

620
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,650
And this is neurological, guys,
this is not me just talking theory.

621
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,780
This happens for real.

622
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,980
You are literally being wired
every single minute of your day.

623
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,250
As I've been talking,
you've been thinking different ways.

624
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:50,940
You've been reframing stuff. You've been
thinking, well, how does that apply to me?

625
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,030
Or how could I use that in the future?
How could I use it? This circumstance,

626
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,720
right? So when you're doing that,
you're changing your perception,

627
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:03,030
and all that takes is bringing experts
into your life that have good ones.

628
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,300
Literally choosing the downloads
that you get in your brain,

629
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,950
choosing who you talk to. If you talk
to miserable people all day, guess what?

630
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:15,630
You're going to feel miserable if you
are watching it. Here's the fix, right?

631
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:16,620
You go home from work,

632
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,540
Yay eastenders half an hour
coronation street after it.

633
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,910
I think a fair city at some point.

634
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,480
Then you watch maybe the news or you
might hear the news every hour. Remember,

635
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,040
your body is physically responding.

636
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,100
So if you are watching somebody scraped
and somebody else's eyes out on the

637
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:33,270
pavement,
over rival over,

638
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:36,750
someone who's had an affair or
you're watching the news every hour,

639
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,630
your body is physically responding
and wiring you. Neurologically.

640
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,720
My body was wired neurologically
for unproductive responses.

641
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,180
So if you want something in
your life or your career,

642
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:51,840
whatever it is that's up to you, you
have to wire yourself correctly for it.

643
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,710
The only things you should be putting
in your mind as positive information,

644
00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:00,210
productive information, everything you
read, who you talked to, what you watch,

645
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,820
and it does have a difference. I
am. I am living proof that had have,

646
00:38:03,821 --> 00:38:07,050
it has a difference.
I used to talk myself miserable.

647
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,590
I used to say everything to myself that
I could possibly say that was negative.

648
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,240
But once I started to seek out experts
or people who knew what they were doing,

649
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,110
successful people successful basically
to me has been the best you can be in

650
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:20,580
whatever area you choose.

651
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,630
So what if I was to find those
people and let them download on me?

652
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,110
If them tell me what it is
that I need to be worried for.

653
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,410
Do you think that would be a smarter move?
Okay,

654
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,010
so think about who it
is that you can learn.

655
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:39,220
You may not personally know them, read
about them. Some of you have my book.

656
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,690
Read it. Do with does exercise
in it. Look at people on TV.

657
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,330
How do they walk?
How do they talk if they feel confident?

658
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,960
If I walk along like this, do you think
my neurology or make me feel confident?

659
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,140
Absolutely not.
Cause here's the thing,

660
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:58,030
your body and your mood I
directly related. It's called
a psycho cybernetic loop.

661
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,820
You're literally,
if I look down like that,

662
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:05,910
my body will tell me that pasture matches
feeling that if I Kerlin like that,

663
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,570
if I want to do something really well,
what if I gave a presentation like that?

664
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,550
How to think I give it? Or if I sat down
like this and I walked over like this,

665
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,460
how do you think I give that presentation?
Not Strong. So if you want to,

666
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,151
for example,

667
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,970
do you want to engage with new people or
you want a new relationship or you want

668
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:28,420
to learn something new,
make herself in that pasture.

669
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,740
Think of if I knew someone who was really
good at this and you may just know of

670
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:35,920
them, how would they stand? What
tone of voice would they have?

671
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,860
How would they breathe?
At one point in my life,

672
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,410
I was literally afraid to
cross the road on my own.

673
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,010
I had to get my mother to hold my hand.
Before that,

674
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:46,300
I didn't want to go outside my door.

675
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,330
I used to go into my bed as my mother
called her. I used to go into my whole

676
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,150
and for me I had to do it gently,
so I had to go in for a cup of coffee,

677
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,770
which was terrifying.

678
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,500
I would genuinely have preferred
to chew on glass and do that.

679
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,240
How am I up here talking to you?
I have to decide.

680
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,740
I had to become committed.

681
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:10,900
I had to get the skills and practice them
often till become wired for it so that

682
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:13,240
it becomes as natural to me as breathing

683
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,540
and every single thing
that you want to do.

684
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,930
You can do it just by
wiring yourself force,

685
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,700
so assess your current life, assess the
downloads you're putting into your brain.

686
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:30,070
If you're literally working on your
laptop and you're looking at things,

687
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:32,080
you typing in stuff that's
negative all the time,

688
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,140
or you're typing in crappy calls.
If you're trying to learn something,

689
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,860
how do you think you're going to fail?
So why do it for real?

690
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,940
Because we have become conditioned to
do it naturally in Ireland especially,

691
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,960
and I'm sure it is across the world,
it's almost bad to become successful.

692
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,990
The minutes almost becomes bankrupt.
Yes,

693
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,020
they've lost all their property.

694
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm so delighted because they were
greedy anyway, all of this stuff,

695
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:01,270
we celebrate people when they fail because
it makes us feel more comfortable now

696
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:04,100
in saying that I don't anymore.
I love it when people are successful,

697
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:07,590
when people are happy and achieve their
goals because they think differently.

698
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,620
I look at people differently. I
almost, it's like if somebody,

699
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,340
imagine people are ringing you and I say,
do I want to answer them or not?

700
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:19,000
Imagine if they're going to fill my mind
with been talking about somebody else

701
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:22,270
hasn't been really mean.
Well, I answered no.

702
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,130
So why answer Fifo or answer masters or
answer information from the environment?

703
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,900
It's if it doesn't make you feel good,

704
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:34,890
only an answer and engaged and open
up information that makes you feel

705
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,960
wonderful, find it, read it,

706
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,140
put it into your brain,
download it and practice it.

707
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:49,290
You can do this as a little tip. This is
something that I do. It's very simple,

708
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,700
but it's quite effective. I want you to
imagine a delete button in your head.

709
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,240
Okay?
There it is.

710
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,190
If somebody say something negative to you,
and that includes yourself.

711
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:08,330
If you watch the news more than
every half an hour or every hour,

712
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,110
I want you to press delete,
literally imagined pressing it.

713
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,120
Can you all imagine that
button in your brain?

714
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,890
If you can't imagine it visually look at
this and feel it going into your brain

715
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,060
or hear that sound

716
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,960
okay, so deleted. Importantly,

717
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:36,240
you need to replace it with something
positive. So if for example,

718
00:42:36,241 --> 00:42:40,500
I say to myself, I can't afford
it and it makes me feel bad,

719
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,800
how about reframing it and saying,
how can I afford it?

720
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,570
What do I need to do to afford it?

721
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,510
It's a different question and
you'll get a better answer.

722
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,850
The questions you answered determine the
answers. Sorry. The questions you ask,

723
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:56,880
determine the answers that you'll get.
If you ask crappy questions,

724
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:58,080
you're going to get bad answers.

725
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,290
If you ask better questions or
reframe questions, guess what?

726
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:04,680
You're going to get better
answers and better solutions.

727
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,593
Imagine this,

728
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,023
hear it.

729
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,550
I want you to imagine
going into your brain.

730
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,270
I also want you to do something else.
Who's right handed here?

731
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,190
Okay. This evening or today, if you
have them here, I'm sure you do.

732
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,780
Get an elastic band and put it on your
left hand. Who's on your left wrist?

733
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,540
Who's lefthanded?
Okay.

734
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,900
Get an elastic bands and put it on
your right hand. Now, here's the thing.

735
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:37,280
I want you to wear this for 24
hours. If anybody asks, say,

736
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,290
that Lunatic Donna
Kennedy made me wear it.

737
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:43,250
There is a reason and people may
ask why you over elastic bands.

738
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,380
Anytime you think something negative
about yourself or somebody else,

739
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,790
I want you to get it depending on your
hand and I want you to do this and then a

740
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:55,250
spring back so it hurts,
right?

741
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,980
It will shock you were in the shower
everywhere for the next 24 hours.

742
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:05,220
It will shock you how many, many negative
thoughts you engage in every day.

743
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,740
It is like sitting at your computer and
opening up negative emails all of the

744
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:12,500
time. I'm wondering why you
don't feel good to perform. Well,

745
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,040
look at what it is that you're opening up.

746
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,240
What is it that you want to hear
in your life so every single time,

747
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,300
no matter when it is or where it is
buying a Gordon had whack it off your arm.

748
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,220
I go, I shouldn't have done that.
No. Why am I asking you to do that?

749
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,830
Not to give you pain it,
although it will hurt.

750
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,410
I'm only asking you to that because
here's the thing, it's physical.

751
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,610
Your body will go, oh, I didn't
expect that. So changes the pattern.

752
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,770
When I'm asking you to put a positive
program in there or delete your negative

753
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:48,270
programs and put a positive one in its
place, your brain doesn't expect it.

754
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,260
Our brain is conditioned. So Chester's
that how many people? Honestly,

755
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:54,570
if we left this room and came back,
he'd sit in the same seat.

756
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:56,920
Okay,

757
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,460
no. Imagine if somebody has sat
in your seat, would you go, well,

758
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:04,420
she didn't sit in my seat. Move.
Because we get into habits so easy.

759
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,960
How many people have their side of the
couch that they sit on or their mug or

760
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,200
you go and when you go home you put your
keys in the same place all the time.

761
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:18,010
What I would even thinking or you drive
home and you don't realize how you even

762
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:18,520
got there.

763
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,050
You could be thinking of something else
because we do things on automatic and I

764
00:45:23,051 --> 00:45:26,350
want you to learn stuff on automatic that
will help you to be the best that you

765
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:27,184
can be.

766
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,240
That's going to help you doing this will
actually help you because it'll throw

767
00:45:31,241 --> 00:45:34,210
your brain off track.
It doesn't matter what you do.

768
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,080
Where do you slap yourself in the face?
Whether you drink a drink you don't like?

769
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,170
What do you smell? Something you don't
like as long as it interrupts your brain.

770
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,620
But I want you to just do that because
it's really simple and if you ever do it

771
00:45:44,621 --> 00:45:48,460
again in the future, put that elastic
band back on and watch what happens.

772
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,330
You will genuinely be shocked out how
much negative rubbish you're putting into

773
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:56,680
your lives. So hands up. Who
is going to become a victor

774
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,060
now to physically get it? I want
you to stand up and become a victor.

775
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,270
Oh my God, I'm standing up.
People are looking at me. No,

776
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:12,170
this time look slightly above eye level,
just slightly provider level.

777
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:14,480
I saw you walking like I have this gut.

778
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,660
Breathe deeply.

779
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,660
Now think of someone who's super
confident and relaxed in a way,

780
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,230
but they've got genuine confidence. You
might see them on TV or might know them.

781
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,640
Now think like them. How would
they walk? How would they breathe?

782
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:35,920
Would you walk differently?

783
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,110
Okay,

784
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,040
now I want you to all for a second,
look down at the floor.

785
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,230
Put your shoulders in like this.

786
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:50,040
How do you feel? Okay, now look back
up. Look slightly provide level,

787
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,510
and she breeds already.
So sit down.

788
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,940
If you engage your brain correctly,
you will embrace the day differently.

789
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,870
You'll start to behave differently,
but you need to do after.

790
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,080
This is not a onetime thing.

791
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,410
You need to continually do it
until it becomes automatic.

792
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,430
And I'm going to finish up on
this because I know time wise,

793
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,320
get out of your own way.

794
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,400
The only person stopping you from doing
what it is that you want to do is you.

795
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,800
If you decide and commit they,

796
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:26,100
you're not gonna take any rubbish anymore
that you're not going to settle for

797
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:29,680
second best that you want to actually
live the life that you want to live.

798
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,460
Why not to us what stuffing and every
single person who has achieved anything

799
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:38,230
great has overcome adversity.

800
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,340
Most people who are world renowned,
great thinkers,

801
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,040
great achievers,
Einstein failed maths.

802
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,320
Walt Disney was fired from his job.
Guess why?

803
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,110
For lack of creativity.

804
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,700
Michael Jordan was thrown
off his basketball team.

805
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:03,390
All of these people failed, but here's
how I want you to think of it. Fit.

806
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:08,110
There is no such thing as failure. It's
feedback. If something doesn't work out,

807
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:10,840
go, what can I do differently?
How can I do it differently?

808
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,200
Ask better questions and importantly,
take action.

809
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,360
If you just wish for something, it's
just a dream, but if you take action,

810
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,880
it becomes reality and
that is the gap in between.

811
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,920
I used to wish for a better life.

812
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,870
Sometimes I prefer to
trade my life for nothing,

813
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,040
just to do away with it.
That was then.

814
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,150
Now I make better questions.
I ask better questions,

815
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:41,500
I make better decisions and I focus
on better things and importantly,

816
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,730
I take action on those. I don't wish
anymore. If I want to do something,

817
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:47,260
I don't have to know how to do it.

818
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:49,720
I've just got to do it and find
someone who's done it before me.

819
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,080
Do you all know someone who's done
something successful before you?

820
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,670
Everybody has.
Everybody knows somebody like that.

821
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,330
Find the strategies and model
them and keep taking action.

822
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,270
And keep doing it and keep doing
it and keep them do it or tell you,

823
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:07,540
get the result that you want and you
will get the results that you want and

824
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:11,200
remember the phrase,
we are all born happy and successful.

825
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:15,010
You're conditioned not to be.
Now that you know that,

826
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,330
I want you to be your best
version of yourselves,

827
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:21,490
I reach your potential and I'd
like to thank you on that note

828
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,230
[inaudible]

829
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,880
and thank you so much.
We're going to,

830
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:36,680
I'm going to maybe one or two questions
and I'm going to have three minutes left

831
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,640
and then we'll go to audience questions
very quickly and please wait until

832
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:44,230
either myself or John get
a microphone to you. Some

833
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:50,480
other to start with is that after
each of the major events that you've

834
00:49:50,481 --> 00:49:53,300
experienced and you were coming
back and can really strong again,

835
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:57,920
there must've been lots of times when you,
you kind of want,

836
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:58,783
you wanted to give off.

837
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,590
What strategies did you use or
or just why didn't you actually,

838
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,083
why didn't you give up?

839
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,460
I didn't give up because I knew
that there was something better.

840
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,080
I didn't know how to do with what.

841
00:50:10,081 --> 00:50:14,280
I knew that there was something better
and I was sick of seeing my parents upset.

842
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:19,500
I watched other people have what I wanted
and I guess I just knew there was a

843
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:23,220
slight glimmer there that I might be
able to do it if I could get the right,

844
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,770
the right people behind me in the
right resources. And I guess I,

845
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,570
I on to that hope because when you've got
a bit of hope, if you can do anything.

846
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,090
So that's why I grasped that hope.

847
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,930
And I also became grant became very
grateful for everything that I have,

848
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,980
not what I don't have any,
you've had lots of brilliant achievement.

849
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,650
What in your mind,
in your gracious achievements?

850
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,793
Having my baby

851
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:51,310
and general wife,
that was bloody painful.

852
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,970
It was the most painful thing ever.
But sometimes it takes bit of pains.

853
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:59,320
They get great results and uh, yeah,
that was my greatest achievements.

854
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:02,140
I on all the other stuff, but that
was a great, my greatest achievement.

855
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,360
That's fantastic.

856
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,540
This is the points, and I said
this to, to Caroline beforehand.

857
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:10,890
This is point travel goals.

858
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,580
I want to ask a question but I
can't put my hand up first. Yeah,

859
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,330
you're the first person
anyway. Yes. Great.

860
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,040
So you,

861
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:25,110
um, maintain analogy of a computer and
you said that everything is an app you

862
00:51:25,111 --> 00:51:30,111
download or programs down but don't people
and even children are born with like

863
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:36,290
some pre made software like children's
share or something without people

864
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:37,890
teaching them how to share.

865
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,330
You can't have that. It's
a physical. But then again,

866
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:44,530
this is neurological so we download stuff
but it becomes part of our neurology.

867
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:45,281
So for example,

868
00:51:45,281 --> 00:51:48,280
if somebody has down syndrome and
there's gene 21 and it's not effective,

869
00:51:48,281 --> 00:51:52,680
it's not working as effectively as
maybe other people. That's part of it.

870
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:55,210
Their and urology,
that's part of their genetic makeup.

871
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,970
But I don't believe that people
are born with emotional, um,

872
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:04,720
been pessimists or been depressed. I,
if you look at all of the research,

873
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,620
every bit of research that's out there,
it's all based on behavior and taught.

874
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:13,540
So what you feel and what you think would
literally affect the chemicals in your

875
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:16,630
body and your neurology.
If I think negatively,

876
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,000
cortisol and adrenaline
are released in my body.

877
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:24,370
If I think happy taught or I look at
something positive chemicals such as

878
00:52:24,371 --> 00:52:27,640
norepinephrine and Serotonin,
which has antidepressants, um,

879
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,450
Dorf mean they're all flooded my body
and that has a physical response.

880
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,210
So there are obviously the right,
it's like we're, we're physically,

881
00:52:34,211 --> 00:52:37,150
we all look different because we
have different genetic makeups,

882
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,500
but on an emotional level it's
neurological and that can be changed.

883
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:43,443
Does that answer your question?

884
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:49,270
Thank you. Anyone else with them?
One final question. You'd like them.

885
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,710
Great.
Hi.

886
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,340
So we have busy days and have been,

887
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:58,160
it's always running and I
know it's called the home.

888
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,100
Do you have any tips on kind of like
finding in yourself and pretty makes you

889
00:53:02,101 --> 00:53:07,101
tick and you know to find that purpose
to go after and that's it instead of

890
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,840
getting lost in the day to day stuff,

891
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,430
set a time, set aside time
on one day a week, one hour,

892
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,760
one day a week to take a pen and paper
and literally write down on the top my

893
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:24,430
why. Why is it that you want to
do you know what you want to do?

894
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,910
It's just to the condition
that's clouding yet.

895
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,870
But you know what you want to do because
when you get up in the morning, um,

896
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,570
you go, I'd love to do this today
or we'd love to do that today.

897
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,770
Or if I said to you, are you creative
person and you go yes or no or whichever.

898
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,000
Or are you someone who loves like an
adrenaline buzz? You'd say yes or no.

899
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,970
You'd know those questions because there
are better questions to ask yourself.

900
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,370
So what kind of a person am I? What do I
enjoy? What makes me go, yes, I really,

901
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:53,490
really enjoyed that. Or, you know,
are you a people kind of person?

902
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,430
If you're a people person and
you take on a solitary job,

903
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,660
you're never going to be happy in it.

904
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,980
So when you start to write out what is
it that's your wife or play around with

905
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:03,510
it,
rather than trying to be stiff with it,

906
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,000
just play around with what
it is that you want to do.

907
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,500
Then you put the passion behind it.

908
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:11,160
You'll only get passionate when
you trade out. Most honestly,

909
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,610
most people here and in the rest of the
world don't know what they want to do

910
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,810
simply because they haven't asked
themselves kids. If you ask the child,

911
00:54:18,811 --> 00:54:19,530
what do you want to be?

912
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:23,910
I want to be superman or I want to be
a nurse or I want to be a doctor or

913
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:26,610
whatever.
It's not necessarily that they do,

914
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:30,840
but in that moment they do so they just
don't question it and adults go, Yay, oh,

915
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:34,200
isn't that lovely? That's so
cute. So they get a reward for it.

916
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,260
Or if a child does something,
everyone celebrate.

917
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,740
If a child stands up and walks and takes
the first step, everyone celebrates.

918
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,340
So if few start asking yourself
positive questions and then you kind of

919
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:46,740
celebrate those questions
or reward yourself.

920
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,850
When you do something that you love,

921
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,930
your brain will start to physically
respond to it as a practice for brains.

922
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:54,480
Some people consider it prior to the
limbic system is called the anterior

923
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:59,400
singular cortex. And what that does is
that is responsible for award rewards,

924
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:03,210
impulses and desires, and that part
of the brain, especially in women,

925
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,620
and activate a very,

926
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:08,400
very easily when you give yourself a
reward and it tags it to the thing that

927
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:12,890
you're doing. Thank you very
much for the last 30 seconds.

928
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:16,630
Final question is,
who inspires you?

929
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,510
My mother, she passed away two years ago,
but everything that she taught me, um,

930
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,860
has inspired me. Now I know
people think, you know,

931
00:55:23,861 --> 00:55:27,730
it should be some celebrity or somebody.
That's what everybody knows. But for me,

932
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:31,360
being the best that you can be and having
good morals and values and having good

933
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:34,210
integrity, that inspires me. I
don't care who the person is.

934
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,590
And so my mother for sure,

935
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:38,950
she taught me how to be grateful
for everything that I have not,

936
00:55:38,951 --> 00:55:41,770
and they're like grateful for your dinner
way or those people starving somewhere

937
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:45,580
else. And you should be grateful in
a way that to genuine only a preset.

938
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,390
If these were gone, would you give
me a billion euro for your hands?

939
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:51,603
Not a full,

940
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,960
but yet everyone just takes
for granted what they have.

941
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,930
Would you give me a billion
euro for your clothes?

942
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,513
Not a hope.

943
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:05,040
If you had to take them off and try and
go around everywhere you might get them

944
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:07,500
to be at home with whatever transaction.

945
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:09,960
Would you give me your
eyes for a billion euro?

946
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,370
But most of us think we have to be
grateful for everything out there.

947
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,010
Where my mother is,
she inspired me to understand,

948
00:56:17,011 --> 00:56:18,630
I suppose at the beginning
of the desperation,

949
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:21,090
but to understand that there's
stuff that you actually have,

950
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,800
if you become grateful for it,

951
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,470
you actually become a
stronger person every day.

952
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,520
And it's something that she taught me
from my nose, like the Phif. Um, she said,

953
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:32,580
say 10 things that you're
grateful for everyday,

954
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,070
10 things and it's very hard to stop.
The team wants to start going.

955
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,540
I'm grateful for my eyes. I'm grateful
for my hands. I'm grateful for my big toe.

956
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,680
If it was gone,
I've Hade.

957
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,880
I'm grateful for the seat that I
sit and I'm grateful that he's here.

958
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,940
I'm grateful for that.
You know,

959
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,690
we're in a safe environment and
get the list goes on and on,

960
00:56:49,691 --> 00:56:51,100
but as soon as you start to do that,

961
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:54,670
your brain starts to open up and think
differently. So she inspires me most.

962
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,100
That's great. Thank you very much. So

963
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:01,520
[inaudible].
