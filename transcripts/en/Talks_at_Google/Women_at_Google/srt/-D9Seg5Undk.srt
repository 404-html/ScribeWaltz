1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,910
So it's my absolute pleasure to introduce
my friend and author and Speaker

2
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:14,570
Nilofer, um, Nyla fan. I met, um,

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,380
about seven years ago at Ted in Europe.
Um,

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,620
and when I moved to the bay
area, she said, oh, look me up.

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:25,280
And I thought that's the kind of thing
that Americans say when you moved to the

6
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:29,360
bay area. But when I called her
up, um, she said, absolutely,

7
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,040
I'm going to throw a
dinner party have for you.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,930
And she threw a dinner party for me with
10 women who then became friends and

9
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,550
we're sort of like the beginning of my,

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,860
my friends and my
network and the bay area.

11
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:42,590
So I've been eternally grateful for that.
Um,

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,730
she also introduced me to the concept
of walk walking meetings instead of

13
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:48,860
sitting meetings,
which absolutely transformed my life.

14
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:52,280
So I've been pacing around Martin
with you ever since. Um, so,

15
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:56,960
and that's actually like her super top
rated Ted talk is a very short talk about

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,580
how walking is important because
otherwise sitting is the smoking of our

17
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:05,630
generation. So, um, she's written, um,

18
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:08,240
on a whole number of topics and,
um,

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,900
it's great to have her here to
talk to us about her latest book,

20
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:15,080
which is called the power
of loneliness, um, which is,

21
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:17,990
and she'll obviously tell you much more
about this concept and why she came up

22
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:22,220
with it, but it's BC about how each
of us is unique in their own right.

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,180
Um,

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,800
she's drawn from a whole load of different
examples of people she's interviewed

25
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:31,160
for the book but also from her sort of
own experience or working at companies

26
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:35,230
like Adobe and apple as well as
startups and the in the early days.

27
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:38,690
So she's got this sort of lick
really kind of a wide career.

28
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,310
And um,

29
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,570
she is now a recognized thinker and she
just told me that she's not like ranked

30
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:49,430
on the number, uh, as number 22 on the
top management thinker list. So. Well,

31
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:54,380
it's a pleasure to have you here and I'm
going to hand it over to you to try and

32
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,940
make these slides work. Just tell
you, tell us about your idea.

33
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,143
Thank you very much.

34
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,120
Thanks Toby.
Um,

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,150
so thank you for coming and actually for
all your patients through the last few

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,983
minutes.
And uh,

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,940
what I want to just do is share with
you a thesis about how the world can and

38
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:13,490
should be. And it starts
with something really simple.

39
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:16,280
I don't know if you guys have caught this,
but in the economist world right now,

40
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,130
there's a conversation
going on about ideas.

41
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:23,480
We've run out of ideas and therefore
productivity and prosperity is doomed

42
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:26,900
because specifically America
has run out of ideas.

43
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,521
And I don't know about you,

44
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:33,230
but I find that idea ridiculous because
actually my experience is just the

45
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:36,530
opposite. I bet yours is too.
Most ideas are dismissed,

46
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,970
not because they're considered
and evaluated and deemed unworthy,

47
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,720
but because of the packaging
that the idea comes in.

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,960
So if that person's super young or maybe
a woman in a male dominated culture or

49
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,640
person of color and a
mostly white culture or,

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,950
and fill out the list
however you choose to,

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,400
most ideas are dismissed because the
person who brings it lacks and status.

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,790
This problem that we have about ideas
being gone is so fundamental to our

53
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:11,800
economy. It's so fundamental to
our future. It's because ideas,

54
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:16,570
when we give them rain, pull us into the
future. And so if we don't have ideas,

55
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:21,280
we have nothing. And so here at Google
we know how ludicrous that idea is,

56
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,250
but we actually have to figure out how
to change the very framework by which we

57
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,830
evaluate ideas in order
for us to change the world.

58
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,020
And that's totally change our
ability to create the future.

59
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,030
Now one of the people, so I ob mentioned
that I did a bunch of research,

60
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:37,810
I actually studied 300 examples in
order to actually write this book.

61
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,110
I didn't mean to write to
have to study 300 examples,

62
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,920
but every single person I was studying
to understand how do they get their idea

63
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:48,610
through had a different idea
of what's made them successful.

64
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,780
Then what was actually true.

65
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:54,010
So there was no repeatable pattern and
tie study 302 I found the through line

66
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,330
and one of those stories is Franklin
Leonard Franklin started an organization

67
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:02,740
called the blacklist, which reinvented
Hollywood. But when he actually showed up,

68
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,720
he was this young, 20 something years
old guy. He had worked for a congressman,

69
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,670
he had worked at Mckinsey
and gotten fired.

70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,980
And then he showed up at
Hollywood after get this,

71
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,630
he had done a weekend of Netflix binge
watching and realize the only thing you'd

72
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,450
ever really loved with storytelling
and movies. And so he thought,

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,970
I'll just show up in Hollywood
and figure out how to break in.

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,920
So he schlepped coffee.

75
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:27,820
And one of the jobs that junior
people do is to actually read scripts.

76
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,520
And he found most, the scripts
had these really trite, um,

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,140
storylines that just kind of repeated
the same heroic architecture and didn't

78
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,490
reflect the stories that he wanted to see
in the world. And one point he thought,

79
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:40,600
there's gotta be a different way.

80
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,710
That's what he went through his entire
Rolodex of people he had met in the last

81
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,600
year and literally like
went through and said, oh,

82
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,540
I saw this person for lunch and I saw
this person for dinner and organized an

83
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,310
89% email list under
an alias, Google. And,

84
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,530
uh,
actually send out a note saying,

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,620
if you share with me the movies that
you've seen in the last year that you've

86
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,860
loved but haven't been put into
production, excuse me, screen the screen,

87
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,420
like scripts,
not movies.

88
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,920
I will collate all that up using his
McKenzie skills and I will send it back to

89
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,950
you. So that's the give and the get
do that and let's see where it goes.

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,870
And people cooperate it.
In fact,

91
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:17,740
they shared it with friends and he ended
up doing this tabulation process only

92
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,560
because he wanted to find the
scripts his boss would need.

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,920
And the reason he used an alias is because
he didn't want his boss to think he

94
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:27,280
wasn't good at his job.
So he does this. He,

95
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,800
this is back in the days when we actually
all went on vacation and actually

96
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,400
logged off. So he printed off the top
five that he got from the master list.

97
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,553
It took off,

98
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,990
he comes back two weeks later and it's
inbox is full of this roll up lists.

99
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:43,540
This blacklist all sent
back to him saying,

100
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,770
this is the most amazing list of scripts
we should all be taking a look at it.

101
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,210
And so literally hundreds of emails are
in his inbox because no one knows it's

102
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:57,190
him that has started this
process. Now, if it was a build,

103
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,740
you see that some of the movies that had
been put into production because of the

104
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:04,940
black list, our Juno and I'm the king
speech, who would imagine, right?

105
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,020
And so these were the scripts that were
destined for the dustmen and pulled out

106
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:13,160
and put back on the master list of we
should really consider these odd ducky

107
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,210
stories.
Moonlight.

108
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,810
One of the things that Franklin did is
he asked a brand new question and I said

109
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,420
it in such a quick way
when I first rolled out,

110
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,900
what are the ask has people that it's
worth kind of pausing on. He asked,

111
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,130
what movies do you love that
haven't been put into production?

112
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,210
What scripts do you love?

113
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,680
And the reality is that's
not how Hollywood has been
formatted up to this point.

114
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,490
What's Hollywood sort on?
What will make us money?

115
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,310
And by doing it through an alias,

116
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,820
he actually found a community of people
who cared about the same question as

117
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:49,880
that, a different kind of
purpose, pulling people together.

118
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,760
And it provided enough anonymity that
people could essentially vote the way

119
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:56,360
their heartfelt not vote, the way
their boss might want them to vote.

120
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,200
And so it changed an
access of orientation.

121
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,060
And one of the things that shows us is
really the power of community in that

122
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:09,860
process, right? So often
we think about power,

123
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,570
the ability to get
things done as personal.

124
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:14,750
And so we'll often describe
like a Franklin in fact
gets featured in like fast

125
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,360
company and stuff as the guy,
as you know,

126
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:22,280
he changed Hollywood because he produced
the blacklist and it's a singular hero

127
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:26,270
that is carved out as if it's not in
context to all the other people who

128
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,104
participated.

129
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,770
And so surely he had grit and surely he
asked a brand new question and surely he

130
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:32,960
did absolutely an amazing set of things.

131
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,120
But the thing that actually made the
blacklist powerful to get that effort done

132
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,110
is a social act, a communal
act. And that's not,

133
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:45,710
that's community in a different way
than let's say how Facebook used it.

134
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,450
Facebook uses the term community as a
group of people that we can then monetize.

135
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,940
That's not actual community.
Right?

136
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,300
Community is a group of people who are
held together by a shared of beliefs,

137
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,950
a certain set of purposes,

138
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,280
and then together they can do
things in a meaningful way.

139
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,320
This is important also because I think
it changes how we might think about how

140
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:10,760
we conceive of our work.
Instead of thinking, what
can I do? You start to think,

141
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:15,761
who can I organize around a new question
and if you walk away with nothing else

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,840
other than that vignette and that story,

143
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,550
it might change how we think and conceive
of how we gather power in our lives.

144
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,230
Because if the story is always a
singular hero on top of a magazine cover,

145
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,090
we miss the real point.
That's individuating something
that is deeply connected.

146
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,440
Now.
Most of us lack that connection,

147
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,370
that ability to kind of think about what
is it that gives me meaning. In fact,

148
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:44,810
61% of us the data says cover or
hide ourselves. At work covering,

149
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:47,990
being defined as we actually
don't show up as our true selves.

150
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,620
It's the some of the vignettes
and the and the research.

151
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,860
A guy wearing glasses because
he didn't want to look young.

152
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,950
A young man who didn't talk about how
he wanted to be a co parent because he

153
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:03,030
didn't want his colleagues to think he
wasn't interested in his career and so on

154
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,893
and so on.

155
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,250
What was most surprising about that
detail that 61% of US cover or hide

156
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,580
ourselves at work is that it didn't
just affect traditional groups,

157
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,720
underserved and under seen people 45%
nearly half of straight white men also say

158
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,353
they cover,

159
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,360
which makes sense if you think about
all the different ways in which people

160
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:26,361
believe they have to fit to an archetype
or some mirage of normal in order to

161
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,880
actually fit in at work and
as long those were fitting in.

162
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:33,780
That way we're not actually being our
true selves and from that place of true

163
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,790
sof is where we understand
what gives us meaning,

164
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,190
what gives us purpose and what things
we actually care about. Therefore,

165
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,710
the genesis of our ideas
now,

166
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,900
this lack of social standing when we show
up at work fitting in is the greatest

167
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:53,460
barrier to belonging. When we lack that
ability to belong as our true selves,

168
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,670
we also lack the ability to
generate ideas that we care about.

169
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,320
I was talking with, um, a banking
executive not so long ago, and,

170
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,280
and this woman was saying she had a really
innovative idea for how to change the

171
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:08,430
low end of the market, how
to serve the, the deep poor,

172
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:11,610
the people who use those cash and carry
kind of places where the check cashing

173
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,240
places are used. They typically take
between five and 10% of that check.

174
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,840
And she said she had a way for her bank
to serve that marketplace with less than

175
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,600
half a percent. And I was like,
oh my God, that would change.

176
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,660
You could get a whole bunch
of new customers and it
would change an entire, uh,

177
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,360
group of people's lives, right?
And she says, yeah, yeah,

178
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,510
but I'll never tell the
people sitting at this table.

179
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,260
I looked at her with that sort
of tilting my head and I thought,

180
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:36,900
why would you not say it?
Why would you not own it?

181
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,860
And it wasn't hard to think about for a
second. She sat there and she said, yeah,

182
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,260
that person,
that person has an Hermes bag,

183
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,560
that person has a such and such Thai.
And she said,

184
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:51,561
all these people have wealthy backgrounds
and she didn't ever want to show that

185
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:55,320
she didn't have that same background
because what was she doing?

186
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,810
She was fitting in in order to belong.

187
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,770
And as long as she was fitting in in
order to belong in that half sole kind of

188
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:05,370
way, she was never also going to claim
that thing that was true for her,

189
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,420
her history and experience her own visions
and hopes based on that history and

190
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:12,150
experience without social standing,

191
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,790
we lack the ability to actually
create change, real change,

192
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,920
the change we actually
want to see in the world.

193
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,350
Now, um, I've written, ob alluded to it,

194
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:25,170
I've written two books before on
collaborative work and how power should be

195
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,430
distributed with an organization.

196
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:29,610
So basically talking about
flat organizations and
breaking down the perimeter of

197
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:33,660
organizations to open up innovation. And
a lot of times people say, well, you know,

198
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:36,600
you've studied these business models for
years, you've done innovation for years.

199
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:37,740
This must be why you care.

200
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,080
And actually the real reason of why I
notice this grouping problem is because of

201
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,930
my own heritage. You see,
when I was 18 years old,

202
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:49,940
I was actually supposed to get
an arranged marriage. And uh, uh,

203
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,590
I had returned home. In
fact, uh, when I was 18,

204
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:55,780
I had gone to commuter college and for
the day and returned home and they're my

205
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,030
aunties and uncles and stuff had
filled the house. And if, you know,

206
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:02,110
Indian families, they're just like all
over the place. And, uh, they had, uh,

207
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,410
been there to tell me that my arranged
marriage was well arranged and, uh,

208
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,230
the sort of terms of the deal were set.

209
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,370
And I had turned to my uncle who was
sort of representing because my father

210
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:16,510
wasn't in the picture, who's representing
me and are representing our family.

211
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,830
And so did you ask the guy if I could
get an education because I was the only

212
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:23,890
thing I had ever said. If you could
please make sure that was taken care of,

213
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,750
I would be okay with it.

214
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:28,030
Because ever since I was four and
a half and move to this country,

215
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,580
I understood my job to be that,

216
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:33,820
of taking care of my mother and getting
this arranged marriage as a way of

217
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:37,510
serving the family. And my uncle
had turned to me and said, no,

218
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,860
she will not let me ask because she's
negotiating for house and some other

219
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,720
things.
So her future is taken care of.

220
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:47,020
She doesn't want to also ask
for your needs and interests.

221
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,840
So I was polite enough to wait until
my aunt, aunties and uncles left.

222
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:58,300
And then I turned to her and my mother
and I had done this sort of theatrical

223
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:02,310
thing, which is not my style
normally. Um, and I had,

224
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,360
I had gone to future
business leaders of America.

225
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:07,540
So the sentence is entirely informed by
future business leaders of America club

226
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,450
in high school. And I
said, I am the product.

227
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,510
You cannot do the deal without me.

228
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,640
So ask the guy if I can get an
education and this will be done.

229
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,460
And I had turned like the
closest thing next to me,

230
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:24,040
a cardboard box without a lid
or anything like grocery box.

231
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,840
And I grabbed it and I had put
in five books in one outfit,

232
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,430
no toothbrush, no money,
because I didn't have any.

233
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,080
And you can tell my priorities,
right?

234
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,080
Books went outfit and I was just
doing this theatrical thing. I've,

235
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,660
and I'm leaving unless you
change your mind. And um,

236
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,170
I actually thought this
would end in about an hour.

237
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,270
And so I walked down the street to
the local donut shop as one does

238
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,860
carbohydrates,
everything.

239
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,660
And I thought I was just going to wait
it out and then call home and be like,

240
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,270
it's done.
When I called home,

241
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,830
the situation only escalated like,
we're never going to change our mind,

242
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,910
but you come home right now.
And one day turned into two,

243
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:08,890
two days turned into three and it's,
well,

244
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,570
it's been 30 years and I
got exited from my family,

245
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,190
homeless, educated. Um,

246
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,740
no cash in the pocket kind of thing to
go off and figure out this new direction

247
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,990
in my life.
And,

248
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,790
and that moment my
identity was being defined,

249
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,710
my value to the world,

250
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:37,630
my ability to create my own space in the
world is being defined by what a group

251
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,660
I belong to in this case being
an Indian or Muslim or woman,

252
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,970
some combination thereof that said,

253
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the only value you have to us in the
world is to serve in way in this box.

254
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,170
That was the first time I saw
groupings and I thought, well,

255
00:14:57,171 --> 00:15:01,070
it's probably true to my family,
but then I would go on and do. Um,

256
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,450
one of my first jobs was as
an Admin at apple and uh,

257
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,690
I showed up in one of those like early
meetings and I was such an eager kid to

258
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:14,300
want to prove myself and stuff.
And uh, at one time they said, hey,

259
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,870
we're going to brainstorm by x, come
to the meeting, we're going to do this.

260
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,430
And I remember doing all the research I
could find and formulating questions and

261
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:25,280
showing up and being so excited.
Like you can totally picture it,

262
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:27,470
right like this that are like Yay and a,

263
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,710
it only took a minute or two and maybe
even three to realize no one was making

264
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:35,711
eye contact with me because it turns
out in that room it was the Mbas who had

265
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:42,200
the ability to qualify for having ideas.
Seeing through that category,

266
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,580
not for everyone.

267
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,340
In later jobs it would be engineers where
the people, we expect it to have ideas,

268
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:51,050
not marketing people.
Ob,

269
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,970
you might recognize that one or in
other jobs it's only the top executive

270
00:15:55,971 --> 00:16:00,020
management team is allowed to have ideas,
not this other group.

271
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,310
And so this thing about groupings ended
up showing up throughout my career and

272
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:07,760
tech throughout all the different ways
in which I was driving strategy and

273
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:08,201
innovation.

274
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,870
I'm realizing that's actually the
biggest limiting factor is that we're not

275
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,980
noticing the one thing that
actually counts the individual
that's standing right

276
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:18,590
in front of us.
Invisible to some,

277
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,960
but purely able to offer that perspective,
that idea that they have.

278
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,920
Sometimes they're invisible to themselves.
I'm not suggesting it's just external,

279
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,550
but it is denying the power of the
singular voice and making invisible that

280
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:41,510
which has value simply
because the packaging,

281
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,130
not because of the idea.

282
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,320
So I'll fast forward and just point
out that this is actually a trend that

283
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,000
allows us to do innovation,
right?

284
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:54,020
So apple and Google helped
change the mobile marketplace.

285
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,050
I was around back when companies like
apple or Samsung used to actually choose

286
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,060
the APP.
The term was choosing on deck,

287
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,920
which apps they would put bride one or
two or three apps costing about a million

288
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:08,210
to $2 million in development,

289
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,280
probably about the same in
sales and marketing expense.

290
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,960
And those companies would then decide,
choose for the consumer.

291
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,410
Here's the thing they would offer.

292
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,550
An apple came along and changed
that developer platforms.

293
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:21,950
So only costs $10,000 to be able
to participate in that ecosystem,

294
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,490
allowing a marketplace of ideas
to happen in the form of apps.

295
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,870
And then Google came along and
did it one better always. And uh,

296
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:33,860
and dropped it down to 500 bucks and
change this opportunity for people to come

297
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:36,800
from anywhere, everywhere.
And be able to participate.

298
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,840
And when I started spotting that,
I was like,

299
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,060
is that a pattern that would allow a
whole bunch of people to suddenly become

300
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,160
available in the marketplace of ideas?

301
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:51,120
Could the idea transpose the immediate
of a smartphone APP or platform based

302
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,193
model?

303
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,650
And that's when I had actually coined
this term ominus it's part of a,

304
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,380
essentially it's an economic thesis,
right?

305
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,420
It's basically arguing that
value can come from anywhere.

306
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,600
Ideas come from that spot in
the world that each of us stand.

307
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,700
They can now scale and connectedness.

308
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:12,720
So you can see the two parts only
knows I should not go into marketing.

309
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,243
And uh,

310
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,210
but I was basically arguing this is the
way in which we will create value in the

311
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:19,044
future.

312
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,500
Now I still believe this, oh,
the bill's not going to work.

313
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,480
Um, it's a really pretty
build, um, the, uh,

314
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,540
the opportunity for each of us to finally
get a chance to actually stand more

315
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:42,960
deeply in our own truth and like Franklin
be able to ask new questions of our

316
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,380
workforce,
of our work environment.

317
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,360
And even outside that it could change
not only what we individually do,

318
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,520
but what we're able to create together.

319
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,040
I think to those economists
who say we've run out of ideas,

320
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,060
I think they've only counted
about 37% of the ideas,

321
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,790
the ideas that come from
traditional power base,

322
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:10,710
which in America is mostly white and
mostly male and mostly from places that

323
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:15,711
sounded like Harvard when they could
actually come from each and every single

324
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:20,670
one of us. In fact, if I could ask
you to do one little exercise with me,

325
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,260
close your eyes for a second

326
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,120
and think back to that time when you
first were valued just as yourself.

327
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,840
Somebody saw you and said,

328
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,590
this is who you are and it's special or
this is what you can do and that's good.

329
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,220
They saw some light in you,

330
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,840
some shining capacity and
wanted that to come forward.

331
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,750
Imagine now if everyone
was given that same idea

332
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,053
uppity.

333
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,810
I think that's the power
of what we can do next.

334
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,520
That each of us as we stand in that
spot in the world, only we stand in,

335
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,020
we can be rooted, deeply rooted
in our purpose. And as we do that,

336
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,980
it will help us find the people who
care about the same things as we do.

337
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,230
And as we do that, we end up being able
to actually shape the world around us,

338
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,740
to not just include those
opinions that are currently herd,

339
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,460
but the set of opinions that
are everywhere that can shape,

340
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:36,110
reshape the world to include all of our
voices in a much more equal and fair way.

341
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,350
And also of course allow
us the power to innovate.

342
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,570
So that's what I came to say and share
and the rest of the time is really just

343
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:48,880
about, um, a chance to do Q
and. A. An ob can come comment.

344
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,540
She probably even has a question knowing
her, but we'll pass along the mic too.

345
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,270
Um, you can ask anything from,
what's it like to write a book?

346
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,090
Because some people like to
ask that question, uh, to go.

347
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,380
Excellent. So just put your hand
up and I'll pass you the light,

348
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,990
the Mike so people can hear it.
Um,

349
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,870
so I'm going to kick off with a question.

350
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:15,010
So one of the things that intrigued
me about only enos and this sort of,

351
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,333
um,

352
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,620
relationship between the individual and
the groups is that when we talk about

353
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:24,940
diversity and inclusion, um, we often
talk about specific groups, right?

354
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,930
Like women or gay
people, et Cetera, right?

355
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,850
And as we kind of experienced
at Google this summer,

356
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:33,940
that can be very exclusionist and
people sort of saying like, well,

357
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:35,650
why are you giving
privilege to this group?

358
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:38,590
Or why did that group have privilege
in the first place? And so on.

359
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,110
And so one of the things that I think
is interesting about this is that you

360
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,420
bringing it back to the
individual rather than the group.

361
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,070
So can you talk a little bit about that,

362
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:49,600
what the implications would be if we
thought about diversity and inclusion in a

363
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,350
different way?

364
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,960
Sure. Um, so in fact, uh,

365
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,770
I felt so bad for the situation that
happened the summer because it was

366
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:59,830
completely predictable
that if you start doing,

367
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,840
oh we're going to try
to include this group,

368
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,040
it feels to the group on the other side
of the teeter tot that power is being

369
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,020
displaced,
that they're being replaced.

370
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,120
And if we're actually talking
about a limited some of the pie,

371
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,280
then you understand where people
were fighting over that pie.

372
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,080
This model actually says
something different, right?

373
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:21,310
Which is that as you open
up the opportunity more
opportunity exists just like

374
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:24,940
that apple example. So let's
just use a specific, there was a,

375
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,710
in fact you helped me find this story.

376
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,500
So one of the stories in the
book is a story of folded.

377
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,610
Does anybody know this story
by any chance? Cheater.

378
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,120
She spread the buck and so fold it is a,

379
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,730
as an online platform that was started,

380
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,390
I'm based out of University of Washington
and they were trying to solve the

381
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,890
problem in the bio
sciences space where um,

382
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,460
if if proteins fold incorrectly,
they basically caused disease bottom line.

383
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,660
And so things like Alzheimer's and stuff
are all diseases caused by misfolded

384
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:56,320
proteins.

385
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,310
And they were realizing this Udab team
that every research team around the world

386
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:04,660
was recreating the problem of how proteins
were misfolding in order to do the

387
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:07,540
actual research they wanted to do. And
they thought, this is kind of silly.

388
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:11,230
There ought to be like a repository you
can draw on so that the foundational

389
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:14,890
work is there and people can build on it.
Therefore accelerating the research.

390
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,600
And they started an online app to
basically crowd science this process.

391
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:22,270
And at first they thought
their first step was, um,

392
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,390
we're going to get PhDs from around the
world. So think globalization talent,

393
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:28,510
right? And that didn't turn out
to have any breakthroughs at all.

394
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:32,320
They let it run for almost a year.
And so then I thought, oh, you know,

395
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,500
maybe there's another way.
What if we actually allow anyone,

396
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,410
could we actually allow anyone,
quite possibly everyone to participate?

397
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,990
Why don't we build a game that
would teach you the fundamentals?

398
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:44,230
Like basically teaching how proteins
fold and then you can take it from there.

399
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,160
And that created more resolve.

400
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:49,550
But then they realized actually there
was some there watching the game and

401
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:53,450
noticing that people were crowding
around the people who had degrees from

402
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:58,451
certain schools or that were men and not
actually noticing who actually was good

403
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,460
at the protein folding problem.

404
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,430
And they could spot the difference
because they themselves had actually,

405
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:06,170
you know, they were studying
it and they just thought,

406
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:10,850
what if we actually hide those social
signals and just tune them down so that if

407
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:13,670
you really want to know, you could
know. But the focus is entirely on,

408
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,690
oh that's working better. And people
can notice that. That was one thing.

409
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:21,200
And then the other thing they started to
do was they actually just realize they

410
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:25,130
were rewarding individuals
instead of rewarding group work.

411
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,090
So most work today is complex problem
solving, complex problem solving.

412
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:31,640
It's not ob sitting by herself
or Nyla for sitting by herself.

413
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,680
It's how we start to play off each other.

414
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,220
And so then as soon as they change the
reward system to be, we all went together.

415
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:39,950
If we all help each other go through
this thing, they'd share in the credit.

416
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,980
It changed how people actually
responded and what they work.

417
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,900
And then they created
these like breakthroughs.

418
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,800
So I think the problem is most of us have
too many social signals in the way and

419
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,360
we're focusing on that
instead of the work.

420
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,040
And so I don't think about
diversity inclusion as I want. Um,

421
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,980
I want to go recruit x number of people.

422
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,940
It's what problems do
we have and what is the,

423
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,480
what is the mechanism in place that would
allow a whole bunch of people to come

424
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:11,240
and play with that problem?
So if I'm really practical,

425
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,980
when I was doing consulting work, one of
the things we would do is go in and um,

426
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,740
uh, you know, we'd signed a
contract with the company and say,

427
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:20,030
we're going to come help
you solve x problem.

428
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:24,110
And this was typically after they had
failed at it themselves and hired a BCG or

429
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,940
Mckinsey or whatever and
failed at it with them.

430
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,710
And then we were in the
room and we would say,

431
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,260
we're going to be in charge
of the process. They would,

432
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:31,790
of course not their
head because by the way,

433
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:35,450
who wants to be in charge of the process
and completely signed off to that,

434
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,090
right? Like without a thought.
And then the first day we'd say,

435
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:40,880
well we're going to send out an email to
anyone in the company and he, you know,

436
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,560
like as broad of a group as possible.

437
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,660
Sometimes the entire
company roster and say,

438
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:46,850
anybody who wants to come
help us with this can come.

439
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,690
And they would always have this like
total look of panic go across their face.

440
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,860
Like, I don't want that ad mat or the
salesperson who's not happy or that,

441
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,053
you know,

442
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,480
like it's almost like a thought that was
going through your head is I don't want

443
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,090
the crazy and I'm putting that in
air quotes for a reason. Right.

444
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:05,750
I don't want the crazy or the wild one
in the room because we have a process to

445
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:08,810
run. And I'm like, trust us,
we'll actually get there.

446
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,110
And as soon as you could have all that
difference around the room and allow each

447
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:17,540
different to actually have their own
voice to create the space for that.

448
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,870
So it could be sometimes we had post its
and let people have their ideas and it

449
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:24,230
turns out the posts that's came from
a person who had relatively low power.

450
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,340
But as soon as you disassociated
the power status to the idea,

451
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,760
you could see the idea for what it
was. Then all of a sudden two, three,

452
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:34,370
four weeks later we'd have this
breakthrough in the room. It always,

453
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,580
I mean always I say this universally came
from that crazy and wild person in the

454
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:45,300
room and so how do we do that
then for all of our organizations,

455
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:49,350
how do we actually start to go take
down the signals, tune it down?

456
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:52,770
So how do we recruit engineering people
without knowing that they're a woman

457
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:53,311
first?
Right.

458
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,090
The data says that if we don't know that
we're more likely to use that person's

459
00:26:57,091 --> 00:27:00,090
code. So how do we just
engineer more in the system,

460
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,420
a way to tune down social signals and so
that easy practical thing of using post

461
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:10,770
its in a room to generate ideas is to
have going around the room because we're

462
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:14,100
more likely to dismiss an idea based
on power status. Would be an easy one.

463
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,570
There's probably a hundred
of those methods that could
just be streamlined into

464
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:22,350
the business that would allow us to
actually see and contribute those ideas.

465
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,740
Soon as you focus on the
ideas and not on the person.

466
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:27,150
I think we start to change things

467
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,220
too,
and by the way,

468
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:33,960
the best protein folder in their set
was an admin assistant for Manchester,

469
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:34,890
England,
so

470
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,290
who by the way,
it's not,

471
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:39,590
it's not irrelevant to this given
the climate of sexual harassment.

472
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:44,620
She had left the industry because as a
nurse she had experienced so much sexism

473
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:46,760
that she actually left the medical field.

474
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,320
This is a pattern that we've seen
over and over again in recent weeks.

475
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:54,530
If you read all the vignettes of the
stories of people leaving Hollywood or

476
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:57,830
people leaving tech, it's so
much sexist. I'm just, you know,

477
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,490
at some point you're like, okay,
okay, I give up, I'll leave, I'll,

478
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,480
I'll tone down my ambitions.

479
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,720
I'll go to more female oriented careers
and of course that's why women don't

480
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:07,940
have as much power and
status in industries.

481
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,020
Really. We answered everything.
Are you guys just really shocked?

482
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,033
We have one here too.

483
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,270
Okay.

484
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,290
I guess I have a question about unlocking
the onliness early on and what was her

485
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:31,460
name again? Oh, sorry. I'm
Bridget. Bridget. If you know,

486
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:34,670
if most of the conversation
has been centered around
like your professional life,

487
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,260
how can you catch this early on?

488
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:39,590
So I'm thinking about my little sister
who's in college and when I went to visit

489
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:44,570
her I was disturbed again by the amount
of Greek life and kind of like the group

490
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:47,960
thing that centers around that and kind
of like how can I help her unlock her

491
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:52,880
ugliness earlier on? So that's my
question. Stay away from it. How Fun,

492
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:53,780
but not too much.

493
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,940
Yeah. So it's, I think one of
the things early on in life,

494
00:28:56,941 --> 00:28:58,560
we're often trying to
figure out how to fit in.

495
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,770
So we're actually giving up ourselves
along that process and we're just doing it

496
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:04,620
for basic survival. Right? So
in Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

497
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,050
the bottom two levels of
the food shelter things,

498
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,440
the top two levels are about self
expression and self actualization,

499
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:13,590
which is where ideas come from.
In the middle is this big block,

500
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:17,610
the biggest block of the, of the thing.
And it's belonging. So the question is,

501
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:20,490
do we understand how to find people
who care about the same things as us?

502
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,190
Most of us are actually socialized
to kind of look and say, okay,

503
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:25,110
where are people already gathered?

504
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,670
And then do we join in without
much intentional thought
about that's not really

505
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:30,870
my people.
Right?

506
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,190
And so this question about who are we
to one another is a question we need to

507
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:39,210
learn to ask like who am I in this mix?
And then who are we to one another?

508
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,830
And if you're asking yourself, gosh, I
really don't feel like I belong here,

509
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,660
maybe your sister really loves it,
right?

510
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,860
But to ask that and learn that skill
about who am I in relationship to this?

511
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:50,680
And uh, I had a young
entrepreneur who is, um,

512
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,890
I think she was like 20 something when
she asked me this question and she said

513
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,090
she had gotten her phd.

514
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,340
She taught is a very accomplished
young entrepreneur, um,

515
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,400
was a yoga fanatic and had a boyfriend
that she was thinking about Mary.

516
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,290
And she said,
in order for me to decide what's next,

517
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:11,410
which of these four things do I
have to cut? Should I quit teaching?

518
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,400
Do I quit doing my entrepreneurial
stuff that my phd is based on?

519
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:18,490
Do I stop all my relationships because
that's such a distraction and should I

520
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:22,540
quit yogurt, Yogi stuff? Because that's
also a distraction. And I was like,

521
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,620
why don't you do all four and live in
the Venn diagram of everything that is

522
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,500
you? And maybe because she was actually
doing really cutting edge science stuff,

523
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:36,910
which allows a cell to act like a
heart and so on. So it's incredibly,

524
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,740
has really strong ethical implications
for if you can grow things from nothing.

525
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:45,820
Right? Um, and I said,
maybe it's your Yogi,

526
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:50,560
since that will actually help guide your
ethical usage of this stuff because it

527
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:53,260
will remind you how connected we
are and what those decisions are.

528
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,400
Maybe your relationship to your students
will remind you that you're trying to

529
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:00,700
teach the next generation about those
same set of ethical implications,

530
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:03,310
not just the pure science
of it. And so on. Some,

531
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:07,420
maybe all of those things actually can
belong together because she was really

532
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:10,060
trying to figure out how to fit
herself into a pigeonhole thing.

533
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,570
It's the greatest thing we can do is to
actually notice all of the person and to

534
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:19,750
say, um, you know, what you
really seem to care about is x, Y,

535
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:21,810
and Z and B that,
um,

536
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,360
I like to say that most of us can't
understand our own onlyness. Um,

537
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,850
because we're living it, it's so obvious
to everyone else what we care about,

538
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,730
but it's actually kinda hard cause
you're in the fun of it. You're,

539
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:35,950
you're literally like mashed up
against the glass of it. Right?

540
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:41,260
And so friends can say, this is, you
know, something that you care about this.

541
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,340
Oh,
he totally gets me too.

542
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,650
So I'm like waiting for her to
tell me my loneliness for a second.

543
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:47,650
But it's like a light bulb above
your head when you walk into a room,

544
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:51,690
the whole room changes. So
if that light bulb is, um,

545
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,380
tamarind orange versus neon orange,
it's a different thing in that room.

546
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:00,190
Or you know, Mallory blue. Right? And
so if your friends can say to you,

547
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:04,210
this seems to be this thing you really
care about, it helps reflect it back.

548
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,160
And so maybe that's the one thing you
can do for her is to help notice what is

549
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:13,000
it that's so true to her
history and experience as
well as her visions and hopes

550
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,920
even something that's just a, a thread
she's ultimately going to pull on to help.

551
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,363
Okay.

552
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,190
Hi, my name is Jason Jason. Um,

553
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:28,530
I noticed that one barrier
for participation is,

554
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:32,870
is the ability to speak the
language folks employee.

555
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,200
If you are in a room
with a bunch of Mbas and,

556
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,290
and if you don't have the background
that you can hardly really talk with them

557
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,180
in, in, in those, in all those jargons
that they use. Same for engineers.

558
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:51,680
If you are a not, if you don't
have a computer science background,

559
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,890
often times you don't really
know what they're talking about.

560
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,920
And when you talk in your own language
and they can easily dismiss your ideas.

561
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,140
Do you have any comment on that?

562
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,880
No, it's, so language is one
of those invisible, um, ways
in which we group people.

563
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:12,740
Absolutely. We use jargon to say we're in
this industry in this way. And in fact,

564
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,690
the Udab team, that was one of their
big insights. Um, it was, uh, Adrian,

565
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,560
I interviewed him here. He actually
worked at Google X for awhile. Um,

566
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,660
and he said to me,

567
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:27,470
we were sitting around with one of the
top physicists in the world and he used

568
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,530
absolutely no jargon and that's what
gave him the clue to go from PhDs to go

569
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:35,270
solve this problem to citizen science.

570
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:39,350
That was the shift is Dragan was
becoming the barrier to actually allowing

571
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,184
people to innovate.

572
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,760
It's one of the reasons why in the last
five or so years actually is very little

573
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:47,230
innovation jargon. I'm
simplifying my own, um,

574
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,840
choices and, and I'm doing that
because I'm trying to make,

575
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,650
I'm trying to get past my own bullshit,
right? And I mean that and the greatest,

576
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,930
like we go through all this
training to learn stuff,

577
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,300
but sometimes you have to
go, okay, actually know that.

578
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:02,540
So now how do I communicate it?
In a much simpler and more elegant way.

579
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,850
So you've actually reached
a really profound truth,

580
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:08,690
which is most of the time most of us
are using jargon to say I'm in this club

581
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,710
and that, and that can mean
I'm educated and credentialed.

582
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,950
It can mean I'm an engineer and not one
of your marketing people that doesn't

583
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:16,850
talk this way.
Right.

584
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,450
And my husband's a chip designer and I'm
fascinated what I read his resume cause

585
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:21,920
I don't understand most of it.

586
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,320
And he asked me for some help recently
and looking at it and I was like,

587
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:27,170
well I can give you like Seth
the gist of it. You know,

588
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:30,890
like if the sentence structures right
or if like the main ideas popping out,

589
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:32,360
but I can't really talk to
you about anything else.

590
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,740
You might want to have
somebody else do that part.

591
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,850
But I was realizing like we do this
thing where we create separations,

592
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,800
partially say this is the club by men.

593
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,170
And the question is when
we're talking in meetings,

594
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:45,920
then maybe we could actually kind of what,
find a way to tone down the jargon. I,

595
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,330
you can even say that, right. Hey,

596
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:49,760
jargon might be getting in the way
for us finding a breakthrough idea.

597
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:51,740
So why don't we just figure
out how to dial it down,

598
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,600
which is why that posted example.

599
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:55,310
And I could probably give
you another 100 examples.

600
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,270
Like that can be the way to get past
language choices. It's intentionality.

601
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,060
It's intentionality.
That's a great question.

602
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,510
Hi, my name is Ada. I can lean
man Ada Lovelace. Ah, yeah.

603
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:11,060
All right. Okay. Yeah,
if you want to say that

604
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,610
I am not named after that and mark about
the pouting palindrome cause my mom's

605
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:19,150
name is Ena,
which is also a palindrome.

606
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,120
I don't know where she got
that idea from. Um, anyway. Um,

607
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,400
well there's an onlyness story there.
Uh,

608
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,580
I can only imagine the courage
you had to have, um, you know,

609
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:35,720
the to speak in that room are people who,
if I can give you eye contact,

610
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,500
um,
as Asian women died myself like that.

611
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,770
At first my English
wasn't even smooth enough.

612
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:47,040
And going into the room where people
taller and bigger, they'll guy,

613
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:50,620
I have often had that experience. And, um,

614
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,490
sometimes I really tried to fit in,
in order to make someone like notice,

615
00:35:56,491 --> 00:36:00,450
like I'm here and actually here I'm
curious like from your experience,

616
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:05,451
like how to give courage in that moment
and how do you even make your voice

617
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:06,181
heard?

618
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:11,181
Because I'm actually believed that you
need to kind of make yourself belong.

619
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,620
Then you take a step back and show that,
by the way,

620
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:19,890
I also have this uniqueness,
but I don't know,

621
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:22,200
maybe there is another way to do it.

622
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,630
The tension of how do we belong to a
group that we have to influence and also

623
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:28,610
assert our own ideas.

624
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,810
So one way is to actually have an
invisible network always there with you.

625
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,380
So there's a group of people
that you have to get along with,

626
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,710
but you can actually build an invisible
network of people in the room with you.

627
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:44,600
So for example, um, I belong to,
it's, it's in the, it's in the book.

628
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,960
I forget too. I'm a chapter
for this group called the list.

629
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,130
And it was a group of
women started, uh, um,

630
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:55,580
trying to figure how to change the
women ratio on stages in board rooms,

631
00:36:55,581 --> 00:37:00,200
et Cetera, um, entrepreneurial
settings. And so, um, the,

632
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,510
it was a private list and
so you'd ask questions like,

633
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,620
one of my favorite ones was,
so this one VC always smells my hair.

634
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,070
Should I worry about the
smelling of the hair?

635
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,840
And other people shared, actually that guy
smells. Everyone here, it's genderless.

636
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:18,650
That guy has a hair fetish.
And so the weirdest thing to discover,

637
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,190
but it became the whisper
network, um, made visible, right?

638
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:25,100
So then all of us were starting to
share stories about what was working in

639
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:28,790
venture funding, who was doing
what. It became the back channel.

640
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,870
So at any given point, I could be in a
meeting saying, I'm experiencing this.

641
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:34,360
Anyone have ideas?
And Asta Guide.

642
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:36,620
Within a couple of seconds someone
would be like, why don't you try this?

643
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,500
And it would become this.
There's,

644
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,420
there's this invisible group of 499
other people who are available on call

645
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,660
through texting to be able to
help me get through my situation.

646
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:48,620
And it could be here,

647
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:51,680
you might end up choosing five people
who are often in that room or in that

648
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:53,150
setting on your team and say,
hey,

649
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:55,500
could we actually figured out
how to help each other more,

650
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,730
be more intentional about helping
each other's ideas get promoted.

651
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,330
So maybe if somebody else's in
the room with you, they could say,

652
00:38:02,331 --> 00:38:05,930
you know what Ada just said is really
worth expanding on so that people then

653
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:09,020
draw more attention back to your idea.

654
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:13,010
If she felt it was like getting
skipped over because of that,

655
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,420
you could find ways of building a network
despite the room that you have to be

656
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:18,410
in.
Does that make sense?

657
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,160
So it's an intentionality of
design of who else could join you,

658
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,350
whether they're in the room or not.
And um,

659
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,550
figuring out how to have that set of
resources available to you that ends up

660
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:29,660
improving your social standing.

661
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:32,960
Because now you don't get to feel like
the Weirdo in the room because at any

662
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:37,510
given point you have a posse invisible
to the room that is always got your back.

663
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:41,530
And as long as you have that
social standing, you have
more confidence going in.

664
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,170
And you know,
I ended up leaving home that day,

665
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,600
but I showed up on community
college campus the next day.

666
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,840
And literally I walked down
to the financial aid office.

667
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,300
I knew the guy who happened around
the financial aid office and said,

668
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,420
so this just happened. And he said, oh.

669
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,080
And he literally took my hand and he
walked me around the campus and he

670
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:02,710
convinced three people to give me jobs.
One was a coding job,

671
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,850
one was an usher job, one was an
accounting job, the usher job,

672
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:08,050
I could do Saturday nights.

673
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,660
So I could still study the a county
job was a Friday afternoon job,

674
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,280
or once a week I would sit there and do
the history museum on campus accounting

675
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,470
and the other job I could do basic coding
to ultimately build a matriculation

676
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,600
program.
I could do it flexible hours.

677
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,170
So between classes I could show up and
do an hour worth of work here and there.

678
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,460
I literally pieced together in
that one afternoon by ability.

679
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,890
But this person wanted
me to have an education.

680
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,640
So my family did not cause
they saw me through one lens,

681
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,000
but this person belonged to
a different group. Right?

682
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:44,200
He believed in the same thing I believed,
which is that a woman, despite her,

683
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:49,470
I mean a person despite her gender can
have an education and here is something

684
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,880
he could do to come lend support.

685
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:55,750
And as soon as you end up walking away
from the people who don't believe in you

686
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,480
that you actually don't belong
to in any kind of real way,

687
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,310
you will ultimately find the people
to whom and with whom you do belong.

688
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,580
That walkway,
that gang plank is treacherous.

689
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:08,530
Like you feel like you're
going to end up nowhere,

690
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,930
but you ultimately do get there.

691
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,230
So that's what I think gives me courage
to studying all that and seeing that

692
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,550
every single one of the 300 stories had
to walk the gang plank and then they

693
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:22,510
ended up with a group of people who
actually believed in them and could stand

694
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:23,344
with them.

695
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,240
Hi, I had a question about it
turned not to be calmer now. Uh,

696
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,580
so thank you for the
topic. I think I, I have,

697
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,870
I'm a new new to Google and I think I
sometimes experience some of the things

698
00:40:36,871 --> 00:40:39,420
that you're talking about.
I think a harder I,

699
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,830
what these people have been asking is
how do you create your credibility in

700
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:47,910
front of those people who are looking for
it is not necessarily about, you know,

701
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,990
the like how much, how much language
about is you hire and whatnot.

702
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:54,550
I think what you're trying to say
is, okay, how am I make some, how,

703
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:58,710
how can I be more credit credible
to this audience? Wow. Why,

704
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:01,420
why establishing their own
credibility with, with, with the,

705
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,100
with the MBA degrees and whatnot. Yeah.
And the second point I want to make, make,

706
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:05,461
make,
make.

707
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:09,030
It is I think what you just explained
in the previous question was about the

708
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:11,880
heart offered your time to look for
mentors who can guide you through this

709
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:14,790
process. And, and it's
still at the end of the day,

710
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,270
used to how to walk that path to
make yourself credit card, you know,

711
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,100
establishing credibility for,

712
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:22,680
for these people at the group
you're trying to do the work with.

713
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,250
Yeah. It's a beautiful set of reflections.
What was your name by the way?

714
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:31,140
I'll read you a beachy, I'll
bet you I'd be shit. Um,

715
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:36,410
so, so one, one little,
I'm sorry, your first one.

716
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,930
Go back to it for a second.
It was credibility, right?

717
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:40,130
We're trying to establish credibility.

718
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,830
Most of us have been conditioned to
believe that the outside world gets to

719
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:49,040
identify for us whether or
not we have value to add.

720
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,520
This is a different thing to do,

721
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:56,120
which is to believe that you
already have something to add.

722
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,640
You already have some value to give.

723
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,380
And so that first step is how
do we conceive of ourselves
in such a way that we

724
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:08,381
understand even if we're not educated
or rapport where whatever that we have

725
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,860
value to offer and,

726
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,380
and tilt the system and then say as
I valued myself, I will get valued.

727
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,720
So just standing in that truth is probably
the biggest step because I mean I do

728
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:24,650
this all the time. I had,
I was just emailing with a
girlfriend and a and saying,

729
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:28,370
I'm having a really hard time with some
of the speaking work I'm doing because

730
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:28,851
she said,
well,

731
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:32,630
what you're trying to say is this is the
biggest manager meant idea ever, right?

732
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:37,070
Which is if we're going to be able
to create ideas out of people,

733
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,590
and that's the entire economy.

734
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,920
What you're saying is only next is
the biggest management idea ever.

735
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:45,680
Because as you lead people and
recognize that their individuality,

736
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:49,760
you will actually create the kinds of
teams, organizations, blah, blah, blah,

737
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:52,910
that will actually create outcomes.
That is a huge idea.

738
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:55,310
And I wrote back to her and I said,
yeah, that's really easy if you say it,

739
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,040
but by the way,
the whole world hasn't started yet.

740
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:02,900
So for me to assert that as a truth
feels crazy for you to assert that as a

741
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:06,710
truth does not. And then I shut
the computer and I went, yeah.

742
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:10,760
So I'm having a hard time owning my own
laziness. Right. Totally. It's just,

743
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:12,290
it's this weird thing cause
what I'm waiting for us,

744
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:15,590
I'm credentialed moment to say

745
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:23,030
you're allowed to claim something
as an idea. And so, so it's just a,

746
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:26,110
it's just a flip to actually say I can't,

747
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,480
I can actually claim that and
there's enough data and the system,

748
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,710
there's enough signals in the system
to say that's it's based on evidence.

749
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,980
The research has been done, the social
science behind it backs at. Right.

750
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,560
But I still can't make myself say it.
Does that make sense?

751
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,630
So I understand what you're
talking about about influence,

752
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:45,620
but the first step is about how do you
conceive of yourself because it changes

753
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:46,580
the value equation.

754
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,770
So I think actually for
those us who have children,

755
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:54,550
that's probably the biggest gift
we can give our kids is to not have

756
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:55,990
expectations or what they're going to do,

757
00:43:55,991 --> 00:44:00,400
but just give them the confidence that
whatever they choose to do, they can do.

758
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,430
So. Yeah. Alright. We have
time for one more question.

759
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,390
He wants to bring it home.
Okay.

760
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,370
Otherwise we're going to end it on that.
And thank you so much for coming in.

761
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,250
[inaudible]. Thank you for those of
you who joined us on the livestream.

762
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,740
Thanks.
Thanks for us to great conversation.
