1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,280
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,240
Thank you all for joining us for another
iteration of authors at Google where we

3
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:17,850
are very pleased to welcome Cindy Padua.
I hope actually I pronounced that right.

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,160
It fell to ask. Okay. Um,

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,950
so in recent months we've had the good
fortune here to host many leading lights.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,270
Uh, you know, we had, uh,

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,640
a Barney frank and more
recently David Duchovny,

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,330
but today's guest puts all of
those to shame. Uh, we're, uh,

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,970
happy to have a pre pre eminent
scholar of the Victorian computing era,

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,070
uh, among us a Sydney Pedro
who hails from Canada,

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,570
did her, uh, her schoolwork at, uh,

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,140
University of Alberta where she got
a phd apparently in footnotes. Um,

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,720
and has a sense become both an impressive
comic artists in a impressive scholar

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,290
of the history of early computing.
Um, and as I was just saying to her,

15
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,380
I'm very glad that she reads all the
primary source materials so that I don't

16
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,440
have to,
uh,

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,880
because there's quite a copious amount
of it and I am truly impressed by the

18
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:22,410
depth to which she has, uh,
she has explored it. Uh,

19
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:24,600
so I guess without further ado,

20
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:29,601
we'll welcome Sydney to tell us all
about Lovelace and Babbage and marvelous

21
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,110
history of computing.

22
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,030
Ah, thanks. Hi. Um, my
name is Sydney Padua.

23
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,570
Uh, I don't have a phd, I
should hasten to say, um,

24
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,630
I'm actually, uh, so this is me.

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,190
I am just a random cartoonist,
uh,

26
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:57,540
and also a VFX artists.
Um, most of the time I,

27
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,450
um, uh, can be found, uh,

28
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,040
making imaginary monsters appear to
attack people for the movies. Um,

29
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,690
I,
um,

30
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,740
came from hand drawn animation many
years ago I worked on iron giant,

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,810
which I'm just filling a lot
of people really like. Uh, um,

32
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,420
since then I've moved on
to, uh, computers where, um,

33
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,340
apparently I work on
blue and orange movies.

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,590
Um, when I have to say
it's, it's really, um, uh,

35
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,960
very strange and hilarious.
In five years ago,

36
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:34,560
if you told me I would be giving
a talk on computers at Google a,

37
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,320
I would have laughed in your
face because I was a very,

38
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:41,820
very reluctant convert a to computer
animation. Um, I've always, uh,

39
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,110
distracted dysplastic
computers. Um, I was, uh,

40
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,800
probably the last person to
be dragged backwards, uh,

41
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,080
with my finger nails
digging into the carpet, uh,

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,340
into CG from hand drawn
animation. Um, but, uh,

43
00:02:56,341 --> 00:03:00,970
the reason I'm here is because
of these two crazy kids. Um,

44
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,630
so that, so eight Ada, this
and Charles Babbage. Um,

45
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,140
I think a lot of people know their
story roughly from computer science 101.

46
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,940
You kind of get the quick rundown.
Um,

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,890
Charles Babbage occasion professor
of mathematics at Cambridge, um,

48
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,610
the position once held by
Newton and currently held I
believe by Stephen Hawking.

49
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,860
Um, so he's pretty clever. Um, he, uh,

50
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,870
was famous in his own time for, uh,
this mysterious calculating machine,

51
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,500
which was perpetually
planned and never built, um,

52
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,680
which we would never recognize as a
computer. And it is really amazing.

53
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:43,660
Their computer, as I'll talk about a
bit later. Um, the other person in that,

54
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,580
uh, duo is, um, it'll Lovelace.
She was born eight Gordon,

55
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,960
uh, probably better known as eight, eight,

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,320
a Gordon Daughter of George Gordon,
better known as Lord Byron,

57
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,390
the infamous poet. Um, I personally,
I learned about these people,

58
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,980
um, when I was in a pub in
London with a friend of mine,

59
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:10,930
Sue Sherman Anderson, who started
this thing called Ada Lovelace day,

60
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,790
which you might be familiar with.
Um,

61
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,780
it's a sort of an online blogging
festival every year to celebrate women in

62
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:20,830
computing and raise their profile.
Um, and she said to me, Sydney, here,

63
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:24,710
a woman in tech, now you should do a
blog post rate all of these day. Um,

64
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,590
and I said,
I don't even know who I love lists is.

65
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,480
I'm also not really a woman in
tech. I work on tech in tech. Um,

66
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,570
but I went to Wikipedia like
anybody else would. And uh,

67
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,680
there are found this extraordinary story,
um,

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,290
about Lovelace who,
uh,

69
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,050
was raised by mathematicians so that she
would not become a crazy poet like her

70
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:51,890
father. And it had this very much a feel
of a superhero origin story. You know,

71
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,740
it had had that Nice angsty
backstory, um, conflict, uh, oh,

72
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,870
that would make a really
cute little comic.

73
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,430
And I thought because
I didn't know who love,

74
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,360
I suppose that I should probably a nice
idea for blog posts would just be a

75
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,590
short little comic. I did it. And as a
strip, so it's like it's about this long.

76
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,840
Um, just explaining where had a lovely
says and I did it like this. Um,

77
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,300
so yeah, I mean this is all true. Um,

78
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,920
I can now verify having read a hell
of a lot of letters. I'm sorry.

79
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,700
Heck of a lot of letters. Um, that, uh,

80
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,460
lovely says mother was very
concerned that she become,

81
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,070
that should not become poetical.
Um,

82
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:35,071
which I believe was a Victorian
euphemism for not lady like or wild.

83
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,453
Um,

84
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,870
so she had a tutored in
mathematics and logic. Um,

85
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,420
she met Babbage at a party in 1833.
How is the best place to meet someone?

86
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,710
And he's leaning there on
the only working fragment.

87
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:54,790
I'm a machine that he built, um, that's
a fragment of the difference engine,

88
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:59,480
which was a calculator. Um, you can
actually see that I that a piece,

89
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,460
a beautiful machine, um, made of
brass in the science museum in London.

90
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:09,110
It's about this big, and you could
turn a crank and it could turn out, uh,

91
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,920
you know, some little
calculations. Um, at this party,

92
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:16,400
apparently someone said a,
as everyone gazed upon the machine,

93
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,440
like savages looking at or looking glass,

94
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,300
only eight of Byron understood the true
beauty of the machine and understand its

95
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:27,740
function. Um, she sort
hanging out with Babbage, um,

96
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,520
for a while she became very fascinated
with this machine and in fact obsessed

97
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:38,160
with analytical engine. Um, and uh,

98
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,930
wrote of course a famous paper about it,
which I'll talk about it in a bit.

99
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,940
I'm having, this was a very short comic.
I should stress the original comic, uh,

100
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,810
was maybe four pages long laid out.

101
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,760
And of course I reached the end,
which is a really stupid ending.

102
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,210
That beverage doesn't build this machine
and a lovely sties at 36 and it's a

103
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,510
hundred years before there's another
computer. So this was a real dead end,

104
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,750
unfortunately in computing history.
Um,

105
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,990
and I think I knocked this whole
comic out in an evening. Um,

106
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:14,840
and when I reached this panel, it
was about midnight and I thought, oh,

107
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,960
I can't end it like that. Um,
you know, that's terrible.

108
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:22,490
So I just throw in as
a joke, this panel. Um,

109
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,920
I think I was aware of steam
punk as a thing that existed. Um,

110
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,060
so I just kind of threw them in fabulous
clothes and gave them ray guns and sort

111
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:36,030
of resurrected them
briefly as a punchline. Um,

112
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,510
I think I was thinking of the Avengers,

113
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,640
it's uncanny
the,

114
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:50,900
so I kind of put their through their comic
up online on my blog and went to bed.

115
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:54,170
And then when I woke up this and the next
morning it was turning up all over the

116
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:59,171
internet as this person is going to do a
comic in which Ada Lovelace and Charles

117
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,430
Babbage fight crime. It was a joke. Um,

118
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,090
I succumb easily to peer pressure
and also I was putting off working on

119
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:15,140
something else. Um, so I started
drawing comics about, hey,

120
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,930
lovely son Charles Babbage fighting crime.
Um,

121
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,480
anyone who's read the comic will tell
you this is a very sporadic, uh, comic.

122
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,560
Um, uh, they fight crime.
They find it quite badly.

123
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,800
Um,
it's quite a silly comic.

124
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:35,240
I should stress anyone expecting a very
serious comic about Victorian competing

125
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:38,670
is going to be out of luck
because it's quite silly. Um,

126
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,460
especially because their chief enemies
of course as they were in life are poetry

127
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:47,850
and street music, which choice beverages,

128
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,660
famous bugbear was, uh, was street music.

129
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,300
So that's kind of his main
nemesis is the organist

130
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,960
aside from silly comics.
If you look at the book,

131
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,270
you'll notice there's quite a
lot of words in it for a comic.

132
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,820
This is because as I was
doing the blog, um, I,

133
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:09,654
um,

134
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,410
I became very obsessed with reading kind
of all the wonderful primary documents

135
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,790
that were turning up online.
Um,

136
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,890
in a sense the footnotes are a
joke on lovely. His famous paper,

137
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:27,120
which you can see on Google books.
This is it. As it originally appeared.

138
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,280
Um, loveless wrote her paper
at it again as a translation.

139
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,770
Um,
Babbage himself never wrote,

140
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:38,340
never published anything on his own,

141
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,090
a machine or anything in detail.
And of course,

142
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,730
women did not normally
publish scientific papers.

143
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:47,520
This was not something
that was done. Um, however,

144
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:51,000
there was a space for
women to do translations.

145
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,410
It says a sort of a lady like
accomplishment. Um, so when this paper,

146
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:58,650
this is Minna Braya, um, a guy,

147
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,320
he eventually became prime minister
of Italy at the time he was a guy, um,

148
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,530
at a conference where Babish spoken,
described his machine,

149
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,610
Middlebury took notes, he
published the notes in French. Um,

150
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,660
a year later Lovelace translated the notes
from the French into the English. Um,

151
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,520
and again,

152
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,420
adding footnotes because actually right
along and she herself was considered an

153
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,720
expert on Babbage's machine at
this time. Um, mostly by, um,

154
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,570
hanging out and continually begging
him for their plans. Um, uh,

155
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,260
so she was known as someone
who knew a lot about it.

156
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,180
That's why she was asked to
translate the paper. Um, but,

157
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,020
um, as she kind of went down
the translation, she began
to add footnotes saying,

158
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,820
oh, actually I have a much clearer
illustration of this. Or in fact, um,

159
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,990
you know, another way to say
this is this, um, are a lot,

160
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:55,170
I think to some extent she is actually
writing the footnotes to Babbage because

161
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,340
she often says things like,

162
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,850
I don't know if this has occurred to
the creator of the calculating machine,

163
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:04,020
but I have this drink, their idea
about how this could actually work.

164
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,590
Um, and this is one of those
notes where she says, um,

165
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,490
this is the first appearance of general
computing theory in enabling the

166
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:15,870
mechanism to combine together general
symbols in successes of unlimited variety

167
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:19,650
and extent. The United link is,
and she goes on, she's Victorian.

168
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:23,430
So these sentences get extremely lengthy.
Um,

169
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,140
if you battle your way through this paper,

170
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,570
you'll see it's not the most
readable thing in the world,

171
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,810
but it is wonderful and it
can be found on Google books,

172
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,360
which is my favorite thing in the world.

173
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:37,000
And which is why I'm so delighted
always to speak to Google because I'm,

174
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,230
this entire comic would not have been
possible without the incredible Cornucopia

175
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:47,250
of amazing documents that were poured out.
Uh,

176
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,570
right around 2009 whenever
down the comic, um, uh,

177
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,090
Google books was dumping
basically all this, uh,

178
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,530
19th century FEMARA online. And so, um,

179
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,640
I should stress, again, I'm not a proper
scholar, I am just some random clown,

180
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:08,260
but the great power there will
books is that, um, uh, I'm not,

181
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,410
I don't have to go through some specific
place in an archive and know him and

182
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,860
I'm looking for, I can just
type yeah. Babin street music,

183
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,360
1839 to 70 and you would get
amazing amounts of stuff.

184
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,200
Um, this is what it looks like
in situ. Great. Kat. I agree.

185
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,820
Calculator and it does have the
famous problem solver. Babbage. Um,

186
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,720
I think the first thing I
was surprised define when I
started, um, my research, uh,

187
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:37,170
was how famous Babbage was. Um, this is
actually from the Salt Lake City News.

188
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,640
Um,

189
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,670
and Babbage was famous enough that fed
the Salt Lake City news would run like a

190
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,440
kind of some random anecdotes about him.
I also,

191
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,670
I like this because of the pockets.

192
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:51,510
Cigar case free to smoke
because if times it's fun. Um,

193
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,530
this is a great set of anecdotes.
This is in the book. Um,

194
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,400
I believe in this actually. Um, they've
come some lovely stuff in the end.

195
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:01,860
I think she says,
um,

196
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,190
our family is an alternate stratification
of poetry in mathematics. Uh,

197
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,100
along the line there.
Um,

198
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,650
also to get a sense of the Victorian era.

199
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,040
A clever woman is one who's abilities
never unpleasantly fountain by the rest of

200
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,580
the world. Um, so yeah,

201
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,880
I found just fantastic stuff.
Oh,

202
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:25,420
he's calculating machine was an endless
subject of monologue mode of people

203
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:29,590
remark on beverages, tendency to go on
and on about his calculating machine.

204
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,370
Um, what else? Uh, of course it wasn't
only Google that I found stuff in.

205
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:40,090
This is, I'm the general method
of my approaching the comics,

206
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,560
whereas I would run around and meet
a bunch of primary documents and a,

207
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:47,110
and then just riff on it
basically on a comic. Um,

208
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:51,970
this is from when Queen Victoria's
diaries were digitized and put online. So,

209
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:55,530
of course immediately searched Babbage,
um,

210
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,160
who was by the way very obsessed with
what other people thought about him.

211
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,780
He used to keep a scrapbook with
all of his news clippings in it. Uh,

212
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,560
this, this is a classic
Babbage quotation Lord Damn,

213
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:10,130
that's Lord Melbourne has said beverage
has made a great full of himself as he

214
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:14,180
does everywhere. Uh, parole
beverage. Um, he was,

215
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,350
he had many, many fantastic
talents, but um, uh,

216
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,610
he did have some issues
socializing properly with people.

217
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,800
Um, so that's Queen Victoria
on Charles Babbage. Um,

218
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,890
this is Babbage's punch a
on the great exhibition.

219
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,500
He's very angry at only being honorable.

220
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,390
We mentioned is that all scandalous,
uh,

221
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,570
to go into the great exhibition of 1851.
Um,

222
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,300
he was very angry that they didn't
put his calculating machine in there.

223
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,960
I think the feeling was that it, uh, that
people would not understand what it was.

224
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,580
Um, which I think shows a sad, uh,

225
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,880
underestimation of the British public.

226
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,950
I think people would have
thought it was great. Um,

227
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,740
I like this one beverage to the
logger with medical Frankenstein.

228
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,600
That's from Google books.
Um,

229
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,500
I tod is a ton of primary
documents, a in a, in the book.

230
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:10,880
I'm probably too many apparently. Um, uh,

231
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:14,100
this is 1833,
the New York Mirror oh five.

232
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,850
You need good eyes to
read this one oh five.

233
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,480
It is said that eight of Byron
sole daughter of a Nobel Bard.

234
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:23,070
It's the most course and
vulgar woman in England, uh,

235
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,290
which I do have her swear
a fair bit.

236
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,670
So that's sourced. Uh, anyone's,

237
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,480
anyone's dubious about the
historical accuracy of, uh, at,

238
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:39,680
you'll notice these, these wrong
coverups here that is also source.

239
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:44,681
Faberge did in fact invented an error
pop up for the analytical engine.

240
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,130
Um,
believe it or not,

241
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,680
if any mistake had been made by
the attendant and the wrong law,

242
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,640
the rear of them had been accidentally
given to the engine at the proper place

243
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:57,050
of ca plate above the raw, the rhythm
with the word wrong engraved on it.

244
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,870
He later as the continually
ringing round loud bell,

245
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,840
which I'm sure would be
absolutely delightful if you
were the attendant trying

246
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:05,960
to hunt down this error
in this gigantic machine.

247
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,810
So this is Lovelace debugging a,

248
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,210
one of these error popups
here with a crow bar,

249
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,510
which is the only way you can
debug the analytical engine.

250
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,720
Um, yeah, so, so this is
just my joke on the subject.

251
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,710
Let's see. Our Lady Lovelace's
getting on some cartoons squares,

252
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:28,410
but I want to say because
this is being recorded, uh,

253
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,960
that's a special language we're
developing just for the engine. Um,

254
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,850
so amongst anything Babbage's Lovelace,
we're actually both very funny people.

255
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:41,720
People tended to remark on them as being
eccentric and tell stories about how

256
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:45,290
strange they were. But amongst all
the wonderful things in Google books,

257
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,760
this is by far my favorite.

258
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,010
This was a really magical find that
would only have been possible with Google

259
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:56,300
books because this is from a
thing called the southern review,

260
00:16:56,301 --> 00:17:01,220
which was this short live journal
out of, I believe Maryland. Um,

261
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,090
it's,
it's,

262
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,510
it was put out in 1867 this is from a,

263
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,080
to celebrate the culture of the south
and the wake of the civil war. Um, any,

264
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,890
what we'd like is a church circular.

265
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,040
It's clippings from all sorts of
random stuff happening around Maryland.

266
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,500
Generally speaking,
uh, but one of them is,

267
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:25,501
is basically your basic letter home to
the folks from the guy who took a trip to

268
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,220
Europe. Um, uh,

269
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:31,310
this is Walter Reed who's a
wonderful writer by the way.

270
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,900
He was actually from Pennsylvania,

271
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:37,850
a English professor there and he writes
by far the most vivid description of

272
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:40,730
Babbage, um, that I found from the period.

273
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,470
This is actually a letter from
1854. Um, I don't know why they,

274
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,780
I guess they had some space to fill
in the old southern review, uh,

275
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,920
10 years later, cause I'm a, I'm
not quite sure why they put it in.

276
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:56,790
They put it in the entire letter,
which is about 13 pages long. Um,

277
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,940
and he meets a several people,
but one of them is Babbage. Um,

278
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,140
and there's just a magical section.
This is about two years after love,

279
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:05,930
they said died.
Um,

280
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,170
and we get here after he got up to
go by some chance of conversation.

281
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:13,530
The late lady Lovelace's name, Lord
Byron Starter, Ada was mentioned.

282
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,330
He knew her intimately and spoke highly
of her mathematical powers and ever

283
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,050
peculiar capability higher. He said
the, that of anyone he knew to prepare,

284
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:27,030
I believe it was the
descriptions connected with is
calculating machine. I fear,

285
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:30,630
I'm not expressing myself rightly here
as to the precise nature of the subject.

286
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,110
Um, and I think he's talking
about the programs here. Um,

287
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,100
the descriptions of how the
machine would go through a problem.

288
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,170
Um, so this is, um, uh,

289
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,810
this is something that would not have
been found without Google search.

290
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,820
Basically.
If you were Babbage scholar,

291
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,050
I can't see any conceivable reason you
would be reading through every single

292
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:56,760
issue or the southern review.
1867. Um, so yeah, thank you.

293
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:01,260
Google. Um, it's a, it's a,
it's just a magical thing.

294
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,570
Um, so, um, the other kind
of stream of research I took,

295
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,280
um, was regarding the
analytical engine. Um,

296
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,830
in addition to all these ideas,

297
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,970
all these wonderful primary documents
that were extremely evocative of beverage

298
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:18,620
and lovely says people. They're
extremely vivid personalities. Um,

299
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,640
and they write all their
own material and they have,

300
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,810
they come up with great gags for
themselves and great dialogue. Um,

301
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,250
but there's sort of a third character
in the comic and that was always the

302
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:34,080
analytical engine. Um, as I said,
I'm not a computer person. Um,

303
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,180
I, uh, um, so for me when I
tended to draw the engine,

304
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:43,890
it's this vast building
sized labyrinth of confusion.

305
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,590
Um, people tend to get lost
and attacked in it. But, uh,

306
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:52,170
I guess as I guess I was
drawing the comic, I began, um,

307
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,680
gain being really frustrated by the
fact that I'm pretty much every book,

308
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,330
even fairly specialists
books on the engine. Uh,

309
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:03,330
would a say it was exactly
like a modern computer,

310
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:06,780
but it's too complicated for
you to understand it. Um,

311
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,440
and also they wouldn't give
me a drawing of the engine,

312
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,940
which I'm really as a comic artists.

313
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,410
I wanted to see a drawing of a huge ash,

314
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,300
huge ass engine made of, made of cogs.
Um, you know, it's just eye candy.

315
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:24,240
So, um, uh,

316
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,370
I had to actually make one myself so you
can get a sense of what this engine was.

317
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:32,580
Um, a lot of you are familiar. Sorry.

318
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:37,350
This is my own video and I know I
shot it like a newb in portrait. Um,

319
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,780
so this is the beautiful, uh, let me know,

320
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,773
turn on the sound

321
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,700
difference engine. Um, but they
still in mountain view California.

322
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,390
It's has then demonstrating it for me,
which is just wonderful of them.

323
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,370
You can hate me
like an idiot over it.

324
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,840
Beautiful arms of the
backer carrying the ones.

325
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,160
Um,
so that's the difference engine,

326
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,240
huge machine and it's incredibly
beautiful and incredibly clever.

327
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,600
But that's not the analytical
Andrea. Um, there's tons of damage.

328
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,290
The difference engine and the
analytical engine, um, the, uh,

329
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,500
different centers is essentially an
adder. Uh, it, it really only has,

330
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:31,860
it hasn't a very specific
way and a very clever way,

331
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,860
but it can only add, um,
right around the 1830s,

332
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,950
early 1830s, um, pretty much
one Babbage met love these. Um,

333
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,590
he, uh, he began to think,
what if you could take the,

334
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:50,980
some that came out of one
end of the engine and put it
back in the other end. Um,

335
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,840
he described this as the
engine eating its own tail. Um,

336
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,940
so he devised a second machine,
uh, the analytical engine.

337
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,730
Um, he, they didn't
build either of them. Um,

338
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,280
partly because, um, it's
just really super hard.

339
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:10,080
I think a lot of people ask me,
you know,

340
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:14,730
why didn't Babbage build the analytical
engine? It's actually really, really,

341
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:18,720
really hard to build a giant
computer entirely made of cogs.

342
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,440
It's not a disgrace not to complete it.
Um,

343
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:27,660
Babbage also kept changing the plans.
Um, so this is the famous, um, plan 25,

344
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,880
um, it's the most beautiful and
the most complete baptist plans.

345
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:36,570
This is from 1840. So this is the machine
that lovelies would have been writing,

346
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,740
uh, her paper about. Um, so I,

347
00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:42,690
I mean at first as you know,

348
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,760
a comic artist who is not very clever,
I left at this picture and said,

349
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,260
Ooh, and then I said, I have no
idea what I'm looking at here. Um,

350
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,580
so in order to draw the
machine, um, accurately,

351
00:22:56,581 --> 00:23:00,300
I had to basically go in and start doing
elevations and hunt down as many of

352
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:03,870
Babbage's, um, diagrams as I could. Um,

353
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:06,900
it was by no means straight forward,
um,

354
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,980
to do an image of this.
Um,

355
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,640
partly because I'm Babish wasn't
very good at, at, at, at, at,

356
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:21,450
at showing complete elevations.
Um, so this is very much a,

357
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:24,840
an interpretation of me. But, uh, anyway,

358
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:28,340
this is possibly the first,
um,

359
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,970
visualization of the entire engine.

360
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,820
MMM.

361
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,460
You may go, Ooh, because it
took me forever. Thank you.

362
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:39,294
Thank you very much.

363
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,190
There's the punch cards at the bottom.
I'll actually show you I'm in animation.

364
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,870
Um, how I believe it works because it's
much clearer. There's a lot going on.

365
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,280
Basically you have storage,
uh, going down the back here,

366
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:58,490
this is a whole line of
gears. Um, for Babish,

367
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:01,130
this machine was pretty much acts,

368
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,710
I mean exclusively and
machine for doing arithmetic.

369
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,610
The entire bulk of this
thing, um, is numerical.

370
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,290
So these columns,

371
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,970
each of these columns represents a
number with 50 decimal places. Um,

372
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:18,620
so each little gear has a number
from one to 10. It's decimal a on it.

373
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,090
So you set this to five, this to two,
and then you have 25. There's two, three.

374
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:25,070
You have 325 so it just goes up.

375
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,990
And so if you have a column of 50 gears,
it's a column of,

376
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:33,480
of number of 50 decimal places.
Um, 50 is a lot of decimal basis.

377
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,250
Um,
uh,

378
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:39,700
Babbage said himself that the reason he
does put in so many is that he thought

379
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,610
that should be sufficient for all
future purposes of science. Um,

380
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,290
so that's uh, that's beverage all
over for you. So here's the, um,

381
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,740
the three types of punch cards they'll
go through in a bit barrels. Um,

382
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,000
I should say,
um,

383
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,450
I think the machine was probably actually
a bit taller than this cat's for scale.

384
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,250
Um, I think also it's very unlikely
it could have been free standing.

385
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,390
I think you would have to have
in mash the entire thing, uh,

386
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,090
in an enormous cage to keep it stable.

387
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,630
The whole machine is based around,
um,

388
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,340
little miracle gears that turn around
and they have locks to hold it in place.

389
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,870
And if the lock hits a tooth at
any point in this gigantic machine,

390
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,330
the whole thing, we'll freeze. Um,

391
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,050
so absolutely nothing can be out of
alignment by so much as a couple of

392
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:35,370
millimeters. So stability would be a
big, big, big issue with this machine.

393
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,490
Although that said the difference
engine works on that same principle and

394
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:42,660
generally speaking it, it's
hardly ever crashes ever. So

395
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,583
okay.

396
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,190
No, they think that only 20. So,
um, but yeah, you have a few more,

397
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,530
a little more space for error
in those. Um, right. So,

398
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,320
uh, that's the analytical engine. Um,

399
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:04,880
so in the book without the power
of animation, this is the plan.

400
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:08,630
I did a, it's actually
quite a bit more clear, um,

401
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,770
in animation. Um, I had
a great advantage, uh,

402
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,710
in building these diagrams in
that I am a computer animator,

403
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:18,970
so I work on this thing all day long.
Um,

404
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,690
so this is a simplification.
This is sort of a card,

405
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:26,670
cartoon engine version.
It's stripped down, um,

406
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,390
partly because it's really difficult
to see what's going on. Uh,

407
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:32,680
when you have the whole thing in.

408
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,210
And also it's so huge sea of hopefully
labeled the layer whole thing.

409
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,411
It's so huge.

410
00:26:38,411 --> 00:26:41,920
My machine really starts to struggle
once you put in all those gears.

411
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,290
Um,
but it's just decimal places.

412
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,580
So this is actually just a slice and
each slice going up is exactly the same.

413
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,330
So you don't need all those 15
understand that the information flow.

414
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,820
So here's your engine. I'm assuming you
guys are interested in this because,

415
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,090
uh, some people start to glaze over,
but I thought Google would probably,

416
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,250
uh, so, okay. Just so I can explain here.

417
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,200
Basically the ranch colors indicate
the driver and the Greens are passing,

418
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,690
um, as, um, these,

419
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,710
so the first thing that activates is
the number card and that will be a card

420
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,290
with each 50 decimal number in, in holes
basically, or rather a lack of holes.

421
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,230
The way these punch card things work,
if there's a whole,

422
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:38,790
so you'll have a whole
arrangement of leavers each
lined up to all the holes. Um,

423
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,870
you'll have a whole pretty much everywhere
except for one point. So as the,

424
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,550
as the card is po pushed her over
the leavers, if there's holes,

425
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:50,630
it just goes right through and nothing
happens. But if there's no hole,

426
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,940
then the card will push the lever
at that corresponding position.

427
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,300
So that's how the punch cards work.
Um,

428
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:01,050
so that will basically select
a bunch of leavers. 50 of them.

429
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:04,740
I haven't animated 50 cause I
was just way too much work. Um,

430
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,870
and that sends it to an address on the
story. The address is on the card as well.

431
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,900
Um,
Babbitt has an address thing system.

432
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:16,830
The machine is an incredibly beautiful
and incredibly clever thing and really

433
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:21,220
shockingly like a computer.
Um, this is the store. Um,

434
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,201
this is short.

435
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:26,610
Like the store would have gone on into
the distance on Babbage said maybe a

436
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,230
hundred, maybe a thousand, maybe 5,000.
Um, everyone wants more storage. Obviously

437
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,710
you'd run into a problem because the,
the entire way that these read, so okay,

438
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:41,790
so Reese one number onto the store and
then reads the second number onto the

439
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:46,590
store.
So that's the two storage positions.

440
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,420
Um, now this is the,
um, the operations card.

441
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:54,000
I should say I'm slightly fuzzy
as to the order of events.

442
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,630
I think the operation card is next,
but it might be the address,

443
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,370
but it doesn't actually matter. Um, the
operations cards are amazingly clever.

444
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,220
He single hole, they were quite
small cards. A single hole, um,

445
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,030
would then rotate these
barrels to certain position.

446
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,720
There's actually three sets of barrels
and each of the barrels has 50 or 80 Rosa

447
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:21,950
pegs around.
Um,

448
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,410
so a single hole and an operations card
could activate dozens and dozens of

449
00:29:25,411 --> 00:29:28,450
leavers, which is what you
need to run an operation. Um,

450
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,950
the machine could do basically four
things. It could add, subtract, multiply,

451
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:32,784
divide.

452
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,990
Any more complicated
mathematical thing you did,

453
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:39,980
you would have to be very clever
in the programming end. Uh,

454
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,780
break it down into those four operations,

455
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,580
run it down a string
of cards. Um, but it's,

456
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:49,414
um,

457
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,710
so all those leaders are activated and
what they do is they then engage all the

458
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:58,330
leavers, um, at one of these sections.
Basically each of these little sections,

459
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:01,260
this is just a cartoon version.

460
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,720
All these little sections are beautifully
worked out in extremely complicated,

461
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,780
but each of these little
sections does a specific thing.

462
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,970
I'm adding or caring the ones,
or if you were multiplying a number,

463
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:15,820
it would break it up into multiplied
by one, multiplied by two,

464
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:18,520
multiplied by three in
Charlie's sections for speed.

465
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,620
So it basically engages that section.
So it's already to go.

466
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,520
Then the variable cards,
which is the third kind of card.

467
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:29,530
Okay.

468
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,580
Um, this is the addressing system
basically. Uh, it then says, okay,

469
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:37,030
pick up from address number
one engages the rack,

470
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,760
the rack slides off into what you
call the ingress access, which is a,

471
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:46,120
this one at the front
here. So this is, sorry,

472
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:49,640
I'm pointing when she can't see.
So this is the position in the store.

473
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,780
So it actively reads out to
the passive ingress anxious,

474
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,300
then that engages the big central.
We'll possibly,

475
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:01,220
I mean this is all much
more complicated actually.

476
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:05,310
There's a way more bits
then I'm showing here. Um,

477
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,980
and then this becomes
active and reads the,

478
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,570
know the number off into whatever
section has been indicated.

479
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,300
Reads the second number.
So now ascot,

480
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,960
both numbers and then it does a thing.
Basically

481
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,620
each of these little bits is very,
very specialized for specific, um,

482
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,600
uh, arithmetical thing. Um, you'll notice
the, the barrels are turning around.

483
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:35,920
The barrel would have, uh, basically
a little program in wedges around.

484
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,740
So once you set it up
with one operations card,

485
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:40,510
then it runs through a
little micro program.

486
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,350
That's my scientific sound fit to
that it would make. So once it's done,

487
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,930
hooks back up so that now it's ready
to go, the number is processed.

488
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:54,190
So it's taken those two numbers.

489
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:57,010
It can only work on two numbers
at a time and spit out a result.

490
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,520
So it takes that number hooks up to the
output and the output hooks up to the

491
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:06,880
variable card to take the address
that it's supposed to read out to

492
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,020
and then reads out.

493
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,830
So now that you have the results on the
store, um, and that will animate Trey,

494
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:18,300
now you understand how
everything's going on.

495
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,720
I would take, I mean, it runs in cycles
like a computer. They're just way, way,

496
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:30,230
way slower. Um, uh, uh,

497
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,180
multiplication might take a few minutes
to run because it's got to go through,

498
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:38,110
over and over again. Um, but, um,
I don't know much about computers.

499
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,090
I probably know more about the
analytical engine and how it works.

500
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:45,770
Then our computer and how it works, but
it's, um, it is remarkably computer like,

501
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:48,290
and it's incredibly detailed.
I mean, Babbage left,

502
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,930
this is not an abstract concept.

503
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:54,050
Babbage left extremely detailed
plans for all these leavers.

504
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:57,410
He thought through all
the timing, um, you know,

505
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:00,200
all the weights and all that
stuff. Um, and there was in fact,

506
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,300
I should give a plug to plan 28, uh,
if you go to plan 20 eight.org, um,

507
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,350
there's some crazy folks who are trying
to get one built, uh, in reality,

508
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,100
like they built the difference engine.
Um, so yeah, that's the analytical,

509
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,540
the analytical engine and a bunch of
primary documents and my comic and the,

510
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:19,374
that's it.

511
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,990
MMM.

512
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,580
I think we have a few minutes for
questions if anyone has any questions.

513
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,140
All right.

514
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,280
So you said there would be one layer of
these for every digit of the 50 digits.

515
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,940
Okay. Um, do you know how like the
carry system where between layers?

516
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:46,290
Yes. Um, I,

517
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,280
it's actually,

518
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:50,890
I put a video on youtube up and it took
me nine minutes to explain the adult.

519
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,870
I know that I go engine
Carrie. Um, it's uh,

520
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,610
yeah,

521
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,020
yeah. If you go to eat, I
guess I could put it on,

522
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,790
I could either explain it to
bring up that file and explain it.

523
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,920
He basically uses like a very,
very ingenious, um, system.

524
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,930
Um, the, the carry arms,

525
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:12,450
the spiral ones that go up the
back of the difference engine,

526
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,030
Babbage discarded those
cause they were too slow.

527
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,500
They cost like 10 imaginary seconds
off his imaginary machine. Um,

528
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,360
so he,
he devised,

529
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:25,590
and this was by far his favorite part
of the engine was the ones mechanisms.

530
00:34:25,591 --> 00:34:29,180
So he would be absolutely thrilled that
someone was asking that question because

531
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,520
he goes in his autobiography,
he says,

532
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:34,500
this is by far the most
important part of the engine.

533
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:38,730
This is in the system for carrying the
ones. Um, basically he had a little peg,

534
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,390
uh, on the nine, on each, um, gear. Um,

535
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,300
so as it came around, if there was
a peg, it's really hard to explain.

536
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,080
Uh, if there's a peg and
a peg below for Carrie,

537
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,040
it would lift to carries,
um,

538
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,630
kind of onto the next gear. It's super
hard to explain, but if you come up after,

539
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:04,050
I'll show you the animation. Um, and
everyone who is intimate can see it.

540
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,370
Just probably everybody
actually. But it, it,

541
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,270
it does take a while to explain cause
it's, it's quite fiddly. But yeah,

542
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:10,590
he had it all worked out for sure.

543
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,910
You may have implied an answer
to this question, but did you,

544
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:22,010
it sounds like you do have youtube videos
with things like this and explaining

545
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,120
all the parts as well.

546
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,980
Yeah, I've got a couple. Um, uh, um,

547
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,880
the carry one is the most complete.
I haven't done this one.

548
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:36,600
I'll put up shortly with an explanation
because I just have the animation with

549
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,190
no explanation now. But, Yep.

550
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,093
Thank you.
Alright,

551
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,230
so you said that the operations that
could do to the four sort of fundamental

552
00:35:44,231 --> 00:35:48,340
arithmetic operations, it
actually divides. Yes. Wow.

553
00:35:48,341 --> 00:35:52,450
Cause Division division is Ma is sort
of arithmetically a far more complicated

554
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:57,340
operation to do and like modern CPS
devote an inordinate number of transistors

555
00:35:57,341 --> 00:36:00,970
to division alone. So how, how
does, how has division implemented?

556
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,110
You're asking me to do this.

557
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,150
Okay.

558
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,180
I'd actually, division is the one I'm
Phaziah Stan, I haven't built it yet.

559
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,190
Basically it's unwinding it,
if that makes sense. Right. Um,

560
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,280
so to multiply it's winding around
and around has got accumulators and,

561
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:20,790
and to divide it unwinds by the divisor,

562
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,690
it breaks up the divisor into units
and then unwinds it unit by unit.

563
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,500
It's quite complicated and it's very
like everything Fabish it's very,

564
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:32,850
very clever, but quite kind
of Rube Goldberg Goldberg in

565
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,900
it seems like you could just go
through and stamp on every part.

566
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:36,734
This is part is quite,
yeah.

567
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,990
Oh,
he was so clever.

568
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,350
So it lovely. Stay mostly
wrote programs for this device.

569
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,250
Did,
were her program strictly mathematical,

570
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,640
like she kept getting logarithms and
that's your thing or did she do, did,

571
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:56,870
was there any approach towards
the more general, uh, computation?

572
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,090
I'm loving this. This paper has,
there's a bunch of programs. Um,

573
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,040
most,

574
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,750
most of them are quite short and we're
sort of Babbage's little tiny workouts.

575
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,530
There's a huge fold out. One,
the Bernoulli Bernoulli numbers,

576
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,600
one that kind of
demonstrates all the loops.

577
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:19,070
This machine can loop by the way it can
instruct itself to go background. Um,

578
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,210
her, those programs are all
strictly mathematical. Um,

579
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,140
and Babbage for sure
only saw the machine as,

580
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:31,070
as for doing specifically arithmetic.
Um,

581
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,230
so no mine craft,

582
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
no. Um, but, um,

583
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,660
Lovelace had actually looked
at the machine and said,

584
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,820
um, I mean it was lovely. I select
in the machine and said, actually,

585
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,130
um, with the new developments in logic,
this is before boob by about 10 years.

586
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:52,280
But, um, she was a student of
Augustus to Morgan, who was,

587
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:57,260
I'm trying to find this
way of mathematizing logic.
Um, so she looked at it,

588
00:37:57,261 --> 00:38:00,470
said, you know, with these
leavers and pigs, um,

589
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,290
you could in theory turned
this into a logic machine, uh,

590
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,300
not an arithmetic machine. And her
example was, um, was music theory,

591
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,860
which is probably way in advance.
Um, but she said if you could,

592
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:16,280
maybe you could take the
rules of music theory. Um,

593
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,750
and find a way to express them.
She didn't use the word program,

594
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:24,320
but into a set of rules for the
machine. The machine could, in theory,

595
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,250
compose music, uh, scientific
music. She said if any extent.

596
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,710
Um, but no, we don't have any, um,

597
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:38,830
uh, unfortunately any experiments
in that direction from her. Um,

598
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,880
and I think it would like,

599
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:42,760
you would to actually do that
sort of thing with a machine,

600
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:46,330
you'd have to redesign the whole thing
because they enormous bulk of it is

601
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:50,920
really, really very, very specialized
to, to Earth medical bits.

602
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:57,170
So, um, hey, I'm really, um, anyway,

603
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,850
but the extent to which you got a,

604
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,370
you're heading into the
workings of this machine.

605
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,360
I also expect you got your head into the
workings of Charles Babbage and it'll

606
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:10,980
Lovelace personally. Can you talk
to me a little bit about sort of,

607
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,960
um,
how,

608
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,990
how you came to grips with what
motivates them as people and, um, how,

609
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,950
or to what extent you sort of personally
identified with them and it's in

610
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,100
process of doing all the work?

611
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,460
Um, I think for, for, um,

612
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,813
oh,

613
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,050
they were both definitely
became incredibly absorbed, uh,

614
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,450
with,
uh,

615
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,850
with this machine and what it could do.
Um,

616
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,650
in terms of what drove them, it's, um,

617
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,310
okay.

618
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,160
I don't know. It's hard to
say. I mean, I think once,

619
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,040
once you see how it could work,
you know,

620
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:56,150
especially if you're Charles Babbage
with this brain that can see all these

621
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:59,000
possibilities, uh, and the, and
that can see the machine, I mean,

622
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:02,960
I guess what you'd call a
spacial reasoning skills
must have been remarkable.

623
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,213
Um,

624
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,500
it drove him nuts that he said that
that's something you could see so clearly

625
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,090
wasn't actually happening.

626
00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:14,420
So he became obsessed with solving all
the problems and he kept solving the

627
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:15,860
problems.
You know,

628
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:20,180
past the point that the problems were
so many decades away from existing.

629
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:24,830
You're like, Babbage, stop. I had the
carry, I mean, the carry mechanism is, uh,

630
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:29,540
is classic Babbage and that he had a
carry mechanism design that works the

631
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:34,100
difference engine one, but if it was too
slow, you know, I'd have to look ahead.

632
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:38,000
Uh, I mean it couldn't look ahead and
had to kind of feel out one at a time.

633
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,940
And he spent a year,
he says in his autobiography,

634
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,860
he spent an entire year shaving these
imaginary seconds off of this machine.

635
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,491
Um,

636
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:51,491
so for him it was definitely solving all
these problems and getting the perfect

637
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:54,830
machine, um, for love,
nice cheese, you know, as,

638
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,320
as always she's a lot murkier and more
complicated in shit. And the comic,

639
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:02,420
she's can be the Batman
ask, you know, kind of, uh,

640
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,460
angst-ridden one. Um, uh,

641
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,430
for her, she actually wrote in a letter
to her mother is a bit weird. She,

642
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:14,000
she was very obviously
her father's legacy,

643
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:19,310
um, as a genius, but
also as a genius who had,

644
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,203
um,

645
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,570
Brock basically sex and a danger to a,

646
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,780
into the world she said to herself,

647
00:41:27,781 --> 00:41:32,781
but she felt she should redeem her
father's legacy by finding a way to poetry

648
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:38,270
and mathematics. Um,
which is an extra bar I,

649
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,050
and extraordinary, these strange thing.
But in externally, marvelous thing to say.

650
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,740
She said she wanted to create a
poetical science, which in the way,

651
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:50,120
if you think about it, po programming
is a sort of a poetical science.

652
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:54,830
It's a unifying and metaphor, um,
and logic, um, in a way that's,

653
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:58,370
that's very beautiful. So,
um, yeah, for her it was,

654
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,770
she felt that she had this,
this dark legacy that she had to redeem.

655
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,470
Um, and in terms of
identification, I don't know.

656
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:10,170
I could never have come up with this.
And in 15 years I'm not a soup.

657
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,780
Virginia's and I really felt that every
second is ed looking at this machine and

658
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:17,810
also lovely says paper, um, you know,

659
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:21,860
to make the leap from this
before, again, as I say,

660
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:25,160
logic at the time was still
basically Aristotelian, you know,

661
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:27,800
in terms of sentences. Um, and, and,

662
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:30,530
and syllogisms to look
at this machine and say,

663
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:35,560
there's gotta be a way to make logic
this perfect and this machine, like, um,

664
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,120
and then this machine could,
could compose music. I mean,

665
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:42,050
it's just a completely extraordinary
feat of imagination to see that in the

666
00:42:42,051 --> 00:42:46,880
machine. Um, so yeah, I, I, um, yeah,

667
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:50,180
I'm just completely blown away by
their genius in and humbled by it.

668
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,180
Does that answer the question

669
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,150
in my reading about this?
I stumbled on something about,

670
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:06,390
I think they were a pair of
Swedish brothers actually
commercially made several

671
00:43:08,081 --> 00:43:12,610
different engines and had customers for
them. Did you stumble on that as well?

672
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,790
Yeah,
I don't remember their name.

673
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,760
Oh,
the shirts I'm shoot,

674
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,270
I'm not sure if I've ever heard it
pronounced. I think it's shoots.

675
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,250
There were Swedish. Um,
uh, and actually, um, I,

676
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,200
I was delighted to see some,

677
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:31,940
I'm Swedish comics blog pop up when the
book came out saying as we all know the

678
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:35,360
difference, Sandra was actually built by
the famous Swedes, the shots for others.

679
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,920
Everyone has their own kind of national
history and the computer. Um, yeah,

680
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:44,520
they built the machine. They both are know
their own machine off of Babbage's, um,

681
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,950
arithmetic. Basically this method
of differences. Um, but they,

682
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,540
they had a completely different
mechanical system. Um, it's a bit,

683
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,180
when I saw one at the Science Museum,

684
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,570
I thought it was a model cause it's a
10th of the size or less than paviches

685
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,540
engine. Um, and there's, there is in
fact a beautiful video of it on Youtube.

686
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:07,940
If you look up shoots,
difference engine,

687
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:11,330
it'll come up cause I think
the Smithsonian has one
that they rent every once in

688
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:15,140
a while and it's just a, it's an
absolutely delightful little machine.

689
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,880
But as it turned out, it did
nobody really needed after all. So,

690
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,260
um, I don't think they made any
fortune off of it unfortunately.

691
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:26,841
Yeah.

692
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:31,841
There's one in I guess the astronomy
astronomical lab and u s spot one.

693
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:36,030
And uh, there was one in England
and I have one in Sweden I guess.

694
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:38,790
And everyone was like,
oh actually these are that useful.

695
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,970
It's quite sad actually.

696
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,940
I recall roughly
is a passing reference.

697
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:52,950
You must be a footnote for mathematics
would not only be too rigorous for the

698
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,020
spirit of a woman,
but also her constitution,

699
00:44:58,021 --> 00:45:01,950
which seems obviously od to modern ears.

700
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:07,730
How many women mathematicians were there
f the time a loveless seems to have

701
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:12,270
been fairly well accepted as one,

702
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:16,530
but was it in fact an anomaly for
there to be a woman mathematician?

703
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:18,690
Was she seen as some sort of oddity or,

704
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,300
well, I mean what people tend
to see it as cute to be honest.

705
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,360
They tend to write, oh, you
know, isn't that adorable?

706
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:32,990
A woman trying to do mathematics and
the letter about her about mathematics

707
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:36,440
damaging and women's contents constitution
is actually from Augustus to Morgan.

708
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:41,570
Um, who wrote her mother saying twice
apparently saying, I'm, I'm very,

709
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:43,320
very concerned because,
um,

710
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,900
the lady Lovelace has as much
mathematical power as which challenged the

711
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:50,000
constitution of a man.
And you know,

712
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:55,340
somehow you felt that it was
overclocked for a woman's body. I mean,

713
00:45:55,341 --> 00:45:59,090
this was actually a very
common idea. And he said, uh,

714
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,290
he gave me, he gave me some great
comic book dialogue. He said, soon,

715
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:06,860
the battle of the truth as soon as a
struggle between body and mind will begin.

716
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,290
Um,
and I mean it's,

717
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:14,050
it's actually incredibly sad and ironic
because the idea was that, um, Matt,

718
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,260
the mathematics,

719
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:18,590
the success of use of that part of the
brain with specifically damage women's

720
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:23,150
wounds, um, and lovelies did in
fact die of, of uterine cancer.

721
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:28,040
So, um, yeah, it was just, I can't
find anyone using that as proof.

722
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:32,330
I'm sure somebody somewhere
said I told you. Um, uh,

723
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:37,280
and actually Lovelace's um, mentor was
Mary Somerville. Um, certainly played up,

724
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,030
um, after whom Somerville
College and Oxford, his name,

725
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,360
she did all these very complicated
translations of works from the continent.

726
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:44,830
And I love this.

727
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:48,480
It was very definitely modeling herself
on Somerville and doing the translation

728
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:53,240
to the analytical engine, uh,
paper. Um, but Somerville,

729
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,410
um, I had to study in secret because her
parents thought she would hurt herself,

730
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,430
uh,
studying math and her,

731
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,950
I think her first husband didn't
agree with her studying math. So she,

732
00:47:02,951 --> 00:47:06,890
she wrote her first mathematics
book when she was 45 when he died.

733
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,210
That's where she got her first freedom.
So no, it was very, very unusual.

734
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:16,520
I mean it was, this is kind
of at the end of that era. Um,

735
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:21,700
they started to have a women's
programs in college in 1870s,

736
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,200
1880s, and I think that's when
it started to turn around.

737
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,890
So we want to thank you for
all the amazing work you've
done to the great comic

738
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:30,010
and

739
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,240
the really beautiful book. Um,
but, uh, I've got to wonder like,

740
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:35,290
where are you heading now?

741
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:39,910
Like you said that you were sort of
ambushed by the comic and is there still

742
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:41,560
going to be a comic? I mean, I hope,

743
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:46,170
hi. I get this question a lot and
I'm here. I'm just kind of, um,

744
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,600
uh, I actually, I have not the proverbial
day job and I still work as an animator,

745
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,030
um, which is quite, uh,
all consuming work. Uh,

746
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,820
when it's on, I definitely have a
bunch more comics I'm dying to do.

747
00:47:59,821 --> 00:48:03,390
I've got a ton of sketches, so
when work dies down a bit, I'll be,

748
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,800
I'll be cracking on for sure.

749
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,180
Yeah.

750
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,013
Um,

751
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:12,400
my understanding is that there
was a couple of critical problems,

752
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:15,910
maybe just one that needed
the difference engine. Uh,

753
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,140
back when Babbage was born,
computer was a job title.

754
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:25,540
It was the people who manually computed
tables of logarithms and they were full

755
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:26,290
of errors.

756
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:31,290
And this led to things like ships
sinking and it made just be that one

757
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:34,120
difference engine was enough
to solve that problem.

758
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:36,070
And there weren't any other problems.

759
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:40,190
Yeah. I mean this was kind of Babbage's
thing. The difference engine wasn't, yeah,

760
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,540
supposed to solve a specific calculation.

761
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:45,660
It was supposed to print out these big
tables because what would happen is you'd

762
00:48:45,661 --> 00:48:50,661
have these giant books of every iteration
of a problem and then when you were at

763
00:48:51,391 --> 00:48:55,500
sea without your difference engine or
in your accountant's office or whatever,

764
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,960
you would just go to volumes 15 and
pull it up and look up that one little

765
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:04,920
iteration. Um, but Babbage
himself actually, uh,

766
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,220
supervise this production of these,
you know,

767
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:12,240
beautifully triple checked error free
logarithm tables after which yeah,

768
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:16,170
you don't need anymore cause they're
all done. So that was um, yeah, the,

769
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:19,650
the difference engine was redundant
by the time, um, you know,

770
00:49:19,651 --> 00:49:24,470
those tables were printed. So I
think for him it was more of an

771
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:26,971
he did,

772
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:30,150
he used to for a lot of stuff around
about all the problems that could solve,

773
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:33,330
but he was really more into just
building the engine itself. I think

774
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,950
what's happening to your
originals from the book?

775
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,350
Oh, hi. There are in fact no originals
from the book. It's completely drawn.

776
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,830
I in Photoshop, sorry. Yeah,

777
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,850
it's a virtual comic computer generated.

778
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,850
So if the point of the engine was to,
you know,

779
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:57,060
produce tables of numbers without areas
and he had 50 decimal digits precision,

780
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,670
did he ever work out how many
volumes wired to print that out?

781
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,640
I am quite sure he did Babbage with
her love working stuff like that out.

782
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,850
So I can't tell you specifically,

783
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:17,380
but I will tell you if it involves
working out and amount of a thing, um,

784
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,280
beverage,
you would have done it at some point.

785
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,900
Even under fixed plant.
You're talking about a lot of power.

786
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,190
Uh,
are there any other questions?

787
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,163
Hmm.

788
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,470
Okay. Well, let's thank our
guests. Thank you very much.
