I've watched you with the
same. Hey. Oh the same.

141
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:51,150
Has All witness seen hand?
They have fee. I stay out.

142
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,443
Ooh.

143
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,870
Uh Huh.

144
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,843
Oh,

145
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,870
oh.
Just like that.

146
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,603
Yeah.

147
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,260
That was amazing. Thank you. Oh my gosh.
That was so great amount of applause

148
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,650
first that, yeah. Thank you.

149
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,020
So I had,
I had this like

150
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,050
very distinct way. It was going to an
order, I was going to ask you a question,

151
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,270
but I have to start with
something different. Okay.

152
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,260
Because you said something
while you were up here and, um,

153
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,630
I think it was really profound and I
don't know that every performer when they

154
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:02,950
get on stage gets that
overtaken by their music.

155
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:07,900
And I wanted to ask you about that because
you, you saying that, um, second laugh,

156
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:09,850
clown laugh, clap, and he said,

157
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,000
I lose myself in that sometimes
or something to that effect.

158
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,410
So when you're up on stage like
this in your performing and you,

159
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:21,430
and that feeling overtakes you,
what's going through your mind?

160
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,380
How do you feel about your
music in those moments?

161
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,820
Um, I'm not really
thinking on a, you know,

162
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,930
you can kind of like a rational
level and that's really the problem.

163
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,410
Most of the most, we call
them, we're not a problem.

164
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,970
It's a good time to be a
problem. Um, yeah, I'm, I'm in,

165
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:44,260
I'm in like a dream state when it's,
when I'm at my best,

166
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,920
I think to be connected to,
you know,

167
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,450
the performance and,
um,

168
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,710
and I'm really grateful anytime that I
get to share my music and perform it and

169
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,030
for that experience of,
you know,

170
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:03,031
receiving energy from people that I'm
performing for and also giving that energy

171
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:08,530
out. So when I'm, when I'm in
that cycle and that circle,

172
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,450
um, I, I spin out sometimes
and I'm kind of in dream state,

173
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,050
which can be a problem if,

174
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,330
if like I let my emotions
kind of take over, right?

175
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,230
If I let my adrenaline take over,

176
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,090
I can do things that I could hurt
myself or like jump on people or,

177
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:30,460
you know, do all kinds of
things that I'm known to do.

178
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,830
But then I don't remember
after, you know, I'm,

179
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm not like really present in
that rational sense in that moment.

180
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:39,790
And then sometimes I'll see a video and
I'll be like, I was dancing like that.

181
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,100
Oh my gosh, I don't even know
how I can do that. I'll be like,

182
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:42,934
why do my knees hurt?

183
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,270
And I'll look at the video and I'll see
that I was doing like these dead drops,

184
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,300
like doing like pow, like doing
all these crazy things. I'm like,

185
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,800
I don't even remember doing that thing.
I didn't split my pants. But that's,

186
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,130
it happens. Yeah. And you usually
play with the band, right? Yes. Uh,

187
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,690
currently my set up is a
four piece band, so, um,

188
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,580
I am free to,
uh,

189
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,280
sing mostly and um,

190
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,320
I play a little organs in this
current setup. Um, but it's myself,

191
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,310
my drummer,

192
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,070
Marco Bocelli and then a
bass player and a guitar,

193
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:22,250
keyboards. If things get really out of
control, they can, they usually are.

194
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,640
I let you go there on the back
line. They're holding it down. Yeah.

195
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:28,640
They're usually just like,
what is she doing today?

196
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,930
That's amazing how we think we all need
to see you at the band. Oh yeah, yeah,

197
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,540
yeah. Come. Yeah, come out.
Yeah. [inaudible] great.

198
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,840
So this is a really exciting time for you.
You're on your second

199
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,730
can album. Your first record was
released in 2013 magic tricks.

200
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:48,500
Yeah. Yes. Um, and then this album,
which I think is so beautiful,

201
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:53,270
they're both so beautiful and they're
sonically so different. Um, what,

202
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,750
what is your process when you write music?
What's your inspiration?

203
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,790
Oh, thank you. Um,

204
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,810
well I usually start by improvising,

205
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,040
so I usually start a writing session
first with something that I know,

206
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,690
just whether it's a song that I like or
a song of mine or something that I know

207
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:16,690
to kind of just warm up. And then,
uh, I usually start improvising, uh,

208
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,110
other with just my voice or on an
instrument, a physical instrument,

209
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:25,220
like I'm a keyboard or on a,
on the base. In this case,

210
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:29,090
I wrote a lot of the album on, on base,
which I don't know how to play really.

211
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,710
I just,
I bought a,

212
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:34,340
I went and I bought a bass because I
was demoing the song and I needed a bass

213
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:37,520
player to play this lines and nobody
would show up that day. So like, well,

214
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:41,480
I guess I'm just going to buy one. I'll
return it. I guess I shouldn't say that,

215
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:44,820
but I'll return it later when I'm done.
But I was having so much fun,

216
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:47,330
they decided to keep the base.
Um,

217
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,170
and so I ended up writing a
lot of this record on that.

218
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:55,100
But usually it's just improvising
night and I tried to, um,

219
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,833
just let,

220
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,580
let myself go for a little bit
and then I start to hear some bit,

221
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:05,690
whether it's a rhythm that I'm
playing or I'm singing were a,

222
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,520
or it's a melody that's happening and
I isolate this, a small bit of that,

223
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,810
and then I repeat it.

224
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,180
So I repeat it a to find out more
about it through repetition. And,

225
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:19,760
uh, usually when I find
out something about it,

226
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,740
then something else happens that changes.

227
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,220
And that's usually how
an idea starts for me.

228
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,780
So it builds organically yeah. Through,
yeah, through improvisation and right.

229
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,673
And listening.

230
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,741
Do you think the fact,

231
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:36,220
because the first record was very
synth in Oregon sounding, um,

232
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,250
and the black Terry cat is,

233
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,640
is there's something smoother and
more jazzy, more melodic about it.

234
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:47,380
Do you think any of that had
to do with the base? It's,

235
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,070
if you just pulling out that base
and beginning to write the record

236
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,750
with it. Definitely, you know, the
writing, a lot of the songs on bass,

237
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,960
you know, influenced the sound of
the album is very based centric.

238
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:01,290
A lot of the melodies came from,
from playing on that instrument rhythmic.

239
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,503
Um,

240
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,550
the first record was kind of a
piano trio power trio record. Okay.

241
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,080
So it was very minimal. It was bass,
drums and keyboards mostly. Um,

242
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,780
there's not much else
in the sound Palette.

243
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,550
And in this record I expanded
a little bit and uh, I,

244
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,060
I did more vocal stacks like,
and my boy in the vocal arrangements,

245
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,600
I have like these kind of fat vocal
stacks and layering that I hadn't done as

246
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:30,900
much before.
I used to loop my voice and use my voice.

247
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,540
That's kind of like horns
and different textures was,

248
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,870
which I'm still doing in this record.

249
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:38,430
But I expanded the sound Palette a little
bit more with more since some guitar.

250
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,320
Um, but I think ultimately what changed
on this album for me was also the music I

251
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:46,890
was listening to at the time.
Um, so I was really into,

252
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,750
I was discovering a lot of hip hop music
that I didn't, didn't know about. Um,

253
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,380
some groups like slum
village and which was, yeah,

254
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,260
I represented some village
where they were they good clients.

255
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,270
I was a music attorney before I
joined Youtube in 2011 and in 1997,

256
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,850
I think [inaudible] 96 I represented this
artist named some village and I didn't

257
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:16,560
know that anybody knew slum village.
That was,

258
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:16,891
yeah,

259
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:21,891
that was some of j Dilla is a master
masterful work at the beginning.

260
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,320
The producer who was slum village,
um,

261
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,920
I think Jay Dilla produced those tracks
and that a lot of those artist with

262
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:33,390
donating, his name is Bryce was his
last name. Oh Gosh. I don't remember.

263
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,720
You taught me. You call me on that
one. Really hilarious. Okay. Oh,

264
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:41,640
they're incredible. Yeah. Um, black
moon. Um, and, and j Dilla. I mean,

265
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,420
uh, discovering sampling, you know, for
the kind of for the first time. I mean,

266
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,220
I knew what sampling was,
but it was just kind of,

267
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,850
I hadn't really been
digging into that music. Um,

268
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,940
I kind of was coming out of a period
where I was discovering punk for the first

269
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,720
time. Um, and I had been
listening to jazz for a while,

270
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:04,180
but I had kind of been
suppressing some of those, uh,

271
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,730
interests in my music or
I'm not suppressing them.

272
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:11,070
I was just on another tip and this time
around I was kind of digging into this

273
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:12,540
music,
going back and listening to Busta rhymes,

274
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,950
who I listened to you as a child as well.
Um, listening to Kendrick Lamars album,

275
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:19,860
pimp a butterfly was also really
influential for me at the time that I was

276
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:23,760
finishing this album. That album came
out and I was thinking about, uh,

277
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,250
lyricists,
uh,

278
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:30,251
rappers and people who use their voice
to tell stories and listening to,

279
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,140
you know,

280
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,790
Kendrick's album and how he sounds like
10 different people on one album and

281
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:40,560
thinking about different ways to use
your voice. So all of those things, um,

282
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,490
influenced me on this album. I
wanted it to be really beat, driven,

283
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,860
really soul fun and
funky and also kind of on

284
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,830
the vocal performances. Right, right.
Oh, what do you do with your EFL courses?

285
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,640
Incredible. Thanks. So pitch, work,
audit it. Right. I pulled a quote, um,

286
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,890
that pitchfork referred to your music as,

287
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,810
as adept at punk confrontation
as are unbeaten run ons,

288
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,430
which was very interesting to have a
Pumpkin RV and it's the same sentence but

289
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,610
um, and then from, you know,
there's also outside of the,

290
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,950
the sound of the music,
there's really deep messages in,

291
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,920
in the work on this album
and the last one too,

292
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:23,670
but I wanted to focus on this one
because you, you perform Mexican chef.

293
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,310
What are you trying to convey?

294
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,640
Well, that song Mexican chef just
started out as kind of an observation.

295
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:34,430
I was walking around running errands and
my neighborhood in Brooklyn and there

296
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:39,431
were kitchens that were signing up for
the night and they had the back door open

297
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:42,770
and you could see the kitchen staff like,
you know, cleaning up, setting things up,

298
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:46,220
prepping. And they were
blasting Bachata and fun shit.

299
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:50,720
US and Salsa and um, today and
the Google cafeteria, actually,

300
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:53,870
they were listening to south side, like
on blast. And I was like, what's up?

301
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:56,720
Who's playing this, all this old school
salsa. And they were like, yeah, we are.

302
00:21:56,721 --> 00:22:00,740
What's up? Um, so that was cool.
But so all of the kitchen staff was,

303
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:03,560
was listening to this music.
And then in the front of the restaurant,

304
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,880
the wait staff was mostly
white. And uh, the,

305
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,200
the kitchen staff was
mostly Latino and the,

306
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,250
the in the front of the restaurant was
completely different sound palette,

307
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,150
completely different kind
of music playing. And I just
thought that was so funny.

308
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:20,290
So I started kind of improvising on these,
these words.

309
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,410
I thought it was writing a short
story or like a funny rhyme to myself.

310
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,510
I didn't think anything of it.
And when I got home I just,

311
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,290
I wrote it all down and I thought it
was just kind of making myself laugh.

312
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,230
It was a joke, you know? Yeah.

313
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,450
But then it ended up becoming that
song Mexican chef. Um, so, right.

314
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,210
People are responding to have responded
to it a lot in terms of saying that it's

315
00:22:41,211 --> 00:22:44,060
very political and it's very
social, which, you know, I guess,

316
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,870
I guess it is very social. Um,
but I didn't intend for that.

317
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:51,210
I didn't set out to write a song like
that. I was kind of just having fun and,

318
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,670
and observing things. But, um, my
mom used to say, when I was a kid,

319
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:59,480
I always remember her saying this one
thing, um, that, that, uh, you know,

320
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:03,500
the hands of Brown women welcome you into
the world and clean you and you're an

321
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:08,060
infant and welcome you in the hospital
and they're the same ones that, that, uh,

322
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,770
kind of take you out of this
world or not take you out, uh,

323
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,330
take care of you when you're
on your way out. Right?

324
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,120
They're the same ones who take care of
you when you're on your way out, you know,

325
00:23:17,121 --> 00:23:19,820
in nursing homes and stuff. My mom
worked in a nursing home. She's at,

326
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,220
she's a registered nurse.
When she first,

327
00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:26,750
I would've heard the first big
jobs in this country. Um, so yeah,

328
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:29,330
she's talked about the
Labor of the Brown people.

329
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:33,350
So that's kind of what I'm referring
to in the song is this kind of somewhat

330
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:37,130
invisible workforce that, you
know, makes our cities function,

331
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:40,900
especially in a city like New York. But
we're all of these, you know, big, sure.

332
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,210
Metropolitan cities where
we have all of these, uh,

333
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,980
incredible services. Uh,
you can have your laundry,

334
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:51,860
you could have your clean underwear
delivered to your doorstep if you want to.

335
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,450
You know, it's absurd, but it, you know,
it's, that's the luxuries that we live,

336
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,260
you know,
and these cities and the,

337
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:01,760
a lot of the times the people who
actually make those services function are

338
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:05,970
people of color. Um, so
it's kind of a shout out to,

339
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,220
to that workforce.

340
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,730
That's great. I've had the experience,
I've been, I've been in the nursing home.

341
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,910
Mm hmm.
You're referring to.

342
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,260
And I've had the experience of birthing
my own children and had exactly the same

343
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,690
experience and both were beautiful.
Um,

344
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,800
so, so when you think about your, your,

345
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,050
your process and your music and
the meaning, you know, there's,

346
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,920
I think that as an artist,
um,

347
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,300
you have your own perception of your
music and then you have all these external

348
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:45,301
accolades and critiques of your music
and w are they the same for you?

349
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,850
Do you feel about your music the way
that you read people writing about it in

350
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:53,320
the way you,
you hear or see people responding to you?

351
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,230
Well,
it's like when you look in the mirror,

352
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,850
the eyes that you see yourself with are
totally different than the eyes that

353
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,000
others see you with. You know, the
lover sees you or a stranger sees you,

354
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,360
you know, so no, it's not
the same. You know, I'm, uh,

355
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,280
sometimes, you know, sometimes there
synergies. Sometimes when I'm performing,

356
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,260
I might be,
I might,

357
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,290
that day I might've been working on
something and channeling something where I

358
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:22,470
might've been listening to a song like
Eric have I do song or something before I

359
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:24,960
come on stage. And then after the
show, someone will be like, Oh,

360
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:28,320
you remind me of Eric about do and I'll
be like, whoa, that's weird. And I'm like,

361
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:29,280
channel, you know, like,

362
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:34,281
just because in that day I think that
I was maybe a channeling that or,

363
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:39,720
or projecting that and through
our transfer of energy,

364
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:43,080
like somebody received that.
So I think that, you know,

365
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:46,120
that kind of stuff happens sometimes
where someone will perceive something that

366
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:48,870
it's a new thought for me that I'm
working on. Yeah. And you know,

367
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:51,570
and that way we'll agree, but a lot of
times I'm surprised, you know, and it,

368
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,160
and it,
it's fun.

369
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,780
It's fun to see how people perceive
your work sometimes more than others,

370
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,110
you know?
But

371
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,170
how do you want the music
to make people feel?

372
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:03,920
Yeah.

373
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,580
Um,

374
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,580
well I would like people
to feel joy and to,

375
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:12,710
okay.

376
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,940
To feel enraptured by my music,

377
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,300
to be,
to feel inspired,

378
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:24,890
to listen to music or to make
something when listening to my music.

379
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,430
Do you do any other form of art?
Do you write? Do you paint any,

380
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,610
is there any other Larry,
I wish I could,

381
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:36,830
can you draw us or I can't even draw like
a square or a circle. It's really sad.

382
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,500
Um,
but I do enjoy writing.

383
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,470
I've just been in a fight with
words for like a decade now.

384
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,860
So I'm working something,
I'm working on,

385
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:46,830
something I was working on on
this album. I wanted to, uh,

386
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,870
work on my lyric writing a little bit.
Um,

387
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,380
because I felt like in my first
album I relied a lot on, um,

388
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,160
kind of figurative language and,
um,

389
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,480
a lot of my lyrics were super open to
interpretation, which they always are.

390
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,330
But I, I was wondering, uh,

391
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,940
what it would be like to approach lyric
writing in a more literal sense. Right.

392
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,440
And I guess one of my big fears
is m two, two big fears is, uh,

393
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,790
talking about things I don't know,

394
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,750
and just adding to the noise of people
just talking about things they don't know

395
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:16,410
about.

396
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:21,210
And the second was about being corny or
cheesy with like being so literal that

397
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:25,560
it's corny right now. And so now I, I
just went for it. And I was, you know,

398
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,880
was literal,

399
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:31,050
but writing is something I'm really
curious about and interested in.

400
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,110
Right. There are some
artists and songwriters that,

401
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,250
that actually put down the lyrics
first. They create music to it, right?

402
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,050
Or vice versa.
Yeah.

403
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,460
Yeah. In my case, I've always
done it the other way around. My,

404
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,560
the sounds and melodies
and rhythms come first.

405
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:50,490
And the lyrics have always been last.
But on this record, I was, I was like,

406
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:52,890
no girl, you go in and you write
the words down. What does that mean?

407
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:57,150
So I was trying to be more specific.
Right. And you know, it was, it's tough.

408
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,910
I'm the only way I convince myself
a couple of times just being like,

409
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,650
don't worry, you're gonna
throw it away afterwards. Like,

410
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:04,380
no one will ever see this. So I
had just had to, you know, it's,

411
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,490
it can be petrifying just to be that
specific. And so, and, and now, you know,

412
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:11,510
we're just always throwing out words
all the time to each other, you know,

413
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,850
on Twitter or whatever. We're just
always like, [inaudible], everything is,

414
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,520
everyone is so entitled
to say whatever they want.

415
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:21,060
All the time and write it
down, you know, um, and not,

416
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:24,150
maybe not always think
about it before, but, um,

417
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,230
do you use your social media in,

418
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,310
in promoting your shows or
things like that? You want music?

419
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,140
Yeah, I do. It's complicated.

420
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,140
We have a complicated
relationship even working on it.

421
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,320
The artist that has a
complicated relationship with
social media, um, I, you know,

422
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,860
I, the one is, and you
probably feel this also,

423
00:28:45,861 --> 00:28:49,760
is there's so many different places
to go to reach your fans today.

424
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:53,750
And you know, I hear sometimes
from artists, will I mind youtube?

425
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:58,340
And I'm on Twitter and I have Facebook
and I have Instagram and I have snapchat

426
00:28:58,341 --> 00:29:00,320
and I have whatsapp. I, you know,

427
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,330
it's like the litany of different outlets
and where should I go first and where

428
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:09,230
should I reach my fan? And I think it's
kind of difficult when, you know, um,

429
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,630
and I think some artists will just select
one place to really focus on and build

430
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:17,270
a fan base. I Dunno. Do
you know, how do you,

431
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,590
well, yeah, I just have
fun, you know? Yeah.

432
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,580
I think ultimately people can tell when
you're not about something in general.

433
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,450
Like if you're playing a song that you
don't believe in or that you don't like

434
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:32,420
what you're doing, people can
tell. So I think, you know,

435
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,670
audiences are smart and people are smart,

436
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,170
smarter than we give them credit for it.

437
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:40,610
So I think like trying to
be genuine in all of those
things. So, you know, I might,

438
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,140
I tried by just makes me feel old. I
don't understand what's going on. I'm not,

439
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,310
I can't ever find, I like to trying to
respond. I'm like trying to do the thing.

440
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,970
Um, but, and I can't figure
it out. Um, but yeah,

441
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:56,710
I just try to have fun and, and figure
out my, my way and not force things.

442
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:01,600
You know. What's your favorite
song to play? Oof. Uh,

443
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:05,020
see them, which is a jam
I didn't play today. Um,

444
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,580
but that's kind of like a B side jam from,
from uh, black Terry cat. Okay. And, uh,

445
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:14,581
it's kind of a choose your own adventure
song except I chose it for you but you,

446
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,260
but uh,
but it kind of,

447
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,250
it's kind of has some similarities
to through composed piece,

448
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:25,130
which is a piece that you know, would
have, if your sections are lettered,

449
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,030
it would just be a, B, c, d, e, f,
g and it would never, never repeat.

450
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,170
It would just go from
one section together.

451
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,560
So I kind of set out in this structure
of writing this thing that would never

452
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:35,670
repeat, but then that didn't happen. I
ended up repeating a couple sections,

453
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,730
but it still has this kind of longer
development and all these different

454
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:43,810
sections and I have so much fun playing
that like too much fun playing that song

455
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:47,680
live. Um, I need the help of my band
to play it because there's so much,

456
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,940
so many layers going on that, uh, to,

457
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,640
to otherwise I would just be pressing a
button and singing to tracks. Um, but I,

458
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,560
I love playing that song live and
seeing how people are connecting with it

459
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,150
physically is cool too.

460
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,430
When are you playing in the area?
I just

461
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:08,450
played in the area. Just miss me. Yeah.
I just had my homecoming show. Um,

462
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,890
uh, a couple, like a week ago
or something. I just finished
my first ever headline,

463
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,420
a national tour.

464
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,900
That's fantastic. Yeah. Thanks.
Where did you, where'd you go?

465
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,430
All over the U S I went to Canada.
Um, drove from coast to coast,

466
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:25,340
went to the south. Amazing. Went
to the middle. I went to the west,

467
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,080
went to the east once of the north.

468
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,840
I watched all the directions
I need to ask performance.

469
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,810
You must have done that in the
middle of there. I did that.

470
00:31:32,811 --> 00:31:36,740
I think the summer they play tape them
an advance. Oh yeah. That was fun.

471
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,420
There was,
must be so much fun.

472
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,020
I was really nervous in the NPR
tiny desk performances. I love them.

473
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,850
I was very nervous, but we got
it. We got through it. Yeah.

474
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,680
It was probably a little nerve
wracking in that space. It is.

475
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,820
Then also, you know, there's, yeah,
it's a lot of heavy music cats in there,

476
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,860
you know, that have played there and that
work there. So it was like, whoa. Yeah.

477
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,950
But we got through it.

478
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,910
Yeah. Um, speaking of heavy music
cats, now I've asked you this question,

479
00:32:02,911 --> 00:32:05,040
but you said that who
would be the one person,

480
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,160
the one musician that you
haven't met yet that, oh,

481
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:14,430
that would be most inspiring and, and
you know, cause you to write more and,

482
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,040
mm. She told me that one
before. You can think about it.

483
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:24,540
While I'm going to ask Julie, ask if
anyone in the room has any questions or

484
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,340
anything more you'd like to hear or
that you'd like to share with us?

485
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,873
Nope.

486
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,243
All right.
Um,

487
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,670
so when I was first through

488
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,920
a black Terry cat, um,
I was thinking, okay,

489
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:49,160
this is a little more political.
Uh,

490
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,550
but the thing that kind of
turned me around on that, uh,

491
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,520
was the song laugh clown,
which you just performed. Um,

492
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,490
so in the first line you talk about how,
you know,

493
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,950
you're letting your eyebrows
grow back in and my mustache,

494
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,400
mustache and your mustache
as well. Yes. Um, and that,

495
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,060
that kind of spun me around because

496
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,383
like

497
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,510
I found that political, but then I
questioned why I found a political,

498
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,690
because in effect,
like as a default state,

499
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:30,940
your body is a statement
to the rest of society.

500
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:36,620
And, uh, and that's really, uh,

501
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:42,180
I think that also applies to some of
some of your other statements like in

502
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:47,380
Mexican chef that, you know,
this isn't necessarily,

503
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:54,230
uh, you going out to be
political, but I see that,

504
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,183
you know,

505
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,570
in this society your body is political.

506
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,480
Um,
so could you comment to that at all?

507
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,300
Um,
yeah.

508
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,110
Well it is interesting.
Thanks for the quick,

509
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,390
they were great question by the way.
Um,

510
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,580
I think that by virtue
of just being who I am,

511
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,930
looking how I look and where
I come from and being a woman,

512
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:34,450
a lot of just observing and just
saying what I see or what I've lived is

513
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,470
political. You know, it's
just as simple as that.

514
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:42,490
But it may not be if someone
else, you know, maybe if
you were to say some of the,

515
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:44,410
some thing that you saw or
something that you lived,

516
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:46,510
it may not be perceived as political,

517
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,510
but just by virtue of me
telling you my experience,

518
00:34:49,511 --> 00:34:51,250
it's political maybe because yeah,

519
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,680
there are less people who look like me
in certain contexts and situations that

520
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:03,911
are expressing their lived
experiences and things that they see.

521
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,450
So, you know, that's one
thing. And I think that, uh,

522
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,780
this album is, this work is really
personal. It's, you know, the, um,

523
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,640
the song laugh clown
at that the beginning,

524
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:20,750
I'm really talking more
about like personal hygiene
and the passage of time and

525
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,040
how I'm,
you know,

526
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:27,041
I was also working through
depression and grief and,

527
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:32,480
um,
and kind of having that,

528
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,920
that the beginning for me personally is,
is about,

529
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,820
I'm just, I'm over it. Like I'm not even
carry, like when I'm looking at myself,

530
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:45,030
I'm like, Whoa, I didn't pluck my
eyebrows, eyebrows for a month, like,

531
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:46,650
what's going on? What's the deal? Um,

532
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,740
but it's more about just being
in that kind of state. Um, but I,

533
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,420
but I am also in this album talking
about brown girls and people of Color,

534
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,140
um, Brown boys too. And, um,

535
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,510
you know,
talking about body issues.

536
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,100
I have a song called,

537
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,870
I won't say where I quote a
piece from one of my heroes.

538
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:14,680
Maybe that's who I would like to
meet. Abby Lincoln, um, vocalist. Um,

539
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,990
she was a contemporary of Billie holiday,
but she's a little bit less well known,

540
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,273
um,

541
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,280
and Abby's work and voices so rich
and so beautiful and has a lot to say,

542
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,630
a lot of commentary about things
that she's lived and seen. Um,

543
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:33,600
and she wrote an essay
that was published in a,

544
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:36,800
it was called Negro digest at the time,
I think it might be ebony now. Um,

545
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,920
and it's called who will review the
black woman. And it was talking about,

546
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,590
uh,
how in our society,

547
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,480
the black woman is kind of disposable
and thrown away and not champion and her,

548
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,420
her nose is too wide and her,
you know,

549
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,260
her feet are too flat and her face is
too black and all this kind of thing.

550
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,610
So in this, and I cite some of
that in my song, I won't say,

551
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:03,630
and I'm dealing with some of these body
image issues and that are universal

552
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,400
regardless of your ethnicity,
you know, but of of um,

553
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,980
feeling like you don't fit in,
you know,

554
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:12,420
just all that be kind of universal things.

555
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:17,160
But so ultimately this work
is very personal for me,
um, more even more so than,

556
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,550
than political. But it's the other,
if the others who do the other thing,

557
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:24,360
it's the others who say that it, you
know, I'm being political but I'm just,

558
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,950
you know, sharing my,
my personal experience.

559
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,350
I don't know if that answers your
question, but it's a couple of thoughts.

560
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,960
Thank you. Yeah, thank you.

561
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,080
Hey. Hi. Um, first I just wanted to say,

562
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,980
this is kind of weird for me because
earlier this week I found out you were

563
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:52,990
coming and I was just like,
oh shit.

564
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,850
And I got here really early cause I was
like, this place is going to be tagged.

565
00:37:57,851 --> 00:37:59,920
I can't believe she's coming here.
And now I'm just like,

566
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,760
apparently I have to tell
everyone to listen to you
because they haven't already.

567
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:09,000
Um, but I was wondering two things. Um,

568
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,870
first have you always
lived in Brooklyn or, um,

569
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,010
I guess just wondering about like where
you grew up and how that like influenced

570
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:21,430
you. Um, thank you. Also wandering,

571
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:25,960
you're just more of your
musical influences I think.

572
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,170
I don't know if you listened to it,
but I kind of,

573
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,240
I'm reminded of like early Virgina
Specter sometimes with your like vocal.

574
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,603
Yeah,

575
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,940
I see that activity or like,
I dunno. It's, it's nice.

576
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,610
Cool. Thank you. Um, yeah,
tell everybody to listen to me.

577
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,310
It's all good. It's all g net. We're
going to spread the word happy.

578
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,450
Happy to be here. Um, I, I'm
not from Brooklyn originally.

579
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:03,190
I've lived here in New York City
for 10 years, so I guess that's,

580
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,580
that's a cutoff that makes you the real
New Yorker, right? Like 10 I heard,

581
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:11,100
I dunno, whatever, but I give it
to New York. You have to like,

582
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,920
do you actually really hardy place?
Like,

583
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:14,750
if you can make it two years in New York,

584
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:17,540
I think you are safe to call
yourself a New Yorker. Okay.

585
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,590
I've been living here for 20 well so
you are definitely the real deal too.

586
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,460
So you got me beat two and a bit.
Well,

587
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:30,440
I'm 24 time flies when
you're time flying life.

588
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,600
Um, yeah, so I'm, I was born
in Hartford, Connecticut,

589
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:38,750
so there's just two hours north of here,
smack dab in the middle of the,

590
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,930
of the state of Connecticut.
Um,

591
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,540
and I've lived my whole life here
in the northeast of the states.

592
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,703
Um,

593
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,740
and I guess the majority of my life
and Hartford and that is a very,

594
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,870
um, oppressed city, uh,

595
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,580
financially and culturally.
Um,

596
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:06,290
which is ironic pieces in like one
of the richest states in the country.

597
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:10,880
But um, there, there's a lot of poverty.

598
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,130
Um,
there's a lot of cultural oppression.

599
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:18,080
There's not much going on, um,
arts wise, although, you know,

600
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:22,790
folks are always constantly working
to change that. Um, but, uh,

601
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,120
very racially segregated city,
um,

602
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:30,510
very large Hispanic community
that lives there. Um,

603
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,560
my mom is from Puerto Rico and my father
was from Cuba and they met in Hartford

604
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,660
of all places. I'm like,
really? I couldn't grow it up.

605
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:43,010
And when the beautiful Caribbean island,
um, but so that's where they met.

606
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:47,780
And in the 70s,
there was an effort to recruit,

607
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,130
uh,
laborers for the industries.

608
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,080
In Hartford. There was
a cult, huge Colt, uh,

609
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,040
weapons manufacturing companies, huge, uh,

610
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,170
industries in Hartford. And they
needed people to come and work, um,

611
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,300
probably on the cheap side
in, in, in these factories.

612
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:13,450
So they actually went to Puerto Rico to
recruit workers and offer them housing.

613
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,450
And I think I have to do more research
and I'm very curious on this topic and I

614
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:18,500
hope to be able to do it soon.

615
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,250
But I think that was how the
ghettos were built in Hartford.

616
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,400
And I always wondered like,
how did all of these Puerto Ricans,

617
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,620
I ended up here and in this cold place,
you know,

618
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:32,330
the cold and friendly kind of climate. Um,
and my mom was always like, oh, you know,

619
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:36,150
it's like somebody's cousin said it was,
there was work there or somebody on.

620
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,870
It's always like somebody, family member
told them, um, to go for work. Uh, but,

621
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,110
but I've recently read,

622
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,260
read that about kind of like this
recruitment effort in the 70s,

623
00:41:45,261 --> 00:41:49,670
which makes sense of why so many Latinos,
but, but that's where I grew up. Um,

624
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,540
and I couldn't wait to leave,
you know,

625
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:57,320
and I spent a lot of my teenage years,
I guess as many peop many of us do,

626
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:01,220
like wanting to get away
from, you know, where I was.

627
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,090
My family was great and very supportive
and very loving and came from a very

628
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:08,660
loving, supportive home. Not Musicians,
no one in my family as a musician,

629
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,960
but music lovers,
they love to dance.

630
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:16,020
They play music at all
the family functions, um,

631
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,130
as many Caribbean folks do.
So I grew up dancing to satisfy,

632
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:23,750
I grew up listening to
classical music. My father, uh,

633
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:29,300
who was the Cuban, my Cuban side. Um,
he grew up listening to the radio,

634
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,350
classical music he discovered
on the radio in Havana. And, uh,

635
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,380
he had a lifelong love of
classical music and for him,

636
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:41,240
modern music was like
Stravinsky or something.

637
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:44,600
So he wasn't sure like what
I'm trying to do. But, but uh,

638
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:48,650
when you started playing music?
Well, I, he took me to the,

639
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,390
like a toy store and there
was a piano in there,

640
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:53,990
I guess when I was like
four and I supposedly sat
down on the piano and really

641
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,260
couldn't stop playing.

642
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,040
I don't know if it was me who did that
or if it was him because he had always

643
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,830
wanted to be a pianist.
Um,

644
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:04,580
but in that time it wasn't acceptable
for men in that community to be artists

645
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,480
because it would imply that something
about their sexuality or, um,

646
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,600
it just wasn't an
acceptable career choice.

647
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,200
And Cuba in his,
in his community.

648
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,220
I don't know if that's true for all of
all of when he was in Cuba, not after he,

649
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,380
no, no. Yeah. As a child,
when he was growing up,

650
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:23,720
maybe it was something
in his household or, um,

651
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,040
his dad was not a classical music fan.
He would say that some music for,

652
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,880
for dead people, like don't play that one.
I'm here or whatever. But, um, so anyway,

653
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:34,670
my dad says that I couldn't, you
know, stop playing the piano.

654
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,800
So he got me the piano. I was like,
couldn't wait. He's like, well,

655
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:40,970
she's going to be a pianist or like, she's
going to be an opera singer. And, uh,

656
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,850
but then I, I was like, I really like
Mariah Carey actually. I just want to,

657
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,920
I just want to like, ah, I just want
to do more. I carry songs all day.

658
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,200
And he didn't, he was like, if
you want to be like Maria caddy,

659
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:56,090
you need to learn how to, you know,
uh, read music. I was like, really?

660
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,820
You sure can. I just not. So,
um, so he encouraged me to,

661
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,320
to,

662
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,960
to choose another instrument aside from
voice to learn also how to read music.

663
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:09,850
And so I started, you know,
lessons and he, he, uh,

664
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,200
like met people at my school.

665
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:14,860
He was always into something
trying to encourage me to,

666
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:19,910
to be musical and met somebody at the
school who was able to fund a scholarship

667
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:24,620
for me to study privately. And that's
how I learned how to, uh, to read music.

668
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,430
Yeah. And some of my musical
influences, I mean our la,

669
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,300
I grew up listening to classical music.
Ravel is one of my favorites. Um,

670
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:38,670
it has beautiful piano Sonatas and uh,

671
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,640
hip hop I talked about
earlier, j Dilla. Um,

672
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:45,780
it was important for me to discover Bjork.
Um, when I was in my twenties, which I,

673
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,010
when I first heard her album
post, I was like, what is,

674
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:52,650
I don't understand what this is.
I hadn't ever listen to electronic music.

675
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:55,140
I didn't know what that meant.
I didn't know what she was doing.

676
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:59,550
It took me like a good year to really kind
of come back and realize the depth of,

677
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,180
you know,
her compositions and her sound world.

678
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:07,740
And that was really inspiring to me
too. So that's great. Another question.

679
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:08,430
Hi.

680
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,670
So music is brilliant. One of the main
reasons I ended up moving to New York,

681
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,230
and especially like listening to bootlegs
from places like Arlene's grocery and

682
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:20,720
places like that or Jeff
Buckley playing at Shinay. Uh,

683
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,350
but a lot of those places
are gone or you know,

684
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,140
do they still exist but they're
in a different location.

685
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,610
And I'm kinda curious what your favorite
places are to play around the city or

686
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,370
to see new music that
you were discovering.

687
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,560
Oh yeah, that's a great question. Um,

688
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,880
there's a new newish to venue in
Brooklyn called C'mon everybody.

689
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,870
Uh, that has a really, uh,

690
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:49,610
great kind of curatorial program,
a lot of diverse,

691
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,120
uh, groups playing there. It's not one,

692
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:58,100
it's not specific to one
style or one social scene.

693
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,550
I feels like there's a lot of different
kinds of music coming coming through

694
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:06,530
there. Um, and it's a new space
and, um, very welcoming space. Um,

695
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,990
it feels like a safe space for people to,
to gather.

696
00:46:08,991 --> 00:46:11,930
So I really liked going there.
Um, it's one of my favorite,

697
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,440
favorite venues to just kind of
hang out at and check out music. Um,

698
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:19,530
Trans Pecos in Ridgewood is
also a really great venue. Um,

699
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:24,510
that's run by Todd P, kind
of a famous promoter who, uh,

700
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,120
kind of came up doing a lot of
punk shows and DIY shows. Um, he,

701
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:33,390
he runs Trans Pecos and also the market
hotel that just recently reopened. Right.

702
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:38,310
I'm also in Brooklyn. Um, so there
are a lot of great venues, um,

703
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:41,720
to check out music, uh,
check out music at, um,

704
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,880
I guess one of my favorite spaces that
I've ever played in New York best that I

705
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:51,020
love the sound of his Bowery ballroom.
I think that room sounds incredible.

706
00:46:51,021 --> 00:46:55,730
And the house engineer, I agree, he's
a legend. Like, you know, such a,

707
00:46:55,770 --> 00:47:00,020
such a pleasure to, to work there.
And, uh, I just, I love that,

708
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,090
the sound of that room a lot.

709
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,040
Thanks.

710
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,630
Sure that it's actually a great question
because I was going to Shanae and

711
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:11,580
Arlene's and brownies. Um, you know,

712
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,170
it was like there was a scene in,

713
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:17,710
in the East village and then it moves
further down to Ludlow and then Orleans

714
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:22,360
opened and Shinay closed and everything
gets kind of kept moving south. And, um,

715
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:25,540
and then it moved into Brooklyn.
In the 10 years that you've been here,

716
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,680
have you seen a radical shift?
I mean, I spent some in La,

717
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:33,730
I spend time in Nashville and there's
been a little bit of an exodus,

718
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,740
it feels, um, for musicians and
artists from, from this area. Oh yeah.

719
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,330
Do you sense that? Oh, absolutely.

720
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,360
Yeah, definitely. I mean, uh,
when I moved here 10 years ago,

721
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,020
you know,

722
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,080
the Williamsburg of today has nothing
to do with the Williamsburg of even 10

723
00:47:49,081 --> 00:47:53,430
years ago. And I don't even know
before that, who knows? But, um, yeah,

724
00:47:53,431 --> 00:47:56,960
I used to hang out a lot in
Williamsburg. I had some, my first shows,

725
00:47:56,961 --> 00:48:00,810
they're at this place, um,
that was called Galapagos,

726
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,970
that used to be on north
sixth street right next to,

727
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:06,990
what is it a now music hall of
Williamsburg. Then they moved to Dumbo.

728
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,020
Um, and then, uh,

729
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:12,510
there's a big article of them like
moving to Detroit and buying an, uh,

730
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,050
a fabulous, you know, building in
Detroit for, for like $5 or something.

731
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,290
So there's all that. Yeah, that
kind of stuff going down for sure.

732
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:22,650
And the last 10 years. And
um, lots of great venues,

733
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:26,550
glass lands on North on. Um, oh Geez.

734
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,410
On Kent mentality,
that whole scene there with glass,

735
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,140
there was another place called
monkey town. That was my hangout. Um,

736
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,050
that place was wild.
It was like this cube room really small.

737
00:48:37,051 --> 00:48:39,420
You can probably feel like 30
people in there maybe or maybe,

738
00:48:39,421 --> 00:48:43,200
I don't believe it was a hundred, I don't
know. But it was all these video walls,

739
00:48:43,201 --> 00:48:45,540
you know, that you were surrounded
by and then these couches and the,

740
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,810
the artists would play in the middle and
they would have like kind of this like

741
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:52,620
video music sets like Dj sets.
Um,

742
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,380
and like mostly experimental
stuff like late night vibes. Um,

743
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,080
but with such a great space and so many,

744
00:48:58,081 --> 00:49:02,880
so many great venues that have moved on
and don't exist any more. But there are,

745
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,270
there are new new places play.

746
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:07,710
But of course a lot of a recording
studio is also have, you know,

747
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,390
shut down and moved away. And um,
you know, it's an expensive city.

748
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:15,030
It's not an ain't cheap. We got all those
services we were talking about earlier.

749
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:16,280
It's cheap. You know, it's, it's,

750
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,760
it's not cheap to live here so
that it's not conducive to, uh,

751
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:24,890
folks who are maybe trying something
new and starting new adventures or new

752
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:28,620
businesses. It can be a little
challenging, um, certainly when,

753
00:49:28,621 --> 00:49:30,750
when real estate is pricey,
when,

754
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,310
when your rent is too damn high. I don't
know if he can say that on here, but,

755
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,720
um, you know, that, that's the vibe for
sure. But there, but there are still,

756
00:49:39,721 --> 00:49:43,640
you know, I, I, I love New York
City. I love living here. I, I, um,

757
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,650
met incredible people and I meet new,

758
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,940
new people working on really
exciting ideas a lot. And
that's what keeps me here.

759
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:55,290
Yeah. That's great. All right, well,

760
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:58,860
thank you so much for being with us. Thank
you. Fantastic. Thanks for having me.

761
00:49:59,400 --> 00:49:59,540
Great.
