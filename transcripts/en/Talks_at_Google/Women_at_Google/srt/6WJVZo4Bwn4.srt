1
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,100
We're so excited to have

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,810
20 here hear from Austin. Um, I think
most of you know her. Um, for her,

3
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:19,640
she has fought tirelessly, uh, first
as a Texas state senator and then, um,

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,640
and her run for governor, uh, Fort
Women's reproductive rights, uh,

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,020
gender equal pay,
Lgbtq rights,

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,910
justice for sexual assault survivors
just has an incredible track record.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,810
Um, and I think you probably also know
her for a somewhat historic 13 hour

8
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:37,460
filibuster in some cases,
sneakers.

9
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,030
MMM.

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,770
And most recently she has started an
advocacy group called deeds, not words,

11
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:47,000
which we're going to talk about today.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
That is all about channeling the energy
and passion for gender equality into

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,630
actionable change. So hello everyone.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,510
Okay.

15
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,590
So why don't we start with deeds,

16
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:05,360
not words and tell us a little bit
about it and why you founded it. I

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,250
started deeds, not words. It's a
nonprofit organization about a year ago.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,840
It really starting from the perspective
of wanting to make sure that we were

19
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,430
giving the best opportunity for that
next generation of young women who are

20
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:27,041
going to be the filibuster errors of the
future to find their way to that path.

21
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,710
Um,

22
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,710
I travel and speak a lot and I was
frequently asked a question that I'm still

23
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:36,200
asked a lot, which is
what do we do right? And,

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,580
and you see this incredible
knowledge and passion,

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,440
but sometimes a struggle about where to
connect that to action. And so deeds,

26
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:49,520
not words was born really
with two big ideas in mind.

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,640
One is to make sure that we're putting
together in one place an area that you

28
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:59,630
can go to a hub,
our digital hub,

29
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:04,631
and you can find a variety of different
organizations and the work that they're

30
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:09,530
doing in the gender equality world.
And it's separated by health.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,550
So things that are happening in the
reproductive rights world. For example,

32
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,210
safety, which of course
includes campus sexual assault,

33
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,070
human trafficking and sexual assault,
criminal justice reform work.

34
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,530
Um,
economic opportunity,

35
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:28,730
which includes a lot of organizations
that are working on equality of pay on

36
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,470
affordable quality,
child care,

37
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:35,420
on increasing the minimum
wage on family leave policies.

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,750
All of those things that make such an
important difference in our ability to

39
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:42,290
equalize our economic
opportunity in this country.

40
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,850
And then leadership,

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,030
there are so many different organizations
who have one based right here in

42
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:52,031
California emerge that are really there
for women to make sure that where we

43
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:57,560
have women who are thinking about
stepping forward and running for office,

44
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,680
they have the support around and the
system that helps them to raise money and

45
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:06,700
to have the resources and the knowledge
that they need to do that and to do it

46
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,790
well.
So that's what we do in the digital space.

47
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:14,500
We have a weekly digital
newsletter called the deeds digest.

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,370
And in that newsletter we inform,
we try to inspire,

49
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:23,371
I hope we do sometimes and we end each
deeds digest with the dues of the week.

50
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:29,590
And those dues always tie in to the
things that we talked about in that

51
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:33,520
particular newsletter.
And then we do a daily deed.

52
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:37,780
We started doing that just a few
weeks ago, um, post women's march,

53
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:42,190
trying to make sure that where people
were looking for a way to plug in and some

54
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,560
direction and guidance in that regard.
We do that.

55
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,750
That's all the digital part of what we do.
The other piece of it,

56
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:54,100
and certainly this is how I found
my way into the political world,

57
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,360
is helping us to find
our power as advocates.

58
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,130
It can be kind of hard to navigate your
way into that and to know exactly how to

59
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:03,460
do it.

60
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,460
I think that indivisible has been such
an important resource and helping people

61
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,060
to see how we can use our voices
in a very, very powerful way.

62
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:16,990
And I love the structure and the guidance
that they've put together for that.

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,240
We are doing tactical
trainings of advocacy work.

64
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,220
So we started in Texas.

65
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:28,480
We have our eye on several other
states that we want to expand into,

66
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,710
but we're working with both high
school and college age, young women.

67
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,370
And we're helping to foster their
voices into the legislative process.

68
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:44,140
So they're working on two key issues
right now with a number of legislators,

69
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,170
kind of from idea to how you write a piece
of legislation to coming to committee

70
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:54,220
hearings and testifying for it and how
you present yourself and how to make a

71
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:55,960
most effective argument.

72
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,260
And the areas that we're really focusing
on in that work are sex trafficking of

73
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:06,451
minors and also sexual assault reforms
in both the criminal justice world rape

74
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:11,500
kit backlog, for example,
statute of limitations issues,

75
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,740
but also campus sexual assault and kind
of changing the landscape of what our

76
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:21,160
understanding is about consent.
Um, how we define that,

77
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:25,730
how we define um, yes, rather
than no means no. What,

78
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:28,550
what does it mean to say
yes. Um, so we're focused on,

79
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:33,551
on those things and we find that our
young audience is very interested and

80
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:36,640
passionate about those particular issues.

81
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:40,750
And so it's been a really good way
to foster their advocacy skills.

82
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,170
What's been the most surprising thing
that you've discovered since starting?

83
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,320
I guess just the,
the challenge of taking an idea.

84
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,280
I can do the political thing pretty well.

85
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,000
I know how to navigate my way in that.
And that's a learning curve too,

86
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,880
just like anything. But it's a
learning curve for me right now.

87
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:06,881
How to take these ideas and
most effectively implement
them and just how hard it

88
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,120
is to be a startup.

89
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,880
A startup nonprofit is no different really
than a startup profit other than you

90
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,920
obviously don't need to make money.

91
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,970
You need people to donate money to the
vcs are maybe a little less excited about

92
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:26,020
the nonprofit. Sorry. I guess
that's so true. Yeah. Um,

93
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,360
but I think most surprising is
just how eager people are to,

94
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,810
to be connected in ways that make them
feel like their voices really make a

95
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,280
difference and they do make a difference.
They truly do.

96
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,070
And what, and so it sounds
like from everything you're
talking about that to you,

97
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,470
the biggest way to
affect political change,

98
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:48,930
kind of the current political landscape.
Would it be to get more women out there?

99
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,670
Nope. Awesome. Um, what,
what else? Like what else?

100
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,930
Obviously you need to have your
focus on, on, on, on say, advocacy.

101
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,650
What other areas do you think could
be making a difference right now?

102
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,770
I'm sure there are a lot of people in
this room and on the livestream that want

103
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:06,240
to know how they could get more involved.

104
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,620
What do you think is the most effective?

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,910
You and I had a great conversation a
moment ago before we came up here and I

106
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,800
thought you actually characterize
and crystallize this perfectly.

107
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,460
What you were saying was that we have to
pick those two or three things that we

108
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:29,581
are really going to care about and dive
into and try to avoid the temptation

109
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,430
because there's so much
going on right now, um,

110
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,970
to weigh in an every little space.

111
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,240
So whatever that area
of passion is for you,

112
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,270
whether it's the environment or Lgbtq
equality or transgender rights and

113
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,450
specific or women's equality and
all of the different realms of that,

114
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,420
find the place that really connects
to you or that you connect to.

115
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:02,410
Because what you'll find, I've
certainly always found this in my life.

116
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,690
If you follow the thing that you really
care about and you use your energy on

117
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:08,530
that thing,

118
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,130
it's going to take you to a place that
you wouldn't have expected and it's going

119
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:17,860
to be unbelievably
fulfilling but personally,

120
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:22,861
but also with your ability to actually
have an impact on it because it's coming

121
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:26,470
from a place that's really true too.
So whatever that is,

122
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,160
look for organizations that are
working in that world. You know,

123
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:34,930
if it's voting rights,
you know, a Clu, um,

124
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,340
if it's a women's reproductive freedoms,
obviously you know,

125
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:44,341
the incredible organizational work of
groups like planned parenthood and Nay

126
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,860
Raul, but maybe you don't know so much
about the center for reproductive rights,

127
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:52,861
which is doing all the legal work
on this and actually were the,

128
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:58,311
the major impetus behind successful
supreme court case that we won last year.

129
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,773
Um,

130
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,270
maybe you care particularly about making
sure that women have access to safe and

131
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,290
legal abortion.

132
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,950
And you want to really get into the
ground level of that and support

133
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,440
organizations like the Lilith Fund,

134
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:18,360
which makes sure that women can afford
to have an abortion if they otherwise

135
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:20,280
don't have the financial means to do that.

136
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:24,960
So there's so many different ways to
plug in and what we hope to do with our

137
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:29,610
website and we're actually in a revamp
of it right now to make it much more

138
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:34,050
meaningful. If you're looking
for that place to plug in. Um,

139
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,790
we want to be a place where you can go
and depending on that area of interest,

140
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,210
you plug into one of those organizations
and you will find immediately two or

141
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:49,020
three key ways that they're asking for
you to get involved on a realtime basis,

142
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,200
some more intense and some less intense,

143
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:56,580
but ways where you can meaningfully be
contributing your time and your energy.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
And what about companies?

145
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,410
What role do you think companies
should or shouldn't have?

146
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,790
Have you seen their advocacy be effective?
I think there are,

147
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,480
advocacy is tremendously effective.
Um,

148
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,250
I'm sensitive obviously to the
fact that companies walk, uh,

149
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,470
uh, quite a fine line in terms of not
wanting to get involved so much in the

150
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,000
partisan world.

151
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,300
And that makes sense because they have
consumers who sit on both sides of that

152
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:30,000
line. They have, I'm sure employees
that sit on both sides of that line.

153
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,720
But I think we find our way into the
things that make sense when we are being

154
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:41,640
very issue focused.
And so for example,

155
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,800
last year in my home state of Texas,
uh,

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
American Airlines became the title sponsor
of the planned parenthood luncheon in

157
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:56,100
Dallas for the very first time.
I almost cried. I literally,

158
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,130
I was so blown away by it because it
means such a powerful statement for a

159
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:06,321
company like that to say we support
women's reproductive healthcare and this

160
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:12,651
organization and in the face of all the
political flack that planned parenthood

161
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:15,390
is in the midst of, we're going to step
forward and we're going to do this.

162
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,520
So I think,
you know,

163
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:22,230
for companies to find their way into
issue areas that really mattered to them

164
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:27,210
and to use their influence. And there
are many ways for them to do that.

165
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,751
Of course,

166
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:32,751
we certainly saw the incredible impact
in North Carolina last year with the

167
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:36,090
transgender bathroom
bill, Texas, by the way.

168
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,340
It's trying to replicate that right now.

169
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:43,341
And I'm pleased to see we've got some
corporate push back already beginning to

170
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:44,214
percolate.

171
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,370
But that corporate push back in North
Carolina not only contributed to really,

172
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,270
um, uh, an economic impact to the state,

173
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,810
but it made such a powerful statement
economically that it impacted the way

174
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:04,120
voters thought about that issue.

175
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:09,121
So that in the last gubernatorial race
that they had during the presidential

176
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:13,930
election cycle, they elected
a statewide democrat. Um,

177
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,040
that was considered a really long
shot thing to do there actually.

178
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,240
And they did it because people,

179
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,990
now we're coming at this issue
from a variety of perspectives,

180
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:27,700
whether it was something that they cared
about from their social conscience or

181
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,370
whether they cared about
it because they understand,

182
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,910
understood it was having an impact
economically to their state and maybe to

183
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,730
their own book.
Uh,

184
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,140
that's what companies have
the power to do and to,

185
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,350
to broaden the conversation in a way
that really does lift it up out of the

186
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:48,340
social and makes it something that's
much more meaningful in the day to day

187
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:53,341
lives of people who have respect for or
who are impacted by the decisions and

188
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,930
the actions that that company takes.

189
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,230
So where do you think companies are
still being silent? Like why don't,

190
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:01,540
what issue do you wish companies
are speaking out more of that?

191
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,800
When I looked at what happened
in North Carolina, um,

192
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,830
with appreciation and awe
for the companies that
stepped forward so powerfully

193
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,510
on that and objected to it,

194
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,110
I found myself longing for that
same response in other areas.

195
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,273
Um,

196
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,370
I of course am very focused on gender
equality and I wish we saw more of that

197
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:31,771
when it came to issues that
particularly impact women in Texas.

198
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,200
When we pass that antiabortion bill in
2013 that was in and of itself terrible.

199
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,830
But what happened actually two years
prior to that that a lot of people didn't

200
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,930
know about,
there was no big filibuster.

201
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:51,931
It didn't capture the attention of people
around the world in 2011 in an assault

202
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:56,080
on planned parenthood,

203
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,500
there was a dramatic defunding of women's
health care there and they couldn't

204
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:05,830
really de-select just planned parenthood.
Um,

205
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:10,030
and so what happened was that there
was this wholesale withdrawal of funds.

206
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:10,950
Number one,

207
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,400
the state decided to no longer
participate in the women's health program,

208
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,700
which was giving us about $30 million
a year for women's reproductive health

209
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:21,611
care.

210
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:26,050
It's aimed particularly at lowering the
Medicaid birth rate and saving taxpayer

211
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:27,340
money by virtue of doing it.

212
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,140
And it really was saving a tremendous
amount of taxpayer money. Um,

213
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,730
we deep participated in that and that
affected not just planned parenthood,

214
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:40,480
but everyone that was getting
money for birth control,

215
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:43,810
reproductive healthcare
services in our state.

216
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,110
And then there was also a $78 million
state defunding of these women's

217
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,070
reproductive healthcare centers. None
of these were providing abortion care,

218
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,240
not a single one.

219
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,780
And overnight we had over 80
clinics close all over our state.

220
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,190
Those that still remained open.

221
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,191
We're hobbled really badly and could only
see a small percentage of the patients

222
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,960
that they'd been seeing.

223
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,380
And there's a wide range of estimates
about the number of women who were

224
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:15,951
impacted,

225
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:20,390
but it's anywhere from 100 to
180,000 women in one fell swoop.

226
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,260
And we see the circumstances
of that in our state.

227
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:29,261
We have the highest maternal death rate
of any developed country in the world.

228
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,030
In the state of Texas.

229
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,740
Our maternal death rate doubled in
about a six year period of time.

230
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,560
So these are dramatic,

231
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,520
horrific human consequences that women
are getting sucked into by virtue of

232
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,460
partisan politics. And I want to
see companies step forward and say,

233
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,550
when these sorts of things are happening,
you know,

234
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:59,870
we were going to relocate our corporate
headquarters to Dallas, Texas,

235
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,430
and now we've decided not to,

236
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,050
or were the NCA and we were going to
host the final four there and now we've

237
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:08,570
decided not to or were the
Superbowl and we were coming,

238
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:09,800
but now we're not going to,

239
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,010
I want to see that kind of response when
women are under assault because it's

240
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:20,471
not just that we are failing to
realize our full equal opportunity.

241
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,680
It's that we literally are the shrapnel
in these political wars where human

242
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,420
lives are being impacted
and devastating ways.

243
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,230
And it's something that we all ought to
care about because at the end of the day,

244
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,940
it impacts everyone. And at the end of
the day, it impacts our economy as well.

245
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,133
So how do you do it?

246
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,850
How do you get women into this obviously
disproportionately dramatically affects

247
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:47,840
the poor,
right?

248
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,650
And then you have a wealthier women
who are at companies who are at these

249
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:52,484
companies.

250
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,900
How do you get them to stand up in the
same way that people have stood up for

251
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,170
other rights, like rights for other groups
that they don't necessarily belong to?

252
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,180
I think part of it starts within
the culture of the organization,

253
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:07,520
the company itself.
Right. And what does the,

254
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,020
what is the makeup of that company look
like in terms of the number of women on

255
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:12,854
it's board,

256
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,840
the number of women that are in the
executive suites of that company.

257
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,830
That has a lot of influence
in these conversations. Um,

258
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,850
and so continuing for gender equality
in the positions that women occupy is a

259
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,440
very important part of that.

260
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:35,441
Josh says is the case for making sure
that we have women fully reflected at

261
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:39,920
every level of representative
government in this country unless,

262
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,060
and until we have that,

263
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,440
we're not going to move this
conversation really where it needs to go,

264
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,980
but we have an opportunity as employees
and as to to exert our own influences.

265
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,940
Uh, we've been talking about
that a bit at deeds, not words.

266
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,250
When I first was hatching this idea,

267
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:04,251
one of the things I wanted us ultimately
to be able to do is to weigh in as

268
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:09,771
consumers and to help direct consumer
decision making based on a company's score

269
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,880
with how well it's doing
to support gender equality.

270
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,090
Is this a company where there are,
um,

271
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,230
a representative number of women in the
executive suites and on the board is,

272
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:29,091
it's a company that's like salesforce
done a self examination of pay equity and

273
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,640
worked hard to make sure
they were equalizing.

274
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,640
It is that a company that has a good a
family leave policy both for dads and

275
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:42,450
moms so that we do have true gender
equality in the way that that's happening

276
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,840
and helping to drive people's positive
buying decisions based on companies that

277
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,170
score well in that regard.
Right now.

278
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm sure you've all seen grab your
wallet and Grab Your Wallet is doing, uh,

279
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,280
I think an interesting job of making
sure that they're making people aware of

280
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:07,491
how to take their dollars
away as consumers from
companies who aren't behaving

281
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:12,480
well. I have found myself
responding to that. Um,

282
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,070
and, and thinking about which rideshare
company I'm going to use for example,

283
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:20,670
or, um, which retail establishment,

284
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,060
not Macy's that I'm going to shop at.
Um,

285
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,120
I have my unexperienced with Macy's
because they actually advocated against an

286
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:33,930
equal pay law in Texas and were successful
in getting the governor to veto an

287
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,330
equal pay law that I worked very,
very hard on.

288
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,520
So if any of your shopping at Macy's,

289
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,680
it's going to add my 2 cents to what's
already on the grab your wallet site when

290
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,300
it comes to that particular company.

291
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:50,301
But we have influences in that regard
and I think we're starting to see some of

292
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:56,631
the response that private companies are
making to watching the way consumers are

293
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,160
responding.

294
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,460
This young woman that we were talking
about earlier who just recently left Uber

295
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,830
and who shared her story essentially
for the outside world and the immediate

296
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:14,130
impact that that's had a while,

297
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,840
she worked within that culture for a
very long time trying to change it,

298
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,770
bringing outside attention
on it and having the,

299
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,100
the executive offices have to deal with
the public opinion of their company

300
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,440
based on that.
That experience,

301
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:34,770
I think it has shown
we have a lot of power.

302
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,010
If we can really kind of focus that you
had to think an acronym to see easier.

303
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,900
Right?
Right now it's very almost,

304
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,710
it's an entirely almost offline or an
individual experience where yes, Kay,

305
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,190
you can post

306
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,100
on social that you've done boycotted
something or support something.

307
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,800
But it'll be interesting to see how
that evolves is that I think the tech

308
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,830
solutions get easier with a company,
like you said,

309
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,510
the companies that are doing the things
that align with your values and how that

310
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,344
gets surfaced.

311
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,590
So how did you get into politics and
what was the moment where you were just

312
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,720
like, Oh wow, I'm a big deal.

313
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,870
I haven't had, I promise you I haven't
had that moment. I'm like, what?

314
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:14,650
That when you went to cabinet
or during a filibuster. Yeah. I,

315
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,970
I know we all do this,
but I think women particularly do this.

316
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:22,380
We take in all the things that we're not
achieving as opposed to celebrating the

317
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:26,160
things that we're doing well, right?
We tend to be very self critical. Um,

318
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,110
but my entree into politics and the
reason that I was really committed to the

319
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:33,450
advocacy training work of deeds,

320
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:38,451
not words happened when I went
to a city council meeting,

321
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,930
I was in my thirties.

322
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:44,130
I was arguing for something in my
neighborhood along with, you know,

323
00:21:44,131 --> 00:21:46,530
a lot of other people in
the neighborhood community.

324
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,710
And I walked into that council chamber,

325
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,800
express my opinion and
then just got the idea,

326
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,530
well, I could be one of those
people sitting up there, you know,

327
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:00,390
and this is interesting actually,

328
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:03,540
and I think I would really
thrive in this environment.

329
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,570
And so it just opened up the idea for me.

330
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:10,170
I had not been paying
attention to politics.

331
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:14,740
I was one of those people that
I really work on right now. Um,

332
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,740
I was a young single mom.

333
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:21,741
I was working two jobs and going to school
and my struggles did not include the

334
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,980
thought about how my voice could make a
difference in the political world. And I,

335
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,780
I really didn't set up and pay attention
to it until I saw Hillary Clinton

336
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,440
fighting for universal health care as
first lady. That was kind of my first,

337
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,110
you know,
tug into it where it,

338
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,210
it seemed relevant and meaningful to
me based on my own experiences and

339
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:50,130
struggles with healthcare as an uninsured
person. So we find our ways. Again,

340
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:53,010
I think, um, when we are,

341
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,550
we're help to demystify that process
where we see that those fancy capitol

342
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:00,091
buildings,

343
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:05,091
whether we're talking about the one
in DC or the ones around our states,

344
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,820
those buildings belong to us.
There's nothing

345
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,460
really mysterious or,
or intimidating about them.

346
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:17,190
And I think we have to demystify them.
And,

347
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:21,330
and I'm pleased to be doing that for
some young people in my own state and

348
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:24,720
helping them to see that, you know,
the people that are elected there,

349
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,820
while they may refer to it
as my district or my office,

350
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,710
the district is actually one
that belongs to the people.

351
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,970
Our office belongs to us.

352
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,020
They have to at least at
some level listened to us,

353
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:42,000
even if they do avoid us in town halls,

354
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:44,370
which some of them around
the country have been doing,

355
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,370
but we the power to speak out by calling
their offices right in their offices,

356
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:52,550
coming to committee hearings and letting
them know how we feel about things.

357
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:53,850
And um,

358
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,020
I hope that the more people we
can encourage and to that venue,

359
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:04,181
the more young women will see that they
have every right to be sitting up at

360
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:10,340
those decision making tables and that
they'll begin to view that as something

361
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:12,410
that they want to do for themselves.

362
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:12,861
And you know,

363
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:17,240
I imagine one of the most discouraging
things when you're thinking about running

364
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:20,480
for any kind of office or speaking up
is that you always know that this is all

365
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:23,450
going to be seen through the lens of
your gender. And I remember, I mean,

366
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,010
I remember when you were running for
governor and there was like how many hours

367
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:29,870
a week did you spend with your kids?
Right?

368
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:32,810
Or it was like how many days
in a month when you were,

369
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,380
did you go back to see your kids, which
you never ever, ever, right, right.

370
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:40,280
What happen? Um, and it's got to be
something that's quite discouraging.

371
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:43,220
Not only just the public aspect of the
soul, but knowing that you're going to be,

372
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,900
you have to fight twice as hard
to be taken seriously. How,

373
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,660
you know, how did you navigate
that? I mean, was it, do you know,

374
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,120
to a certain degree you'd have to play
that game that you can't transcend it

375
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:56,060
entirely the same time you want to
have control over your narrative.

376
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:56,900
How did you to

377
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,590
approach that or how do you
purchase it today too? For me, it's,

378
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,120
it's still one of the most frustrating
experiences that I've had in the

379
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:08,630
political world and women
faced this and you know,

380
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:11,000
every level of profession.

381
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,400
One of the things that was successfully
done to me during my gubernatorial race,

382
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:19,730
and it was really kind of,
I mean,

383
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:22,940
if I stand aside and just
look at it as a spectator,

384
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,300
I'm rather fascinated by it
being in the middle of it.

385
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:30,110
It was horrific and painful.
Um,

386
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,950
but one of the clever things that happens
in the political world is trying to

387
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:42,461
figure out how to take a candidates
best asset and make it their weakness.

388
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,040
And that's what happened with me.

389
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,550
My asset was my story,

390
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,800
the American dream story of
coming from poverty, struggling,

391
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,760
fighting,

392
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,900
making my way all the way
through Harvard law school,

393
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,980
first person in my family to ever even
go to college, nevermind graduate.

394
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,700
And then to,
you know,

395
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,730
have a career where I gave back to my own
life experiences and the things that I

396
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:17,450
fought for that, that
was my feather, right?

397
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:22,040
That was the thing that I could
distinguish myself about. Well,

398
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:26,720
my story got ripped out from under me.
I was a bad mother.

399
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,320
I commuted back and forth from Boston to
Fort Worth and my second and third year

400
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:39,200
of law school because that first year,
taking my girls there with me,

401
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,160
what's not just really hard on me.
It was so hard on them.

402
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,730
Um, and where a man would never
have been questioned about that.

403
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,500
My Bona Fides as a mother
was called in to question.

404
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:57,180
My two daughters actually
had to come forward. And,

405
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:57,940
uh,

406
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,940
they wrote a very heartfelt letter that
they read publicly about my bonafide,

407
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:05,500
he's has a mother.
Um,

408
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,700
you just wouldn't see
this happening for men,

409
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,920
but I understood why they were doing it.

410
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,220
And I also understood with some of the
labels that they used with me why they

411
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,120
were doing them.

412
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,640
Abortion Barbie was a label that
was used quite often for me.

413
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,181
And in fact,

414
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:28,770
when I came to do some fundraising in
southern California during that race,

415
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,100
there were these big posters that
have been put up all over la with,

416
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,940
there were three d posters with
a Barbie plastic transparent,

417
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,860
uh,

418
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,860
belly with a plastic baby doll in the
belly and me with scissors in my hand.

419
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,330
Um, so why would they do that? Well,
a couple of things. Number one,

420
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:56,390
they wanted to make me a candidate that
was all about abortion and to take away

421
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,170
the entire body of work that I had done
as a public servant and what I had to

422
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:02,400
offer as a candidate.

423
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,500
But they also wanted the Barbie
image was very purposeful.

424
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,920
If we can invite voters to think about
women candidates in terms of how we look,

425
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,850
then we dismiss our capacities as leaders.

426
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:22,851
We're inviting people to think about
them as mothers and bad mothers at that.

427
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:23,760
Um,

428
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,760
as women who are no more than the makeup
of what we look like and to therefore

429
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,700
take away our perspectives
about our true value as leaders.

430
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:41,040
It happens to women in the
political world all the time.

431
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,000
I am not unique.
Uh,

432
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,400
it was particularly bad in my race and
it's particularly bad in Hillary's race,

433
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,230
but it happens to women all the
time. And I think, you know, the,

434
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:57,231
the best way to ride through that and
to rise above it is to continue to fight

435
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:02,100
back every single time and
to pop right back up. That,

436
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,700
that was one of the things that
I always admired about Hillary.

437
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,560
I've never seen anyone that could pop
right back up and get back out there and

438
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:15,060
fight another day. And it's
unfortunate that we have to do it,

439
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,890
but it's the reality.

440
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,610
And I think unless and until we have more
women in those gubernatorial mansions

441
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,340
and,

442
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,340
and until we have a woman in the White
House and we can show the incredible

443
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:35,220
capacity that women have to lead
in those executive positions,

444
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,550
we're going to continue to
struggle with these stereotypes.

445
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:43,551
So I really committed to just doing
everything we can to chip away at it and

446
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:48,760
school boards and city councils
and every state legislative,

447
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:53,410
um, body in this country and obviously
at the congressional and of course the

448
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:55,150
presidential level too.

449
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,110
And so you,
you've lost the race and you know,

450
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:02,320
in the valley we love to talk about
failure and it makes us all stronger.

451
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:05,580
And like there's usually a story, oh,
I failed at this and then I, you know,

452
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,620
it was bankrupt and I looked up at the
stars and realize that it disrupts the

453
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:11,220
auto industry or something. Right. And
then you become this like a millionaire.

454
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,840
Did you have an equivalent moment?
I mean,

455
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,660
did you take anything from that failure?

456
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,380
Most definitely.
I,

457
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,120
I wrote an essay for Lena
Dunham's Lenny letter,

458
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,510
um,
just within a few months of that race.

459
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,960
And if it's okay for
me to say a curse word,

460
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:34,810
the title of my essay was
I fucking hate to lose. Um,

461
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,590
and, and I talked about just what a
competitive person I am by nature.

462
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:42,890
I'm sure a lot of you are as well.
Um,

463
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,250
but that,
you know,

464
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:50,620
going back to that beautiful
Teddy Roosevelt, um,

465
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,070
quote about what it
means to be in the ring,

466
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:00,490
to be that person who sweats and tries
their hardest and comes up short,

467
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:06,910
but how much more glorious it is to be
that person than to be the person who's

468
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:10,490
standing on the sideline as the critic.
Right?

469
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,680
It's only when we

470
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,750
put ourselves out there and we risk
losing that we will ever move the ball.

471
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,763
Um,

472
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,230
there's value no matter what
in that moving of the ball.

473
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,640
I know in the political world
that in places like Texas,

474
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,740
a lot of times these conversations,

475
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:36,950
these hard conversations that
need to be had about policy,

476
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:42,190
they're not being had except for when we
have these big statewide contest where

477
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:47,990
we can raise the conversation and the
level of consciousness around them.

478
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:52,220
And for me that was really important
part of running for office.

479
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,710
Um, but the same can be said of
anything that we are working to do,

480
00:31:57,711 --> 00:32:02,711
anything we're striving for that's hard
and that we may fail at every attempt we

481
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:08,801
make at it advances that a little bit
and we ultimately will succeed in those

482
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:13,970
goals,
whether it's me individually or not.

483
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,870
I will have played a part in
moving that ball forward. And,

484
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:22,280
and so in my essay Wa what I
said was if you're going to fail,

485
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:23,750
like fail big,

486
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,020
fail gloriously trying to do something
that really matters to you and when you

487
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:33,930
fail and you deal with that,
um,

488
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,160
consequence in terms of how that feels,

489
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,790
really try to center around
how extraordinary you are
that you tried it and that

490
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:45,344
you,

491
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:50,120
you moved to the ball and then if you've
got it in you and I hope you do get

492
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:54,920
back up and try to do it again. And
let me just, I've got more questions,

493
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:58,040
but I bet there's probably some stories.
So do we are we didn't live as well.

494
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,113
Yeah.

495
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,620
How do you combat and deal with people
who have violently opposed views to you

496
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,460
even on like base principles and then get
to talking policy with them afterwards

497
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:08,900
if they're base beliefs are different.

498
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,670
There's some people that you can't
talk to. Um, I know that's not a very,

499
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,780
um, in my leather side of
experience, for example,

500
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:26,930
I really prided myself on working
across the aisle and got quiet.

501
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,400
A lot of legislation passed doing that.
You have to do that in Texas have it's,

502
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:36,600
uh, quite, um, predominantly
republican place.

503
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,970
But there are some areas where it's worth
drawing that line. You know, where you,

504
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,270
you can't find a way to compromise.

505
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,820
And I think the most effective way to
communicate when you're in that place or

506
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,870
any of these places actually,

507
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,200
even where you do find that middle is to
do it through personal experiences and,

508
00:33:58,591 --> 00:34:00,060
and human stories.

509
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,720
A lot of times we have these conversations
up in the ethereal world and we're

510
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:10,800
kind of stuck in our own ideological
way of thinking about them.

511
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,000
But when we can make them more real,
it really makes a difference.

512
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So a great example of how that can move
the ball and the conversation around

513
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:26,271
Lgbtq equality that really began to
move when a great deal of work was done.

514
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:35,241
Determining how to talk about it and
to talk about it in a way that was more

515
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:37,860
resonant than had been the case.

516
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:42,780
It had been talked about specifically as
equality and that we all ought to care

517
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,670
about it just to be,
you know,

518
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:48,450
living in a full and equal world that
we all ought to be treated that way.

519
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,540
But the conversation shifted purposefully.

520
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:56,541
So to be much more personal and a lot
of work actually was done in your state

521
00:34:56,731 --> 00:35:00,840
around that door to door
conversations with people were, had,

522
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:02,790
were um,

523
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,410
couples who are impacted by the inequality
of marriage equality, for example,

524
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,590
would go to a older
Republican household and say,

525
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,780
we want to talk to you about
why this matters to us.

526
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:21,410
It really shifted people's thinking
about it and it's because it,

527
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,450
it became personal and because
they saw it as something personal.

528
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,170
Storytelling is powerful.

529
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:35,460
And I love seeing the fact that it's
becoming more and more prominent and that

530
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:40,461
technology as has such a great platform
for people to share stories and to

531
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:42,480
influence based on that.

532
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:47,330
A lot of abortion story
sharing going on online, um,

533
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,400
post 2013 and the filibuster and kind
of people's consciousness raising about

534
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:57,360
that. And I think that's our most
effective way to try to get through hard

535
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:59,740
conversations. But that doesn't
mean everyone's always right.

536
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,720
Hi, I'm Monica and I'm so
excited that you're here.

537
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,210
I grew up in south Texas.
Um,

538
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,720
and when I was growing up and
Richards was the governor,

539
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:14,290
so I'm going to ask a question
just on the topic of failure again.

540
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:19,130
Um, she was the first governor I got
to vote for. I went on to work in, um,

541
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,990
President Clinton's first White House,
Barbara Boxer,

542
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,370
Dianne Feinstein.
All these women were,

543
00:36:27,371 --> 00:36:32,350
were running and I felt so invigorated
as a young woman coming out of college.

544
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,810
Um, it's a very different story now and
I look at that from when I was young and

545
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:41,380
where we are now. Everything that
Hillary Clinton's had to go through.

546
00:36:41,381 --> 00:36:44,530
Everything that Elizabeth Warren
is going through, et Cetera,

547
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,610
everything you've gone through. And thank
you by the way, for going through that.

548
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,560
Um, where have we failed and
what do I tell my daughter?

549
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,890
It's such a hard question. The,
what do I tell my daughter?

550
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,310
That was such a hard question.
Um, the night of the election,

551
00:37:01,311 --> 00:37:06,311
I have a 34 year old and a 28 year
old daughter and I was at the event in

552
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,124
Manhattan.

553
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:13,260
I had phone conversations with
both of my daughters that evening.

554
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:18,770
Both of them crying their eyes out and
both of them asking questions from a

555
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:24,990
place of what was real fear,
what's going to happen,

556
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,140
what's going to happen.
Um,

557
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,130
I'm feel really optimistic
right now about the,

558
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:39,131
what's going to happen because I am so
encouraged by the personal reaction that

559
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:43,550
people have had to saying,

560
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,460
we're going to step forward and
we're going to use our voices.

561
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,830
What you tell your daughter,

562
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,390
I hope is to participate in that with you.

563
00:37:53,391 --> 00:37:55,340
To the extent that you participate in it.

564
00:37:55,610 --> 00:38:00,610
Show her through role modeling the power
that you have and how you're going to

565
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:05,420
express it and show her that
you're going to sustain it.

566
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,420
I think that's one of the
big questions right now.

567
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:13,690
Are we going to sustain this enthusiasm
that we have right now for our values

568
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:19,520
and our desire to make sure that
they're going to be heard? Um,

569
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,560
but at that top level, once
again, I think it is our

570
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,600
very important responsibility to make
sure that we're doing everything we can to

571
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,150
create legislative bodies,

572
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,800
reflect who we are as a community.
Um,

573
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,310
and that doesn't just mean
making sure we have women,

574
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,210
it means making sure we have women
of color who are dramatically

575
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,920
underrepresented and legislative
bodies around this country that we have

576
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,910
transgender,
uh,

577
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,080
representatives that we have people from
different cultures and religions and

578
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,740
backgrounds,
both socioeconomically and otherwise.

579
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,820
Unless we're really reflected
in the decision makers,

580
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:12,150
we're not going to move things forward
as productively and as effectively and as

581
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:14,260
quickly as we'd like to see.

582
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,320
So if you're going to spend
your energy somewhere,

583
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,660
I would say run for office, um, or,

584
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:28,090
or you know, find a candidate that you
can get behind and that you can help,

585
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,690
not just by writing them
a $5 check every week,

586
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:33,580
but making sure that,
you know,

587
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,580
you're gonna knock on some doors for them
and you have some conversations about

588
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:40,120
why their election makes a difference.
Republicans for a long time,

589
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:45,121
I've been very astute at building from
the base up and making sure that they are

590
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:51,490
putting people in places where they have
the potential to climb in the political

591
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:55,090
world. So those school board
races and city council races,

592
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:57,980
which is where I started to, um, it,

593
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,840
it's a really important way
for us to make an impact.

594
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,280
Hi,
my name is Meena and um,

595
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,970
first I just want to say thanks for
coming and also thank you cause I,

596
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,580
you really personally affected me.
Um,

597
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,740
I actually did knock on doors
for you in Texas as part of, um,

598
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,000
um, and I, I really,

599
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:27,150
I want to say that I feel like
you revitalize politics in Texas.

600
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,450
Um, everyone that I spoke to, we spoke
to a number of people who actually said,

601
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:35,400
you know, we're switching parties.
Like they were frustrated and,

602
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,740
and I felt like you had a
big part in that thing. Um,

603
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,530
and you know,
as you mentioned,

604
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:46,531
we are seeing a revitalization in
interest in politics and people getting

605
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:49,900
involved. Um, one of my questions are,

606
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:54,901
one of my question is you also see women
voting against their own interests a

607
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,740
lot of the time.
And you know,

608
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:02,470
I feel like it is because
they just focus on one issue.

609
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:07,471
How can we make it a larger conversation
so that they actually perhaps want to

610
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:12,690
start supporting each other rather
than tearing each other down.

611
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,720
Um, I like the way you ended that last
question because it made me think of

612
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:22,610
something that Chelsea
Handler's had recently about
women that we've been taught

613
00:41:22,611 --> 00:41:24,650
to tackle,
not to climb.

614
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:29,370
And I do think sometimes we can be each
other's own worst enemy because there's

615
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,110
a lot of judgment that goes on, right?
Depending on the choices that we've made,

616
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,760
our own lives and careers or whether
that career is outside the home or inside

617
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,740
the home.
Um,

618
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,220
this is the $20 million question though.

619
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,450
How do we make sure that people aren't
voting against their own interests?

620
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,230
And there's a lot of education that
needs to take place because people aren't

621
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:56,900
going to vote against their own interest
because they think they're voting

622
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:59,810
against their interests. They really
believe they're voting in their interests.

623
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,450
Right? Um, and I,

624
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,060
I think Democrats have failed,

625
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:10,061
myself included and doing a good job of
communicating why it is that our values

626
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:15,830
are ones that really are,

627
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:20,720
are more in alignment with most
peoples in this country. Um,

628
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,010
and there's a lot of work being done
right now on how do we reframe the

629
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:28,310
narrative and how do we do a
better job of talking about that.

630
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,470
But back to that personal
storytelling again, um,

631
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,520
where we have experiences that we can
share with people who may disagree with us

632
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:45,521
and paint a picture of a real person
and an impact that would feel more

633
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:49,760
compelling to them,
where you have opportunities to do that.

634
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:52,580
I think that's the most powerful
way to cut through that.

635
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,440
And particularly if there's a way to
paint within their own perspective what's

636
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,580
happening to them.

637
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:03,581
Visa vi a person that they may have
thought was actually aligned with their

638
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:04,964
interests.

639
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,340
So first of all, I agree
with the optimism. Um,

640
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,450
and I think that's just because
everyone's having such a big wake up call.

641
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,480
So when I came to this country
four years ago from London,

642
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:19,790
I was maybe a latent feminist.
I mean, I've always believed
in equality, et Cetera,

643
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:21,080
but it wasn't an issue for me.

644
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:23,840
And then I came to the balcony where
everyone was male and everyone was working

645
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:27,440
in tech and everyone was
white. Eh, these issues,

646
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:31,820
kind of what became more important
for me personally, but now it's like,

647
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,740
it's because it's so bad this Trump,

648
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,770
it feels like the entire kind of middle
ground of people who just didn't care

649
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:41,480
anymore and didn't seem to
be caring about politics.

650
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:44,420
I've been awake and so I actually think
this might turn out to be a good thing.

651
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,710
I don't think she hang up. But I
wanted to ask you about this, um,

652
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,330
question about personal storytelling,
which I totally understand. Um,

653
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,850
in terms of building tolerance, right?
Like if you relating to this person, um,

654
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,470
it's different.
And it reminds me when I was 16,

655
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:05,030
I was in upstate New York as an exchange
student and a family that was, you know,

656
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,330
Aniko blatantly racist,
all these things.

657
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,250
And so my dad would like shout it back,

658
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:15,110
people out the odd out of this
pickup truck, my host dad and,

659
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,920
but then like Bob, who is the black guy
who worked with him, like somehow didn't,

660
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:23,000
it wasn't black, right? Cause
he was bald because he knew him.

661
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,060
So I think that's, that's sort of
what you're guessing at is right.

662
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:28,040
It's like once you,
once you know the person,

663
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:32,060
you can no longer put them into this
category of otherness. Right? Um,

664
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,530
but on the flip side of the politicians,

665
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:37,920
it seems like we're moving further and
further away from issues and more and

666
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:39,300
more about the personality.

667
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:44,301
And that jump got elected because of his
personality that appeals to TV viewers.

668
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:49,050
That, and it was nothing about the issues,
right? Everyone ignored all the issues.

669
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,650
So how can we square those things?
Like how can we get,

670
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,310
should we get politics
away from personalities and
more towards issues again?

671
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,660
Or is that just impossible?

672
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,160
I don't,
I don't know if that's possible,

673
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:05,190
but I think a lot of people to would
tell you that they supported Donald Trump

674
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:11,590
because they did believe that he was
supportive of policies that we're going to

675
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:13,720
have a positive impact on their lives.

676
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:18,220
So whether we were talking about people
who had been impacted by automation,

677
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,400
but he gave an easy target to blame,

678
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,090
which was an immigrant workforce
that had taken your job. Uh,

679
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,760
whether we're talking about people who
worked in industries where environmental

680
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,110
evolution and the protections
of environmental laws had,

681
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,413
um,

682
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,880
decreased the employment capacity in
that particular sector and they'd been

683
00:45:43,271 --> 00:45:47,200
impacted by that. They heard
him speaking to them about that.

684
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,670
Um,

685
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:54,210
never underestimate the massage
mini that is out there and the,

686
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:59,350
even if it's not something that people
bring forward consciously their own

687
00:45:59,351 --> 00:46:04,180
subconscious feelings about the threat
that equality in the workforce means to

688
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:06,550
their own livelihoods and success.

689
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:12,120
He spoke powerfully to a lot of those
things and people were responding to them.

690
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,970
Um,
but I love your,

691
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:20,270
your example about Bob Bright because
that's the only way that we can really

692
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,271
counter that.

693
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:27,271
There was a great story in the New
York Times yesterday about a Mexican

694
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,570
gentleman who was,
um,

695
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,710
detained recently and he's
probably going to be deported.

696
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,440
And in the small Iowa town,

697
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,570
he was so well loved and everyone
was saying, well, yeah, we support,

698
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:48,550
you know, rounding up and
deporting, but not him. I,

699
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,360
we, I think his name was Carlos.
We'd love Carlos, you know,

700
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:55,810
and Carlos had done all these
incredible things in the community.

701
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:59,710
Like supporting firefighters and always
being the person there with the food

702
00:46:59,711 --> 00:47:03,100
drives and different things like that
and you know, everyone loves them.

703
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:08,101
So making it the reality come to life
for people is really a way to take a step

704
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:13,870
back and to, to, to look
at things differently.

705
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:18,910
The real challenge that we have is not
that their personalities and politics

706
00:47:18,911 --> 00:47:22,660
that can be persuasive.
Um,

707
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,690
but that we have a media culture where
people self select the prism through

708
00:47:28,421 --> 00:47:33,421
which they viewed news and they're going
to hear things and be told things very

709
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:36,790
differently depending on
that self selection. Right.

710
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
That to me is the greatest challenge that
we have is cutting through the version

711
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:47,191
of things that you find on
different news sources and the um,

712
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,820
the decisions or the opinions
that you formed based on,

713
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,700
on what you hear coming from,
from those filters.

714
00:47:54,701 --> 00:47:59,701
And we all owe a responsibility again to
take the power away from their version

715
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:00,710
and,

716
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:05,710
and put the power into a reality version
that's based on real human impact is

717
00:48:08,921 --> 00:48:09,521
hard.

718
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:14,260
But we each have an we're
each and influencer and we
each have an opportunity to

719
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:18,130
do it to our spheres of influence.

720
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:23,100
Hi. Um, I'm an immigrant,

721
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,780
a woman and a Latina,

722
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:29,250
so I 100% relate to your daughter's
fear about what's going on.

723
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,680
Um,
and on top of that,

724
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,680
I like many others that have sort of
like the opposite concern from hers.

725
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:41,040
I'm raising a white meal
in a Silicon Valley, um,

726
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,130
and I'm deeply concerned about what
he's going to grow up listening to,

727
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,880
um, at school and on,
on the TV and so on. Um,

728
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,570
it was very frustrating not being
able to vote last election. Um,

729
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:00,750
so I guess my, my question to
you would be how do you think,

730
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:01,680
um,

731
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,680
we did not get to vote in this country
can have the biggest impact beyond the

732
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:08,520
ballots and

733
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:14,390
um, and, and you know, and
myriad of ways and again,

734
00:49:14,391 --> 00:49:19,130
find that thing that feels most
authentic and a value to you personally.

735
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,280
Um,
if it's in the political space,

736
00:49:22,281 --> 00:49:25,190
obviously supporting candidates
and working for them,

737
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:28,070
even if you can't vote for
them. For example, in Texas,

738
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:32,600
I had a large number of
dreamers who worked really,

739
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:36,530
really hard on our campaign.
None of whom could actually vote for me,

740
00:49:36,531 --> 00:49:41,060
but all of whom had a vested stake and
what the outcome of that election looked

741
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,870
like and who cared very deeply about
the direction that we were going.

742
00:49:44,871 --> 00:49:49,520
As a state. You have a wonderful
opportunity with your son, you know,

743
00:49:49,521 --> 00:49:53,810
to be an influencer and the way
he's going to view these issues.

744
00:49:53,811 --> 00:49:58,760
And uh, I, I'm sure he's
going to grow up beautifully,

745
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:03,680
uh, based on who you are and what your
values are and making sure that you pass

746
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:07,100
those on to him. Um, if you know,

747
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:11,570
you find yourself really
deeply passionate about, um,

748
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,800
LGBT equality or the
environment or gender equality,

749
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,450
find an organization that matters to you
and support the work that they do and

750
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:24,560
ask them how you can be valuable
to the work that they do.

751
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:30,010
There's so much that's needed in terms
of our time and our passion that as long

752
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,430
as you find a place that
feels meaningful to you,

753
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,550
you will be making a difference.
He really well,

754
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,560
whether you can ultimately vote or not.

755
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:44,690
And when do,

756
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,710
you were going to take one more question
from a man who's been watching over the

757
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,850
live stream, who asked, how do
you see the role of men as allies?

758
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,830
What can we do to help this?
Cause

759
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,230
that's a really good
question. Um, first of all,

760
00:50:57,231 --> 00:51:00,440
I'll tell you a story about
myself and the word feminism.

761
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:02,960
Back to what was said earlier,

762
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,100
when I was in my thirties
when I was running for city
council for the first time,

763
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:12,370
I was asked by a reporter whether I was
a feminist and I answered the question.

764
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:17,450
No.
And I'm ashamed to tell you that honestly,

765
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,190
but I want to tell you because I want
us to do some self exploration about our

766
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:25,730
own attitudes and perspectives.
Why did I do that? Well,

767
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:30,731
I felt like it was categorizing me in
this limited way and defining me in a way

768
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:37,541
that other people would look
at and disqualify me based
on that categorization.

769
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,180
But by doing that,

770
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:46,870
I was playing a role
in marginalizing women.

771
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:51,500
Right? Um, what I would
love to see more of,

772
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,160
and I'm so pleased to see
so much of it right now,

773
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,430
our man stepping forward and saying,
I'm a feminist too,

774
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:01,760
because to be a feminist really just
means that you support the idea that we

775
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:06,680
should all be equal in society
and the economy. Right. Um,

776
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:11,740
what's that bumper sticker feminism is
the radical notion that women are human

777
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:15,010
beings or something like that.
Um,

778
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:20,060
I'm really encouraged about that too
though. And where we are, the marches,

779
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,870
the women's marches that took place
around the country, around the world,

780
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,530
there were so many men,
there were so many beautiful,

781
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:32,150
wonderful man stepping forward and saying,
this matters to all of us.

782
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,160
I'm with her. I'm with her.
Exactly. Um, and you know,

783
00:52:37,161 --> 00:52:41,390
I think more manner or looking at this
from the prism of their mothers and their

784
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:45,890
sisters and especially their daughters
and wanting to create a world where they

785
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:46,870
have,
um,

786
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:52,330
the opportunity to fulfill
their dreams and their,

787
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:57,080
um, best opportunities for
themselves. And so more and more,

788
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,320
uh,
we're joining this conversation as one.

789
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:05,770
And I think one of the powerful ways that
we can talk about it is the fact that

790
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:10,781
when we are all working toward gender
equality were actually all working to a

791
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:15,821
place where our economy has the
strongest opportunity to thrive.

792
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,900
And it really goes back to looking at
what happened when women were able to

793
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:25,590
really enter the workforce and stay in
the full time workforce for the first

794
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:25,801
time.

795
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:30,270
It was in the 1970s and I know a lot
of the really young people in this room

796
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:31,560
cannot even fathom,

797
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,820
but and as of 1971 birth
control was illegal.

798
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:36,990
If you were not married,

799
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,380
you could not have birth control in 1972
with a supreme court decision that's

800
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:44,970
much less known.
The Roe v Wade,

801
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:49,500
Eisenstadt v Baird birth control
became legal for unmarried persons,

802
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:50,670
not just married persons.

803
00:53:50,671 --> 00:53:54,030
There'd been a supreme court decision
a few years prior to that, that equal,

804
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:57,150
that allowed married people
to access birth control.

805
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,540
So birth control and then of course
Roe v Wade with our right to make

806
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,130
determinations about our own bodies.

807
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,790
We could suddenly decide that we were
going to enter the workforce and we were

808
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,320
going to stay there if we wanted to.

809
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:15,740
And the women's participation rate in
the workforce took this huge climb.

810
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:21,201
It went from about the low 20 percentile
to the mid 40 percentile over the

811
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:25,680
course of the next three
decades and and hung there.

812
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,360
And because it hung there,

813
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,650
we contributed significantly
to the economic output,

814
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,960
the economic growth of the country,

815
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:39,290
about an estimated one point $7
trillion in 2012 which pays for,

816
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:45,360
by the way, Medicaid, medicare
and social security combined.

817
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:47,430
Just our participation,

818
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:52,431
our increased participation from the
1970s to that point is responsible for

819
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:56,340
being able to pay for
all of those programs.

820
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,760
So we all have a vested stake and
women's equality and women being able to

821
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:07,320
realize our full economic
participation in this country.

822
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:12,650
And I want to hear more women
and men sharing that with,

823
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,900
with their friends and their coworkers
that this isn't just a social issue.

824
00:55:18,601 --> 00:55:23,040
It's not just about saying we ought
to treat everyone fairly and equally,

825
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,500
we all have an economic stake in it.

826
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:28,290
And it goes back to that saying
that a lot of people think,

827
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,830
is this a try it little campaign saying,
when women do better, we all do better.

828
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:36,870
It's really true. Um, and so we,
we all have not only a stake in it,

829
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:40,200
but we ought to be exercising our voices
and making sure that we're spreading

830
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:44,050
greater understanding about that. Okay.
Well, thank you so much for having me.
