1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,430
Um, and now I think we're
going to do some Q and. A.

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,730
Um,
so from a teaching perspective,

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,790
how come kids who are
gamers don't seem to apply?

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,870
Uh, the sort of, uh, you know,

5
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:26,060
being okay with failure and
exploring this as to mine,

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,070
all of that in the classroom setting.
Yeah. And how can I make them do that?

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,720
Yeah. I mean there are a
couple of reasons. I mean, in,

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,780
in classroom environments there tend
to be more consequences for failure,

9
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,490
right? Um, I mean even at the
younger levels, um, you know, if you,

10
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:44,200
if you don't do well on something,

11
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,930
you will be perceived as
not being good at that.

12
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,300
That could affect what
group you're put in. Um,

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,440
as you get older and you fail a
tastic counts towards your grades, um,

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,610
you don't get to retake it.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,870
I know there are a lot of schools that
are experimenting with trying to create,

16
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,023
um,

17
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,470
structures for failing that
more closely resembled games.

18
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:07,540
So schools where you can take a
test as many times as you want,

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,560
the same way you would play a level
as many times as you want to focus on

20
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:15,730
mastery rather than, you know, performance
anxiety. Um, there's a chapter,

21
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:19,720
chapter four in the book talks
about, um, those specifically,

22
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,870
why do only some people seem to bring
the gameful mindset to everyday life.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,020
Um,

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,020
and at least 41% of gamers do
not bring this to everyday life.

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,710
Um, and it, it has to do with, um, uh,

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,440
whether you view games as being escapist,
um,

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,990
or whether you view them as being
a part of, of your real life.

28
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,280
So we have this bias.

29
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:50,260
We talk about games as being escapist
and you think you leave reality. Um,

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,800
and it helps you forget, you
know, everyday life. Um, and when,

31
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:57,140
when people are playing games, we tell
them they're wasting time, right? Um,

32
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,370
people who feel that way,
uh,

33
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,460
tend to play games more when their life
gets more stressful because they see it

34
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,660
as this kind of coping
mechanism the same way.

35
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,690
Some people drink more when life gets
stressful or they eat junk food or they

36
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:11,560
just,
um,

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,460
and so then the problems get bigger and
so then they have to play games more

38
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:18,370
cause they're more stressed out now.
Um, and it creates this downward spiral.

39
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,370
And that's actually the number one
predictor of like who becomes addicted to

40
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:25,090
games are people who see game
does escape this. Um, eh,

41
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,980
people who benefit and sort of the way
out of that seems to be people who focus

42
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:33,700
when they play games on, um,
how they're getting better.

43
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,760
So I played this game. I'm, I'm
getting better at, you know,

44
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,890
spacial intelligence or teamwork or
coordination or designing or creativity or

45
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:42,724
whatever it is.

46
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,050
So the really practical
answer that question is to
talk to kids about the games

47
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:49,570
they play and say,
what do you like?

48
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:52,010
What do you have to be good at
to be good at this game? Um,

49
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,210
order model back to them.
Wow.

50
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,990
You like it took you four days to finish
that level. Um, that sounds really,

51
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,570
but you must be somebody
who when you have a goal,

52
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
you don't give up until you really succeed
and start to help kids see that there

53
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:12,310
are real character strengths
that are part of who they are,

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,690
not just when they're playing games,

55
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:17,800
they don't have to escape reality to have
those feelings or have those strengths.

56
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,910
Um, so is it a whole chapter about
how you do that in, in chapter four?

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,060
Yeah. Oh No, I have the mic.

58
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,960
I've been talking about super better a
lot with a friend because there was just

59
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,620
an article in the less psychology today
about it and we thought it was cool and

60
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:39,220
we had this whole discussion about what
our power ups and what are bad guys.

61
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,110
And that was cool. So my
question is actually a question
from my friend who says,

62
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,303
please ask.

63
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,390
I'm curious as to how effectively people
use super better to deal with issues.

64
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:53,530
I might be concerned about
like procrastination and
mild anxiety rather than

65
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:57,860
deeply debilitating depression,
et cetera. Right? Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay. Well Sue, uh,

66
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:00,920
I'm gonna give it to you straight here.
This,

67
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,340
this method seems to
work better and better.

68
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,710
The more, uh, difficult
your challenges. Um,

69
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:14,390
so when we crunched the numbers
and people who signed up to like,

70
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,740
I want to lose 10 pounds, I want to
run my first five k, um, I dunno,

71
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,690
I'm just bored of my life.
I want to change. Um,

72
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,590
those people do not register a lot
of benefits and we, we, there's, um,

73
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,010
there's this other measurement tools
inside the system where we look at changes

74
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:34,010
and things like courage and
optimism and things like that. Um,

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,890
those people don't register
as many changes. Um,

76
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,720
where as people who come with
big problems, you know, I,

77
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:45,170
you know, I, I just lost a family member.

78
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:49,490
I've been diagnosed with something.
I have always suffered with anxiety.

79
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,140
Um, they registered the biggest changes.
So that is, I think that's important. Um,

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,440
and, and there are lots of reasons that
would make sense. Why, um, you know,

81
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:01,520
I mentioned the idea of post
traumatic growth earlier. This, the,

82
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,080
as I explained in the book,
the super better method at its heart.

83
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:08,720
What it seems to do is
promote posttraumatic growth.

84
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,190
In order to have post traumatic growth,
you have to have some kind of, you know,

85
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,990
serious challenge or trauma.

86
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,740
Now there is a version of posttraumatic
growth that does not require trauma.

87
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,800
It's called post static growth.
But I also talk about that in the book,

88
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,070
but it still requires you to do something,
but it's extremely difficult.

89
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:28,520
So running a marathon, not if
I can't, I'll marathon, um,

90
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,910
trying to maybe write your first
book, starting a company, um,

91
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,410
becoming a parent for the first time.
So positive things,

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,010
but that will really force you to,

93
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,540
to kind of dig deep and cultivate
that new form of shrine.

94
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,700
So the short version is, um, uh,
it may, it might, it might help,

95
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,810
but it will,

96
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,440
it will make a bigger difference in
the lives of people who are really

97
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:58,020
struggling with something.
So one is, you know,

98
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:01,490
and you just put it on your phone
now and hopefully you don't need it,

99
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:05,000
but maybe some,
it will help you more.

100
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,780
I've tried to use games as a way
of developing particular, uh,

101
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,730
cognitive styles.
And I've often found,

102
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,840
and I'll start playing a game
with the intent of who you know,

103
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,980
I'm going to be practicing
some cognitive skill or other,

104
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,520
and then I find kind of an hour has passed
and I noticed I slipped totally into

105
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:35,001
complacency and I wasn't
practicing that cognitive style.

106
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:36,264
I wasn't,

107
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,590
I wasn't trying the new strategy
that I had intended to try.

108
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,550
How do I maintain the focus required
when playing games to make sure that they

109
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:51,030
do that.

110
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:56,031
I actually do use them as that sort of
practice rather than kind of idly passing

111
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:58,314
the time.

112
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,780
Well that's really interesting.
I mean that's because on one hand,

113
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,550
I mean I would think from what I've
seen that I believe passing the time is

114
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:11,240
actually totally fine.
I mean that,

115
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,970
that it will do the same
thing. Um, you know,

116
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,770
you don't have to adopt a particular
style of game play or strategy.

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,340
What you want to do to make sure,
I mean,

118
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,460
so we talked about playing a
game you've never played before.

119
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,380
We'll make that mindset happened faster
than playing a game you played a hundred

120
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:33,330
times. So maybe it'd be
more a matter of, um,

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,730
making sure that you're exposing
yourself to different games,

122
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:42,710
different genres of games, you know, if
you've never played a certain genre to,

123
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:46,310
to, to try that sort of expand your, um,

124
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,520
your competency with
different kinds of games.

125
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:54,521
I would think that aspect of making sure
that you're always requiring yourself

126
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,780
to be learning and improving,
um, is probably, you know,

127
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,860
probably the most important aspect
of it. Um, but other than that,

128
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,730
there's not a particular, you know, just,
just make sure that it's challenging,

129
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,080
really challenging for you and challenge
yourself to, to learn different games.

130
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,290
Is this a really good way
to do that? Cool. What else

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,833
you guys pick?

132
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,960
So you said we should ask this
question earlier, so what,

133
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,760
what about what can go
wrong with violence?

134
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:30,270
Yeah, definitely. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Um, so, uh,

135
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,500
all of all of the stuff they're putting
in the media is hype and not to except

136
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:39,120
for, um, if you spend most
of your time playing violent,

137
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:43,140
aggressive themed games, we'll use
call of duty as an example, um,

138
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,240
against people you don't know online,
not in the same space.

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,433
Um,

140
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,570
the one negative side effect of that is
that if boost your testosterone in a way

141
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:56,910
that does not in other gameplay context,

142
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,540
it doesn't happen if you are playing
against people, you know, in real life.

143
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,100
It's like we don't have to
be in the same room with Bob,

144
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,910
but if I know I'm playing,
you and I were cool, um,

145
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,260
I'm not going to get this
sort of testosterone jack.

146
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:11,040
There's a lot of research behind
it, um, that I explain in the book.

147
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,050
But for now we'll just
say you're going to like,

148
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,400
you can get basically
testosterone poisoning is how
one researcher describes it.

149
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,620
Um, where, uh,

150
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,330
after you're done playing for
hours afterwards can make you,

151
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,580
um, just more hostile and your interaction
with other people, more aggressive, um,

152
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,530
uh, less compassion and empathy because
you're really jacked up on testosterone,

153
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:39,000
which just has that effect on
people. Um, so you know, uh,

154
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:43,080
that's why some game communities
may have a reputation for, uh,

155
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,070
it's kind of people get
become kind of jerks. Um,

156
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,670
so I recommend you know, that you spend
less than half your time doing that.

157
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:52,020
If you're going to play
a lot of these games,

158
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:55,200
make sure you spending a
significant amount of time
playing them with people you

159
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:55,950
know,

160
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,980
that you have to continue
to have relationships with
because that's what stops,

161
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:03,090
that's what damp dampens the testosterone.
However, I'm very open minded person.

162
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,330
I think people should use games to
benefit themselves however they want.

163
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,840
There may be people who want to
Jack up some testosterone, you know,

164
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:14,841
I'm going into have a contract negotiation
and I do want to be aggressive or uh,

165
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:18,970
I mean, you may, you may want that.
So, um, I am not to judge there.

166
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,230
There may be benefits to it as well.
But that is, that is the genre.

167
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,880
So thanks for coming back to that.

168
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,790
I'm curious if you've a investigating
the relationship between York on PTSD and

169
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,100
other work like Vanderkolk's the
body keeps the score, you know,

170
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:36,810
ideas of trauma being stored somatically.
Physically,

171
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,310
no, I'm not familiar with that.
But the name is very evocative.

172
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:41,840
Your body keeps the score.

173
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,220
Yeah, that was a new book.
The body keeps the score.

174
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,970
I am, I'm going to buy that.
That's great. Thank you for that.

175
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,060
So I was kinda curious about
the reference to motor neurons,

176
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,933
not knowing some of that.

177
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,410
It's pretty controversial a and it
only applies to sort of where motor

178
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:59,750
activities involved.
I'm kind of curious,

179
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:04,070
not knowing anything about the gaming
world and people watching these video

180
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:07,730
screens of other people playing.
How much of that is like,

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,180
you know,
actual physical activity that they can,

182
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,120
their motor neurons can actually
relate to versus intellectual?

183
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:16,200
Like if it's scrabble
or some boring thing.

184
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,280
I can look at golf and I'm always started.

185
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,320
Yeah, I mean I would, I would
contest the idea that it's just, I,

186
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,330
I know there's a, there, there are
discussions now going on about, you know,

187
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:32,140
there's sort of, there was a, it's
on the, what is it, the hype cycle.

188
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:36,820
The hype chart went into the, the
trough of disillusionment. But um,

189
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,630
would you do absolutely still
seemed mirror neurons even
in things, um, you know,

190
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:43,210
conversation. So if, if
I'm having, if we're,

191
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:45,850
we're close friends and you're
telling me about your day,

192
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,210
we do see that my brain will,
as you tell me,

193
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:54,211
your story will start to mirror
the as if it happened to me.

194
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,970
Um, and I don't know
that, that necessarily,

195
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:02,130
I mean you see the same kind of
emotional activation. It's not that, uh,

196
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,080
I feel like there's a sufficient body
of literature that this, um, that this,

197
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,880
that there is a sort of general um,

198
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,790
processing of experience
that can be in York.

199
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,821
That's where I,

200
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:19,990
that's where I come down on all they
know is this sort of the people are,

201
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,800
people are arguing about it. Um,
you know, there is, there is,

202
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,000
there is a strong physical
component. I mean, in terms of,

203
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,400
uh, I mean in, in the same way that
speed typing has, you know, a component.

204
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:35,800
I mean you have to be able to uh,

205
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,690
input decisions and execute decisions
very quickly through the interface.

206
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,070
It can be possible. It'd be part of when
you think about the, the piano example,

207
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:49,700
I mean that is probably similar playing
the piano and sort of the controls of

208
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:54,630
the video game. Um, you, you still have
to be mirroring the musicality. I mean,

209
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:57,020
you have to have the understanding
of the musicality, um,

210
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,390
and not just the execution
of, um, of the interface.

211
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,300
But, uh, so we have
time for one more maybe.

212
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,050
Sure. Yeah. Um, so sometimes when you're
achieving a goal and a video game,

213
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:13,010
it feels really frustrating.
Yeah. So is there a value,

214
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,310
positive or negative in the frustration
or is there only a value and achieving

215
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:16,600
them?

216
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,500
Oh, no, no, no, no. Most of the value is
in the frustration. I mean, it is, um,

217
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,190
the,

218
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,190
the value is in staying motivated and
optimistic while being frustrated.

219
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,410
So, you know, when we were
looking at that, that,

220
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,530
that what is the mindset of super
empowered, hopeful individual.

221
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:38,120
But if somebody who was highly motivated
and able and optimistic and able to

222
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,530
learn,
uh,

223
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,400
and try and be flexible and try different
strategies so that in the face of

224
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:47,780
frustration, they will continue
to engage with the obstacle. Um,

225
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,020
Eh, it's why I like to
play games, you know,

226
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:55,820
myself that are very challenging.
Uh, I love it when I have to,

227
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,470
you know, try a level a hundred
times before I get past it. Um, that,

228
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,300
that's where a lot of the resilience,

229
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,350
that seems to be one of
the most essential, nope.

230
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,020
What do games make us good at?

231
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,870
Being resilient in the face of
that kind of frustration. So,

232
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,920
um, yeah, don't play games that you're
good at and always winning. That's,

233
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,860
that's just positive emotion. Um, but
the actual positive psychology, the,

234
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:26,870
the strengths will come out of
playing games that you are bad at,

235
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,290
which is why we played a game that you
guys would know you went through were

236
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,530
surprisingly good at massive and multiple
years gravel though it was good. Um,

237
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,410
good. Well, good to me.

238
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:36,870
Thank you.
