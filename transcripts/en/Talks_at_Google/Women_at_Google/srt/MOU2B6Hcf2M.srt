1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:02,980
Uh,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,500
thanks to everyone who's joining us on
the livestream and who was able to come

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:07,210
in person.
I'm Joelle Common Office.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,950
I am the host and I'm looking up at
the camera there. Uh, I'm a Googler,

5
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm a product manager and
I'm an aspiring parent. Uh,

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,680
that means that maybe sometime
next year if everything goes well,

7
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:20,920
I'd like to have kids and I start
early when I prepare for anything.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,740
So my wife and I went to
this talk that she found, uh,

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,300
by these characters and fat to introduce.
And uh,

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,390
they did this talk at whisper and high
school and it was all about parenting.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,310
What she knows is not surprising,
it's the whole point.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,490
But it was also about psychology
and it was also about technology.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,400
Three of my favorite things,
um,

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,880
and I find one thing that they usually
have in common is that to the either

15
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:47,620
uninitiated, uninformed or just to the
aspiring, they can all be kind of scary.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,950
But what I really liked was that
this is not a fear based message.

17
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:55,330
This is all about hope and prevention
and looking forward as to how can we not

18
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:59,440
only avoid the pitfalls but in fact
raise our kids higher in the future.

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,060
So a quick introduction then. These are
the cofounders of my digital tattoo.

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,610
They have some pretty
awesome chops already.

21
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:08,680
They've talked to a lot
of different people here.

22
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:10,390
I even have to take
notes on these numbers.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,980
It's been over 14,000 students,
5,000 parents,

24
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:19,460
400 educators and a hundred schools in
the bay area as well as 800 healthcare

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,820
providers all in the
last four years alone.

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,390
So they provide education and training
in four key sectors from all of those

27
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:27,670
schools, families,
corporations and healthcare.

28
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,990
They also just presented at the annual
Rsa Conference where captains of industry,

29
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,230
we're asking questions about how to deal
with their kids privacy and security

30
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:39,670
worries online. Kind of interesting.
So without too much further ado,

31
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,660
Gloria Moskovitz squeak sweet,
who's been a social worker educator,

32
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:48,640
program developer and university lecturer
since 81 and Erica Plevin who's been a

33
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,770
family psychologist for over 20 years,

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,460
please welcome them and I'm going to
pass it over to them. Thank you baby.

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,990
Uh,
Joel,

36
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,460
thank you for inviting us here and thank
you for coming and we recognize you and

37
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:03,520
felt you in the audience because your
hand was up an awful lot and there was a

38
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:06,590
tremendous amount of interest. So
we're delighted to be here. Um,

39
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,530
we have had the privilege now of working
with 14,000 plus students all over

40
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,340
California and it's their story we want
to share with you. It's their voices.

41
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,720
There are no textbooks. Anything that
anybody writes is dated immediately.

42
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,360
It's their voices that have
continued to school, us.

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,320
And as we have kind of taken this journey
with them over the past five years,

44
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,790
we have learned so much.

45
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:32,560
And our goal today is to teach you and
take you into what we've learned. So we,

46
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,810
as Joelle said,
we are not fear based.

47
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,420
We really believe in
the power of technology.

48
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:42,421
We see it being used
incredibly beautifully and
strongly in empowering ways.

49
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,940
So we understand the power,
we watch kids learn,

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,090
we watched kids collaborate
with each other,

51
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,910
we watched them feel empowered
in this incredible world.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,100
And we have watched them do amazing
things around creating a kinder world.

53
00:02:57,101 --> 00:03:00,310
They actually call it the kinder net,
but we also recognize

54
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,230
the challenges and the challenges are big.

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,470
And we're going to talk about both and
we're going to talk about them without

56
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:06,920
judgment because it really is,

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,980
is the tool is here to stay is what we
do with it and how we choose to support

58
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,380
our kids and using it
ethically and kindly.

59
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,730
So Erica is going to do the first half
and I'm going to do the second half and

60
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,990
we'll have talked for questions

61
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,680
standing

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,700
in the right place. Hi everybody. I'm
Erica and I'm the mom of two boys,

63
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:32,540
one in high school and one in college.
They are huge gamers.

64
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:36,800
So I've started learning about this way
long ago when they started entering the

65
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,000
world of gaming.

66
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,810
But what I've learned from being a mom
the last 20 years of their life is that

67
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,460
all the skills that I have offline,

68
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,660
being a good parent and thinking about
things really translate into their online

69
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:51,380
world,

70
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,970
and that oftentimes we get fearful and
frozen about what they're doing online.

71
00:03:55,971 --> 00:04:00,530
And if we step back and actually just
think about how we parent or how we liked

72
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,880
what our parents did to us,
there's some beautiful translation.

73
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,870
So we're going to talk
a lot about that today.

74
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,470
I thought I'd start with a story that
can help ground us in the importance of

75
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,640
what it is to parent in the age of
social media or parents in the age of

76
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:20,540
technology.
When my son was in the fifth grade,

77
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,600
I decided to have a pool party.
I was really excited.

78
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:26,660
It was back in the time when
I felt like I was the manager.

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840
I got to pick all the friends
that could came. Oh, sorry.

80
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,660
I got to pick all the friends
that came to the party.

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,230
I got to decide what the
theme was. Um, but parents,

82
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:40,910
I wanted to be around and I hired
a lifeguard and I hired a lifeguard

83
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:45,260
particularly to stay in the deep end of
the pool because my fifth grader is a

84
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:47,240
risk taker and I thought,
okay,

85
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:50,530
something's going to happen in that
deep end of the pool. So I hired a risk,

86
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,540
a lifeguard right in that
spot in the deep end,

87
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,640
in the middle of the party.

88
00:04:55,641 --> 00:05:00,641
I walked in and there was a child
drowning in the shallow end of the pool,

89
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:01,640
right in that space.

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,850
I think we've all been where we can't
feel our feet anymore and all of a sudden

91
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,030
we get that panicked feeling
and he slipped under and
I had to jump in and save

92
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:14,840
him and take him out. He was okay. The
kids were really upset about watching,

93
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:19,360
but when the mom came, I
think I had a real attitude.
I'm sure I did. I'm like, uh,

94
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,830
excuse me.
Does your kid know how to swim?

95
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:26,210
You left them here with no
supervision? And she said, no,

96
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:29,900
but my kid is so good.
He never leaves the step.

97
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:34,670
He never goes anywhere. He just
stays in that shallow area. So, um,

98
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,260
when when she left,

99
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:40,580
Gloria and I started to talk about it
processes and we realize that it's similar

100
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,320
to life in the digital age,

101
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,760
that most of the time our kids are in
that shallow and doing beautiful things

102
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,780
and making safe and good
choices once in a while.

103
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,550
And I think it's sort of their job, um,
to get curious and to go a little deep or,

104
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,090
or to get pulled into what's happening
in that deep end of the pool.

105
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,600
And that's sometimes the slip
under without even knowing it.

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,660
And really what we need
is to be their guides,

107
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:08,150
to be their teachers and to
get in the pool with them.

108
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,290
Now I know that I never liked getting in
a bathing suit or getting into the pool,

109
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,770
but I knew that it was really important
that I got in there because you can't

110
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,260
just throw your kid out there
without learning how to swim.

111
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,060
We're going to have to hold on to them,

112
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,780
teach them the rules of the road when
they actually don't mind having US help

113
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:26,360
them when they're
interested in being with us.

114
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:31,361
And then in my opinion now with high
schoolers and kids in college is to move

115
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:33,470
away and become that consultant.

116
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,800
Help them self regulate an
advocate for themselves.

117
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:40,130
So when they go out in the world,
they can do that without our assistance.

118
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,900
But if we freak them out so much in the
beginning we've seen that kids are less

119
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:49,400
likely to come to their parents when
they feel like they've made a mistake.

120
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,850
And I think Gloria and I are real
believers that we want our kids to make

121
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:55,820
mistakes on our watch because
then we can help them.

122
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,310
We don't want to have
everything so perfect for them.

123
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,960
Snow plow the way for them that they
don't make any mistakes, it's their job.

124
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,120
So I just want to put that out there,

125
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,020
that it's a good metaphor to think about
that we want you there in the pool with

126
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,510
them no matter what age they are.

127
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,590
The kids we've talked to tell us that
they want their parents to hear what

128
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,570
they're saying and to supervise them,

129
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,700
but we're going to talk a
lot about strategies we've
heard over the last couple

130
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,520
of years. Some of them may stick
with you, others might not be.

131
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,050
Things that work with your kids.

132
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,340
Kind of want you to think of it like
a big colander and I'm going to,

133
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,380
we're going to throw a lot at you and
some things will stick and you'll say,

134
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:33,531
yeah,

135
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:37,250
I'm going to try that or that might work
with my kid and other things may not

136
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:39,050
have anything to do with your kid.

137
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,490
But I think what's important for Gloria
and I to convey to you is that you are

138
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:44,810
the expert of your kid.

139
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,040
I always kind of say find the book that
says what you wanted to say and follow

140
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,550
it because you know your kid,
you are the expert.

141
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,100
If you see that things are going poorly,

142
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:59,870
you step in offline and what we want
to remind you is that the same is true

143
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,280
online so kids don't really
see an on and an offline life.

144
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,540
They just see it as an is there
rarely leaving their phones behind.

145
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,070
They're usually attached to them.

146
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,440
And so what we find is that if your
kid is experiencing trouble offline,

147
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,120
gender identity, depression,
friendships, sitting alone at school,

148
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,910
any of those things that
are happening offline,

149
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,840
you can be pretty sure that it's going
to follow them into their online life.

150
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,381
Now,

151
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,160
that's not necessarily terrible cause
sometimes they're going into their online

152
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:36,161
life to look for support or to help
diagnose themselves or to find something

153
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:37,760
that's gonna make them feel better.

154
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,830
But for us to keep in mind that if we're
worried about our kids offline to check

155
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:45,020
out what that looks like in their,
in their digital space,

156
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,170
the same is true for their
passions and interests.

157
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,010
I've watched my kids just expand in
things that they're interested in.

158
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,200
They become world experts.

159
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,130
Alex had figured out a way to apply to
all the schools that had a scholarship

160
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:02,070
for east sport gaming.
That's certainly didn't come to me.

161
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:04,860
He went out there and he found it himself.

162
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:08,430
So our kids are really taking what
they're good at and getting better on it

163
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,010
online.
So I think that's important to remember.

164
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,140
Gloria and I often get asked
our kids addicted to technology.

165
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,530
And I think kind of, I'm trying to
answer that question for myself.

166
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:21,510
Am I addicted to technology?

167
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,750
I'm finding it harder and harder to
leave my device behind because we're here

168
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,481
for an hour.

169
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:32,481
I'm going to give you our general guiding
principle about whether we're your kid

170
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:38,181
is addicted to technology and for us it's
a simple question of is it opening up

171
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,800
their world or is it shutting it down?

172
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,780
So I have one very shy kid
and it opened up his world.

173
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:49,440
He tried on behaviors that he would never
have tried offline and then was able

174
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:53,260
to practice leadership roles
and take it offline. Uh,

175
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,720
he met friends with similar interests
and he has virtual play dates where he

176
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:00,020
feels loved and respected.
Um,

177
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,630
but we've also seen it where it
can close down people's worlds,

178
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,900
where they get so invested in finding the
next slide or feeling relevant that it

179
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:14,100
can close down their world
and make things uncomfortable.

180
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,210
So pay attention to that. Pay attention
to how you're seeing them use it.

181
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:21,480
Because not all screen
time is the same for us.

182
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,620
It really depends on what they're doing
and how they're using it, balancing it.

183
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,560
But I do want to remind us, I think this
is so important and it seems so simple,

184
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:33,150
but every time I come back to this,

185
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:36,300
it's a good reminder when we
talk with the kids we work with,

186
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,040
but also with my own kids,

187
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,250
that kids are kids that really nothing's
changed in terms of team development,

188
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,340
that they're actually doing exactly
what they're supposed to be doing to be

189
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,470
these incredible curious beings when,
when they start to grow up.

190
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,270
So I want to remind you that the teens
are using social media to do all the

191
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,190
things that they're supposed to do.

192
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,690
They're socializing with their peers
like we did. My mom used to ask me like,

193
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,740
how come you come back from school and
you're immediately on the phone? You know,

194
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:09,750
I was,
I had a cord back then,

195
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:14,400
but I immediately went to the phone and
they're doing exactly what they should

196
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:14,910
be doing.

197
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,560
Most of the kids we work with actually
tell us that the reason their socializing

198
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:24,561
online so much is because there's so
overscheduled that they need these little

199
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,880
bits of time to connect
with their friends.

200
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,800
And I find that so fascinating because
they're telling us we need our community,

201
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,430
we need to stay connected and
we're finding ways to do that.

202
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,900
So they're also trying
on incredible identities.

203
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,530
And Gloria,
Mia and I just got this Bitmoji APP.

204
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,130
Anybody familiar with it where you
can make an Avatar of yourself?

205
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,870
One of the kids suggested it to us
and you put all these outfits on,

206
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:55,420
have you seen it? And, and it,
it can be really silly and fun.

207
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:59,770
I think our kids are doing that kind of
like how I used to play dress up or try

208
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,900
out a new ideas when
I went out to parties.

209
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,530
So our kids are really trying
on new identities as well.

210
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,120
But most of all what our kids are doing
is trying to establish independence.

211
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,750
And part of what I think happens in
this new paradigm where we don't know

212
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:16,540
exactly what the roadmap is,
is to parent,

213
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,810
is we start pulling back and trying to
hover over them and their job is to keep

214
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:23,650
moving away from us.

215
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:28,450
So if we can do that in a way where we
can stay curious and they can start to

216
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:32,320
take those risks and gain independence
and we're not hovering over them,

217
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,170
I think we're really giving
them the greatest gift,

218
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,900
which is to start being critical thinkers.

219
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,810
And I will tell you that
when we're in the classroom,

220
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,520
our kids from ages fifth grade up are
going to be the ones to come up with the

221
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,330
solutions.

222
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,330
When we ask them for solutions about how
to manage group texts or how to manage,

223
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,420
uh, their sleep, they come
up with incredible ideas.

224
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,930
So we really need to use
them and harness their power.

225
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,600
But for the most part,

226
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,960
I want to say they're really
using them in incredible ways.

227
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,870
They're using them to connect to support.

228
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,370
We've even seen kids doing causes
for other kids in their school.

229
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,100
They're using it for schoolwork.
They're collaborating,

230
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,990
they're creating youtube videos.
I mean,

231
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:21,160
I can't tell you how excited a group of
fifth graders gets when we come in to

232
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:24,820
talk to them and are curious about what
they're doing because they're doing such

233
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,020
amazing things.

234
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,500
But at some times our kids are
slipping under like in my pool,

235
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,850
um, scenario and making those
mistakes. And sometimes as a parent,

236
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:41,260
and I'm sure this was true for our
parents to, they, we keep saying, well,

237
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,650
we told you that already, or Oh,
come on, I have to say that again.

238
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:47,590
We already talked about this
and they're slipping under.

239
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:50,870
And I'm wondering if anybody knows
why they're slipping on onion,

240
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,760
why are kids slipping under?
Why do we have to tell them so many times

241
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,600
they're actually missing something in
this area that makes it really hard.

242
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,410
We've given them this incredible
tool with incredible power,

243
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,830
both to take care of themselves
and their reputation,

244
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:13,420
but also to hurt and harm other
people's reputations and feelings.

245
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,830
And they're kind of missing something,
which is that their frontal lobe,

246
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:22,000
which helps them with that long term
planning and consequences isn't fully

247
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:22,834
developed.

248
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,430
And for me that's a huge takeaway that
we're asking them to do something without

249
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:31,360
literally having what they need to do it.
So for us,

250
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:33,520
sometimes we need to talk with the kids.

251
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:37,240
We're talking about what's this
going to affect you like tomorrow?

252
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,650
Or how is this going to affect you this
afternoon? Because telling a kid, oh,

253
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:44,680
you know, if you put that out
there in 10 years from now,

254
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:47,470
when you have an employer looking at it,
they're not going to like it.

255
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,930
It's really kind of hard for someone
who's lobe isn't developed. Um,

256
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,150
and of course with our teenagers are
middle schoolers and our high schoolers,

257
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,490
their emotions are so high.

258
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,660
And those of you that have kids will
know or go back to when you were that age

259
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,450
that you can be happy and sad and silly
and Matt and anxious and left out in,

260
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,510
in a whole day.

261
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,040
And so when you have a powerful
tool and a bunch of feelings,

262
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,480
we have to really be lending them our
frontal lobe about how to deal with it.

263
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,890
And that all those feelings are normal
and they make sense and they're easy for

264
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:25,640
us to look at and say like, Oh, come
on, get over it. There's no problem.

265
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,470
But to them, they feel really real.
They change rapidly, and I always say,

266
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,760
if we can name it, we containment, so
instead of just shutting off the device,

267
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:39,200
if we can start helping our kids
to say, I felt left out, or I'm,

268
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,470
I don't feel like I measure up
or my body doesn't look right,

269
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,970
then we're giving them this huge service
to talk about what they're experiencing.

270
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,910
I want to talk a little bit about this
evolving landscape and Gloria and I used

271
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,810
to just call it the digital landscape
and we realize that working with kids

272
00:15:56,811 --> 00:16:00,380
every day that really it evolves
as soon as we know about it,

273
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:03,200
something new is coming up and
I think that's probably like,

274
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,250
we like this work so much because
it's constantly changing and areas of

275
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,810
interests keep moving,

276
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,850
but I wanted to tell you a little bit
about what we're seeing in the last six

277
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:16,880
months or so about what's happening
on this digital landscape.

278
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:19,400
For tweens and teens.

279
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,810
I think this actually even relates to
us as I think about how I'm starting to

280
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:25,130
use media more and more.

281
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,900
The first thing we're seeing is that
kids are stuck trying to stay relevant.

282
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,830
And many of our kids will tell us that
they're trying to curate their life to

283
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:37,160
make it look a certain way to their
friends and the people around them.

284
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,500
And I just want to take a minute to think
about how exhausting that is to have

285
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,940
to lead a curated life.

286
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,530
To have to think that there's strategic
times that you need to post in order to

287
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:53,270
stay relevant, are not forgotten. And
that that news feed happens so quickly.

288
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:57,230
Are those texts come so frequently
that if you miss that opportunity,

289
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,440
you're not going to be noticed in,
you're going to be left behind. Now,

290
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:02,150
this is not true for all of our kids,

291
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:07,151
but many of our kids will tell us that
they will put a post up and if it doesn't

292
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,820
get enough likes,
they'll take it down. Uh,

293
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,630
they will tell us that they know
their prime posting time that uh,

294
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,530
I get my most likes at eight o'clock or
that they feel upset that they spent the

295
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:22,610
whole weekend trying to make it look
like a life they had a life and no one

296
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:26,210
noticed. So just really sinking
into that idea that our,

297
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,480
that our kids aren't having to search
to stay relevant and how that must be so

298
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,180
perfect conversation with our
nieces or nephews, our kids,

299
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:39,440
our friends is to talk about how we don't
want to define ourselves based on the

300
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:44,000
number of likes that we get and really
kind of going to do what our parents did,

301
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:47,660
which is searching underneath
to see what's important
and what we like about our

302
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:52,560
self without people needing to
give us the praise for that. Uh,

303
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,620
the one on the top is my son and I put
it up there because he is a virtual gamer

304
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,900
and he spends lots of
his time in his room,

305
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,160
in multiplayer environments
with people all over the world.

306
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,710
He's joined teams all over the world.

307
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,220
He has friends all over the world and I
don't know if any of you have had this

308
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,550
experience, but if you're on
what's called a virtual hangout,

309
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,820
you can't say play date once
they leave elementary school,

310
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:21,090
but when you're on this virtual hangout,
it's pretty incredible.

311
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,510
It feels like everybody's in the room.
I think when I started,

312
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,850
I used to think they're
just in parallel play.

313
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,070
How can this be any kind of interaction?

314
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:33,810
They're just on their devices now I'm
seeing that they're interacting as a team

315
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:38,220
and they're doing what I see is engaging
in some pro social games where they're

316
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:42,240
learning some pretty incredible
skills about community guidelines,

317
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,440
about friendships,

318
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:47,550
about how to stick up for somebody about
how it feels when someone trolls are

319
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,390
being mean to you.

320
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,620
And that they're actually doing a lot
of this pre-learning as early as fourth

321
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:57,600
grade in games like Minecraft.
But most of all, and that corner,

322
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:02,060
right is our advisory board, which
we go to a lot to look for, uh,

323
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:07,080
advice and to run things by them.
They are socializing with their friends.

324
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,040
And I think most people would look at
that and they would say they're not

325
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:11,851
socializing,

326
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:15,510
they're all on their devices and
they will tell us they looked at it,

327
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,900
but they're all talking to each
other or sharing or having fun.

328
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,970
So a reminder that our experience might
not be how they're experiencing and to

329
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:28,110
talk about,
does anybody remember this?

330
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,120
A whack a mole game.

331
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,610
So the thing that I can't believe I kept
going back to whack a mole is if I was

332
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:39,480
going to figure it out and I always
wanted to get a higher score and the thing

333
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:41,970
would come up and go down
and we would get frustrated.

334
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,100
And Gloria and I just thought this was
a perfect image to talk about how it

335
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:51,090
feels to stay up to date in our kids'
lives with what they're doing online.

336
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,440
And I think as soon as we figure it out,
they've gone somewhere else. I mean,

337
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:58,800
that's sort of what they're supposed to be
doing, right? If, if we're at the party,

338
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:00,630
they're going to leave. I
mean, that's embarrassing.

339
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:05,220
So I don't think our job is really to
have to know exactly what they're doing at

340
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:08,340
all times,
but our job is to be curious about it,

341
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:13,341
to see trends that are going on and and
to ask them about what goes on in each

342
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:14,640
of these sites.

343
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,240
And I put the word down code switching
there because for those of you,

344
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,880
you might even be doing it
yourself cause I certainly do,

345
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:25,881
but most of our kids will tell us that
they actually have a whole circle of ways

346
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:30,120
that they go and check their media.
Like they have their Instagram open,

347
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:32,580
then they'll check their snapchat
and they'll look at reddit.

348
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,200
Then they might do a little Pinterest
for it or which phone game and that they

349
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:41,790
do this kind of an order and that each
one of those platforms has their own way

350
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:46,791
of being and so that they have an
amazing ability to code switch between of

351
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,070
those.

352
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,360
I just want to talk about the importance
of opening up the dialogue and for me I

353
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:53,800
always say be curious.

354
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:58,600
Not Furious because I think it's so easy
for me to say to my husband, to my kids,

355
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:00,280
like, what are you doing?
You're wasting your time.

356
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:02,110
We should be out and
going and doing something.

357
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,770
Well that doesn't really set the tone
for somebody wanting to tell you about

358
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,810
what they're doing.
It's sets the tone for you,

359
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:11,140
telling them to go outside and then
they take the device and go with their

360
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:13,950
device outside.
So I'm curious to,

361
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,610
to encourage you to ask your kids,
what are the apps that people are using?

362
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,330
What do you like about them to try it
on yourself today I tried on a new APP.

363
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:29,800
It was called, uh, musically,
no, it wasn't musically,

364
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:34,300
but musically is another good example
where we can get on and we can do Karaoke

365
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:38,860
and we can be playful and fun and really
feel what it feels like to want to do

366
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:43,150
10 videos instead of just one and to have
a hard time not wanting to fix it and

367
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:45,550
make it better.
So the more we enter their world,

368
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,790
the more I think we get a sense of what
they're doing rather than being mad.

369
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,980
So let's take a look at the apps
that we're paying attention to. Now.

370
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,170
Our kids have moved away from Facebook.

371
00:21:56,171 --> 00:22:00,190
Any idea why they moved away from
Facebook? We're on it, right?

372
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:02,650
Or grandmas or taking selfies are,

373
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:05,200
kids will tell us though
that because you're on it,

374
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,820
they'd like to ask you a favor,

375
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:10,780
which is to stop posting pictures
of them without their permission.

376
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:14,680
And I think that's important because it
becomes part of their digital tattoo.

377
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:18,040
But we're also asking them to do that
with their friends so that the digital

378
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,650
drama decreases.
So kids will tell us like,

379
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:24,910
I really don't want that picture of me
in the Bathtub Nudie when I'm 12 and says

380
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:25,121
like,

381
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:29,470
where have the year's gone that they
really want you to model and ask them for

382
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:30,304
permission.

383
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,250
I'm just thinking that all of these
apps for me have good intention.

384
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,510
I don't think any apps are
created to be mean or bad.

385
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,540
What we know is when teens go anywhere
in a large number that things get sexual

386
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:47,710
and that they push the envelope.

387
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,970
And so I guess I wanted to talk
just briefly about each of these.

388
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:56,971
Maybe just not all of them but about
what kids are finding amazing about them,

389
00:22:57,221 --> 00:23:00,790
but also some of the things you might
want to start talking about or thinking

390
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,980
about when you're
talking about these apps.

391
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,480
So they are moving away from
Facebook. Like we said, they
checked birthdays there,

392
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,720
they made check maybe
communication with relatives,

393
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:13,180
but it's not the space that
they're hanging out in.

394
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,040
I wondered if anybody knew.
Let's just pick one of these up here.

395
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,080
Anybody know kick? Yeah. So
what do you know about Kik?

396
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,880
So, so we love it that it's
a messaging APP. We love it,

397
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:30,250
that it's free and that
kids can get to use it.

398
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:34,810
And what we also know is that when you
take your kids phone away and you think

399
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:37,810
that they're not going to
be texting anymore, that
they're getting the free kick.

400
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:41,290
Gac. Yeah. And then
they're able to use that.

401
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,940
I'm also going to point,

402
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:47,420
I got the five minutes sign that
the right is called followers. Plus.

403
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:52,280
What I think is interesting about that
is that it takes analytics of how you're

404
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:55,910
doing with your postings and want you to
think about that with your kids to see

405
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,710
did someone unfriend you, did they not?
What's my top posts really to talk about?

406
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,930
That's really important.
Ooh,

407
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:07,250
is that group chat where our kids get
to be together in a group formation.

408
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:11,480
Anytime we're in a big group, we run
the risk of mean behavior happening.

409
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,470
Uh,

410
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,180
periscope and some of the other live
apps are a place where we're seeing a lot

411
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:21,620
of problems because kids aren't really
thinking with their frontal lobe.

412
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:26,210
And so they're exposing things quickly
in the moment and not pulling back to

413
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,044
think about it.

414
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,860
And the only thing I wanted to say
about Instagram and snapchat is that

415
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:35,060
Instagram, um, your, your kids
have two Instagram accounts.

416
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,130
We're pretty sure of it now that one is,

417
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:40,430
they're curated one for their family and
one is their real one that they share

418
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:45,020
with your friends. So talk about it.
Same thing about snapchat is fun,

419
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:48,890
exciting, really playful. They
don't have to be picture perfect,

420
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,300
but there's lots of room for people to
feel left out of situations to feel like

421
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:56,510
things are happening in live
time and they're not included.

422
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,950
We've also had this amazing shift from
real name to anonymous culture and it's

423
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:05,060
like our kids are listening to us.

424
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,840
We asked them to be careful when you
put your name out there so they went

425
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:09,530
underground.

426
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,270
So the three that have come into play
love you to ask your kids or nephews or

427
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:19,080
nieces if they know them and how you see
them being affected is the afterschool

428
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,710
APP ASK FM and the burn book.

429
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,380
So really talking about the
power of anonymous APPS,

430
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:26,330
how we can be a little
meaner behind a screen,

431
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,250
how much more we have to focus on stepping
in someone else's shoes to be able to

432
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:35,000
really feel that when we don't see them.
On the other side of the screen,

433
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,930
I want to tell you about this incredible
thing that we keep hearing about with

434
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:43,580
kids, which is how much these
gurus and viners are their friends,

435
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,230
how much they look up to them,

436
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:48,380
how much they wait for the
next video to be released,

437
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,380
and how much information
they can give us to,

438
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:55,460
how are kids doing to kind
of get a psychological pulse
on how they're doing in

439
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:58,970
the world, what they're gravitating
to, what they're interested in.

440
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,980
So I love just asking kids who are your
favorite youtubers or viners and why?

441
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,390
And you get incredible answers.
The middle one is Pewdie Pie.

442
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:11,150
The top is, um, I call him the,

443
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,210
the Mr. Rogers of Minecraft. His
name is stampy long nose. Uh,

444
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,940
there's Jenna marbles
at the bottom. Um, so,

445
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,170
and Miranda Miranda sings at the
bottom and Jenna marbles in the middle.

446
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,310
But I want you to think the same way you
did about asking your kids about their

447
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:29,720
friends in elementary school.

448
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,750
I want you to ask them about the people
they're watching. How'd you meet,

449
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:36,530
how did you get introduced to them?
What's interesting about them, hey,

450
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:38,900
let me take a look at it. Instead
of saying, oh, I don't like them,

451
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:43,100
or they're no good, we actually just
talk about what they're interested,

452
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,890
why and sit down and we can
learn so much about them.

453
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,260
Our kids tell us that they want us to
supervise them, not supervised them.

454
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,710
That they don't want you to take their
phone away at night and look at what

455
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:56,071
they're doing.

456
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:59,850
They want you to go through it with them
because they're creates a feeling of

457
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,000
anxiety. If they know that you're
always kind of overlooking them.

458
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,950
We want to tell you that we rarely see
predators and we know parents worry a lot

459
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:11,670
about predators. Um, and if your
kid is struggling with issues,

460
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,650
then you may see that.
But for the most part,

461
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,440
the dramas happening with their friends.
Ask your kids,

462
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:21,060
what's the digital drama happening
right now in your squad of friends? Um,

463
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,620
we want to look for openings for
connection and discussion. So in my life,

464
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,090
I send my kid, I used to send him
a note to his lunchbox. I love you.

465
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,610
Now I send a note to his inbox or quit,

466
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,090
so and give them an
out of hard situations.

467
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,990
So I'm going to end with this one
and then hand it over to Gloria.

468
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,290
But I think this feels like my
most important slide, which is,

469
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,120
and I think Gloria started with this,

470
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:49,530
which is I think that the tool is
here to stay and has incredible power,

471
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,820
but just taking it away without having
a conversation leaves them just wanting

472
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:57,450
to go underground. So for example,
if we don't like in my house,

473
00:27:57,451 --> 00:28:01,110
I don't like to single person shooter
games and I can say I don't like it cause

474
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:05,820
I think it desensitizes you to
violence. Uh, or you can say,

475
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:07,860
I'm worried about your sleep.
Or you can say,

476
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,670
I feel like in those musically videos
you're sexualizing yourself to get

477
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:12,800
attention.
And,

478
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,830
and so instead of taking away the
APP or taking away the device,

479
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:20,490
I'm going to encourage you to have
the conversation, to be curious,

480
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,260
to enter their world, to hear
what they have to say. Uh,

481
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,230
and to kind of think back on our parents
and when they were open to knowing what

482
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:30,000
we were doing without shutting us down.

483
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,990
It was the time we made the
best connections and then
we can send our kids up

484
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,610
being self advocates.
All right.

485
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,890
It is um, been such an incredible
gift for me to work with Erica and uh,

486
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,460
to really look at what triggers
us so much as a psychologist,

487
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,900
as a clinical social worker.

488
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,250
We were really intrigued by the psychology
of technology and we want to take you

489
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:57,090
into this, into this place that we
have been in for the past five years.

490
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,380
But to do that,

491
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:02,850
I'm going to ask you all to go back to
middle school and I'm just curious how

492
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,890
many of you would go back to
middle school if you could?

493
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,680
Not a single hand is going up here.
Very rarely do we see hands go up here.

494
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,660
Can anyone tell me why
they wouldn't go back?

495
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,610
Like why would you not
go back to middle school?

496
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,000
Puberty. Yeah. Selfconsciousness just the,

497
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,080
I mean like the light is on you and
everybody's watching. Absolutely.

498
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,270
So let's go into this right now.
Actually, I want you to, as you go back,

499
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,800
I want you to remember when and in doing
that, even if you're not a parent yet,

500
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,060
I mean, Joel, when you talked about it,

501
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:38,700
you were thinking about what
it would mean to be a parent.

502
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:42,220
So the best way to do this is
to think back at this time. So

503
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,270
let's remember one,

504
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,360
how many of you remember doing and note
that looks something like this? You know,

505
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:49,960
so we all had a version of something like
this and this was very important to us

506
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,190
as we were defining ourselves. And the
most important thing was to be liked.

507
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,580
We all want it to be liked,
we wanted everyone to approve of us.

508
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,540
And it's really no different is
it? It is still. Do you like me?

509
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,190
And as Erica mentioned, our kids are,
well not completely off Facebook,

510
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:07,810
but getting off of Facebook,

511
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,490
it's about insta likes and it's about
evaluating yourself worth by the number of

512
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,590
likes and by the number of comments.

513
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,970
And we've had so many conversations with
kids about this and it's been really an

514
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:23,971
eye opener for us to have them talk
about what it means to really get social

515
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:24,681
collateral,

516
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:28,840
a social currency by the number of likes
they get and the number of comments and

517
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:32,350
how strategic they are about that
and how careful they are about that.

518
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,920
And what we say to parents is that
this is such an incredibly important

519
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:36,754
conversation.

520
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,150
If you see your child completely
defining themselves by those likes.

521
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:44,770
And by the way, I'm going to talk about
my own kids around this. You know,

522
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:46,870
in one of my oldest son would say to me,

523
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:50,320
in spite of my best self at the age of 29,

524
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,770
I cannot stop looking at how many
likes I'm getting on Instagram.

525
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,690
So we all know that pool.

526
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,920
And I want you to imagine that pool on
steroids because for kids to be liked in

527
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:02,080
middle school is what they are all about.

528
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,950
And to us that is the
discussion that we want to have.

529
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,940
And we also want to look at
it for ourselves too. Um,

530
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,580
but definitely look at it with our kids
that appreciate that this is a time when

531
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:14,350
it's really,
really huge for them.

532
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,200
What to talk about the impact of social
media on the adolescent brain and as we

533
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,460
talk about this,
we're,

534
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,640
we're going to be looking at generalities
and we're going to be looking at what

535
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:27,640
we know about the brain and we're also
going to be talking about what we have

536
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:29,710
learned and what kids have
shared with us as well.

537
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,280
So we know that our brains are hardwired
to seek new information that is no

538
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:38,950
different.
We literally get a shot shot of dopamine,

539
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:43,690
the happy chemical with an in
today's world with a, with a text,

540
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:48,490
with a tweet, with the, like with the
buzz. We get this search, and again,

541
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,980
imagine this in middle school
because it's far bigger.

542
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,720
It's a much more intense search.

543
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,460
What our kids are saying to us is
that their texts and tweets are highly

544
00:31:57,461 --> 00:32:01,660
perishable and they lose that social value
if they're not responded to instantly.

545
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,700
This has been an interesting transition
for us in this field because what was

546
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,430
five years ago?
An acceptable amount of time.

547
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:14,110
Can anyone guess what an acceptable
amount of time might've been about three

548
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:16,330
years ago to respond to a text?

549
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,463
Good

550
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,390
a day.
What do you think it is now?

551
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,840
Not even,
it's for many of our kids,

552
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:30,890
they talk about wanting an
immediate response and if
they don't get an immediate

553
00:32:30,891 --> 00:32:31,724
response,

554
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:36,060
they will think that something has
happened like dreadful to their part,

555
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,190
to that person. They've even said
to us, maybe they're dead. We've,

556
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,440
we've heard kids say that.
Or they think that something,

557
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:46,220
they've done something terribly wrong and
therefore that person's not responding.

558
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,970
So that that response time
has shifted enormously.

559
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,940
And I think it's a shifted for
every adult I now as well. I mean,

560
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:57,380
there's no question about that.
They also let us know that, that,

561
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,390
that the fact that it's highly perishable
makes this device so incredibly

562
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:06,740
important. 24, seven because they're
out of there. They're not in the know.

563
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:09,350
If they don't have it, they
often will say to us, um,

564
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,750
if I don't respond to a friend right away,

565
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,830
she's gonna think I'm a really bad
friend and that means my call is to be 24

566
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,180
seven and always there.

567
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,640
And that imperative is
incredibly important to look
at because that's a really

568
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:26,090
tough way to live. And we see
a lot of our kids, I would say,

569
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,440
well it's not just our girls,

570
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:31,280
it's girls and boys really struggling
with this issue of being always on.

571
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,380
Let's continue thinking about what this
biology is and like let's look at some

572
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,240
of the chemicals that are
going on in the brain.

573
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,040
Dopamine is one of these key chemicals
that we know about scientifically,

574
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,260
but we're also hearing
about it a lot for our kids.

575
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,780
Of course they're not talking
about it in terms of dopamine,

576
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,830
but they are saying it feels
really good to connect it.

577
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,520
It makes them feel like they
are really in the know and they,

578
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,010
and they are really loving
that constant connection.

579
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,760
And we're talking about brain chemistry
because it's dopamine that gets

580
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:04,460
stimulated by tiny bits
of new information,

581
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,530
which is exactly what social media is.
So we can see the pool for this.

582
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,350
And there were also
talking about oxytocin,

583
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,260
which is what's called
the cuddle chemical,

584
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,430
and it releases a feeling
of goodwill and connection.

585
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,420
And that's what the comments are about.
That's what the likes are about.

586
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,440
And that's what's really getting
highlighted in the eye and the brain of an

587
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:31,220
adolescent and not just the brand of an
adolescent, the brain, all of our brains.

588
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,060
So between dopamine and between oxytocin,

589
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,360
it's really hard to stop wanting more
and we can really see that pool that our

590
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:43,520
kids are experiencing. And by the
way, that we're all experiencing,

591
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,940
I don't know anybody that is completely
honest that wouldn't say I'm feeling the

592
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:51,890
tug of this as well.
But we know that for our kids,

593
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:55,280
because of their brain chemistry,
it's more so than it is for adults.

594
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,150
So that's her advisory group again.

595
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,750
And with that in mind
with sort of the brain,

596
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,060
very brief look at brain chemistry,

597
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,000
would you say that kids
are addicted to devices?

598
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:09,530
And I'm just curious
about a show of hands.

599
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:12,940
How many of you would say kids
are addicted to devices? Okay, so

600
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,260
some hands are going up. How many of
you would say your addicted to devices?

601
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,990
I think I am. You're on
the fence? Not quite sure.

602
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,040
So we're going to look at two ways of
looking at this. And I want to say to you,

603
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:31,580
this is without judgement at all.
As a mom, I didn't mention earlier,

604
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:34,820
I'm the mom of three
young adults and it's,

605
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,070
they have led me through
this world and the work.

606
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,990
All of our kids have really
taught us so much about this.

607
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:43,470
And this is what we're seeing and hearing.
Our kids are saying to us,

608
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,260
we're not addicted to our phones.
We just like each other.

609
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:51,300
And it had overscheduled intense world
where there's so much expected of them

610
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:54,930
and they have to move so quickly.
Those times that I know,

611
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:58,980
are you a member of just space where
I could ride my bike and no one was

612
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:01,650
watching me and I didn't
have to text my mom.

613
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,700
I can't even imagine that as an
adolescent those days are over.

614
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,970
So what it means to be tethered to their
parent is huge and and they are missing

615
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:15,000
that and they really don't have that
time to play the way they used to.

616
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,470
So they're using a device to connect
into play because that need to connect as

617
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,120
no different than what any of us had.

618
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,980
What we also have seen very clearly
is face to face conversation begins.

619
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,880
We're digital ones and and vice
versa that there is no honor off.

620
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,050
It's exactly the same.

621
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,200
It's one world and that both
really contribute to that
formative development of

622
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,850
identity.
They're both incredibly important.

623
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,080
So that's sort of one perspective and
looking at this and then we're also seeing

624
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:43,740
another,

625
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,740
we talked about the power and we talked
about the challenges and so I'm going to

626
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:50,400
look at the challenges right now.

627
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,970
This is a quote from one of our 12th
grade students. You're not alone.

628
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:58,860
When you're on your phone and we're
seeing that ability to be alone really

629
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:01,080
shifting.
And I know when I take a walk,

630
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,510
I very rarely see someone alone anymore.
I mean there is a device going on,

631
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:08,130
there's a full conversation happening.

632
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,080
So we are struggling with
what it means to be alone.

633
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:16,081
And that's an interesting issue when
you think about invention and new,

634
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,303
um,

635
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,840
new energy often comes out of that alone
time and we're seeing less of that now.

636
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,230
And that's an interesting
thing to ponder on. So again,

637
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:28,890
this is our advisory group and if
we look at them, we see sort of,

638
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:33,630
this is a very typical discussion with
our kids and you see them kind of on

639
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,230
there. There's a phone there, there's
conversation and you see a head down.

640
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,500
And that's not uncommon at all.

641
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,570
And what we are hearing and what we're
seeing from our kids and for most people,

642
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,360
and here's the conversation we had
with one of our kids. That quote,

643
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,280
if a phone is on the table,

644
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,450
I will keep my conversation light
knowing I don't have full attention.

645
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Then in that at any minute some will be
distracted and I think that is a very,

646
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,320
very true issue and that has shifted.
That is something very different.

647
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:06,930
We didn't hear that five years ago.
We are seeing that now.

648
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,060
If the phone is on the table,

649
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,270
I will keep that conversation light and
I'm not going to go deep because I know

650
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:16,950
at any minute I'm going to lose attention.
That was an 11th grade student.

651
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,550
Our kids are learning this new
social norm in middle school.

652
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,840
They're learning it when they are
learning how to look like they're paying

653
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:27,780
attention to a lecture and they're
texting underneath their desk.

654
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,100
They're learning that they can pull this
off and pull it off really, really well.

655
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,800
So we're watching our kids feel that
this is something they can absolutely do.

656
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,250
But the question that I think we have to
address is are we losing the complexity

657
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:43,270
of what it means to be in a conversation?

658
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,560
Because conversations are complex and we
have to know and we have to be able to

659
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:51,580
tolerate that awkward
silence when you're not sure,

660
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:54,040
is it my turn to talk or
is it their turn to talk?

661
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,930
We have to figure out where to stand in
space and am I too close? Am I too far?

662
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,420
When do I make eye contact?
When do I look down?

663
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,270
This doesn't happen if a
child is looking at a device.

664
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,600
And this personally gives us concern
because what we know is that those skills

665
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:13,480
are still needed. It
doesn't matter. You know,

666
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:18,250
our world is here to stay.
Our World of media is here to stay.

667
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,200
But those skills are human skills.

668
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,460
And I think it's important for us to all
pay attention to the fact that we are

669
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:27,250
saying our kids now struggling with
us in a really, really big way.

670
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:32,010
Many of them are telling us that
they would much rather text, um,

671
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,800
than they would talk because they
can control the conversation.

672
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,890
And if they're talking,
they've lost control of the conversation.

673
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,590
And I think that's an interesting
thing to pay attention to.

674
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,600
Has anyone seen this photograph?
I would imagine some of you have,

675
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,420
it was a photograph sent to
us by one of our advisors. Uh,

676
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,750
it was taken about a year
ago and Redondo beach.

677
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,000
And we are convinced that this man is
googling where to find whales and we're

678
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:03,001
sure we're sure that he missed
exactly what he needed to see.

679
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,840
And we know that there was a guy in front
of him taking this picture and I had

680
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:09,820
this fantasy of him screaming,
look up.

681
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,950
I mean just look up and the guy who never
did. So we are tethered and you all,

682
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,980
most of you raised your hands in terms
of your own tethering and our kids are

683
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:21,130
very honest about that.
We're tethered to our devices.

684
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,980
Our kids are tethered to their friends.

685
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,250
Our kids are tethered and
romantic relationships.

686
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:29,680
The amount of texts
that go back and forth,

687
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,420
it can be overwhelming and almost
suffocating to many of them in late middle

688
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:37,720
school and high school. And I want to
talk a little bit about the tethering.

689
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:41,560
We're saying for parents because that's
a really interesting level of tethering

690
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,610
that has shifted quite a bit.
Um,

691
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,240
we are hearing from colleges now
that there's an expectation not well,

692
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,550
they're seeing that they're his parents
and kids are texting sometimes seven to

693
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:53,950
eight times a day.
And um,

694
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,460
and the techs can take these
very interesting tourance
they can be things like,

695
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,660
and kids are sharing this with
people at school and college. Um,

696
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,660
can you geo locate the library for me
and you can you geo locate the bookstore

697
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,240
and while you're at it we'd like,

698
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:09,310
I'd like you to get my books and get them
immediately because I expect things to

699
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:12,880
happen immediately. So there's a
language and there's a term for this.

700
00:41:12,881 --> 00:41:16,690
Right now our colleges are calling
it drone parenting and it's kind of

701
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,950
fascinating and it's a little
scary when we think about this.

702
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,750
It's helicopter parenting with
tech enhanced surveillance
capacity and expanded

703
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,670
reach.
So they've given,

704
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,700
they move from hover parenting
hovering to drone parenting at college.

705
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:37,100
What it looks like is arguing with props
on behalf of grilled growing children

706
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:42,050
for grades. Um, and they also look like
correcting their paper and turning it in.

707
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,890
And a profit is very clear that this
is not coming from a student but coming

708
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:49,790
from a parent and then let's look at
what it looks like in the world of work.

709
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:53,510
And I can certainly speak to this as a
parent of kids that are in the world of

710
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:58,250
work, going to job fairs and bosses,
offices in place have grown children.

711
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,860
And I know for myself,
I see some heads nodding here for myself.

712
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:06,020
When my oldest son got his first job,

713
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:11,050
it was amazing for that job to court my
husband and I equally as they courted my

714
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:16,280
husband with an assumption that
if they wanted him they had,

715
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,720
we had to talk him into it too.

716
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,640
So I'm seeing a shift happening culturally
that's looking like it's normal and

717
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,700
we may not want this to want to be
normal. You guys, I mean this one,

718
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:29,300
this one gives us big pots.
So drone parenting.

719
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,700
Now I also want to talk about a shift
that we have seen in our five years of

720
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:38,270
working with kids. And I'm going
to throw this question out to you.

721
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,010
When we ask kids,

722
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:44,240
we show a short video and it's very old
school about someone being digitally

723
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:47,690
tethered and,
and losing the losing conversation.

724
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,260
And when we showed them this video,
we asked them who they see,

725
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,190
who do you imagine they see when
we showed this? Any guesses?

726
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,720
You nailed it.
Now that's a shift.

727
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,580
They didn't see their parents before.
They used to see themselves.

728
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:10,440
And um, we're now in fourth grade.
Primarily we're an elementary school,

729
00:43:10,441 --> 00:43:13,260
high school, Middle School and
high school. And the shift,

730
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:17,070
I'd say in the last year and a half,
our kids are now saying, that's my mom.

731
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,560
That's my dad.
That's my family.

732
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,020
And I'm going to take you into some of
the quotes that we've been hearing from

733
00:43:22,021 --> 00:43:22,854
kids on this one.

734
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,270
This is a ninth grade student.

735
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,140
If parents stopped for a second to
look behind their iPad and put down the

736
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:31,974
scream,

737
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,100
they would realize they're kids are right
in front of them and they are trying.

738
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:40,130
And that's really pretty intense quote.
Um,

739
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:45,740
we often present this in many ways in
fourth and fifth grade and it's amazing.

740
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,260
Kids are shooting up their hands and
they're sharing strategies with each other

741
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,070
on how they can bring their parents back.
And here are some of the strategies.

742
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,540
Well one child said, I see my dad two
days a week and he's always on his iPad.

743
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,930
The bottom are the strategies kids are
sharing with each other about how they

744
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:05,310
pull their parents back. I shake them,
poke them, pinch them, bribe them,

745
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,760
yell at them, weigh the piece
of paper in front of their face,

746
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,410
grab their phone away.

747
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:13,230
Our newest one that we heard is
called them by their full name,

748
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:18,120
which you thought was hysterical. Uh, put
my face in their face until they see me.

749
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,950
But the one that really concerns us
is that I give up and then they say,

750
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,490
and then I give up and I go in
my room and I got on my device.

751
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:32,090
And what concerns us is kids in school
still think parents are incredibly cool

752
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,310
and there are looking for connection and
they're looking for a time to have that

753
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:40,500
icon.
I contacted conversation,

754
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,710
but if they're learning early at
this point that nobody's home,

755
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,880
they are going to just drift away and
they're going to just go to Google to look

756
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:49,440
up things and not go to their parents.

757
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,010
So this is definitely an issue that
we're seeing and paying attention to.

758
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,930
I also want to talk about
tech not perfection and when
we ask our kids to define

759
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:58,980
Tecta perfection,

760
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,480
they are really clear that
it's about a curated image.

761
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,980
It's about trying to be
perfect and expecting that
perfection is something they

762
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:09,870
have to have 24 seven

763
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,120
I was amazed when we do our advisory
groups that we asked in this question,

764
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:17,760
they could have talked about it
forever and we asked them what are the

765
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:22,761
acceptable body types and they told
us that it's super skinny or Kim

766
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,620
Kardashians. And if you look at the
new Barbie dolls that have come out,

767
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:27,090
it's interesting.
Some people,

768
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:30,180
has anyone been aware of the new barbies
that have come out, go check them out.

769
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,320
They're fascinating to me.

770
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,510
Some of them are looking just like Kim
Kardashians and some of them are looking

771
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,540
just like super skinny and so in a way,

772
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:43,470
and they thought this was really good
news because it was defining real bodies,

773
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,370
but are they real bodies?
So look at what's going on there.

774
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,760
Our feeling is that this
subliminal message is beauty
is unachievable and we're

775
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:57,480
hearing our girls talk about this quite
a bit and what we're also very aware of

776
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,040
is that it's not just a girl issue,
that it is a boy issue as well.

777
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,170
So what I want to talk with you about
right now or the kinds of things that our

778
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:10,290
kids have said to us and our advisory
group about what they want their parents

779
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:14,400
to do to help. How do we change this?
How do we start this conversation?

780
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,020
And the first thing they said to us is
we want our parents to help us combat

781
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:21,240
those myths.
Because to us it's real.

782
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,730
We see a billboard or we're
assuming that it's real.

783
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,780
Help us understand that being
thin will not bring you happiness.

784
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:33,600
I love this one. Helping not seek external
validation. And find my own voice.

785
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,640
Start this conversation early and people
are often very afraid to start the

786
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:40,560
conversation because they
think it's too young.

787
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,830
There is no too young and
shift the conversation.

788
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,360
What are they trying to sell you?

789
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,120
There is no middle schooler that wants
to be manipulated and once they realize

790
00:46:49,121 --> 00:46:51,780
that someone's trying to sell them
something, especially in adult,

791
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:56,070
they're going to be able to push back
and as I mentioned earlier,

792
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,140
this one gets them
screaming when we show them.

793
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,930
Justin Bieber can't even really
explain what's going on there.

794
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:04,950
But what I love about showing us images
that they're not supposed to see the one

795
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,220
over in this corner, they're supposed
to see the really buff to find one.

796
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:12,030
And what we want them to
get is the manipulation.

797
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,680
We are seeing that because it's a female
issue, it's seen as a female issue.

798
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:21,810
There are often not able to discuss it
the way that girls do and we want them to

799
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,900
because that conversation is important
and we really love this quote because we

800
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:30,220
think that pushing back as we really
want our kids to be able to do.

801
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,290
I'm looking at our time and I want to
talk a bit about sleep because sleep is an

802
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:39,700
enormous issue that's impacting kids and
at first to on this ladder used to have

803
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:43,240
what our teens are saying about sleep
but we had to change us because of our

804
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:47,110
kids. It's what our children and our
teens are saying about sleep and it's been

805
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:47,944
significant.

806
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,930
I closed my eyes and go to sleep and
feel like my brain is on coffee and this

807
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:53,980
just happened last week.

808
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:57,790
That was a fifth grade quote and I'm
curious if anybody ever feels like the

809
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,990
brains on coffee in here

810
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,520
when you go to sleep it's
like what is going on?

811
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:08,380
This is emerging science
and we're starting to get
more information on this and

812
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:11,350
I'll share with you in brief what
we're saying and what we're learning,

813
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,120
but we are seeing that our kids are coming
to school with digital hangovers and

814
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:19,720
I can certainly see that adults are going
to work with digital hangovers as well.

815
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,660
What we are finding out is the kids
between the ages of nine and 15 are

816
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:28,660
especially sensitive to light
exposure in the evening.

817
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,670
Light comes at them from any way
and they're sensitive to all light,

818
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,410
but we're also wondering,

819
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,910
and we're learning that the blue light
emitted from digital devices may be

820
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,610
particularly impactful and we
know it's impactful to us as well.

821
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,800
The more evening light exposure,
the lower that level of Melatonin.

822
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:51,610
It's true for all of us and
incredibly true for this age group,

823
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:56,830
so it suppresses their bodies time clock
and makes them fall asleep later and

824
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:01,540
therefore wake up with those digital
hangovers. So what do we do about this?

825
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,580
And I want to say what
do we do about this?

826
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:08,250
Because this impacts all of us and these
are just a few things to look at. Um,

827
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,420
is anyone using flux? It's a
great one. And the new iPhone,

828
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,930
um, has niche, it is at night night shift,

829
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:19,150
which is going to be also mirroring.

830
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:22,480
We know that blue light tricks
our brain into staying awake.

831
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,350
So flux does this amazing
thing which is so important.

832
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,020
It mirrors our bodies time clock.

833
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,840
It mirrors what our body
needs when it's nighttime,

834
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:36,070
it turns that reddish glow of the sun
setting. When it's daytime it turns blue.

835
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,150
And there are also really
good apps that we recommend.

836
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:45,280
Self control is one of them that blocks
access to distracting websites. Um,

837
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:49,510
stay focused is another that sets a timer
where you can block your own access to

838
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:54,370
those websites. And re readability is one
that really helps with online clutter.

839
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,150
It's amazing we're having to develop
these tools to help us not get distracted,

840
00:49:58,151 --> 00:50:01,900
but we have to and we have to really
support our kids are doing this as well.

841
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,581
And then finally,

842
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:06,940
when Eric and I are in schools and
we're really challenged and parents were

843
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:11,290
encouraging them to change the
norms around 24, seven conductivity,

844
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:12,880
because we're all feeling it.

845
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,450
So what are the skills our kids
are going to need in the future?

846
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:22,240
We know that it's the ability to work
cooperatively and collaboratively through

847
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:26,350
network communication. I mean we, we
see it, we're living it right here.

848
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,950
Collective intelligence, crowdsourcing.
And it's that very sharing,

849
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,450
tweeting, constant updating that's
preparing them to do that work. I mean,

850
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:39,410
it's that thing that worries us,
that is so incredibly important.

851
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:43,310
But here's the paradox that here's the
piece that we have to look at with the

852
00:50:43,311 --> 00:50:44,840
world at their fingertips.

853
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,890
It's the ability to tune out the noise
because there's an awful lot of noise out

854
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:53,810
there and engage in technology
with awareness and balance
that's going to cause

855
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:55,550
us to be able to succeed this world.

856
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,820
So that's the piece that's
so incredibly important.

857
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:01,380
And I want to share with you that,
that um,

858
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:06,860
we are really at a place right now
after working with 14,000 kids and we're

859
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,680
moving very,
very quickly and expanding.

860
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,460
We're looking for partners and we
were looking to expand our reach to

861
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:17,600
organizations and to schools particularly
where kids can't afford this and we

862
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:21,200
feel that everybody needs it and we want
to introduce our executive director,

863
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:24,320
Mia Walker,
who is a former Googler and a,

864
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,980
we will be here for conversation and
really look forward to talking with you if

865
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,940
any strategies and ideas about this.
Thank you so very much for coming.

866
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,020
Thank you for inviting US Joelle.
One thanks guys.

867
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,540
How do you define
acceptable usage of a phone?

868
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,960
And the question came in two parts
and I love it. So I'll read them out.

869
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:47,560
That datum. Uh, one is, is
it okay to take away phones,

870
00:51:47,561 --> 00:51:51,430
have bad grades and as a follow on,
is it different when they,

871
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:54,160
or we use the phone just to
research things like, oh,

872
00:51:54,161 --> 00:51:57,100
let me Google that to pick up the phone
and check it out. That kind of thing.

873
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:58,490
I say something

874
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:02,380
about taking the phone away
for, for bad grades, I,

875
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,690
the danger of doing that is creating
the forbidden fruit. I mean if,

876
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,700
if we take it away as a punishment,

877
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,570
if you really want to make someone fall
in love with something and make it the

878
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:14,560
forbidden fruit and I think
that that technique is, is just,

879
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,090
is doomed for failure.
Personally as a parent,

880
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:19,760
I don't think that that works very well,
that sad.

881
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,200
There's absolute need for limits and our
kids desperately need our limits. Um,

882
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,930
do you have any other thoughts on that?
Yeah.

883
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:31,490
Thinking the same thing and that sometimes
being part of a conversation ahead of

884
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:33,290
time,
some preventative work,

885
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:37,850
talking about a contract or pointing out
what you're noticing that their grades

886
00:52:37,851 --> 00:52:42,851
are slipping or that they're acting
inappropriately in their conversation is a

887
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:47,000
better way to talk about it than
just grabbing the device away.

888
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,070
Because we will often hear kids say,
oh,

889
00:52:49,071 --> 00:52:53,720
I just get a free counting and used my
friend's phone to text or I have a dummy

890
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:56,090
phone that I give my parents
and they don't remember.

891
00:52:56,091 --> 00:53:00,500
So I also like kids to really understand
that our bodies are not meant to

892
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:02,960
multitask,
that we don't do it very well,

893
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,440
that our bodies are in desperate need
of sleep. And none of us do this. Well.

894
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:10,100
I think that parents have to model this.
I think that if we just direct kids,

895
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:13,580
but we're also hearing from kids is
parents will say to them, you know,

896
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:17,720
get rid of that device and as they're
saying that they're on their device and so

897
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,940
that it's not going to,
that will not bode well. Um,

898
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:24,140
they're really watching our behavior
far more than they're listening to us.

899
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,480
So we have to really be
willing to model it and may be,

900
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,420
that may mean in some families
are doing this, it's 10 o'clock.

901
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:35,160
All devices are down, including
ours. Not Easy, but that is effective

902
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,600
in my house.
We have forced family fun.

903
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:42,410
We're all the devices have to
stay at home and we all leave. Um,

904
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:47,580
just really carving out those digital
free spaces where kids feel like where

905
00:53:47,621 --> 00:53:51,310
there are families are feeling like we're
being heard and that they're important.

906
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:52,361
Yes,

907
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:55,220
it's a great idea for everyone to put
their phones down at 10:00 PM but how do

908
00:53:55,221 --> 00:53:58,840
you reconcile that with the needs of
the kids to stay in touch instantly with

909
00:53:58,841 --> 00:54:01,030
our friends who don't put
their phones down at 10:00 PM

910
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:04,630
you know, we're, we're in an interesting
time right now. I mean, we, we, I mean,

911
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:08,140
I think his parents, we have to come
together and work as communities. I mean,

912
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:12,460
that is, that is not easy to do. And
yet it's so important to do. I mean,

913
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:13,570
I think we have to model it.

914
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,960
I also think it would be so great to
have a community conversation and have

915
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:20,230
other parents doing it too.
But I remember as a parent being told,

916
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,160
you're the only mom doing this and
I'm so angry at you for doing that.

917
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:27,730
And it's okay to have that anger because
we're really helping them out of a jam.

918
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,270
What kids say to us privately. They
don't want us to share it with parents,

919
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:36,040
but I am exhausted and I want off
that group tax, but I can't tell them.

920
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,730
But I'm going to let you know. Um,
and I'm not going to tell my parents,

921
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,130
but you're,
you're helping them out of a jam.

922
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,920
So I'm encouraging parents to set limits.
Yeah.

923
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,430
I'm kind of agreeing with glory.

924
00:54:46,431 --> 00:54:51,431
I've been called the meanest mom Mna in
North America because I wouldn't let a

925
00:54:52,241 --> 00:54:56,170
phones come to a sleepover cause I kind
of feel as my parents did that nothing

926
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:59,580
good happens after 11 o'clock
when you're in a group, uh,

927
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,430
that it just kind of goes south. But, uh,

928
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:07,470
my experience has been that we do a super
good job finding out the best tutors,

929
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:09,310
the best schools,
the best camps,

930
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:12,340
talking to parents all the
time to gather information.

931
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:17,590
And that if we could use that same
curiosity and connectedness to say, hey,

932
00:55:17,591 --> 00:55:17,981
you guys,

933
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,670
do you remember when our parents wouldn't
let us call after nine o'clock because

934
00:55:21,671 --> 00:55:26,350
it was rude or answer the phone during
dinner? And it was just an is right.

935
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:31,000
And so I think the more we talked to
other parents in our kids' friends groups

936
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,210
or to help them do what
Gloria said and realize like,

937
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:35,710
we're not doing it to be mean,

938
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:39,880
we're doing it because these devices are
tricking your brain into believing it's

939
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:43,300
daytime and you don't feel good.
And getting it though.

940
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:48,130
How many kids actually want to fight
distractions from this question? Uh,

941
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,570
when I was a teen,

942
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,920
I didn't really notice when I was tired
or distracted and I didn't think getting

943
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:57,460
A's instead of bees was worth
the extra work anyway. No

944
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,430
Kid wants to fight distraction.
I mean they're,

945
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:02,350
they're not even feeling distracted.
I hope I'm hearing this correctly.

946
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,020
No child would say to you,
they would all say to you,

947
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:09,760
I am amazing at multitasking.
I could do 20 things at once.

948
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,150
I can do whatever. I mean, but we
all said that too, right? I mean,

949
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:18,151
I said I could do whatever at any time
because that ability to recognize that

950
00:56:18,401 --> 00:56:22,900
they can't isn't there yet. So we have
to be the ones to say, you know what,

951
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,990
I'm going to help you with this.
It's really not about getting a six.

952
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:28,990
We're about staying healthy and sane.
I mean,

953
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:32,100
we can't survive on three hours of sleep.
And I know some kids that are trying,

954
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,620
um, we've heard teachers say that
papers are coming in at 1130,

955
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:40,600
1230 for fifth graders because they're
getting so distracted that's not working

956
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:42,760
for anybody.
I have to get their pain point.

957
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,780
And right now what we're noticing in
the classroom is group texts are a pain

958
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:51,781
point that they go on to several group
texts and then hundreds of k what's

959
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:54,190
happening, you know, uh,

960
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,850
just flooded their inbox and the
beings and make it hard to go to sleep.

961
00:56:57,851 --> 00:57:01,480
So I put it back on them like,
what can we do about this?

962
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:04,780
What do you guys think you can do?
And they come up with amazing strategies.

963
00:57:04,781 --> 00:57:07,160
So putting it back into their hands,
uh,

964
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:10,270
to help is and hitting their
pain point really works.

965
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,580
That's a great segue to the
question I had for you guys,

966
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:16,370
which is do you know
of or, or anything, um,

967
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,810
groups or meetups for discussions among
parents or between parents and kids or

968
00:57:20,811 --> 00:57:24,860
even among kids with your advisory panel
or anything where people can go in and

969
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:26,780
share and develop their solutions?

970
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:31,670
I love that question. Uh, we're, we're,
we're seeing that popping up all over.

971
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,690
So we're seeing schools when we go to
a community and we present to schools,

972
00:57:35,691 --> 00:57:38,240
we're seeing parents afterwards going,

973
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,550
we're going to start something
and we need to start it now.

974
00:57:40,551 --> 00:57:43,820
And they come together as parents did
no differently than we came together

975
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:48,290
around other issues as an opportunity to
discuss some of our most effective work

976
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:52,220
has been working with parents separately
and kids separately and then bringing

977
00:57:52,221 --> 00:57:56,000
everybody together to share strategies
with each other, really powerful.

978
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,830
So often it starts small.

979
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:02,860
It's often parents going on lost and then
coming together with other parents who

980
00:58:02,991 --> 00:58:05,750
equally feel that way. And then just
starting that community conversation.

981
00:58:05,751 --> 00:58:09,770
I love what you're talking about because
we spend most of our time talking about

982
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,450
problems, about facilitating
conversations. About how it feels.

983
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:19,400
And I love the idea as we start to expand
our program bigger to talk about what

984
00:58:19,401 --> 00:58:20,360
can we do about it?

985
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:25,360
How do we work as a collective community
to create a kinder Internet where we

986
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:29,570
have incredible power and we
can do great things. And I, I,

987
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,710
I would just love people to come to
us with ideas and to help these kids

988
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:35,500
facilitate their own.
So to,

989
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,000
I wanted to say something about our
conversation after we met you. Um,

990
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,280
I'm fired up about parents before they
have children saying we want to do

991
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:49,520
something now because we're concerned.
And some of the current research,

992
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,760
the new research is coming out around
attachment just a little scary.

993
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,960
So we are encouraging parents to talk
even before they have kids about how they

994
00:58:56,961 --> 00:59:01,790
want to deal with this world. So, uh,
this conversation is incredibly important.

995
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,110
Okay. Well thank you both very
much. We're just about out of time.

996
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,590
Really appreciate you guys coming down
to Google to give us all talk. Thank you.

997
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:09,670
Yeah.
