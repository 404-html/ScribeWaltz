1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,970
Standing next to me is
Winefred Winefred Riley.

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,400
She is a psychotherapist specializing in
marital therapy and relationship issues

3
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,430
in a private practice in Berkeley,
California.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,120
In her 35 years of clinical practice,

5
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:28,620
she has treated hundreds of couples
who are convinced they're headed for

6
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:29,454
divorce.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,930
Ms. Riley has been a guest lecture on
marriage and sexuality and her writing has

8
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:35,640
appeared on the Huffington Post,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,950
the good men project x chain
and her blog speak of marriage.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,920
I'm so excited that we get to
hear Winifred Riley. Thanks.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,910
Thank you so much.
So I'm going to start first.

12
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:50,140
Thank you so much for having me.

13
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:53,500
I'm going to start first by
telling you this personal story.

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,060
So my husband and I were married
early on a Sunday morning.

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,630
By late that afternoon we were in the
car driving down one o one to spend a few

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,790
days down in big Sur.
So our friends had painted,

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,870
just married across the back of our car.
So as we're driving along,

18
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:14,410
people are honking and waving
and giving the thumbs up.

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,100
And then this guy in the pickup truck
comes on pulling on up to our car and he's

20
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:23,050
honking from my husband
to roll down the window.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,290
And then at about 75 miles an hour,

22
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,120
this guy leans across the cab of
his truck and yells out the window,

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,030
don't do it.
So I there,

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,810
I married what, maybe five hours,
six hours, and I'm thinking,

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,360
Nah,
that'll never be us.

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,450
Not not the business of yelling out
of the car, window and newlyweds,

27
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,120
but the idea that we would
be disgruntled or unhappy,

28
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,860
it never occurred to me now you'd think
that it would've known better given my

29
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:59,830
work, given that I'm a
marriage and family therapist.

30
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,970
I mean you think I would have been better
prepared in some way for what marriage

31
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:07,060
would be,
but actually I was as naive,

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,250
an unprepared as my clients.

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,850
I had ideas that were fairly useless.

34
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:16,450
Like we have so much in
common and we're so in love.

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,280
How hard could this be?

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,530
So here's what a client of mindset
on the eve of her third anniversary.

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,380
Yeah,
I know marriage takes work.

38
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:30,160
Everybody knows that I was prepared
for that and I knew we'd have our

39
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,120
difficulties,

40
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,280
but I never ever imagined that the
biggest difficulty in my life would be my

41
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,360
husband George.

42
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,880
So I'm here today to talk about my book.
It takes one to tango.

43
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,480
I'm going to talk about why marriage is
hard and I'm going to tell you a little

44
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,130
bit of my personal story,

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,340
how I changed my own marriage by taking
a leadership role and how you can create

46
00:02:56,831 --> 00:03:00,820
a vibrant and satisfying relationship too.

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,910
So the question is,

48
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:08,770
why is marriage so hard? Well, here,

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,170
marriage puts two people into a small
space with the expectation of keeping them

50
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:17,200
there for a lifetime and then says,
good luck.

51
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,490
Marriage doesn't come with
a guidebook or a roadmap.

52
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,240
And none of us come in with
all the skills that we need.

53
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,060
Many of us have had terrible role models.

54
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:32,050
We've had parents who fought to the
death or hated each other and finally

55
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:32,920
divorced,

56
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,340
or we had over idealized romantic role
models like grandparents who were married

57
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:44,920
75 years in swore.
They never had one single argument now.

58
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:48,220
And then there you are in your honeymoon
on the third day and you're ready to

59
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:51,550
kill each other. So you've completely
blown it right out of the gate.

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,780
Then we also have these mistaken ideas,

61
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,110
like marriage is harder,
marriage shouldn't be hard,

62
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,410
or people who fight should get a divorce
or those people look really happy.

63
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,440
What's wrong with us then? You know,

64
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:13,310
so we have the negative role miles
and there was a confusion about the

65
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:15,470
difference between marriage and courtship.

66
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,850
Courtship is that wonderful drunk on
love beginning phase where it's all about

67
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:27,080
sameness and loveliness and you just
can't believe that you finally found

68
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:31,940
someone so perfect, someone so much
like you with so much in common.

69
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,690
And unfortunately courtship doesn't last.

70
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,490
And many people really do think that's,
that's what relationships are.

71
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,180
So when court ends,
they just move on to the next one.

72
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,060
Or when marriage gets difficulty or the
long, the longer relationships start to,

73
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,150
they start to struggle. People
think, Nah, I better move on.

74
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,850
So the, so when people struggle and
they find marriage to be difficult,

75
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,600
what I want people to know
is that nothing is wrong.

76
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,850
It's just that marriage is a really
tough teacher and we all have plenty to

77
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:12,470
learn, but many of us don't like
the idea of being beginners.

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,710
We think somehow we're supposed
to be good at everything,

79
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:19,920
even without any practice at all.
No.

80
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:24,921
My graduate school training mimicked
some of these myths about marriage that

81
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,370
that were not particularly helpful,
but worse.

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,400
It seemed to me the trouble that people
had in marriage be more of a pathology,

83
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,800
sort of an aberration,
more than the norm.

84
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,430
But I was thinking there are some really
lovely people that I see in my practice

85
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:46,800
and my husband and I were
not preparing exactly crazy,

86
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:50,130
but we were going at it in
ways that didn't make sense.

87
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:53,520
So I thought something
is wrong with this idea.

88
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,430
So I decided to figure out
why and in order to do that,

89
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,200
I decided to turn myself
into a marriage expert. Now,

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,240
back then, none of this existed. I
couldn't just sit at my computer.

91
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,170
Well actually I didn't even have a
computer back then and I couldn't just sit

92
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,710
down and Google.
Why is my husband driving me crazy?

93
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,310
What am I supposed to do? It was none
of that. So I went to the bookstore.

94
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,030
I had to,
you know,

95
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,030
I went books and I took workshops and
trainings and went to conferences.

96
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,600
And here's the most
interesting thing that I found.

97
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,360
It pretty much turned
everything I understood about
marriage and relationships

98
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,650
upside down.

99
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,880
So most of us think that marriage is
about agreement and consensus about

100
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,160
compromising and meeting halfway.

101
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,080
It's our need for consensus
that's driving us crazy.

102
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,880
We need this agreement, we need this
validation. We need somebody to say,

103
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,050
yes, I hear you. I agree with you.
I perfectly understand you. Oh yes.

104
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:03,950
What you're saying makes perfect
sense and yes, let's do it your way.

105
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,850
But of course it's this, you
know, of course we all like that.

106
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:09,980
I mean everybody wants validation.

107
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,490
And what I like to say is that validation
is a perfectly fine thing to want and

108
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,970
it's a really dangerous thing to need.

109
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,290
So here's essentially
what it comes down to.

110
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,600
We need to learn how to
disagree, not agree. Now,

111
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:33,260
I'm not saying that we have to fight
all the time and that that's the key to

112
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:34,094
happiness.

113
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,280
I'm just saying that what we have to do
is we need to learn to effectively deal

114
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,840
with being two different people.

115
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,650
This was 180 degrees off of everything
that I believed up until then,

116
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,900
but somehow it made perfect sense to me.

117
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:53,270
I didn't know how to apply it to my life,

118
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,090
but I knew that I was onto something.

119
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,810
So let's consider this quote from Einstein
central to the advancement of human

120
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:06,110
civilization is the
spirit of open inquiry.

121
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,210
We must not only learn to tolerate
our differences, we must welcome that,

122
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,000
welcome them as the
richness and diversity,

123
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,300
which can lead to true intelligence.

124
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,630
So I read this quote and I'm in a
workshop for therapists and we're,

125
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,680
we're working with how to
deal with our most impossible,

126
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,240
difficult couples.

127
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,160
So I thought immediately of this
couple up, or Bruce and Cindy,

128
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,230
they were my couple from hell.

129
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,020
They fought about everything. They
just, you're there the corner.

130
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,690
And they couldn't decide, you know,
if they're just taking a walk,

131
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,640
whether they should go right or left.

132
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,560
So I try to imagine die hard,
Vegan Bruce,

133
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,870
welcoming as rich and diverse,

134
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:58,871
his wife's Cindy's interest in any
hamburger when this pi would not even wear

135
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,690
leather shoes.
And what I realize is that's the point.

136
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,770
We don't have to get the person senior,
never going to agree on anything.

137
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,200
And the good news is I didn't,

138
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,560
we didn't actually have
to make them agree.

139
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,540
But here's, here's one of the
pieces of trouble with consensus.

140
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,430
Okay.

141
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,430
So have you ever noticed that your
version and your spouse's version sound

142
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,180
nothing alike?

143
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,800
Have you thought that maybe you're
living in alternate realities,

144
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,710
parallel realities on a good day.

145
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,670
So here's how I observed
this in my office people.

146
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,530
So somebody's there and they're
starting to talk and they say, you know,

147
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:48,531
and this thing happened and that they
have near Portner moves like some micro

148
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:52,840
movement. Why brow little suddenly
happens in what, what? And they,

149
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,430
there was a completely riveted,
they can't finish a sentence.

150
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,380
They can't complete a thought. And
they say, see, this is what I mean.

151
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,000
We can't talk about X.
I'm not allowed to bring up why.

152
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,040
And I say, why not? Who made these rules?

153
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,460
And so if you want to
know who made these roles,

154
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,530
I'm going to ask you to take a
minute and I want you to think about,

155
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,040
imagine,

156
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,760
remember the two of you back in the
early days of your relationship.

157
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,540
There you are.
You're in Starbucks sharing cafe lattes.

158
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,910
Maybe you're actually drinking one
tea with two straws and you're,

159
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,320
you're planning your weekend away
romantic the first trip to the country.

160
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,370
And now meanwhile,
in some smokey back room,

161
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,500
your people and your partners,

162
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:50,400
people are back there negotiating
the terms of your relationship.

163
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,060
Okay, fine. Uh,

164
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,930
I won't question how many times a day she
has to talk to her mother. Okay, fine.

165
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:02,220
And she's just not going to bring up what
the cost of those club level seats are

166
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:06,960
at the ballpark and all right.
Really? Ah, okay. They'll never,

167
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:11,640
ever, ever talk about sex.
So this gets signed into law.

168
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:15,510
They shake hands. Meanwhile you're
out there, you know, having a Lark,

169
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,720
you have no idea that these are actually
the rules that will confine you.

170
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,230
They will define you,
they will make you miserable.

171
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,220
They will make you feel like you were
living in a box until you have the

172
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:32,610
strength and stamina to change them.

173
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Now sad about courtship,

174
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,830
about courtship being about all
things lovely and wonderful.

175
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,451
These rules,

176
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:47,451
you made these roles back in the beginning
when the goal was to keep the peace,

177
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,810
to fall in love,
to preserve your bond,

178
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,980
to keep your partner essentially from
thinking you're completely awful and

179
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:01,390
deciding to leave you. So all of
these things are hidden, but you,

180
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:06,300
you make these rules and you will
have to live with them. So that's,

181
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,480
that's what courtship is.
And so here's marriage.

182
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Marriage is essentially about
the rest of your life together.

183
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,460
You can't keep up the facade of,
of not being yourself when you,

184
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:23,830
when you're,
when you're in a long relationship.

185
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,720
So marriage is really about coming to
terms with the fact that you're two

186
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:32,740
different people that you want
different things that you liked,

187
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:37,540
different things that some of the things
you're going to want are going to clash

188
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,620
with what your partner has in mind.
Now,

189
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,350
this is really,
really important.

190
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,240
We have to figure out how to deal
with this, our differences with grace,

191
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,490
and in order to do this,

192
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,180
you're going to have to learn
how to stand on your own.

193
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,200
This is crucial.
This is the whole,

194
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,900
this is the whole point that I wrote
and this is why I wrote this book.

195
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,700
If you can't stand on your own,
if you can't take a position,

196
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,080
you're never going to challenge the rules.
You're not going to live your life.

197
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,640
You're not going to like your partner.
You're not going to like how you feel.

198
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,430
You will have compromised
your core values.

199
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:22,960
You will have sunk below your own
bottom line. You will be fearful.

200
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,110
You will find yourself spending
a year saying things like,

201
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,470
we're not allowed to do this
and I'm not allowed to do that.

202
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,230
You're going to feel trapped.

203
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,640
You are going to blame your spouse.
If you,

204
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,470
if you imagine yourself one
year, five year, 10 years,

205
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm married almost 40 years,
find yourself all the way down the line.

206
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,330
You won't even know. You would've
been able to recognize yourself.

207
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,630
You will have turned yourself into a
pretzel of accessibility and you won't,

208
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,120
and you won't be able to standard.

209
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,300
Why this is important is that you have
to realize what's at stake. You've,

210
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,410
you've sacrificed your eye for your weed.

211
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:10,660
And in order to be happily married,
to be in a satisfying relationship,

212
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,990
we have to be as connected to
ourselves as we are to our spouse.

213
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,830
If you can't do that,
what's at stake is your vitality,

214
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,260
your wellbeing,

215
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,820
and really even possibly
your entire relationship.

216
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,690
So here's where my
personal story comes in.

217
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,380
I come home from this workshop I've taken,

218
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:39,210
I've gotten this new
idea and I'm ecstatic.

219
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,180
I'd finally figured out why my husband
and I are fighting like a couple of

220
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:46,660
junkyard dogs. I figure
this is it. I've got it.

221
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:50,890
So I come home and I'm all
excited and I said, essentially,

222
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,650
honey, this is the greatest
thing that's ever happened.

223
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,770
I'm going to dismantle our entire marriage
right down to the rafters and we're

224
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,480
going to remodel this whole
thing while we live in it.

225
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,580
And I'm going to be the architect
and the carpenter. So I has been,

226
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,800
you know,
we didn't embrace the,

227
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,810
all of these ideas with quite the
relish that I did. And you know,

228
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,730
pretty much what he said was, I pretty
much think our marriage is fine as it is.

229
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,670
So I know it didn't deter me. I
decided no, I'm going to keep at it.

230
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,230
I knew that this was right. You know,
but, but then actually, so to be honest,

231
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:34,130
what he actually said after,
I think our marriage is fine as it is,

232
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,260
he actually said you went to a workshop
for the weekend and you came back

233
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:43,460
brainwashed and you are essentially,
you're going to save our marriage.

234
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,580
You were about to destroy it.
So I mean,

235
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,280
I can't blame him for thinking this.
I mean,

236
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,210
I'm seeing things like in order to
be close, we have to be separate.

237
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,830
In order to stop fighting, we have to
disagree. You know, this is so many,

238
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,430
could be sense. And so I
can, I can understand. So,

239
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,930
and here's the other thing.
I was pretty much,

240
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,870
here's the picture.
If this is exactly what I was like,

241
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,970
I came home like a lunatic.
Zelle, I'm, I'm, I'm, you know, I,

242
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,770
I knew that this was right,

243
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,330
but there was some way in which I
couldn't actually sell it to him.

244
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,700
So I kept trying out my good ideas
and books to read and things to do.

245
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,910
And, and it was, and it was, you know,

246
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,150
it's like a door to door salesman
trying to sell a reluctant housewife,

247
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:36,500
a new vacuum cleaner. I don't really
need this. Mine works just fine.

248
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,920
So I was about to give up and then I
realized that maybe going about this all

249
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:49,370
wrong,
I realized that my,

250
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,110
my,
the instructions,

251
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,980
what I was going by was that
you have to stand on your own.

252
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,020
You have to take risks.

253
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,300
But what I was doing was he was exactly
the opposite of what I needed to do.

254
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,170
I was trying to get my husband's buyin.
It was,

255
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:08,570
it was as if I was saying,
honey,

256
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,890
I can't very well stand and be
separate from you if you don't join me.

257
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,370
I can't take the lead
if you don't come along.

258
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,790
And that was when I realized that this
business of changing my marriage was

259
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:27,071
going to be a whole lot harder and a
little more complicated than I had first

260
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:29,510
anticipated.

261
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,040
I realized then that if I was
going to change my marriage,

262
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,310
I was going to have to change it myself.

263
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,520
So I didn't have,

264
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,110
I didn't have any real,
um,

265
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,510
real rules for how to do this.

266
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,480
But, but, but this, these are
the principles that I had.

267
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,000
You can't change your partner.
You have to take risks.

268
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,820
You have to challenge the rules
that can find you and frustrate you.

269
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,160
You have to recognize and accept that
this is not a kind of a beeline to change.

270
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,650
You're going to have to learn by falling
seven times and standing up a eight.

271
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,230
And most of all,
you're going to need to focus on yourself.

272
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,373
Well,

273
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,880
I decided that focusing
on myself was the best,

274
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,410
was the best place to begin.

275
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,430
So instead of focusing on all of the
ways in which he was contributing toward

276
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:41,720
difficulties, when focusing on myself,
I discovered a handful of things.

277
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,150
I'm a stubborn,
is my husband.

278
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,480
I'm as likely to start a fight as he is.

279
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,110
I am maybe even less
likely to allow it to end.

280
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,950
I will be willing to fight about anything
as ridiculous and stupid as it might

281
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:04,130
be, as long as I have to end up
being right. But the worst thing,

282
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,220
the most painful observation that I
had was that I realized that I have the

283
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:13,640
staying power of a
dandelion under pressure.

284
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,390
I would just crumble.
And it,

285
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,120
it didn't really match my sense of
myself who I am out in the world.

286
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:25,121
But somehow at home there were these
ways that our interactions would switch,

287
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,210
you know, would just make me dissolve. So,

288
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,590
so I decided that further than
just this focus, which helped,

289
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:37,670
I learned how to stop being pulling
my end of the tug of war rope.

290
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,750
What I realized that I needed to do was
I needed to pick this most frustrating

291
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,010
mind boggling interaction that
I would have with my husband.

292
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,310
It's what I refer to as
our loopy logic fight here.

293
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,000
Way kind of start with, we didn't
matter what we were talking about it,

294
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:03,650
but within a short period of time he's
throwing things in from left field and

295
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:07,220
right. I'd be saying, wait, wait, wait a
minute. Where are we talking about shoes?

296
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:09,970
Wait a second, I thought we were
talking about and then it's what,

297
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:10,880
what's going on?

298
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,980
And I would just lose my ability
to think he was very good.

299
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,230
I really have died by or competence.

300
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,920
He was terrific and I would make me lose.
It would just,

301
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,540
I feel like I was losing my mind.

302
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,260
So what I began doing was experimenting
with what would it take for me to

303
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:34,700
maintain my thoughts,
to feel like I'm staying in one piece.

304
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,480
So I tried deep breathing and I tried
counting backwards and I tried writing

305
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:44,870
down points that I wanted to make,
but none of that worked.

306
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,760
So then one day I decided
to take a physical step back

307
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,940
then I noticed I was able to maintain
my thinking better but not very well.

308
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,510
So I took another step back
and then I experimented.

309
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,760
I come back in the room and I'd look,

310
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,660
I would just lose it in about six seconds
I come back out of the room and so I

311
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:09,640
did this. Honestly, people say, how
long did it take? It took a year.

312
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,360
It took a year for me
to actually be able to,

313
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,400
to stand there and this
is how it happened.

314
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:21,760
One day in the middle of
one of our stupid go rounds,

315
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,820
I realized I didn't have to leave the
room there I was an and it was like

316
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:31,390
suddenly this words for like snowflakes
falling through the air and I was

317
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:36,391
perfectly calm and I knew what I thought
and I knew what I wanted to say and it

318
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:38,290
was like,

319
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,290
like being popping outside of the pull
of gravity and just floating free through

320
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:44,710
space.

321
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,270
And so here's what I'm
going to ask for you to do.

322
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,440
I would like for you,
here's my question.

323
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,270
Yeah.

324
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,230
What experience do you have?
What's,

325
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,670
what is it like for you?

326
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,300
What experience do you have
where you lose yourself?

327
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,020
Where what you want it feels out of reach.

328
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,950
Where what goes on makes your head spin
and frustrates you or makes you shut

329
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:16,930
down or cry or blow up.

330
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,910
What one situation would
you like to master?

331
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,050
So I'd like you to just take
a minute and write it down.

332
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,060
One way to think about it is this,
instead of x,

333
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,710
I want to do y instead of blowing up.

334
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,600
I'm wondering remain calm
instead of crying when I'm angry,

335
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,070
I want to be able to hold
my thoughts together.

336
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:49,820
I want to be able to express myself.
Now.

337
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,830
In order for you to do this,
you're going to have to do two things.

338
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:01,310
You're going to have to give up trying
to change your partner and I mean really

339
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,600
give it up. I don't mean just lip
service. No, no pun intended there.

340
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,190
I didn't mean lip service to the idea of
secretly believing your partner should

341
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:14,400
change.
People come in and they,

342
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,750
it's like they bring in a broken toaster
to the fix it shop in my office and

343
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:21,180
they just,
it's like here I finally brought,

344
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:23,250
I'm bringing my situation to an expert.

345
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:28,251
I've tried to fix my partner and here
it goes and so it's not like that.

346
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,340
The thing about marriage
is that it's a choice.

347
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,360
We can stay with our
partner or we can leave,

348
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,140
but if we're going to stay,
we have to really, we have,

349
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:43,450
we have one of two choices.
We can,

350
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,930
we can be completely driven nuts by our
partner or we can figure out what we're

351
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:51,620
going to do with ourselves.

352
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,170
So the other thing you're
going to have to do,

353
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,120
you're going to have to totally
give up the, it takes to paradigm.

354
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:08,330
You're going to have to throw out all
this stuff about fairness and needing both

355
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:11,940
partners to work as a team and change.
See,

356
00:24:11,941 --> 00:24:15,690
this is one of the things that
surprise me in my own marriage,

357
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,800
that then as I was busy
focusing on myself,

358
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,600
my husband was actually
changing in ways all on his own.

359
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:30,290
He was calming down and occasionally he
was even the more levelheaded arguing

360
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,020
when we would get into
something. He, he, you know,

361
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,130
one day he completely surprised me.
I came home and I was,

362
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I know I came home to make lunch and left
all his stuff all over the counter and

363
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:48,240
the plate and the fork and that,
all of that stuff.

364
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,160
And I was immediately incensed and um,

365
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,010
and so weeks we started
that into it. Oh, like,

366
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,400
well what a nice way for you to come
home and say hello. Well, you know, I'm,

367
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:03,480
I only have 15 minutes and I have to deal
with your math back and forth and back

368
00:25:03,481 --> 00:25:07,980
and forth. We went and then, then
he stopped and he said, okay,

369
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,180
hold on a minute. Let's
back up. So in other words,

370
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,230
you come home in a rush
and complain about my mass.

371
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,970
I get defensive and you feel despair.
You said about right?

372
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,410
And I said, uh, yeah, now I really,

373
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:29,190
I was about to fall
over. And he said, yeah,

374
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,180
I can see that.
And then he began to clean up.

375
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,640
So what happens when you stop focusing
on your partner and you focus on

376
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:39,690
yourself? That was what he did. He began,

377
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,370
he was focused on me and then
he was focused on himself.

378
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,600
So you're going to have to
completely give up the one, the, the,

379
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:52,830
the two to Tango Paradigm
in order for this to work.

380
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,290
Now here's the interesting
thing that people say, you know,

381
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,240
in business people, people you know,
are, are impressed with leadership.

382
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,890
They call leaders decoding, being an
innovator. They, you know, they say,

383
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:10,200
you know, you're, you're a twin center.

384
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,560
But when I suggest that people have
to take it in their own marriage,

385
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,920
they think that I'm centrally telling
them that they're going to have to be some

386
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:23,230
sort of doormat.
So I promise you,

387
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:28,410
I'm asking you to roll over and play
dead or give up on the things that are

388
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:33,630
important to you or just live with
conditions that you can't stand.

389
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:39,290
I'm really suggesting that you recognize
the power of being a leader for change

390
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:43,690
in your relationship.
And,

391
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:48,750
and it really is going to start with that
one thing that I'm asking you to look

392
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:51,930
at.
The one thing that you can change,

393
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:55,760
the one thing that you can control and,
and,

394
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,770
and don't be surprised if it takes
a long time for you to master that,

395
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,910
that one thing that I asked you
to do. It's an incredibly, it's,

396
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:10,911
it's so much more empowering than
waiting for your partner to change.

397
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,090
So, you know, in, and, and
basically what I, you know,

398
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:19,710
what I want you to understand is that
you have more power than you think.

399
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,860
If you're skeptical,
you're not alone.

400
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,020
I mean really I'm asking you to let go
of one of the most cherished beliefs that

401
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:33,021
people have to change as a team that
that it's not worth doing if your spouse

402
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:34,410
doesn't join you.

403
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,640
So I'm really just asking
you to take the challenge,

404
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,230
challenge yourself.

405
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,610
The goal is not here to turn you into
a little island of self sufficiency.

406
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,990
It's about turning you into a partner
who's capable of change is capable of

407
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:53,334
leadership.

408
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,410
One person must take the
first step in change.

409
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,340
My invitation to you is why
not let that person be you.

410
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,213
Thank you.

411
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,420
I love this so much.
Thank you.

412
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,840
And one of the chapters in almost every
chapter there was something where I had

413
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:19,770
to put it down and think about it,

414
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,040
but almost everything in chapter
six when it says it happens once,

415
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,260
what happens once you calm down?

416
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,580
And that for me has been in my marriage
and very difficult thing to do is just

417
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:38,220
to calm down because I was high pressure.
Yes.

418
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:43,250
Under the same impression or feelings
that you were talking about where we have

419
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:45,840
to do this together.
We have to agree,

420
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:50,750
and my husband really likes for me
to agree with him. And so it's very,

421
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,410
it caused not surprising kinds of issues.

422
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,170
So, um, but calming down,

423
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,300
it's just such a great
thought and a great, yeah.

424
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,460
Honest and it's not something
that's easy to do. You know,

425
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,860
when you're really upset and somebody
says to you, calm down. I mean,

426
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,700
how useless is that? Right. You
know, so it actually has to happen.

427
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,260
It has to happen from inside and it
really is another one of those kind of try

428
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:19,840
this and try that. You
know, like I was saying,

429
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:24,160
in order to stay present in my
loopy logic fight, you know,

430
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:27,610
I tried counting,
I tried digging my fingernails in my hand.

431
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,270
I tried planting my feet,
you know, it really just,

432
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:34,840
it ended up being that I
needed the physical distance.

433
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,790
And little did I know that what I was
doing at that point was kind of calming

434
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:42,040
down my,
my neocortex.

435
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I was staying in that little sliver of
reasonable nets while the kind of flood

436
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,520
of the whole rest of my brain was taking
over and acting like it was some kind

437
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:56,521
of emergency and that I'm in on
page one 31 you talk about how,

438
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,120
and this,

439
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,850
this is for me a revolutionary
thought for most people.

440
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:10,770
It takes some time to grow comfortable
with the idea of being responsible for

441
00:30:10,771 --> 00:30:15,771
comforting ourselves when
we're disappointed our
hurt and somewhat longer to

442
00:30:17,221 --> 00:30:18,630
discover its benefits.

443
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,990
And you'd recognize the point of self
soothing with your children. Yes. We all,

444
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:29,280
you know, yeah. We want them to self
soothe so that we can get a night's sleep.

445
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,160
Yes.

446
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,890
And to self sooth ourselves
as a partner in the marriage.

447
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,460
Yeah. I mean if you think about
it, you're in the middle of a,

448
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,470
of a thing with your partner.

449
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,800
If you're reliant on them to be soothing,

450
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:47,510
you mean they're busy,
they're brain is lit up at that moment.

451
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:50,340
And so where are you going to do
go into some sort of free fall?

452
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:55,341
I mean you have to actually settle down
and tell yourself I'm really going to be

453
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:58,980
okay. Well, one of my clients
had a wonderful phrase.

454
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,510
He said that the thing that would help
him the most was that when he got anxious,

455
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,110
he would remind himself.
He would say, okay,

456
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,590
I might get her here but
I'm not going to die.

457
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:16,430
That was his self soothing
and so we find something, uh,

458
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:20,790
what are some of your
suggestions? Okay, well like I
said, you can breathe, you can,

459
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,460
I think you have to start with,
with the,

460
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,520
the novel idea that
it's actually your job.

461
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,760
And I think that's a big beginning
part. It, you know, being,

462
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,890
being able to lean on each other and
being together. Like I said, we're not,

463
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,940
this is not about being a little island,
it's just about,

464
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,970
it's like it stays to be
able to lean on each other,

465
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,760
but you have to be able
to stand on your feet,

466
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,460
especially when you're not agreeing.
You know,

467
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:49,650
you can't lean on somebody else while,

468
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,710
while they're agitated or
holding their position.

469
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,850
So you can breathe,
you can talk yourself down,

470
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:02,310
you can take breaks, you can say,
hold on, I'm just getting flooded.

471
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,240
I'm going to step out.

472
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:07,870
I'm not suggesting that you
come back two days later. Um,

473
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,620
you know what I'm saying? Just five
minutes. Quiet your brain down.

474
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,280
So it really is an experiment.
Uh,

475
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,630
sometimes there are issues that
are so hot to deal with that you,

476
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:17,970
you pick them up tomorrow.

477
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,523
Okay,

478
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,200
that's great.
Um,

479
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:27,300
did you want to ask a question and we
have stories of questions right here.

480
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,223
Okay.

481
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,650
I'm going to read the Dory questions and
feel free to add as many as you would

482
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:41,630
like.
And there it is anonymous.

483
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:47,950
So the first question we have is how to
convince your partner to go to couple's

484
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:52,720
therapy and is it helpful to do it alone?
Great.

485
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,080
I love that question.

486
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,670
You can't convince or persuade
someone to do something that they're

487
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:03,170
uncomfortable with. You can ask.
It's actually your job to ask.

488
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,480
I mean, nobody is going to advocate
for you except you. But you know,

489
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:12,260
there are reasons people don't want to
go to couple's therapy. They, you know,

490
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:15,770
they think it's a first step
toward divorce. They're fearful.

491
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,780
They think that, um, things
were fine. They are, uh,

492
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:25,070
what's, you know, don't walk the
boat, um, or the, or the or, you know,

493
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:29,270
or they just don't believe in
it. And so I, it's, it's this,

494
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:32,660
it's the one to tango principal.
If there's something important to you,

495
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,880
go on your own.
Take the lead.

496
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:39,590
I do work with some people by
themselves without their partner. Uh,

497
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:42,980
and so a good couple of
therapists will actually help you,

498
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,840
not just take your side. It's not that
helpful means it's lovely. But if you,

499
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:50,840
if you're talking about
nonsense in your relationship,

500
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,560
you actually have had somebody
who, who can, you know,

501
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,030
not just commiserate with you but
actually help you take charge of yourself.

502
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,100
So, you know, I think sometimes
what people, I, it's very,

503
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,490
it's kind of a sort of seems obvious.
Uh,

504
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,480
just you can start by saying,
this is really important to me.

505
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,370
Uh,

506
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:18,370
and I'd like you to go at
least try it once and uh,

507
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:23,610
but really go by yourself, go by
yourself. It a lot can happen if he,

508
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:28,220
if you don't just go there to complain,
but you go there to say, like, I did,

509
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,700
you know, saying, oh wait,
I'm as big of a hothead. Oh,

510
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:35,840
here's my contribution to the
difficulty and I want help with that.

511
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,830
What are some of the steps one
can take when they're screaming,

512
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,060
name calling as well as verbal
abuse in the relationship,

513
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,850
but the partner refuses
to stop this behavior.

514
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,240
Or the partner says it will stop if the
partner does such and such a few change.

515
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,890
Okay. Well, all right, so, so if
somebody is screaming and yelling,

516
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,820
I differentiate this from, you know,
where there's physical violence.

517
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:08,210
So let's just take that off of
this off the table. It's just,

518
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,370
it's kind of bevel on it, your house. Um,

519
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,580
I think the surprising thing is
for you to be able to remain calm.

520
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,160
I learned this from my
son's kindergarten teacher.

521
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,990
The room would be chaotic and
she was a whore. Her voice,

522
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:29,150
she would get really quiet and the
energy in the room would change. Now,

523
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:32,030
if your spouse is off the rails,

524
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,810
the last immune or it could be able
to reason with him or her anyway.

525
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,190
And so I suggest you sit
down and be a witness. Also.

526
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:44,790
You don't have to argue every single
point. I mean, we don't, you know,

527
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:47,700
you don't have to argue.
If somebody is saying the earth is flat,

528
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,040
you don't actually have to say, we'll
actually hear here is his wife's round.

529
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,420
You have to calm down.

530
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,330
You also might want to try
with a really nasty, uh,

531
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,880
spouse, uh, saying, you know,

532
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,363
w

533
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,950
do you, do you actually think I can
hear you when you talk like that?

534
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,170
How about if we sit down?

535
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,280
What did you tell me what it is you
want you to understand or I don't really

536
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:16,770
have any idea why you get so frustrated.

537
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:20,550
Do you have any idea why you
totally lose it? You know,

538
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,500
that you start to become the ambassador
for sanity in a crazy situation.

539
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,450
It's least that's a start.

540
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:29,960
Okay.

541
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,340
Next question.

542
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:36,610
You talked about standing on your own
and taking a position in the same vein.

543
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:42,790
Do you think it's absolutely necessary
to spend time alone explicitly, um,

544
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,490
be single for many years
before being married? Well, I,

545
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,330
I wasn't. Um, and you know,

546
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:55,130
and so I was very young when I got
married and I, I, my sense of self, I,

547
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,600
Oh, I sure thought I was an adult,
but what I had lots of growing to do.

548
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,140
I think that that any coming
in at any phase in your life,

549
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,490
you're still going to meet challenges.

550
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:12,050
That whole list of why is marriage hard
that I talked about in the beginning,

551
00:37:12,051 --> 00:37:16,430
it's still going to be difficult.
You know, you're going to think, oh,

552
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,020
I'm a really saying, well adjusted person.
I can, I can handle just about anything.

553
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:21,591
And then,
you know,

554
00:37:21,591 --> 00:37:26,150
you put yourself in a small space with
somebody and you're going to just see,

555
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,160
we know all the little holes in
your, in, in yourself. You know,

556
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:35,810
this is quote a man. A man can be a fool
and not know it, but not if he's married,

557
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,730
you know, and a woman can be a fool
and not know it unless she's married.

558
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,190
And so,
um,

559
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:48,310
so I think that the more solid
and strong we are as as people,

560
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,670
the better is, but you're still
going to hit the trenches.

561
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:56,480
You still going to have to learn
how you live with this person when,

562
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,680
when agreeing to disagree,
it does not solve every problem.

563
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,063
Okay.

564
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,590
This next question is great.

565
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,520
Any advice for single people trying to
find or choose a partner and wanting to

566
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:15,820
make that relationship work?
Okay. Yeah. Well, you know,

567
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,510
it's the same as anyone.
Even a relationship.

568
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,630
Okay.

569
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,400
Be Clear about what you want.

570
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,780
Know as much about yourself
and be willing to be brave,

571
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:31,700
be willing to reveal yourself. I
have, I have clients who come in 20,

572
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,420
30 years down the line and,

573
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,000
and they've hidden so
many parts of themselves,

574
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:41,800
but they feel strangled and you know,
and so,

575
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,880
so the, the, the thing of when
you're looking for a relationship,

576
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,510
find somebody who's curious.

577
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,690
Find somebody who wants
to take an adventure. But,

578
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,120
but if it isn't going to
be a lark with anyone,

579
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:58,000
it's just not going to be
a walk in the park. But,

580
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:03,190
but somebody who's willing to laugh,
explore,

581
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:08,230
grow, um, you know, it's,
it, it, it's, it's, it helps.

582
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,413
And it's,

583
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,940
I appreciate what you said just
about knowing yourself because yeah,

584
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,900
it seems like no matter what,

585
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,350
how much you, you in, uh,

586
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,540
investigate the person or interview the
person or try to analyze the person.

587
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:33,330
It's always comes down to that when you
are on your side, that's to it. I mean,

588
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:36,850
it really is. You know, you can't, uh,

589
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,680
if you don't know what you want
and who you are and what you think,

590
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:45,340
if you have no connection to
your inner most reliable witness,

591
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,190
you're just going to be moving about and,

592
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,150
and you're not going to actually
be able to, to, to have it,

593
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,690
have your relationship go in
any direction. And so, you know,

594
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:59,980
it's not for sissies is what
say, you know, people say,
but longterm relationships.

595
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,510
Very true. And this one, this question is
about long distance relationships. Okay.

596
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:09,940
How would one approach this when a couple
is in a long distance relationship and

597
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:13,790
what are your thoughts on each
partner seeing a separate therapist?

598
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,120
Um, you know, so, so this may sound
like a kind of a jokey answer,

599
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,320
but therapy can be one of the worst
things you could do for your marriage.

600
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:27,220
I mean, there's statistics about
it, so it doesn't mean don't do it,

601
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:32,350
it's just that you will sometimes have,
you will, you therapists will take sides.

602
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,460
Um, you know, you're, you've got
two people. If you're focusing,

603
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:38,590
if you're doing relationship work,

604
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,120
not just in a work in a
work is a different thing
when you're doing it with an

605
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:45,790
individual therapy.
When you're doing relationship work.

606
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,900
I've actually worked with people where
someone flies in and I see them for,

607
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:54,880
you know, two or three hours and maybe
a couple of times in a short time.

608
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,620
And then we, and then they go back
and they do their own work that,

609
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,330
that in a long distance relationship,
some of the pressure is off. You know,

610
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:07,840
in the beginning I showed this cartoon
that was the definition of marriage is

611
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:11,080
two people in a row boat and they're
rowing in opposite directions.

612
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,600
So that's some of the stuff
that happens when you're,

613
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,950
when you're living together,
things heat up. But you know,

614
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,230
if you, um, you know, but, but
it's the same I suppose, you know,

615
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,730
any work, any, anytime
that you're together,

616
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,270
pay attention to yourself what
you want, you know, don't,

617
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,210
don't shy away from challenging things.

618
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,190
When you mentioned that therapy

619
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,630
isn't necessarily the best thing,

620
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,500
it reminded me of what you told us at
lunch that you had a therapist and a

621
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:39,970
recommended,

622
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,610
but something that wasn't, my therapist
said, oh, your husband and you know,

623
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:47,200
you're so frustrated, he's really
never going to to, you know,

624
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,860
really take a hold and, and grow. You
really should, you know, just move on.

625
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,480
Which was stunning. And,
and, and I actually stopped
that therapy pretty quickly,

626
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,390
uh, realizing that, you know,

627
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,540
I would've much rather somebody said,

628
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,890
you know what I what I'm saying to people,
well this is challenging. You know,

629
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,850
fast new seat belts. You don't
put on your work boots, get going,

630
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:15,650
see where you can go. It wasn't that
my husband was immune to change,

631
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,060
it just was, she used to come to, I'm
more content with things as they were.

632
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:25,061
So I came in with these ideas
for how to have it go better and,

633
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,110
and you know, and at this point he, he
would, he would not argue that this,

634
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,450
that our relationship is, you know, much,

635
00:42:32,451 --> 00:42:35,690
much better because we
both basically grew up.

636
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,880
And that leaves me to a question
of how does one choose a therapist?

637
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:44,440
Because if you have a
therapist that is quick to say,

638
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,700
yeah, this isn't working out, you
guys should just get divorced.

639
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,850
I don't think you should allow
anyone to tell you to get divorced.

640
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,300
Remember what I said about
marriage being a choice.

641
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,830
You can stay with this
partner or you can leave,

642
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,430
but if you're going to stay,
you have two choices.

643
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:09,120
You can figure out what you're going to
do with yourself or you can allow that

644
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:11,290
person to drive you completely nuts.

645
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:16,590
And this business of figuring out what
to do with yourself is really pretty

646
00:43:16,901 --> 00:43:20,110
extraordinary. There were a lot
of things we call, you know,

647
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:22,360
it's not just we calm down,

648
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,860
but I later in the book I
have a thing about what, what,

649
00:43:26,861 --> 00:43:29,590
what some people discovered to be changed.

650
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,360
Like one person said to his wife is
just a busy person moving around,

651
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,760
always drove him really crazy.

652
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,870
And then you realize it's a little
bit like living near train tracks,

653
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:46,230
but people eventually stop hearing the
train and he's just stopped focusing on,

654
00:43:46,451 --> 00:43:48,100
she was always running
around and doing stuff.

655
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:52,570
He figured out how to regulate his own
state and be peaceful in the midst of all

656
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:55,630
of her people coming and going and
calling, you know, so, so, you know,

657
00:43:55,631 --> 00:44:00,130
rather than I need to be with you, you
need to slow down. He figured out how,

658
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,580
how to just maintain his
own shaping the context.

659
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,050
Next question,
how to get,

660
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:13,110
how to agree or to disagree
on parenting issues.

661
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,440
How we approach parenting if we are
coming from very different places.

662
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,430
This one, you know, I
could write an entire book.

663
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:26,230
This one is not a quick answer because
it's one of those things that you can't

664
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,790
have two philosophies.

665
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,680
You can't say we're never going to spank
the kids and somebody going to spank

666
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:35,520
the kids were, or you're never going
to do timeout or you're going to do,

667
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:39,000
you know? And so I think,
you know, I, I can't,

668
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:41,820
I can't actually give
this one a quick answer,

669
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:46,850
but it actually I think comes down to
needing to collaborate in some way but

670
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:53,181
more to be persuasive in terms of uh,

671
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,070
the seat. Okay. When you have to,

672
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,160
when you have two things and you're
only going to have one outcome,

673
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,290
the only way you're going to get anywhere
is it somebody is going to have to

674
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:08,910
yield, somebody is going to have to be
generous. They're going to have to say,

675
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,640
all right,
this is not my first choice.

676
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,440
But from a solid and strong place,
we'll do what you want.

677
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:21,330
We can't compromise. You can't
have, you know, half a time out.

678
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:26,750
You can't have one parent saying we
have no sugar in the house and the other

679
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:30,570
one, you know, feeding the
kid sugar. So or screen time.

680
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:34,380
I mean these issues you have to, it's,
it's, it's, it's sorta like this,

681
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,980
you're going to even move over here or
you're going to move over there and how

682
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:41,790
you do it I think does it
requires sense of self.

683
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,680
Don't expect these conversations that
happen quickly. Hang in there with it,

684
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,860
see if you can both come from the most
curious and generous places in yourself.

685
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,060
Thank you.
There are a couple more here.

686
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,610
How amplified is the,

687
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:05,250
it takes one to tango message when
one of the partners can't change much.

688
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,250
For example, Asperger's. Okay.

689
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:12,480
So I do work with couples like that and,
and um,

690
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,720
and so here's the,
here's the piece that,

691
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:21,170
that if the Asperger's person actually
work igniters is that there may be ways

692
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:27,381
that he or she isn't going to change
but can acknowledge that it drives their

693
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:31,260
spouse nuts.
That's one thing.

694
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:36,530
And then for the other spouse to give up
all hope of this person being different

695
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,633
and to,

696
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,710
and to make your own moves
and think your own thoughts.

697
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,600
You know, I work with one
couple where the guy would,

698
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,290
would be,

699
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:54,290
would begin every you'll
begin every answer or every
piece of a conversation was

700
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:59,400
begun with the word no. And he
eventually stopped, you know, she'd say,

701
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,210
I'd like to go to the moon. And
he'd say, no, I think, you know,

702
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:07,410
Pluto would be better. But every no is the
beginning of, so she eventually got to,

703
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,500
I can just ignore that word and I can,
you know,

704
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:13,380
I can listen and he big
and he actually did change.

705
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,160
I think people actually can
change or be not everything,

706
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:21,270
but I don't put a ceiling over
what's possible for people.

707
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,150
But I think you know,
you pick this person,

708
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:28,890
you know somewhat of what you're getting
and what you're not getting and you

709
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:31,990
have to figure out how to make
yourself happy in that context.

710
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:33,530
Okay.

711
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:36,650
Have you ever seen the technique you
describe work on a marriage that has

712
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:37,910
already failed,

713
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,110
where the partners are divorced
and separated or separated?

714
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,010
At which point,
um,

715
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:47,480
would you recommend as a professional
with experience giving up?

716
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,490
Okay. Well, if it's already
failed in your already divorced,

717
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:52,290
I mean I have seen people we married,

718
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,330
but I don't think that's
quite what you're asking.

719
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:59,190
So I'm going to answer a question of
like how far gone is too far gone.

720
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,990
Um, I actually in my book
opens with this quote,

721
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,090
it's a Turkish proverb that says,

722
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:10,800
no matter how far you have gone down
the wrong road, you can turn around.

723
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:15,990
So I never give up. Uh, it's not
my job to tell people, you know,

724
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,750
you can do it or you can't do it.
But I never give up.

725
00:48:18,751 --> 00:48:23,670
I never put a ceiling over what's
possible for people. But here's the thing,

726
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,510
marriage is a choice.

727
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,990
If you want to try and make it a go,

728
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:35,030
I say you don't have anything to lose.
Give it your all. See what happens.

729
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:38,180
There is no guarantee as
to how it will come out.

730
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,150
But if you have even one shred of hope,

731
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:46,040
start working on your side of
it and don't and don't give up.

732
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:50,960
You still might not end up married, but
I like people to at least come out of it.

733
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,220
Being able to say, you know, I feel
as if I really did everything I could.

734
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:57,420
Okay.

735
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:02,400
This is our last question.
You mentioned getting, uh,

736
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:07,920
giving up the idea about 50,
50 fairness and working as a team.

737
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,090
How do you then balance day to
day obligations such as parenting,

738
00:49:14,091 --> 00:49:17,840
working without being completely run
down or a bearing? Most of the weight?

739
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:22,190
Well, you know it's tricky because
this is a, this is a common concern,

740
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:26,330
especially for the person who feels like
they're already carrying more weight.

741
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,400
It's not, this is the, the, the Ma this,

742
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:34,970
this idea is not about how you should be
doing all of the cleaning and watching

743
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,750
all the kids and doing, you
know, and it's turning your,

744
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:42,140
turning cartwheels about everything.
It really is about.

745
00:49:42,141 --> 00:49:45,890
So if you're in a situation where
your partner is not doing much,

746
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,330
this is a time where you actually
might need to really step forward.

747
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,770
And instead of saying, you know,
like what's wrong with you?

748
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,930
You might say this would be like what
I would say to somebody in my office.

749
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:05,450
So what do you tell yourself while you're
sitting there reading and your wife is

750
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:08,970
running around doing the dishes,
unloading the dishwasher and, and,

751
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,340
and juggling three children.
Like tell me how that makes sense to you.

752
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,320
And so you know,
you,

753
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:19,310
you want to find yourself in a position
where you're not working on changing

754
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:23,270
your spouse, but that doesn't mean you
know blooming where you're planted.

755
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:26,750
It means you, this is why I said
it's going to take gumption.

756
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,160
You're going to have to move toward
your difficulties and talk about them in

757
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,670
ways that figure out ways to talk
about them that are affective,

758
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,000
that aren't about
changing the other person,

759
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,040
but are really about coming
forward and being yourself. Great.

760
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,100
Thank you so much. Oh, it's
been really a pleasure.
