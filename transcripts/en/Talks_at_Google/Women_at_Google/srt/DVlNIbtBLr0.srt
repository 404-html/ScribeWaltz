1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,403
Started.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,910
So today we're really excited to welcome
for laying flat again and released from

3
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:14,660
being called roommates at Chapel Hill.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,230
They both going on some
very fascinating careers,

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,600
so we're going to set a
lot of records for running.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,910
She's running for Olympic Games now.

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,070
When you bronze medal in one
and just a few weeks ago,

8
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,140
she wants sex leading the American team.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,370
She holds the record for the 3,100 and
500 meter indoors and pretend name 15 k

10
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:32,204
mark racists.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,650
It's fascinating to me personally how
long she's been able to stay on top of her

12
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:40,651
games and so many athletes peak or
only to a single moments works for Nike

13
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:42,630
running and doing digital marketing.

14
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:47,110
And after she graduated and then did a
career change and went to culinary school

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,950
and having our city.
So what am I looking at this Cup book?

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,960
We know that the authors have a
serious chops both and knowing,

17
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:54,460
running and annoying cooking.

18
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,100
So it's no wonder it made the
New York Times bestseller list.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,020
Please welcome Caroline and Elise

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,720
[inaudible].

21
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,040
Thank you so much for
having us here at Google.

22
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,770
It's such an honor to be here for me.
Um,

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,270
I always admire Google as a company
and worked in digital marketing at Nike

24
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,850
Promo is 10 years.
And if I hadn't been working at Nike,

25
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:18,740
I probably would've wanted
to come work at Google.

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,390
So it's awesome to be here and see
what an amazing campus you guys have.

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,290
And today we've been traveling
all over as part of our book tour.

28
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:32,090
We've had the chance to go to some awesome
running cities and speak to runners

29
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,520
and athletes of all
levels. And for us, um,

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,170
this is an opportunity for us to
spread is such an important message to,

31
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,780
to athletes and what we're teaching
people is that there's more to healthy

32
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:44,570
eating and just killed,
killed Jews. It's a,

33
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,860
also health food is a juicy burger and
you want to teach people that help who

34
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,320
doesn't have to be planned in boring.

35
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:54,350
It can be really nourishing and really
flavorful and keep you satisfied so

36
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:58,250
you're not reaching for junk food. So
I'm going to dive into that. But first,

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,550
I know you guys probably want to
hear some stories from Shalane, um,

38
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,210
just since she's just returned
from an incredible race in Rio.

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,780
Yeah. So about a couple of weeks
ago, I ran a little race down in Rio.

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,980
It was an incredible experience.
It was my fourth,

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,120
but I never take it for granted.
Getting to wear a USA across my chest.

42
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:21,450
There's so much pride and
honor behind that. Um,

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,160
and the race itself,

44
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,230
I had high expectations hoping to land
on a podium and wear a nice little

45
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,220
necklace around my neck after the race.
But that didn't happen. I play six,

46
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:36,030
but we had the highest finish for
an American team ever. We went six,

47
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:40,710
seventh and nine, which was
huge. We have the definitely,

48
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,370
I'm a tough challenge. You East
can seem to dominate the distances.

49
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:47,500
So it was quite an
accomplishment for us. Um, uh,

50
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,020
but I did have to overcome a lot of
fear actually for this last race of my

51
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:56,260
Olympic trials, qualifier for the
marathon was in la and it was funny.

52
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,390
Have you run in the heat eat

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,160
before he can pretty taxing

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,470
and arduous. And so I never
run a heat Marin on, um,

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,790
suffer in la at the Olympic trials.

56
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,150
And that's obviously I'm kind of a tough,

57
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,810
tough race because you're trying to make
the Olympic team and you have to finish

58
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,680
top three. And I ended up, um,

59
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,470
having a really hard race in the
final three miles. I barely finished,

60
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,030
but I hung on for third.

61
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,260
And so I created a lot of fear at first
time I'd ever had to receive an IMV

62
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:31,160
after the race. And it kind of scarred
me that experience running and such, um,

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,150
uh,
deprive dehydration state.

64
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:36,580
And you would think at this level I would
know everything. But really I don't.

65
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,850
And um, so I have a lot of fear
going into Rio cause again,

66
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,130
it was going to be a hot and humid race.

67
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,050
So I had to over come a lot of
fear going into that. And, um,

68
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,550
I reached out to a lot of resources
to overcome that fear and, uh, uh,

69
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,200
hydration plan. I relied on my best
friend to help me come up with that.

70
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,420
And then a lot of, um,
research. I went to, um, uh,

71
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,470
Olympic training center and did an,
a hydration analysis.

72
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,950
And then apparently I'm a, they
classified me as an aggressive sweater,

73
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:13,120
so I had to probably drink three times
more than the rest of the athletes out

74
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,520
there, but I was able to do that
and have a successful marathon. Um,

75
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,510
but beyond that, um, you know,
talking about fear, I'm Alisa and I,

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,433
um,

77
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,520
completely made career changes a little
bit and collaborated on this beautiful

78
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:29,320
cookbook.
Then three years ago,

79
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:34,040
the idea started just at my kitchen
table while we're eating a delicious meal

80
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,070
and at least it made some career changes.

81
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:40,300
And I was trying to meet the goal
to make it before the Olympic team.

82
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,110
And we came up basically over this meal,

83
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:47,530
the idea of writing a cookbook and sharing
the knowledge that she gained and how

84
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:50,500
I felt kind of deprived and just,
um,

85
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,930
a burden with my own diet as an athlete.

86
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,580
And I wanted to make sure that
I was feeling properly. And,

87
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,120
um, so that's how it began at least this
year. A little bit more of the story.

88
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,740
It's some things. And so it's been such
an honor for me to write this cookbook,

89
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,200
so we've known each
other for for 16 years.

90
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:11,170
So to get to write a cookbook together
has been a lot of fun with it.

91
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,380
We were college roommates and teammates.
Um,

92
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,620
and then we both have a chance to move
west after graduating from UNC, um,

93
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,410
and then working for Nike
in different capacities.

94
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:24,400
So I worked in a cubicle wall Shalane
Wayne's down below on the fields running

95
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:27,100
laps and I always would look out my
window and wish I was down there on the

96
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:32,080
field too. Um, and anyways,
um, the cookbook came to be,

97
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,600
we hadn't seen each other in a
couple of years and I had been,

98
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,400
I had the chance during my career,
my career in marketing to work abroad.

99
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,460
Um, I worked in Geneva, Switzerland, um,

100
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,160
for not to be named video game company.

101
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,970
And during that time I got really inspired
by the food culture in Switzerland.

102
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,090
My Diet changed drastically when
we moved over there from, um,

103
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,520
and I can suffer it in college.

104
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,680
I suffered from a lot of injuries and I
thought it was a healthy leader and what

105
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:01,100
I had been eating in college that led
to the stress fractures and led to me

106
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,560
suffering from, um, athletic game area.

107
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,380
It went away as soon as I moved to
Switzerland and changing my diet,

108
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,490
my diet changed for meeting white meat,
chicken breasts,

109
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:13,850
a whole roasted chicken and from Veggie
burgers to grass fed ground beef and

110
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:17,510
from processed fake butter
spreads to real butter.

111
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,620
And all these decadent foods that we
had learned to label in our country as

112
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:25,970
unhealthy actually made me healthier and
happier and stronger than ever before.

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,480
And so I had this realization that I had
been depriving myself and these amazing

114
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,730
foods that not only
tasted it tasted great,

115
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:39,731
but we're also helping my body absorb
vitamins and nutrients so much better than

116
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:44,660
what I had been eating, running at a
high level in college. Um, and I decided,

117
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:49,160
decided that I wanted to feel to inspire
other athletes of all levels. And so I,

118
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,790
um,

119
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,450
we moved back to the u s and I went to
study culinary nutrition at a top school

120
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,670
in New York City. And after that, uh,

121
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,060
wasn't really sure what I was going to
do and how I would get my message out to

122
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:03,890
athletes, um, but had the chance to
have dinner together and we reunited.

123
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,420
We hadn't seen each other.
Um,

124
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:09,500
so that night we were talking and sharing
stories from college and catching up

125
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,270
on good times.
Um,

126
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,110
but sooner conversation got more serious
and we talked about how many athletes

127
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:19,010
we had seen suffer at every
level from our own teammates. Um,

128
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,960
in college too.

129
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,180
A lot of young female athletes I'm
suffering due to eating mostly a processed

130
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:26,571
foods,

131
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,630
diets and calorie counting calories
and feeling like they had to follow the

132
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,390
prescription way of eating instead of,

133
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,380
and seeing food just as fuel instead of
seeing it as indulgent nourishment. Um,

134
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,650
and so that night I said to, um, showing,

135
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,660
she told me how she always felt while
she was marathon training, drained and,

136
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,520
and hangry, and she just felt depleted
all the time. And I told her that night,

137
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,740
maybe you just need more
better in your life too.

138
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,550
So we quickly started revamping her diet
and we thought maybe we should write a

139
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,360
cookbook together some day so we can
get this message out to thousands of

140
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:05,520
runners across the country
and athletes. And, um,

141
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,620
I never actually thought we would get
our courage up to write the book, but,

142
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,431
but a whole,

143
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:14,450
a whole year went by with a lot of text
messages back and forth and more dinners

144
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,284
together.

145
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,390
And finally I took my daughter
being born for me to realize like,

146
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:23,680
this is what I need to do.
And I quit all,

147
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,160
put all my other projects to write our
book proposal fulltime and just went for

148
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,580
it. And I tried to channel
channel shall lanes, uh,

149
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,190
energy and competitive edge as must,
as much as possible.

150
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,770
And I poured everything
into our book proposal.

151
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,820
We sent it out not knowing if anyone
would ever want to publish our book.

152
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,960
And we said, well, if nobody
wants to publish it, we'll
publish it ourselves. Um,

153
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,700
so we sent it out to publishers and we
ended up with eight bids for our books.

154
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:53,220
So we got to pick our first
choice publisher, which was, um,

155
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,590
Rodale and they've been,

156
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:59,100
they've done an job of making
them beautiful buck that
we hadn't envisioned and

157
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:02,960
sticking to our nutrition
philosophy, which is, um,

158
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,870
we came to call it indulgent nourishment
and indulgent Martin nourishment. Um,

159
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,060
we want to prove to people
that healthy food can be cool.

160
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:17,061
It doesn't have to be land and you can
eat these amazing foods and hot and use

161
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,230
local seasonal ingredients and top
it with olive oil and olive oil based

162
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,960
dressing or a buttery sauce.
And by eating this way,

163
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:29,130
eating these real foods and fueling
yourself, um, you ended, you're not,

164
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,610
you don't have the cravings anymore for
the job getting the bars and the package

165
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,790
package foods. Um, so we, uh,

166
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,880
are proud to have the first cookbook
for runners that doesn't have calorie

167
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,020
counts or nutrition facts.

168
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,710
And instead we're teaching people to
get back in tune with listening to their

169
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:45,970
bodies needs. And, um,

170
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,680
we've been beyond excited
to buy the amount of media.

171
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:53,630
The media has been really excited about
what gets appeared in runner's world and

172
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:57,330
then women's running magazine and
outside magazine and food and wine.

173
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,470
And we were just a couple of weeks ago
in New York City to be on good morning

174
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:03,330
America.
And Best of all,

175
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:07,560
like we had this really high goal that
people told us we would never achieve,

176
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:09,980
which was to make the New York
Times bestseller list and right.

177
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,620
That's the best, right? We're
going to shoot them the best. Uh,

178
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,860
Shlain is competitive and I channel

179
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,880
porter called heart and soul
into this book and we want, um,

180
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,370
not only to inspire people
to get into the kitchen,

181
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,810
but to inspire people to seek out the
best ingredients that are body to buy

182
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:40,460
local, seasonal food. Um, it's not only
better for the planet and better for you,

183
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,680
it just is more nutrient dense.

184
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:46,820
So it will leave you feeling satisfied
and more energized and not reaching for a

185
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:50,180
sugar fix and not reaching
for a coffee fix all day,

186
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:52,380
which I noticed you guys
have plenty of opportunities.

187
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,710
Not the coffee's bad.
Um,

188
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,760
and as part of that,
um,

189
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,990
we've been trying to show people
improve that dieting doesn't work.

190
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,200
Um,

191
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,200
a lot of people in our country or Yoyo
dieting and every year it's a different

192
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,500
kind of diet, whether that's, um,

193
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,550
a paleo diet or a low fat diet or juicing
or any of these extreme diets in the

194
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,120
end. And the science is there now and we
go into it in the book, but diets just,

195
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,860
they're no fun. They caused your
body to have, um, metabolism swings.

196
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,030
And in the end,

197
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:32,510
a lot of people try these diets and
they don't work and they end up gaining

198
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:36,340
weight. And instead when you
get to eat real food and um,

199
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,330
take the time to get into the kitchen and
cook, you'll feel so much better than,

200
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,450
than ever before.

201
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,100
And one of the things that you tell that's
kind of our most important message is

202
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:52,090
the single greatest thing you can do as
an athlete to improve your performance

203
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:55,480
and your health and is happiness,
is to learn to cook.

204
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,870
And Pete was just showing with us how you
guys have a kitchen here where you can

205
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,160
learn to cook,
which is amazing.

206
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:04,540
So I highly recommend that you take
advantage of the cooking classes here.

207
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,870
Um, people often tell us like, I
don't have time to cook, right?

208
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,790
Have a full time job and I'm training
and I have kids and it Shalane can get

209
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,710
out, go in the kitchen and cook after a
20 mile training run at high altitude and

210
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,280
made homemade sauce and homemade
meatballs in a hurry. Green Salad.

211
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,210
Then I think the rest of us can
to a lot of people think, well,

212
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,090
she must have a private chef with Navarra.

213
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,080
I'm going to hire you.

214
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,460
She's not only cooking for herself,

215
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:37,880
but often going to the training camps
and cooking for all of her teammates too.

216
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,090
Um,
so it's pretty impressive to see that.

217
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,140
I'm a let her talk about some of her
favorite recipes in the book here in a

218
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:49,480
second. But I'm the other, the other
thing I wanted to share about, um,

219
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,560
the good fats.
So we'd really,

220
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,670
all of our recipes are full of flavor
and the reason they're so flavorful is

221
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:58,880
because they're so rich in good,
healthy fats.

222
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,750
And there's been kind of ingrained in
our culture over the years since when we

223
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:06,950
were in high school and college that
fat is bad for you in fat causes heart

224
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:11,300
conditions in fact causes weight gain
when in fact the opposite is true.

225
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:15,770
Fact Prevents Weight Gain Fat,
helps regulate your metabolism,

226
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,640
it helps you feel energized.
It's a great source of energy.

227
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,510
Runners get so focused on protein,
protein, protein, and carbo loading.

228
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,030
And really fat is a
great source of energy.

229
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,140
It helps when you're eating a
salad or veggies or something, um,

230
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,350
hurting and helping you
put fat on top of it.

231
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,260
It helps your body absorb all the
vitamins and nutrients better.

232
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,090
Many vitamins are fat soluble,

233
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:42,140
so you can't get the most out of what the
foods you're eating without having the

234
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:45,490
fat in your diet. And
especially for Google and, um,

235
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,170
employees that is so
important for brain health.

236
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:51,590
So it keeps you smarter and
prevents, um, depression.

237
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:56,570
So anyone who works here probably had
a mom that was cooking good meals with

238
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:59,200
healthy fats as a kid because
that's how you guys got here. Yeah,

239
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,320
it was good for your brain health.
I have a toddler goes to Europe,

240
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:07,250
two years old and she eats is
it, this is incredible, uh,

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,510
way of eating and I know like it's
really good for her brain development.

242
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,090
So especially for kids where
their brains are developing,

243
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:16,640
they need the good fats in their diet.
And that's,

244
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,690
we talk about butter because we love
butter, but it's not just butter. You,

245
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,980
you have a range of fats,

246
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:26,981
you have coconut oil and olive oil and
even fat from really good quality meat

247
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:32,480
sources. So grass fed, ground beef and
aids. And for us, we prefer dark meat,

248
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,670
chicken over white meat
chicken because it's more,

249
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,150
it's got more of the good nourishing
fats in there and also more vitamins and

250
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:41,750
minerals. So, um, there's lots of
sources of great health and fats.

251
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,910
The ones you want to avoid are the ones,

252
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,990
the cheap oils that are in
packaged foods. And, um,

253
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,560
there's a lot of packaged foods out there.
Um,

254
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,810
when I'd see actually people think chips
and cookies, but there's so much more.

255
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,710
It's also that the dressings
and the sauces and all the
quick fixes that we have

256
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,500
in our grocery store to get
dinner on the table faster.

257
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,880
But in our book we teach people how to
make dressings from scratch and sauces

258
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,480
and Pesto and calmness. And when
you're making these foods from scratch,

259
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,310
you're able to use to really good oils.

260
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:12,680
Whereas if you're buying
Hamas in the grocery store,

261
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:14,210
which sounds like a healthy food,

262
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,440
it's often made with cheap
oils and preservatives, which
are great for your body.

263
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,010
Um,

264
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,150
so we really want to inspire people to
get into the kitchen and put on an apron

265
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:25,960
and make it, have fun with
cooking. Um, make it, uh,

266
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,320
activities you do on a Sunday afternoon
to prepare meals for the week and a half

267
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,190
stuff prepared in advance.
Um,

268
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,960
so I'm going to let Shalane share talk
about some of her favorite recipes and how

269
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,890
the one paid, right? That's gain
celebrity status. Um, I guess you can,

270
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,730
if we were to measure a celebrity says
through Instagram, at least one tool.

271
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,830
But um,

272
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:51,880
so these are our superhero and
muffins and as you can see,

273
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:55,180
they look delicious and you can make
him with chocolate chips or not.

274
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,950
I spread the chocolate chips.
Um, so these are great. Really.

275
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,950
See she didn't cause they have some
good butter in it and they also are made

276
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:06,160
with almond flour, which is a little bit
different than your traditional flower.

277
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,260
Um,
so the very satiating.

278
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,940
They stick in my stomach and I feel
like I don't get hungry or hours,

279
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,650
which is great because I don't want
to be running around high ingredients,

280
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,540
at least describes it. Um, so
I'll hobbies for breakfast,

281
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,210
I will have them as a snack.
I'll have him for dessert.

282
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,260
They're stable and people are
cooking these up like crazy.

283
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,760
They're definitely different because
we're tricking people. They taste awesome,

284
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,810
but they've got a Zucchini
and carrots in it too. So, um,

285
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,390
these are for what we
classify as a long Sunday run.

286
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,420
These muffins were designed
for superheroes like you.

287
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,140
They're packed full of veggies in Sweden
with maple syrup instead of refined

288
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:47,170
sugar. In addition, almond
meal and whole grain oats,

289
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:51,160
replacing nutrient strict white
flour user, my goto muffins,

290
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,960
nourishing and sweetly satisfying for an
easy grab and run breakfast and do not

291
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:56,980
fear the butter.

292
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,280
You only got one with healthy fats
is a great way to start your day.

293
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,150
That helps transport important vitamins
throughout your hardworking body will

294
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:07,780
help keep you satisfied
longer. Um, so yeah,

295
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:12,640
I recommend these. These are
huge hit for kids, for husbands,

296
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:17,060
wives, um, for parties.
They're just are nice.

297
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,400
Do you want to talk about some
of the other foods that you love?

298
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,110
Training Therea Burrito?

299
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,190
Um, yeah. Let's see. So I
pretty much primarily, you know,

300
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,290
a lot of them say once you create this
cookbook and you've already tested all of

301
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,340
these recipes and numerous
signs of eating all of them,

302
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,500
it feels like a hundred times each.

303
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:37,870
But I genuinely don't
stray from the cookbook.

304
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,890
I feel like I can rely on this because
they know every ingredient is going to

305
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,840
have is power pack.
I everything I'm putting in my body,

306
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:49,290
it has a purpose and I like knowing
that and I can control that. Um,

307
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,440
I always say in athletics you control
what you can control cause there's a lot

308
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:53,820
of variables that you can't control.

309
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,680
So I try to control what
I'm putting in for fuel. Um,

310
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,650
I'd say another favorite food, um, is
our high altitude vice and meatballs.

311
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,170
These are also a huge fan.

312
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,540
I had 10 teammates go to the Olympics
this summer in Reno and I made these up

313
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,010
probably once a week
for them. Um, and bison,

314
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,560
we eat quite a bit of bison
because it's really rich in iron,

315
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:20,650
which is really important for endurance
athletes because burn an endurance

316
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,400
athlete, especially if I
train at high altitude, um,

317
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,310
I need the red blood cell
production and it gives me energy.

318
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:28,450
It transports the oxygen.
Uh,

319
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,790
so there's thought and stories
behind each one of these recipes.

320
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,830
And on top of being healthy
for me, they're delicious.
Like I created them. So,

321
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,810
um, I think in the past I used to just
eat super bland and boring and I wasn't

322
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:45,690
excited to eat my food and I
just felt like this burden,

323
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,970
like I was describing
and counting calories and
worrying about getting to this

324
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,710
race weight,
which is optimal for performance.

325
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:56,490
And I used to stress about it and now I
feel like I can indulge in these great

326
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:58,680
foods and not have to
worry about my race way.

327
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:03,150
I find it comes naturally now I'm
without all the stress of counting,

328
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,950
I think it was actually counterproductive.
So I'm just hoping that uh,

329
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,010
these recipes can really enhance whatever
goals you have athletically or just

330
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,153
health wise.

331
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,740
A lot of people ask us, we're going to
have some questions, time for questions,

332
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,980
but I'll go ahead and ask the question
then. I know we're going to get asked. Um,

333
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,620
everyone asks us that every
stop, every city, well,

334
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,260
I don't run a hundred miles a week
and I eat these foods. And really, um,

335
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,060
this is if you're not 120,

336
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,540
so a lot of people are like,
Whoa, well I don't run that much.

337
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,580
So it is really applied to me. Can I
really eat that? And the answer is yes,

338
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,560
this is for anyone of any level,

339
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,850
whether you're a marathon is a 12 hour
day at Google or you're chasing after a

340
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:47,990
toddler is you're running.

341
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:51,930
My running is three to five miles and
often with a stroller and not every day.

342
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:54,740
And it really varies. And when
you eat this way, this is,

343
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,410
this is good food for anyone.
When you eat this way,

344
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,650
you're just so satisfied and so energized
that you're gonna want to get out

345
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:03,620
there and do these adventures,
um, at on the one hand.

346
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:07,790
And then just real food isn't real.
Real food doesn't cause weight gain.

347
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,950
It's all the sugars and processed foods.

348
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:14,270
So if you really made a commitment to
sourcing good ingredients and getting in

349
00:20:14,271 --> 00:20:16,970
your kitchen and cooking, then
yes, you can eat this late too.

350
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,680
Okay.

351
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,700
So yeah, if anyone has questions,
we have time for answering.

352
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,900
So we have a mic set up right here
for questions. Please form a line,

353
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:27,734
ask your questions.

354
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,170
MMM.

355
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,210
Actually I have a couple of questions.
Um,

356
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,510
the most important question for me is
like how do you source them, you know,

357
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:42,470
what do you call it? Good food.
Like for example, um, beef. So, uh,

358
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:44,900
I've tried the different kinds
of beef before I owned a,

359
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,270
there's only one source would be
if I had that was really good.

360
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,990
Uh, but that's from Hawaii and
it's really hard to get to.

361
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,980
Yeah, you guys are really less
with access in Seattle state,

362
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,500
incredible ingredients.

363
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,480
So I would really highly recommend getting
to know your farmers that your local

364
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:05,940
farmer's market,
um,

365
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,260
and they find direct from a farmer is
going to give you the best source of the,

366
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,310
um, when you go to the grocery store,
you have the options of the organic,

367
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:19,600
some hiring versus stories like that with
Luke grocery stores will also have the

368
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:23,710
graph said options.
So I always choose the grass fed option,

369
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,730
organic labeling as a bit misleading
because it's gotten to be so mainstream

370
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:30,730
that now you have mass
produced organic foods.

371
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,170
So anytime that you can get your food
closer to the source and in Seattle and

372
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:38,790
have amazing access to local farmer's
markets, that's the best bet.

373
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,430
And you could make a commitment to
go to a farmer's market once a month,

374
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,040
but even if you don't have time
to go to the farmer's market,

375
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,110
a lot of farms will deliver direct.
So even where I live in bend,

376
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:50,944
Oregon,

377
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,750
there's a CSA which is a community
supported agriculture farm share and they

378
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:58,390
will deliver, I don't know if we
will have deliveries direct to here,

379
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:00,340
but in bed he could have um,

380
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,170
produce and meat delivered direct
to your office or into your home,

381
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:06,910
which is an awesome opportunity.

382
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,570
And a lot of food labels
are really like misleading.

383
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,670
You see like grass and
cage free and all of this.

384
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,350
But when you're buying
direct from a farmer,

385
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:17,650
you don't have to stress when you're
getting it from a small local farms there,

386
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,650
they're the ones who are committed to
taking care of their land because they

387
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:23,500
want to be able to pass their
park down in generations.

388
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,920
We have a great source that we
love is pine on ranch in bend,

389
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:33,370
Oregon, just outside of where I live.
And they have a website, um, hi.

390
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,350
Not Ranch and you can order on amazing
ice in and Yak and have it delivered.

391
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,970
Mail lit like ice axes.

392
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,740
Yeah. Yeah. My daughter loves Yak.

393
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,750
My two year old Pine Mountain
Mountain Ranch Moodle

394
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,580
most.
Okay.

395
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,280
Um, I don't want it to you.
Let's just get, we'll ask him,

396
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:08,770
but I do have another question. So you
mentioned the bar could meet the chicken.

397
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:10,430
So what does that mean?
I know

398
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,400
guys, you have the chicken. Um,

399
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:18,430
so when I buy chicken I buy a whole
chicken and I get it from a reputable a

400
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,040
farmer or reputable grocery
store. Um, even like whole foods,

401
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,380
you can buy the whole chicken
and use every part of it.

402
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:27,680
And that's the best way to eat
meat because you get to the chief.

403
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,320
The dark money is the thigh and the late.
Um,

404
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,490
but also I use every part of the
chicken so we don't eat a lot of me,

405
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:37,480
but we definitely have meat every
day and eat it as like as a side.

406
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,400
So we have a lot of vegetables and
the meat is a smaller side dish. Um,

407
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,660
and just it's, you use every part
of it. You can make bone broth,

408
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,960
which is incredibly mineral rich,
nourishing time,

409
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,990
which is great for fall flat fighting
inflammation and for recovery and are

410
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,550
getting,
we're getting into the flu season.

411
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:59,520
So we have a recipe in here for bumper
off and that you can make like a chicken

412
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,360
stew, which is full of ginger and garlic
is really good for boosting your news.

413
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:04,194
Listen.

414
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,250
Um, I also have a question
about the, um, I don't know.

415
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:14,300
I don't know what the fuck out
of people, but um, so there's me,

416
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,260
there's advantages, but we also eat
a lot of a flower and rice, you know,

417
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:21,680
how do you source had those kind of
things like that from Costco or from,

418
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:22,101
you know,

419
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:25,910
a whole foods or wet do just awesome
because we need to use a lot of them.

420
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:27,140
Like on regular basis.

421
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,010
My favorite source for whole
grains is Bob's red mill.

422
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,330
And you can find it at a lot of wills,

423
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,530
even like Safeway or mainstream purchase
where you can find Bob's red mill.

424
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,040
They're based in Oregon and they have,
um,

425
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,180
all kinds of whole grains like
Farro and Kheema. And you can get,

426
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,640
um,
like ground flowers too for making,

427
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:50,360
we have a lot of wholesome treats in our
book and they're made with whole grain

428
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:52,970
flours. Um, rice,

429
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,330
I would say we like to stick
to short grain brown rice.

430
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,590
Brown rice is more nutritious and make
sure arranges for the texture and you can

431
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:03,860
find that in the bulk section
at any health food store

432
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,103
concussion.

433
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,500
So I've been a question about, uh, during
and post workout nutrition. You know,

434
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:15,220
I find that it's really hard obviously
while you're running and then immediately

435
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:16,060
afterwards,
you know,

436
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:18,940
the last thing I want to do after a
long run is still in the kitchen for 20

437
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:23,290
minutes cooking something. Do you pre
mean just food or how do you handle that?

438
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,070
Yeah.

439
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,320
Um, concerning while you're
running. So do you like,

440
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:31,010
do you consume a sports drink or a joke?
I've been using the power bars.

441
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,750
Super happy with it, but yeah. Um,

442
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,910
we have some treats in here that are great
for like while you're running as well

443
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:42,250
as post run. Um, my favorite
that we have our opinion shoes,

444
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,750
which are just a natural, um, but they're
cooked a little bit new, the chewy.

445
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:50,750
So it's like, you know, you see
a lot of those sports gummies,

446
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,100
so replaces the synthetic kind of gummies
and this simple sugars that are not as

447
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:55,934
great for you.

448
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,850
We also have what we call Guinea up
energy bars and they're made of dates and

449
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,810
variety of dried fruit and
um, and that's in it. So,

450
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:10,670
um, gates and nuts are great
for light source to fuel you.

451
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,470
Um, when I'm competing I just drink
a sports drink. And so that's,

452
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,690
uh,
but that's necessary.

453
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:21,050
Like there's times and places where
you're drinking the sports stream.

454
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,860
Otherwise I'm thinking usually like a
coconut water most of the time or just

455
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:28,400
simple water. Um, but
I get you after Ryan,

456
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:31,160
the last thing you want to
do is get in the kitchen. Um,

457
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:34,850
so sometimes I'll try to like prepare a
little bit and maybe half my meal prior.

458
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,200
Um, but right after a run I usually
have, um, our beats movie sounds weird.

459
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,580
It's delicious.

460
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,860
And that really just get something in
immediately because you have kind of a

461
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:46,320
window to kind of refuel and
it'll make it feel a lot better.

462
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:47,910
And if you refuel right away,

463
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,490
you're going to be a little bit more
motivated to get in the kitchen.

464
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,710
So my goto though, once I
get in the kitchen are just
some veggies and scrambled.

465
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:56,100
The egg,
it's really simple.

466
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,270
Um, but yeah, at least you have more. Yes.

467
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,680
If you're not hungry Radtke
rounds you so thirsty as,

468
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,550
and he is a great solution and especially
you're putting other ingredients in

469
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:09,720
there besides fruits and
veggies to balance out all.

470
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,270
You don't want to just
have this big sugar rush.

471
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:15,190
So putting all in veteran there for the
good fat and whole milk yogurt has made

472
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:20,090
me like any good organic
whole milk yogurt. It that
into your smoothies is great.

473
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,380
Awesome.
Thank you.

474
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,370
Hmm.
Huh?

475
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,650
I'm a question you'll be always on carbs.

476
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,170
So on the one hand it's the fuel,

477
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,120
like we do carb loading before a marathon
and I probably during their training

478
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,690
and on the other hand there are a
lot of abuse against carbs like the,

479
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,770
I read the book from fuel method tongue.

480
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:45,510
I'm the big book of enduring sat book,

481
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:48,550
have some extreme views
but it does help a lot.

482
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:51,100
They also have the quick recipe there.

483
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,120
He wholly against human carbs and even
against carb loading before a marathon.

484
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,000
He also recommends things like a grass
fed grass fed beef from local farms.

485
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:06,510
So what's the Obo on light carbs?

486
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,250
If I were to just ask about the
women that I compete against,

487
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:13,330
men like in the Olympics were running
the marathon during this athletes,

488
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,370
none of them are not consuming
carbs. Everyone would be
like car. They need carbs.

489
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:21,330
You need like a gen to
doing endurance events.

490
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:26,320
So that may said it would not do the no
carbs, not really into any trend at all.

491
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:30,880
Like, we just think that what you eat on
a daily basis and weekly basis and then

492
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:34,600
you're training for example is what you
should be fueling basically before the

493
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:39,070
race. So I will add in a little bit
of extra cars the week of the race,

494
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:42,910
but I don't go hog while I don't go and
sit and have like a giant bowl of pasta

495
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:45,850
the night before. I think I would spend
half my racing the importer. Yawn.

496
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,840
You have to like everything in moderation.

497
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,400
Anything extreme is not what we're about.
Everything is all about moderation. Um,

498
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:59,610
so we find that it is important to do
the carpet loading but it's very small.

499
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,580
So like more more of my snacks,

500
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:05,920
snacks throughout the week
we'll be carbo oriented,

501
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,550
but otherwise they eat exactly the
way I would eat through my training.

502
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,750
Do I need to,
uh,

503
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,070
limit carb intake to
loose weight because okay.

504
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,430
No,
that his car,

505
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,120
there's a big difference in the change
process. Carbs and hopefully parts.

506
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,930
So you do want to avoid the process.
Carbs like the bread,

507
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,560
white flour and white sugar and breads
and all the packaged foods out there.

508
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,570
Made with really highly processed carbs
that have no nutrients but the carb,

509
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,150
carbohydrates fees and our books are all
are complex carbs like sweet potatoes

510
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,980
and whole grains and all these things
that are going to be balanced energy

511
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:48,150
versus these unhealthy spices.
Um,

512
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,710
not only because he's not brave
but also lead to weight gain.

513
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,950
But it is good to avoid
the processed carbs.

514
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,833
Okay.

515
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,290
I'm going gonna just,

516
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,830
I'll just full up little bit more on
that specific question again. Carbs.

517
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,330
So he wasn't doing his intellect so you
consume carbs but we'd like not white

518
00:30:12,351 --> 00:30:16,480
carbs. So pastor the buckwheat
pasta and yes. Yeah, yeah.

519
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,570
[inaudible] it out.
Um,

520
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:24,930
so the night before I
run the Boston Marathon.

521
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,340
I mean loading up on this week that too,
cause no,

522
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,610
he's going to explain why it seems to,

523
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:33,240
it's a great source of a carbohydrate
as opposed to like we were talking about

524
00:30:33,241 --> 00:30:36,570
this strip flowers that
really have I no nutrition.

525
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,740
So we pass it. It's kind of
misleading packaging. Um,

526
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
same with wheat bread.
If it says whole wheat Pasta,

527
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:46,980
whole wheat bread on the
outside of the package.

528
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:48,900
If you flip to the back and
look at the actual ingredients,

529
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,500
the first ingredient is just wheat flour.
It's not actually a whole wheat.

530
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,870
So when you're buying red
and one of the first grade,

531
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:58,590
it would be whole wheat flour and I'd
just be loud and there's a lot of other

532
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:03,510
things like that. This lean packaging.
Um, we eat pasta, we're not gluten free,

533
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:06,190
but um, but we don't eat
like a big map of the pasta.

534
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,700
Instead we will have a small serving of
pasta with a lot of sauces and salsas

535
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,680
pack with veggies and meat
and all the good stuff. Um,

536
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,710
and then others good
carbohydrates are runners is um,

537
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,110
grabbing rights or his favorite
is wild rice and we have a,

538
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,720
a wild rice salad in here.
That's amazing.

539
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,010
I'm on Fario or Kheema and there's
lots of other great sources. Um,

540
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,650
but we're not going to
say don't eat pasta.

541
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,570
Yeah, the one thing that's,
what about like, again,

542
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:41,571
we get some [inaudible]
assuming the no yogurt milk

543
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,660
Sherry there. Yes. Yes. The
dairy is pretty hard to digest.

544
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,280
A lot of renters are sensitive to
dairy and sensitive. They can live in.

545
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:56,150
A lot of runners suffer from GI
distress because when you're running,

546
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:59,300
your blood is flowing away from your
digestive system and going to your

547
00:31:59,301 --> 00:32:00,860
hardworking muscles.
Um,

548
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:04,640
so dairy can be very hard to
digest because of how it's
processed in our country.

549
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:09,200
Um, it's very, it's homogenized
and ultra pasteurized.

550
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:11,520
So they're heating it to
these extreme temperatures.

551
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,600
It's killing off all the
good probiotics and enzymes,

552
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,980
which makes it really difficult to
break down the lactose in the dairy.

553
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,360
And so we have,
in our book,

554
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,420
we don't use cream or milk in seven we
use varies that are easier to digest,

555
00:32:25,431 --> 00:32:26,600
like whole milk yogurt,

556
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:30,930
which have probiotics in it and aged
cheeses like Parmesan and they age the

557
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,880
cheese. It has, it has the enzymes
and it's a lot easier to digest.

558
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,170
You also love goat cheese and doesn't
have a lactose that's in Berryville a of

559
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:40,090
people have palms.

560
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,920
So shallow.
You don't drink coffee with milk?

561
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,640
Oh No, I do, but not a lot.

562
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,810
I usually I prefer actually almond milk.
What's the time?

563
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,343
Uh,

564
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,800
you mentioned that you used to count
your calories a lot and like you wouldn't

565
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:04,790
be satisfied with the food,

566
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:08,760
are happy with the food and the answer
is you change it. This diet, not diet,

567
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,650
weight off eating. Yeah. Uh, he helped a
lot and you don't change your diet much.

568
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,390
Can you elaborate more on like how much
you change your eating close to raise or

569
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,260
if you change at all?

570
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,081
Yeah,

571
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:24,081
so like at least helped me realize that
the way our culture and how you grew up,

572
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:27,220
who is in green to have
everything both that.

573
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:31,720
So like in my fridge it would be
low fat yogurt and um, I would have,

574
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,800
you know, fake butters price thinking
this was all healthy. Am I do here I was,

575
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,520
I was thinking I was doing myself that
I was doing a good job taking care of

576
00:33:39,521 --> 00:33:44,020
myself. Um, but it always left me
hungry and not feeling satiated.

577
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,950
I always felt like I was constantly
hungry and just could never feel full.

578
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,730
And there was a reason why.
It's because I was eating all,

579
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:56,590
everything so low fat and a lot of low
fat foods. Just put mom in a lot of sugar.

580
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,690
So out of my body was just burning
it and just ripping through it.

581
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,280
So it was feeling hungry all the time,
which is not fun to run around hungry.

582
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,440
And I have a lot of training.
I run them close to, you know,

583
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,560
sometimes 20 miles a day and that
left me just not in a good place.

584
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:12,730
So I felt like, um, you know,

585
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:17,680
with counting calories and having to
eat all of these kind of landlord foods,

586
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:22,090
I just felt like unmotivated
and uninspired to eat and
uninspired to get in the

587
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:26,500
kitchen and cook and once at
least taught me how to integrate,

588
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:29,860
like making my own salad
dressings was really good oils.

589
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,540
I'm eating chicken the eyes and
said of all the white breasts, um,

590
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,410
having nice buttery sauces on my pasta.

591
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,750
I just started to feel
like it was more indulgent.

592
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,300
I was enjoying my food more and I just
felt like I didn't need to count calories.

593
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:48,610
So it's just my weight was
naturally finding a good
place and I didn't feel like

594
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:51,130
you have to stress about it anymore.
And she told me that she was like,

595
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:55,530
only numbers you should be concerned about
or what your watches reading and what

596
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,420
your splits are for your workouts.
How many miles are running a day.

597
00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:00,290
Worried about those numbers.
Ben,

598
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,100
in the idea of counting
calories and plus on top of it,

599
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,270
I couldn't count calories because all the
foods I was eating more natural foods.

600
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,130
I don't know how many calories
are in each, you know,

601
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,450
I'm an apple unnecessarily.
Every Apple's different.

602
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:16,900
And when you're eating whole
foods, there's no need to
read the nutrition label.

603
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,480
So it just completely opened up.
Um,

604
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,080
my way of looking at food and
it's been like a huge relief.

605
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:28,140
And I have found that here at
age 35 and I feel rejuvenated.

606
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:31,300
And then he, my fourth Olympic team
and that's hard to do at my age.

607
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,960
Not many 35 year old Olympians.
And um,

608
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:38,880
I feel like it's because I've changed
my diet in way, well I should say diet,

609
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,660
my way of eating.

610
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,690
No, I have a follow up to that. So
sometimes when I'm in happy training,

611
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:46,930
I wake up hungry. Like in the
middle night, like four or three.

612
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,940
You have this kind of stuff
or do you change your diet?

613
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,310
When I used to,

614
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,110
I used to always have like a snack by my
bed is I would wake up and it'd be like,

615
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,150
oh my gosh, I'm so hungry.
I can't wait till breakfast.

616
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:58,830
I have to like promise snap right now.

617
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:01,770
So you said literally I'm food on my
nightstand because there's usually like a

618
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:05,800
packaged bar or something.
Um, you know, athletes,

619
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:09,210
it's a bars are always like
pushed at you all the time. Um,

620
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,280
so now I go to bed and I'm full throughout
the night and then I'm ready to eat

621
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:16,710
in the morning.
But I'm not like we've all the nights,

622
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,690
but the hunger pains are
what waking me up, which,

623
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,280
what happened a lot
when I'm cheating heart.

624
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,453
Yeah.

625
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,360
Before I ask my question can
invite you ladies to sit.

626
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:33,310
You've been standing where the rest of us.
Um,

627
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:34,930
so,
uh,

628
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:38,920
I was kinda curious cause there's a lot
of trends out there and one particular

629
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:42,450
one, I have a friend who really
got excited. Soylent. Uh,

630
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,350
what is your take on silent?
So lend,

631
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,000
it's uh, uh, nevermind.

632
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:54,060
I guess if it's a they da is that they're
sourcing a bunch of sugars and fats

633
00:36:56,271 --> 00:37:00,520
from different places and then they put
them in a bottle or a powder. Right?

634
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:03,340
So it's supposed to be pre balanced,
all that stuff.

635
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,800
There's warranty eating.
Then just like the nutrients,

636
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,250
there's the act of eating
and sitting down to a meal.

637
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,520
Part of the community and the social
aspect of eating food and cooking wakes up

638
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:20,180
your digestive system.

639
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,650
There's so much more to you than just
like drinking down nutrients so that those

640
00:37:24,651 --> 00:37:28,190
products scare me. They're also really
highly processed in a lab and they're not,

641
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,060
um, it's not real food. So
yeah, not crazy about that.

642
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,800
I never even heard of it.

643
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,070
Ask a non food question.

644
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,560
Just what a couple of questions to a
[inaudible] about running Moscow. Oh,

645
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,940
my first question was can you comment?
Like what is your opinion on the,

646
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:54,690
there is some amazing work
[inaudible] like what's your in?

647
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,710
Okay,
very.

648
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,340
It's like my boy, I came, you
actually even conceptualize,

649
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:05,460
so he's asked me about the
Olympics and then 10,000 meter,

650
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:09,240
which I am bronze medal from Beijing,
China,

651
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,980
and then 10,000 meters. And
um, but in Rio this summer, um,

652
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,010
there was a woman for Ethiopia who ran
the world record in the race and it was,

653
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:24,630
I couldn't believe my eyes watching her.
It's beyond my comprehension.

654
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,790
I'm Charlene isn't America.

655
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,800
Yeah. Um, and so she ran, um,

656
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,200
half of the race faster than I could run,
like,

657
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,080
so at five k or 5,000 meters,

658
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:40,820
she's ran her first 5,000,

659
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,330
hundred second 5,000 faster
than I've ever run one.

660
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,760
So I can't even conceptualize, um, it
was just an outstanding performance. Um,

661
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,570
unfortunately with athletics,

662
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,340
sometimes what seems
unbelievable is unbelievable. Um,

663
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,730
I don't know what to think
about it, um, just because, uh,

664
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,270
as maybe many of you read over the
summer and there was a lot of, um,

665
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:05,020
doping stories and, um, you know,

666
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:09,670
with Russia being extracted from the
Olympics and not allowed. So it's hard to,

667
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:13,600
it's just hard to know what
is real or not real. However,

668
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,710
I will say there's not many 10,000 meter
races and opportunities to run really

669
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:21,340
fast. So maybe, um, she
really just is that good,

670
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:25,960
but we'll find out. But she
resumed. It was so impressive.

671
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,973
Yes.

672
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,890
And then can we just talk a little bit,
what is next for you

673
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,550
next? Branding wise? Yes.

674
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,620
Um, well I'm taking a nice little
great, um, on this book tour.

675
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:42,230
It's fun to do something different.
I,

676
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,370
my lifestyle is very monastic.
When I'm training for a marathon,

677
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:50,740
it's three months of a lot of dedication.
It's run, eat, sleep, running,

678
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,950
sleep for p, it's very much the same
thing. It's what I call groundhog day.

679
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:58,190
If any of you seen that movie, that's my
life. When I'm training for a marathon,

680
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:00,260
it's not very eventful.
Uh,

681
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:03,920
so it's fun for me to do other
activities and engage with people.

682
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:06,080
I feel like when I come
out of marathon training,

683
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,870
I'm in like shock and I don't know
how to even communicate. It's like,

684
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,440
do I even know English? Like
it's a, it's a little scary.

685
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:17,441
So it's fine to just be inspired by my
running community and the cooking world.

686
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,220
Uh, it, it motivates me to get back
to my training by taking a break.

687
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:27,221
And so probably come December and January
I'll be back at the grind of running a

688
00:40:27,981 --> 00:40:32,060
sleep and I have aspirations.
My,

689
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,870
my love affair with running is a in
Boston. I love the Boston Marathon.

690
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:39,800
I grew up there,
so I may show up in Boston next April.

691
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,430
That may be part of my plan. Um,
but beyond that, I don't know.

692
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:46,970
I'm taking one race at a time. Um, a
lot athletes thinking four year chunks,

693
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:48,470
but right now I'm just going to go

694
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,180
one flight month was that,

695
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,850
so I want to ask about morning rounds
and you may have to luxury not to have to

696
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:55,810
deal with this,
but,

697
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,870
but how do you deal when you're trying
to get a long run it in the morning,

698
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,051
you know,

699
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:02,740
do you wake up at 4:00 AM to eat and
then go back to sleep for a few hours or

700
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,680
um, if I'm just doing chaining.
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Um, yeah.

701
00:41:07,681 --> 00:41:08,670
So I,

702
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,740
I like to eat about 90 minutes
prior to the start over run.

703
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,900
Um,
and I know that,

704
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:20,790
that maybe this is like a luxury
for me because that's my job. Uh,

705
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,670
but so if like for example,
if you were wanting to start your run,

706
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:27,780
what at like 5:00 AM you're saying and
you want it to get in before work or,

707
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,750
or, yeah. Or You'd have family or

708
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,970
three hours at like,
you know, 7:00 AM 609.

709
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,600
I mean, the key is the key in the morning,

710
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:42,490
and this is maybe a little
bit too much information,

711
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:46,510
is to get up and get it moving so that
you're not gonna have any GI issues out

712
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:50,140
on the trail. How did it make a pit stop?
So that's usually what most mentors are.

713
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:53,500
Like, let's get up like an hour
before, so I get some food in,

714
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,710
make sure that you've made your bathroom
stop and you can head out on the trail

715
00:41:56,711 --> 00:41:59,260
on the road and be good to go.
Um,

716
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,650
so I usually get up about
like an hour before,

717
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,970
but sometimes that's hard to do
if it's dark and cold. And, um,

718
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
but usually on the ride to like we're
drive or if I'm going to go run to drive,

719
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,350
um,
or run dry it to go run,

720
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,670
I will take like a smoothie or
one of our superhero muffins and

721
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,610
that kind of right before I get out there.
So yeah,

722
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,440
you don't have time for breakfast.
And I,

723
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,110
I run an early and before my husband
leaves for work in before I start,

724
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:31,260
we're being in. Um, so I don't,

725
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,450
at that hour at 6:00 AM I'm not hungry,

726
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:39,451
so I'll just get up and have some
coconut water mixed with water,

727
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,300
diluted with water and
either coffee or tea.

728
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,510
And I'm like a couple of days
just frozen quick energy.

729
00:42:46,511 --> 00:42:51,130
But a three hour run is different.
Like I know less than that. So, um,

730
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,460
you definitely get some
good quick glucose,

731
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,370
right?
That's the end of our talk.

732
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:00,800
We're going to have a book signing
over at that table over there.

733
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:03,740
There's still some books available for
purchase over here and everybody please

734
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:05,420
give a warm thank you to Shane and Elise.
