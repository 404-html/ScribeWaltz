1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,860
I am here to introduce Lori. Ken Shot
Laurie introduces herself, uh, uh,

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,250
describes herself as an
intellectual Omnivore,

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,460
her undergrad degree from Swarthmore
or in biology and religion.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,750
She got her masters from Harvard Divinity
School and Theological Studies and her

5
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,510
phd from Boston University
was an American studies.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,560
I describe Lori as a personal friend as
well as an all around fascinating person.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,190
She hosts lectures and discussions and
all sorts of topics including but not

8
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:35,280
limited to a politics,
economics, charitable giving,

9
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:37,860
religion and mass incarceration.
Uh,

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,370
the last two being related to our
positions as clerk of the first parish,

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,190
unitarian universalist of
Arlington and coordinator,

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,780
other mass incarceration working group.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,110
Her diverse background gives her an
interesting and informed perspectives and

14
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:52,350
all of these topics today. She's here
to talk a bit about our third book,

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,500
gender inequality in our changing world.
And I'll hand you off to Laurie. Great.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,510
Thank you very much.

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,550
I want to thank all of you for being here,

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,580
particularly Jonathan for inviting me
and Tim for handling the mechanics of

19
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:12,500
making the thing work. Um, and
so just a brief background,

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,740
gender inequality and our changing world
is a brand new textbook. Sociology.

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,460
I'm in a story and more or less as
we said intellectually on before, uh,

22
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:22,950
but I teamed up with a couple
of sociologists to write this.

23
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:27,000
And the reason we did this is because
this sociology of gender or textbooks that

24
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,120
are out there now tend to have been
written in the 1990s when there was this

25
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,820
really sort of triumphalist sort of idea,
that sort of view.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,460
Then it states as the norm, you
know, everybody's headed our way,

27
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,810
Washington consensus,
and they had updated edition since then,

28
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,750
but the fundamental
conceptualization reflects that era.

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,640
And it seemed to us that we live in a
much more diverse and complicated world

30
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,100
than we did there.
The people thought they did in the 1990s.

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,790
And so we teamed up together to,

32
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,060
to try to focus on what's going on with
gender inequality in the contemporary

33
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:57,894
United States,

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,110
but really put it in a
richly international global
context and in an historical

35
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:07,020
context. So we're focusing on the theme
of change. How does things change?

36
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,710
How do things change? What is changing
with changing more quickly, with changing?

37
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,980
We're slowly all of this.
Um,

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,950
it's one of those huge topics that if
I'd realized what I was getting into,

39
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:19,680
I probably would've said no.
But in retrospect,

40
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:24,210
I'm glad I said yes and I'm very
grateful that you are all here today.

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,790
What I'm planning to do
is what I call a flyover.

42
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,310
It's a 450 page book
or something like that.

43
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,410
And I'm going to try to
talk about it in 30 minutes.

44
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,930
So there's no way I can
touch on everything in there,

45
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:38,220
but I'm just giving you a
flyover perspective of what's
in the book and some of

46
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:43,020
the things that I think people might find
interesting. Um, I'm going to ask that.

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,560
Well,

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,910
I'm going this quick speed through
people not comment or question during the

49
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:52,650
slides because several of these I
included in the book because they're so

50
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:54,240
interesting that if I were in a classroom,

51
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,450
I could use them to do 20 or 30 minutes
of conversation right there in the

52
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,010
classroom.
And that's not the goal for,

53
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,480
so it's a please do not be triggered by
the slides into conversation until the

54
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,740
end. And then there will
be time for Q. And. A.

55
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm going to try to keep this very
hard to 30 minutes. Makes Sense.

56
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,470
So the first question is where
is gender inequality? Um,

57
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,010
and they're three different maps and I'm
going to show you that are looking at

58
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,710
gender inequality on a global scale.
Um,

59
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,740
this one is the United Nations has a
gender inequality index and any metric you

60
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:29,380
use,
any index you use has its problems.

61
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,670
Like this one makes Saudi Arabia look
sort of the same as the United States.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,840
And that's because lots and lots of women
in Saudi Arabia go to a university and

63
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,960
get high education because they're
not allowed to do anything else.

64
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,830
There are brothers are allowed to go
work, go for play sports, be with friends,

65
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:48,160
go socialize, whatever. And all the young
women can do is go to the university.

66
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:52,310
So they go to university and that makes
the society looked like it has very good

67
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:55,390
to quality for women with you
measure it just by education.

68
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,490
So clearly we have some
problems with this index,

69
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:01,960
but there are some patterns
here that are real.

70
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,110
Um,
it is true that by many different metrics,

71
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,520
the United States has more gender
inequality than most wealthy democracies.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,810
And the two things, the two places
that are changing most quickly,

73
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,080
our China over the last 60 years and
Latin America over the last 20 years and

74
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:22,840
Latin America is changing very quickly.
Also in terms of economic inequality.

75
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:27,841
It's the only religion of the world in
which economic inequality has decreased

76
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,160
over the last 20 years
rather than increased.

77
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,040
So there's interesting things going
on in both of those countries.

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,240
And in China that's very intentional
that the communist government,

79
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,270
when it came in,
said women hold up half the sky.

80
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,430
They said that girls had
to get primary education,

81
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,050
that employment had to open up to women.

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,270
And it takes a while for these
things to percolate through.

83
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,470
But China's changing very quickly as a
result, partly of intentional policies.

84
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,580
But that's not all that's going on.

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,850
So the next metric that I
would like to offer is, um,

86
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,220
this is gender gaps in life expectancies.

87
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,150
And what are the key distinctions
here that sociologists of gender,

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,990
Gender Studies, people use is between sex
and gender. Sex is what we're born with.

89
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,420
Whatever it is,
whatever complicated is,

90
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:15,421
it's what we're born with related to
reproductive anatomy and everything that

91
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,990
goes along with that.
Gender is what cultures make of that,

92
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:22,720
how cultures put meaning on that.

93
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,580
So six males are more
likely to die at every age.

94
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,600
That's includes prenatally. So you
know, this stuff, this is when,

95
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,240
when nobody knows until
recently, uh, um, what,

96
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,600
what sex they are.
So that has to do with sex.

97
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,780
Gender affects how that happens,

98
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,940
how quickly it happens to
the balance between them.

99
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,070
There are societies in which is not true.

100
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,320
There are societies in
which women die younger.

101
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,450
That's high level of gender inequality.

102
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,560
There are societies in which women live
much longer than men and that is awesome.

103
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,400
Excessively longer than men. And that
is also a form of gender inequality.

104
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,790
So the countries that are marked in red
are the countries where the gender gap

105
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,020
is too long, that men are
being disadvantaged by gender.

106
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,090
And that has a lot to do with violence,
has a lot to do with alcohol,

107
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:14,940
is a lot to do with risk taking behaviors.
Um,

108
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,430
and then the blue countries are where
women are likely dying of gender,

109
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,480
although in a few cases I think it's
because the gap is small because medical

110
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,141
care is really good.

111
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:27,470
It's not like Iceland up there is a
particularly bad country for women,

112
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,100
but that gives you another perspective on
the patterns here of gender inequality.

113
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,380
Here's another perspective on this.
Again,

114
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,450
if we have a natural sex
ratio and, and all, um,

115
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,330
all of this is a little difficult to tell
because what's natural because there's

116
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:52,280
no culture that doesn't have
culture, right? So we're,

117
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:55,220
we're sort of guessing
where the natural state is,

118
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,460
but the natural state seems to be that
about 1.05 boys are born for every girl,

119
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:05,570
of course, we really should say 105
boys for every hundred girls. But, um,

120
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,020
and there are a variety of
countries where that's not true.

121
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,380
So the India,
China,

122
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,470
some other smaller countries have many
more boys per girl than would be average

123
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,960
born would we natural born.
And that's because of sex,
selective abortion. And it,

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,780
um,

125
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,400
the notice that India and China together
and contain about a third of the

126
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,420
world's population.

127
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,190
So when you have those countries
selecting strongly for male births,

128
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,470
that means we have a real
disproportion in the population. Um,

129
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,180
the red countries are where
there's too few girls boys born.

130
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,170
And the reasons for that are
not completely understood,

131
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:49,130
but I believe that at least I'm sure
that at least part of the answer is that

132
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,770
when a woman is stressed during pregnancy,

133
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,780
male fetuses are more likely to miscarry
back to males are more likely to die at

134
00:07:56,781 --> 00:08:00,830
every age. Males are more fragile.
So those countries are countries,

135
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,390
I believe in which women are so often
so stressed during pregnancy that their

136
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:07,880
sons in utero are more likely to die.

137
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,250
So gender inequality affecting both the,
the woman and the next generation.

138
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,400
So those three ways of thinking about
what's the big patterns here. Um,

139
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,210
there are four key causes of gender
inequality that we outline in the book.

140
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,000
And this is where the book
starts. Um, economics,

141
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,390
nearly all societies use gender to
allocate who does what work and to give.

142
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:36,971
And nearly all societies
give men preferential access
and control to economic

143
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:40,220
resources. The degree of that varies
a lot. How that works varies a lot,

144
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,360
but that seems to be very,
very common. Families,

145
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,780
nearly all societies assign the majority
of unpaid family care work to women,

146
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,980
childcare, eldercare cooking and cleaning
and just keeping everybody alive.

147
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,470
It seems to be women's
ultimate responsibility to
keep their families alive.

148
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,960
Control of sexuality,

149
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,500
patrialineal societies or societies where
family membership and inheritance are

150
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,590
trace through the man's lines,
through the father's line.

151
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,020
And the simple frame of that is you, you
get the name of your father's family. Um,

152
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,000
but in,
in patrialineal society,

153
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,010
there are many societies where only
sons inherit from their fathers. Um,

154
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,350
or only fathers can give,

155
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,550
can be quick to their sons and daughters,

156
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,430
but it's called to the fathers
maitre lineal societies.

157
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,260
You had trace inheritance
through your mother's line.

158
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,980
Now this results in very different types
of societies because obviously we all

159
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:40,800
know, given baby, we're
pretty sure who the mom is.

160
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,760
We're not necessarily sure who the
father is and societies that are patriots

161
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:49,380
lineal and consider patrialineal tracing
to be really important half to control

162
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,900
women's sexuality,
their reproductive capacity.

163
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,220
And that means basically all of their
behavior so that there can't be any doubts

164
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,720
about which baby is assigned to which man
and how stringently that's done varies

165
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:03,730
a lot. But there's a
fundamental difference between
patrialineal matria lineal

166
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:04,564
societies.

167
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,390
The vast majority of people have lived
in patrialineal societies and then

168
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,224
violence,

169
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,830
traditional societies worldwide wide
expect the male head of household,

170
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,730
the men who are in charge of the family
and therefore the society to maintain

171
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,140
discipline within the families.
And usually violence is
an acceptable method. Um,

172
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,640
and in addition, nearly everywhere, the
threat of sexual violence constraints,

173
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:32,790
women's lives in a variety of different
ways. A lot we could say about that.

174
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,330
So starting with economics,

175
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,210
the type of economic system that a
society has affects the degree of gender

176
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:44,790
inequality in. And it's not,
you know, tight correlation,

177
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,630
but sociology is always about
loose correlations here.

178
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,630
There's always going to be exceptions to
the rule. Hunting, gathering economies,

179
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,950
you share food.

180
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,130
You can't really own much in the way
anything else because you have to be able

181
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:56,964
to carry it with you.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,290
There isn't much economic inequality to
be head horticultural economies which

183
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,670
use hose and other hand tools but don't
have big plows or domestic animals.

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,200
A big domestic animals tend to have
separate cultures for women and men,

185
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:14,160
they use gender to assign
the work roles very strongly,

186
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,980
but there tends to be a sort of
balance of power between them.

187
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,500
Agricultural and pastoral or hurting
economies tend to be the most unequal.

188
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,250
They tend to have what's called
family economies for the whole family.

189
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,420
Whatever that definition is,
works together to create everybody alive,

190
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:34,560
to create all the things that aren't
necessary and the men of the family are

191
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,950
given control of the
resources that are necessary.

192
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,450
Ownership of the land or the animals,

193
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:42,900
whatever their core resources and
also the right and therefore the

194
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:46,740
responsibility to control the family.
Labor force, I. E. The women and children.

195
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,550
So that's the most unequal type of society
in industrial economies to begin to

196
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:55,720
open up room for individuals
to earn their own incomes,

197
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,240
including for women to
earn their own incomes.

198
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,110
And that makes it possible for women to
have a degree of independence that it's

199
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:05,380
impossible in a family economy. Um, the,

200
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:08,560
this affects of obviously the women
who are earning their own incomes,

201
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,550
but it also fits women who aren't because
they have that possibility available

202
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,290
culturally,
economically.

203
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,620
And so industrialized societies
tend to increase gender equality,

204
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,860
increase the focus on the individual
as the unit of decision making,

205
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,090
knowledge based economies
like the one we're in,

206
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:32,410
especially here in this building.
Um, value, intelligence, expertise,

207
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,310
creativity,

208
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:37,180
social and relationship and emotional
skills and the ability to sit still and

209
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,290
focus and concentrate.

210
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,010
These are all skills that women tend
to have is at least as much as men.

211
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,400
And so in knowledge based economies
there tends to be increased in gender

212
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:50,170
equality,
although as we have seen,

213
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,420
nowhere has become gender
equal, um, in the United States.

214
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,660
Now, if you look at young
adults, age 25 to 29,

215
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,790
37% of the women and 30% of the
men have a bachelor's degree.

216
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,460
So we're really,
she seeing a shift there.

217
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,040
But if you control for education,

218
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,330
then men earn more than women
in every demographic group,

219
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,060
including young singles,
unmarried,

220
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,070
Yo don't have kids that the sort of most
free individuals still men earn more

221
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:25,570
than women if you correlate correct.
For Education.

222
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,580
Two key factors are important
for increasing increasing
gender equality within

223
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,470
families. So again, if we look worldwide,

224
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,450
one of them is women having access to
reproductive health care, contraception,

225
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,980
abortion, maternity care and
not having genital cutting,

226
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,220
particularly in fibrillation. Um,
women's lives. You know, it's,

227
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:50,730
it's just affects so many
things in a woman's life.

228
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,510
If she can control when she's going to
have children and if she has a really

229
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:56,160
good chance of surviving childbirth,

230
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,690
which in some societies CIC is
each time a woman gives birth,

231
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:05,180
she risks dying and her children
risk ending being motherless. Um,

232
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,220
the other key thing is if men bond with
their children and become engaged with

233
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:12,091
their infants,

234
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:15,840
they are much more likely to continue
to care for their children throughout

235
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:19,110
those children's lives. So this is
where we see the sex and gender thing.

236
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:22,980
You know, that, that it really
makes a difference when men,

237
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,510
um,

238
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,510
w w what seen sociologically is that
when men take paternity leave some amount

239
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,190
of time when they're infants or small,

240
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,780
that's long enough to bond with that
child that affects how they behave as

241
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:38,610
fathers for the rest of their lives.

242
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,400
So that requires paid paternity
leave or you know, uh,

243
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,170
generally paid paternity
leave to be available to have
this be really common and

244
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:49,890
policies that overcome social pressures.
So in most countries,

245
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,000
maybe all countries,

246
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,670
there's some degree of stigma
against men who prioritize childcare.

247
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,480
And the countries that have been most
successful in getting men to do this are

248
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:04,280
the ones that create maternity leave
first and then was called parental leave,

249
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,600
which can be taken by either parent,

250
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,900
but they require men to take some amount
of paternity leave dedicated for men

251
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,380
first. And then either parent can take
the parental leave and those societies are

252
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,080
seeing the stats.
I'm sure there's a limit to this,

253
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:22,220
but for each month of paternity leave,
a man takes his,

254
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,050
the mother of his children,
not always his wife, um,

255
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,990
has a 7% increase in earnings in the
future. So this really significant.

256
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,333
Um,

257
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,610
one note here is that women tend to United
States and other advanced countries,

258
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,900
economically advanced countries still
are having huge what's called motherhood

259
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:45,980
penalties. That when a,
when a woman is a mother,

260
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,120
she earns less than,

261
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:51,140
it's less likely to get hired or
promoted really for the rest of her life.

262
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,110
Even if you control for
experience, it's not just, Oh,

263
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,670
she took some time out of the workforce.

264
00:15:55,671 --> 00:16:00,050
She's a little behind in you're
accumulating education and experience.

265
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,890
Even if you control for that,
women still earn less if they are mothers.

266
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,910
Men On the other hand,
more earn war if they are fathers.

267
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,700
And it's not just because
they tend to work more,

268
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:12,530
which some men do when they
have kids, they say, okay,

269
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:15,230
I really need to focus on this.
Even if you control for that,

270
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,380
men tend to earn more if they are fathers
get this fatherhood bonus as long as

271
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,510
they do not. Or there
are two criteria. One,

272
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:27,290
if a man spends significant time
taking care of his own children,

273
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,760
then he doesn't get the fatherhood bonus.

274
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:31,130
Like if he takes that paternity to leave,
probably won't get it.

275
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,150
And if he has brown skin, you have to be
white to get the the, the daddy bonus. Um,

276
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,990
which is related to but not the same
as African American men are much more

277
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:46,550
likely than a white American men to be
equal or close to equal partners around

278
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:47,690
taking care of small children.

279
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,960
So there's a lot of different
factors going on here. Okay.

280
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,210
This is one of my favorite charts.
This is about control of sexuality,

281
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,580
but using it from a small
statistical point of view,

282
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,230
if you look at the percent of people
in a society saying that their society

283
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,150
should accept homosexuality,

284
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,990
there's a strong correlation
with the per capita GDP.

285
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,310
That's a $70,000 there. Zero
down there. And as you can see,

286
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:17,210
there's a pretty strong correlation,
but there's also a lot of diversity.

287
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:19,730
And that diversity I
would argue is cultural.

288
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:25,060
So there are countries are whole regions
that are much more likely to accept

289
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,230
homosexuality than others and then
it then predicted by their GDP.

290
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,690
So these sort of purple dots up there,

291
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:36,290
those are European countries and
they tend to be relatively embracing.

292
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,700
These aren't green dots.

293
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:42,701
Here are Latin American countries which
are poor but also more embracing for

294
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:46,810
their GDP.
These red countries down here,

295
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,180
Subsaharan Africa don't be born
there. Um, if you were gay, um,

296
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,860
and then these are, um, Muslim
majority countries, those orange dots.

297
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,840
This is the United States,

298
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,490
which is pretty tolerant but not nearly
as much as you would think based on its

299
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:06,420
GDP. Statistically. Uh, and the
reason this is so important,

300
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:09,990
it's not just because of what it
means for gay folk in these societies,

301
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,200
but also because what tolerance of
homosexuality means is a belief that

302
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,160
sexuality belongs to the individual.

303
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,390
That in this traditional family
based patrialineal systems,

304
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,690
sexuality belongs to the family.
It is part of reproducing,

305
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,200
reproducing the family.
It is part of creating that labor force.

306
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Women's bodies are very tightly controlled
so that the family has its official

307
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:38,370
integrity, often described
as purity, um, kept intact.

308
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,630
The more a society sees
sexuality as an individual thing,

309
00:18:43,631 --> 00:18:45,180
something about individual choice,

310
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,600
something about individual prep
preference and pleasure and relationship.

311
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,080
But a matter of individual
choice, the more people go, hey,

312
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,470
it's a matter of individual choice. You
can choose who you're going to be with.

313
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,920
Um,
so this is a metric for that.

314
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:03,921
How much is Heidi has moved from seeing
sexuality as a property of the family to

315
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:07,050
seeing sexuality as a property
of the individual. Um,

316
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,110
so it's a very important graph
from that point of view. And again,

317
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:13,830
this is what I mean by Latin American
countries are changing quickly.

318
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,490
Um, violence. Some key things
to know about violence.

319
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,220
Men commit the vast majority of violence,

320
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:26,160
both that what's socially
approved and what's not.

321
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:29,550
And that's about maintaining social order.
It's about defending the community.

322
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,240
There's some evidence that may be the
classic Vikings were an exception to that,

323
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:34,110
that women fought equally.

324
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:37,860
But in the modern world that don't
seem to be any exceptions. Um, and,

325
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:39,860
and very few historically,
um,

326
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,310
men are also much more
likely to die violently. Um,

327
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,870
in 2008, uh, they were about three
times as likely as women. And that's,

328
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,720
that's common. Yeah. The men
worldwide, this is worldwide.

329
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:54,780
Statistics obviously are roughly
give or take a year by year,

330
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,640
three times as likely as
women to die violently.

331
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,340
But violence against girls and women
lie behind many of those other forms of

332
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:05,310
inequality.
That's how you enforce family discipline.

333
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:09,150
That's how you exclude women from the
workplace and from the street. You know,

334
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:12,990
that that's how a lot of
these things happen. Um,

335
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,310
key point violence is not
inevitable. It's not just, Oh,

336
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:19,410
men are going to be violent.
This is back to the sex gender thing.

337
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,610
Because levels of violence vary
enormously between different societies and

338
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:26,250
within one society they
can change quite quickly.

339
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,740
They can also change over the generations.
Those Vikings,

340
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:30,930
those warlike notorious Vikings,

341
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,030
are the ancestors of the modern peaceable
Scandinavians. It's the same gene pool.

342
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,790
So it's not about the jeans.
Um,

343
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,080
and then as of 2011,
violence had decreased,

344
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,810
whether it looks at decades,
centuries or millennia.

345
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,140
And here I highly recommend
Steven Pinker's better
angels of our natures. Why,

346
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,350
why violence has declined. The
book draws a lot on that. Um,

347
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,010
I can do only a little bit with it,
but it's a great book.

348
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,640
And he documented this and then talked
about a variety of reasons why that's

349
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:05,530
true. What's going on in Syria has
caused an increase in violent deaths.

350
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,220
Um,

351
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,940
but it's too soon to tell whether that's
sort of a blip in the grand historical

352
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:12,650
chart or whether it means
some sort of trend. It, it's,

353
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,620
so this is not as true over the decades
now as it was, but you may be going back.

354
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:22,540
I hope so. Um, so this is drawing
again from Steven Pinker's work.

355
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,870
When government is not trusted to provide
security and justice people have what

356
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:31,900
he calls it. I call self
hope, self-help justice.

357
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,430
Where in my society, if somebody
robs my house, I called the police,

358
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:38,830
I say help somebody robbed my house
and they hopefully find who did it.

359
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:42,490
And you know, they take care of it.
Whereas in a traditional society,

360
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:46,630
if somebody steals something from you,
there's no police to call on, right?

361
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:47,680
There's no government to call on.

362
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,970
So you have to be willing to exact
retribution more to the point.

363
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:55,960
You need to have a reputation to exact
retribution so that they won't steal from

364
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:59,650
you in the first place and they won't
beat you up in the first place and they

365
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,130
won't kill you in the first place
so that it's a family level fit.

366
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,660
And that's called honor,

367
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,080
that having that reputation for being
quick to respond to insult is essential

368
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,610
for preservation of groups in societies
where there is no government that can

369
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:19,390
provide protection to families.
So you get this culture of male honor,

370
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:23,170
which gets intertwined with his idea of
female purity, the patrialineal society,

371
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:27,460
family, all of that. In such
societies, girls have little schooling,

372
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,300
women are economically dependent
on their men and their families.

373
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,260
There's high levels of violence within
the families as well as between families,

374
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,260
high death rates, high birth
rates, those need to go together,

375
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,550
high levels of poverty, high risk
of political violence. And war,

376
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,330
all of which reinforces
ineffective government.
There's a spiral going on here.

377
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,600
When girls get educated, things change.
That seems to be one of those levers. Um,

378
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:55,750
so women are able to contribute more
economically if they're more educated.

379
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,620
Families become more economically stable
because there's more people able to do

380
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:04,210
more diverse things. Child mortality
decreases really quickly. Giving women,

381
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,020
giving girls a primary education really
affects the survival rates of their

382
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:12,220
children. Um, birth rates decreased
because families like, Oh, you know,

383
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,420
hopefully my kids will survive so I can
have fewer of them and women have more

384
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:19,530
choice in whether to have children.
So the next education,

385
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,140
the next generation is better educated.
It's healthier, it lives longer,

386
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,510
and the population size stabilizes.

387
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,070
Women have more say in their families and
communities and one of the things they

388
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:33,790
do is use those families and those that,

389
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,670
those families and communities to create
structures that help them keep their

390
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:39,430
kids alive. It seems to be
one of those universal things.

391
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:41,530
If you give women political power,
one of the things,

392
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:45,380
the first thing is they go for
is clean water supplies. Um,

393
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,290
and governments provide
more public services.

394
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,830
It's a little more complicated what
women do in countries like ours in the

395
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,950
United States, but in countries
where you're just on the edge,

396
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,720
women really like clean water.
Um, so public poverty goes down,

397
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,230
public health improves violence,
decreases chances of war,

398
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:06,020
decreases another spiral.
But going a different direction.

399
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,250
Say here's how to encourage girls
schooling in poor countries.

400
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:13,220
And there's a lot of different
parts of this. You need schools,

401
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:17,120
but you also need the, the teachers
and books and Internet access.

402
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,610
Your quality is really important.

403
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,540
There's a lot of places in this world
where people can go to school for several

404
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,180
years and still not really
become literate or numerate.

405
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,770
And when parents see that their
girls are not getting educated,

406
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,420
they're much more likely take the girls
out of school because girls Labor's

407
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,480
always needed at home,

408
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:38,420
always need it and families and the
girl isn't benefiting for the schooling.

409
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,800
Girls are more likely to be withdrawn.
Um,

410
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,730
of course it's good for boys too that
they actually learned something in school.

411
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,180
Um, make girls safe on
the streets and in school.

412
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:50,930
The violence thing provides safe
bathrooms and sanitary supplies.

413
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,450
There are parts of the world,
like Pakistan,

414
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:58,451
a third of the schools have no
bathrooms and no running water.

415
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,770
And when girls go off into the fields
or whatever to relieve themselves

416
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:07,820
privately, they are more likely to get
assaulted. This is particularly a problem.

417
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:11,420
What's girls start menstruating?
Uh, there are places where, um,

418
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,710
pilot studies have just given out
menstrual pads and girls attendance.

419
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,500
Adolescent girls are much more likely
to go to high school if they have

420
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,130
something,

421
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,780
they can be private with
conditional cash transfers.

422
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,010
These are huge in particularly
Brazil and Mexico are best known,

423
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:31,880
but there's lots of countries around the
world that are giving cash transfers to

424
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:35,900
mother's much more than fathers, um,
because they use the money differently.

425
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,860
But to poor families if
they meet certain criteria.

426
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,100
And typically that includes sending
their kids to school and getting basic

427
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:45,080
medical care including immunizations.

428
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,470
And that really increases both
education and the wellbeing of the next

429
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:55,580
generation. Um, but unconditional
cash transfers can work too.

430
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,650
There's been pilots studies
done and think it's in Morocco,

431
00:25:57,651 --> 00:26:01,580
in Malawi where you just give families
a little bit of cash, not very much,

432
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,160
and they're much more likely to send
their daughters to school because they're

433
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,260
pulled away from that edge of survival.

434
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,810
And many families want their
daughters to go to school.

435
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:12,860
They just can't afford it. Um,
reproductive healthcare again,

436
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,390
um,
you know,

437
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,120
mothers being in good shape needs their
daughters are more likely to go to

438
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:20,390
school and focus on disadvantaged
groups that nowadays,

439
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,200
if you look at primary education
and you look at the dominant group,

440
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,630
I think it's every country
or nearly every country,

441
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,590
maybe every country there's gender
parity at the primary level.

442
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,420
The place that we really hurt around
gender parity on the primary level is in

443
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,680
marginalized groups within
countries. Usually ethnic
groups could also be a cast.

444
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,230
That's where you see gender
inequality within the country.

445
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:44,880
So at primary level it gets
more complicated after that.

446
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:50,390
So those are two key things to keep in
mind when we're talking globally focusing

447
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:53,940
on United States,
there's two things I want you to know.

448
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,750
Gender inequality decreased,

449
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,570
decreased by many different
ways between 1970 and 2000.

450
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:03,810
And since then it has leveled out. We see
this map over and over and over again.

451
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,280
And then educational levels,
how much education people have,

452
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:12,960
which sociologists use as a proxy for
social class as a much larger impact on

453
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:17,570
life patterns now than it
did in 1970 or before, um,

454
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,130
or 1980 or before. So
here's one of my graphs, um,

455
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,831
that shows this.

456
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:27,831
So this red line is the frequency of
rape in victim studies where researchers

457
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:33,420
get on the phone and they call households
randomly selected around the country

458
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:37,080
and they say, what crime have you
experienced in the last six months?

459
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,310
And the totally this.
And so if that,

460
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,300
that beginning spot is
1973 of normalized to 100.

461
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,560
And as you see,

462
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,000
the incidence of rate has gone
down by roughly three quarters,

463
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,470
80% since 1973.
Big Change,

464
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,280
but it has more or less
leveled out since 2000. Um,

465
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,290
the dotted line of there is the
incidence of rape as reported to police.

466
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,090
Most rapes are not reported,

467
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,170
but their police reports went up and up
and up during this time period when the

468
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:14,490
rate was actually going down because of
the work to de de de de stigmatize rape,

469
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,240
the women became more likely to
report it men too, but mostly women.

470
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,060
And then since around 1995,

471
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,610
the reports have gone down at roughly
the same incidents as the, um,

472
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,720
what's being done by victim studies.

473
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,820
And then this blue line is the murder
rate during this time period, again,

474
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:35,490
by the same normalization.
And as you see,

475
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:38,040
the murder rate has gone
down by roughly 50%,

476
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:41,640
and there's lots that violence in
general is gone down. Lots of discussion.

477
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:44,460
Nobody's really no consensus
about why that's true,

478
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,210
but the difference between that
and that I would argue as gender,

479
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:52,410
that there is an increasing understanding
that gender equality is good,

480
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:55,170
that women should be able to
say no, you know, uh, that,

481
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,680
that coercion is not a
desirable part of masculinity.

482
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,250
These are all changes that are happening
with gender and that's making that

483
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:05,920
difference, which is a
significant difference. Um,

484
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:12,210
another graph, this is the divorce rate
per thousand people starting in 1870.

485
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,540
This spike is right after World War II.

486
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,880
Lots of people married
in hasting came apart.

487
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,540
This spike is often called
the feminist movement,

488
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,400
but I would say it's more broadly all
the changes of the 1960s which were huge

489
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,180
and couples didn't always change at the
same pace and became much more likely to

490
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:31,920
come apart.
But as you see,

491
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,040
the divorce rate has been coming
down pretty steeply since then.

492
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:39,690
Still high historically speaking. But
that, that's a trend line down, you know.

493
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,290
Um, but if we look more closely
at different economic groups,

494
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,360
it's all among college graduates.

495
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,190
So these three lines are for people
who are not college graduates and they

496
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:54,970
started in the 70s and this is when
they got married and their chance of

497
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:56,380
divorcing within 10 years.

498
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,660
So those who got married in the 70s had
a significantly more higher chance of

499
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:05,700
divorce is they were not
college graduates but, but the,

500
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,590
the difference is much
more now than it was then.

501
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:14,290
And that is the pattern that comes
up in one cluster of statistics after

502
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:17,590
another. Um, here,

503
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,890
this is life expectancies among
Americans since 1900 and as,

504
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,340
um, the, the um,

505
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,500
blue lines are for black folk and white
lines are for white folk and the solid

506
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:35,440
lines are for women and the
dotted lines are for men.

507
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,200
And that will be true in all
graphs of this sort of. Um,

508
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,500
and as you can see in 1900,

509
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,400
the race was the really
big determining thing.

510
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:47,080
We had this small gender gap,

511
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:51,610
which indicates high gender inequality
and race really affected life expectancy

512
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,960
as a century has gone on.
That's somewhat reversed over here.

513
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,270
Ray still has an impact.
Gender has an impact. Um,

514
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,370
the gender gap for blacks is significantly
higher than the gender gap for whites,

515
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:08,170
but gender and race are more
coequal than they were. Um,

516
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:13,450
if we look more narrowly to now to
education, it's really different.

517
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,220
This is for Americans with,

518
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:18,910
with no high school diploma
just since 1990 to 2008.

519
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,460
And this is the line for white men
and that's the line for white women.

520
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,750
And as you can see,

521
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:29,260
life expectancies for white Americans
without a high school diploma had been

522
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:30,460
going down there.

523
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,420
Now basically it's the same as life
expectancies for black Americans without a

524
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:35,254
high school diploma.

525
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,560
And there's a lot of things that are
correlated that since I sent in these

526
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:39,310
slides,

527
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,910
there was a New York Times article
talking about a recent study talking about

528
00:31:42,911 --> 00:31:47,410
levels of suicide and deaths
related to substance addiction,

529
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,540
both alcohol and illegal drugs.

530
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:54,040
There's a lot of despair going on among
less educated people and that's related

531
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:58,600
to all of this. Um, so the
gap for education is huge.

532
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,010
White men with a college degree live 13
years longer than white men without a

533
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:06,850
high school diploma for White Women.
The gap is only 10 and a half years,

534
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:11,410
but that's, that's a
decade, you know. Um, here,

535
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,380
uh, this is one of those things we
could look at a lot, but we want,

536
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:20,490
this is looking at full time earnings
meeting weekly earnings by gender and

537
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:21,040
education.

538
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Since 1980 men's earnings
average decreased unless
they had a bachelor's degree

539
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,180
that these men up there with a bachelor's
degree went up by a quarter in terms

540
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:32,380
of their average earnings,

541
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,640
women's earnings increased unless they
did not have a high school diploma.

542
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,430
So the general trajectory for women
and the general trajectory for men,

543
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:43,970
it's really different here man could
pretty much count on earning more than

544
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:48,320
women in their social world.
Now, not as much likely,

545
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,610
but not as much labor force
participation rates have really changed.

546
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,630
Men had been going down since the 1950s.
Women obviously went up,

547
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,980
but then women have also been
teetering down since around 2000. Um,

548
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,970
some of the reasons for men's decreasing
participation rate are really good.

549
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,730
Yeah.
When men are staying in school longer,

550
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:10,460
they're taking time off to
take care of kids or travel.

551
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,370
They are retiring that in the 1950s,

552
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:18,150
the typical man died before the
retirement age. Now the tickle,

553
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:20,930
but typical man lives past retirement age,

554
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,910
big difference affects the labor force
participation rate. This is good. Um, but,

555
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,330
and they're often in reasonably good
health if they are well educated,

556
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,910
less educated women.
Men However,

557
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:36,080
suffer from very high
levels of unemployment under
employment and incarceration

558
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:41,470
and they often retire or
leave the workforce because
they are in ill ill health

559
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,020
rather than because they're ready
to move on to something else.

560
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:48,850
So it's a very different demographic.
Here's another,

561
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:53,020
if you look at percent of
births to unmarried women,

562
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:56,680
which is getting a lot of
conversation these years, um,

563
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,240
if you look at groups of women who did
not go to college or had some college,

564
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,260
they're real racial differences. But if
you look at women with a college degree,

565
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:09,370
those racial discipline differences
disappear. Um, at this point,

566
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:14,020
black and Hispanic women have the same,
basically the same birth rate,

567
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:17,380
whether or not they are married for,
for white women, there's a difference.

568
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,320
But again, among college graduates,
the differences disappear.

569
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:27,090
Here's looking at those who
have never married by age 40.

570
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,290
And as you can see, there's huge
differences based on race, gender,

571
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:35,190
and education for black men.
Without a high school diploma, it's,

572
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:39,690
well less than half will ever marry by
age 40, which probably means ever. Um,

573
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:44,640
two thirds of Americans say that a man
has to be able to support a family before

574
00:34:44,641 --> 00:34:48,090
he gets married. One third of
Americans think the same of for women.

575
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,880
So that's part of what drives
this gender difference.

576
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,460
Obviously lots more
that can be said there,

577
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:58,620
but this is a graph of the
ages of people when they marry.

578
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,930
And as you can see back at the turn of
the 20th century, it, it was really,

579
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:08,100
um, uh, the, that, um,

580
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,610
gender affected this a lot and now race
affects it more that there's been a

581
00:35:13,771 --> 00:35:18,060
shift in what, what drives this,
what fundamentally drives this,

582
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,580
and this is again related to these ideas
about financial stability that nowadays

583
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,260
most people feel, and this
is all ages, all genders,

584
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:30,870
all race and economic groups,

585
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,460
educational groups feel that they need
to get some sense of financial stability

586
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,090
before they get married. They need
to get themselves professionally.

587
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,970
That was what the college
graduates call it. Just,

588
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:45,690
just some financial stability for folks
who don't have a professional aspiration.

589
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,430
Um, and communities where many men
never achieve financial stability.

590
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,380
They don't get married.
They,

591
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,430
but most people want to have children
in their twenties when it really works

592
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:58,930
well to have children. So
a lot of people are, are,

593
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,350
and women in their
twenties are often saying,

594
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,390
I can handle raising a kid or two
and most of them have a kid or two,

595
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:11,370
not lots. Um, but I can't take on being
financially responsible for a man as well.

596
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,290
So we have huge patterns going on here.
Um,

597
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,520
so that gives you a flavor.

598
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:22,521
What I mean when I say that education is
really affecting our country more than

599
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:27,780
it was, whereas gender inequality
headed is my final question.

600
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,900
There are sort of different possible
answers to this and I don't,

601
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,370
I'm not coming down on anyone's side,

602
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,330
but one theory is that gender equality,

603
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:38,400
we will continue to
increase in United States.

604
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,980
So we have a lot of positive feedback
loops that are just going to keep going.

605
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,080
A knowledge based economy.

606
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,310
Two thirds of women in nearly half of
men say they believe in the social,

607
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:50,310
economic and political
equality of the sexes. Ref.

608
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,890
Roughly half of those people
describe themselves as feminists.

609
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:55,300
The other half don't.
But you know, that's the,

610
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:58,090
they still believe in equality
of the genders. So you know, um,

611
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,090
laws not always followed,

612
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:05,120
but laws prohibit gender discrimination
and they allow it in force.

613
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,760
Say that women have a right to refuse sex
and use contraception at least so far.

614
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,570
Um,
and social tolerance of violence,

615
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,740
particularly sexual violence is
decreasing, has decreased in,

616
00:37:15,741 --> 00:37:17,370
seems to be continued to decrease.

617
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,960
So all of those factors suggest that
gender equality will continue to increase

618
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,840
globally. Nearly all big international
institutions, governments,

619
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:28,561
not all governments.

620
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:33,540
Many governments have realized that
increasing gender equality and women's

621
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:38,541
empowerment seems to be key to creating
stable societies with prosperity,

622
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:42,120
with economic stability, good
economies, lack of violence.

623
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,130
All of this seems to be intertwined.
You know,

624
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:48,210
I'm not saying anything radically new
here. We'll bank will say it too. Um,

625
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,710
and many poor and middle income countries
have started a positive cycle of

626
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:57,270
growth, more education, more women's
employment, increasing health,

627
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,520
women's empowerment, these things, again,

628
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,580
positive feedback cycles
going in a good direction.

629
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,870
There are theories, however, the
gender equality will stagnate.

630
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,560
As I said in the u s metrics
have stagnated since around
2000 women still have

631
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:16,380
primary responsibility for
unpaid family work everywhere.

632
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,040
Even in the most egalitarian countries
like Sweden, the Nordic countries,

633
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:20,874
they're working on it,

634
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,120
but it's still really women's ultimate
responsibility for their families and for

635
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,840
less lucky and prosperous countries.
Um,

636
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,650
ethnic groups that are marginalized or
stigmatized or live in war zones often

637
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:38,080
have really high levels of gender
inequality along with all the other things

638
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:38,770
they are suffering.

639
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:43,770
And it's really hard to break those
cycles for a stigmatized or violence prone

640
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:48,640
areas. Um, so theories
that gender equality,

641
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,130
inequality,
inequality will increase.

642
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,520
Societies tend to become more stagnant
and more intolerant and more full of

643
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:01,600
resentment when economic situation
is either level or falling.

644
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,340
When people have a falling
standard of living,

645
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,460
they often finds feely they'd
need to find someone to blame.

646
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,650
And this can intersect with masculinity,

647
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,390
that if a man feels like
it's his responsibility to
be a breadwinner and to be

648
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:16,330
therefore in control of his
family and he can't do that,

649
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,850
men can become very resentful.

650
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,050
And some men try to shore up their
sense of masculinity by exercising it in

651
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:27,180
other ways. I eat dominating
women and dominating children. Um,

652
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,700
so that is a pattern that has been
seen in many different contexts.

653
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,290
If the United States is headed into a
period of economic decline or some people

654
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,960
in the United States are headed into
a long period of economic decline,

655
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,380
if this pattern has its obvious risks,
um,

656
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,260
and another way plug countries as well,
not just the United States.

657
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,830
And then women tend to suffer more from
men than men from political and economic

658
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:53,230
instability from social disorder and
war. Children's suffer the most, right?

659
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:54,490
Because they're the most vulnerable.

660
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,900
But the more a woman has to
work to keep her family alive,

661
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:03,790
just to subsist subsisting the lesson
or she has, she has for anything else.

662
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,070
Um, and climate change and
environmental stresses,

663
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,800
economic stresses look
like they are increasing.

664
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:16,330
The Pentagon has put out
research suggesting that
there's going to be increasing

665
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:20,380
economic instability, political
instability and military
instability worldwide.

666
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:22,300
So they are preparing for that.
Again,

667
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,060
I don't know if that's
what's going to happen,

668
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:28,360
but it's certainly is a possibility
that environmental stresses will lead to

669
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:29,440
more social stresses,

670
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,560
will lead to more gender inequality
in countries where those cycles,

671
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,760
uh,
can actually reverse.

672
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,960
So thank you very much for the city.

673
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,850
Questions,
comments?

674
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,120
Um,

675
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,120
so the part where women are going at
graduating college now more than men,

676
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,180
how does that track by class and race?

677
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,760
Ah, it's more true for, um,

678
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,060
families that were, the parents did not
go to college. So in elite families,

679
00:41:09,061 --> 00:41:12,540
it's very likely to sit down at all of
the children will go to college no matter

680
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:14,240
what. The small exceptions, not, but,

681
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,550
but families where some people go
to college and some people not.

682
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,060
That's where you really see
the differences that the
girls are more likely to go.

683
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,650
And one of the reasons for
that it is believed is that,

684
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,520
um,
is gender discrimination in the workforce.

685
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,670
That at any given level of education,

686
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,480
the boy or young man
is more likely to get,

687
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,990
get a job and a better paid job
than the woman at that level.

688
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,890
So women have to get more education
or in order to get economic equality.

689
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,810
And then on top of that,

690
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,780
women see themselves as having
primary responsibility for children.

691
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,600
So they really want to get
economic stability. So there's,

692
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,550
there's gender issues
driving the motivations in
families that are less elite,

693
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,420
less privileged.

694
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,830
Uh,

695
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:01,670
when you talked about factors that affect
a family's decision about whether to

696
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:04,520
support their daughters going to school,

697
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,820
you mostly talked about factors
that were internal to the family,

698
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:12,710
the economic situation or the
attitudes towards the girls' education.

699
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,390
Uh, one of the things that's been
surprising from watching the world news,

700
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:18,920
at least for me over the last decade,

701
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,330
is the growth of the belief
of a political cultural.

702
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,860
That I have the right to tell other
families not to send their daughters to

703
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:31,100
school, but that's seen as, um,

704
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,230
a major political plank of a group
like Boko Haram or in Pakistan.

705
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:41,530
And I was curious whether you see that
as being the outgrowth of economic

706
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:48,950
factors or is this something that also
could play into unfortunately one of

707
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:50,660
those last three slides?

708
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,960
Oh, absolutely. Um, the real answer is
very complicated as you can imagine. Um,

709
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,440
and I glossed over it,

710
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:02,240
but that safety issue that a lot
of how the Taliban, Boko Haram,

711
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:07,220
other extremist groups have deterred
parents from sending their kids to school,

712
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,520
particularly their daughters is by making
schools seem threatening that, that,

713
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:13,880
that there may be violence there, there
isn't violence all the time, obviously,

714
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,210
but if you were scared that your
kid is going to get attacked, raped,

715
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,760
killed for going to school,
you're more or less likely to get,

716
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:24,710
send them to school. Um,
and I see the, um, yeah,

717
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,740
Boko Haram literally means
Western knowledge or Western
education is forbidden

718
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:30,770
or is taboo.

719
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,160
And I see those movements is very much
part of a reaction against Western

720
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:42,010
ideology, Western
colonization. Um, and, uh,

721
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:45,740
I'm not justifying it,
but, but saying yes,

722
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:50,741
there's a global debate that's going on
now and one of the places it's playing

723
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:56,300
out is on this dispute on who should
have control over people's bodies,

724
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:58,190
particularly girls and women's bodies.

725
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,020
Should it be the family and community
as it was in traditional societies or

726
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:04,220
should it be the individual?

727
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,410
Most of the world sees the United States
and Europe is saying individuals should

728
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:14,170
have control over their bodies, over
their destinies, over how they dressed,

729
00:44:14,171 --> 00:44:15,050
how they behave,

730
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,440
and the men of Boko Haram and the tempo
and the Taliban see that as a real

731
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,450
threat to them as men,

732
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,480
but also to their whole traditional
society that's based on the group defining

733
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,770
what individuals will do.

734
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,000
So gender is one of the places that
this fundamental argument over who,

735
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,990
where the locus of control
should be is playing out.

736
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,653
Does that help?

737
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,160
So how do you imagine the impact of
the birth gender sex inequality in 15,

738
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:56,180
20 years in China and India and Africa?
Um,

739
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,990
now that those kids that
are maturing into adults,

740
00:44:59,991 --> 00:45:02,540
but the gender equality's all off.

741
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,320
Thank you for asking. That is,
it's not just in the future.

742
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:11,400
It's happening now because this had
been going on as long as people have had

743
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:14,220
access to ultrasounds and
that that's young adults now.

744
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:18,120
And so particularly in China,
India, Vietnam, a few other places,

745
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:23,070
you have really big disparities
and there's real concerns about the

746
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:27,230
militarization that happens when a society
has too many uh, men that they need.

747
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,073
Young men,

748
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:32,370
young men who can't settle into a
family are often pretty hard to control.

749
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,470
Um,
and so and,

750
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:38,010
and particularly in societies
where the sense of membership,

751
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:42,210
the sense of belonging is
still very strongly rooted
in families that, you know,

752
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,940
the China, as I said, it's
changing very quickly.

753
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:49,020
And that was partly because
of the ideological changes
as partly because of the

754
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,530
economic changes driven by industries,
industrialization.

755
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,740
But it isn't like a society
changes instantaneously overnight.

756
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:01,100
And so young men in China now know
that they have really hard odds around

757
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:05,850
getting married. The only ones are going
to, but the lesson lean ones or not.

758
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:10,860
Same thing in India where one of the
things we talk about in the book is issues

759
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:13,740
of rape and we focus on
Indiana in the United States,

760
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,140
but there are a lot of young men in India,
lower status,

761
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:19,110
young men who know that they're never
going to be able to afford to marry.

762
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:23,730
And in a society where marriage is
how you get your value out of life,

763
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:28,020
that can be devastating. So yes, this is
already rippling through these societies.

764
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,850
The key thing that I,

765
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,110
I'm going to take the opportunity to add
is that South Korea used to be in this

766
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:37,380
camp and it is among adults.
It's still is, you know that.

767
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:41,420
But if you go back and look
at the graph now, Jen, it's,

768
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,370
there's some sex selective
abortion going on in South Korea,

769
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,040
but not nearly as much.
Not enough to show up on the map.

770
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,870
And the reason for that it seems is partly
ideological preaching about, you know,

771
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:53,070
gender equality and all of that.

772
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:58,220
But even more the country put in a
strong public pension service for older

773
00:46:58,891 --> 00:47:01,740
adults because in traditional societies,
when you get old,

774
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,170
you need to rely on your
children to keep you alive.

775
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,280
And in traditional societies where only
males can have access to good jobs and

776
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,360
ownership of property,

777
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,790
that means you need to have sons
or you're going to be destitute.

778
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:17,270
And South Korea got access to ultrasounds
and good simple abortion technology at

779
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:22,200
a stage where parents still
depended on their sons to survive.

780
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,980
Industrialized societies, people
tend to want to have one, two,

781
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:30,110
maybe three children, sometimes
zero. And so they were using sex,

782
00:47:30,111 --> 00:47:32,710
selective abortion to make sure
they'd be secure in their old age.

783
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,810
Once the country started putting in
secure what equivalent to social security,

784
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:42,220
the use of sex, selective abortion
went down a lot. That works.

785
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,760
Making it illegal. It doesn't work. It's
illegal in China, it's illegal in India,

786
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,440
it's happening. Um, so that's the key
thing there. And yes, all of this,

787
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,640
those societies are consciously
and intentionally struggling
with these problems.

788
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,180
Do you think that would lead
to war, gender, and inequality,

789
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:00,160
or to greater valuation of women?

790
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:05,430
It can lead to a greater valuation of
women as sexual and reproductive partners,

791
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,860
which tends to lead to more gender
inequality in the broader political and

792
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:11,800
economic realm.

793
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:17,140
China has had an increase in what's
called wife theft or wife capture,

794
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,950
where you grab a woman and go marry her,
uh,

795
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,370
whether or not she was already married,
um,

796
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,170
that that's an extreme
form of gender inequality.

797
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,140
Whether or not she has
consents, obviously, you know,

798
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,410
if it's fun by physical capture and
that's not happening everywhere,

799
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,550
but that is one of the patterns that's
emblematic of what happens when there's a

800
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:41,500
real gender imbalance that women get
valued as sexual and reproductive objects.
