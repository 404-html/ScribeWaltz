1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,680
Really excited to introduce
you to Emily calendar.

2
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:14,560
Emily Emily is a correspondent
on Netflix's to Menuso.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,450
Bill Nye saves the world.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,130
She's a producer and the host of
foxes exploration outer space.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,720
She also covers the space industry as a
writer for tech crunch and has been on

6
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:28,630
the Ted Stage Multiple Times.
Through our work,

7
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:32,650
Emily seeks to explain science
related topics in an easy,

8
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:36,760
digestible and entertaining way to
increase stem literacy and in the general

9
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:40,600
public and to inspire more
women to pursue stem careers.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,820
Please welcome Emily to Google.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,453
Okay.

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,351
All right.

13
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:50,890
So before talking about how you discovered
a passion for space exploration,

14
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:54,190
let's start with why space
exploration is so important.

15
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:57,370
What's your elevator pitch
to skeptical politicians?

16
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,790
Yeah, so it's hard to make an
elevator pitch for this, right?

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,940
I get this question a lot.
It's the most popular question.

18
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:08,750
Usually it's stated as more
of an argument. You know,

19
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:11,840
why are we spending so much money on
space exploration when we have so many

20
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:14,180
problems down here on earth?
Um,

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,810
and I usually skip the traditional
arguments of, uh, you know,

22
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,700
there's thousands of NASA spin offs.

23
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:23,270
There's a lot of great commercialize
technologies we've gotten out of NASA

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,300
research and development. Um,
or the fact that, you know,

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,690
how would you live your life
without a space based technology,

26
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:33,920
without satellites, without gps? Because
I think those arguments are overstated.

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,780
There are there,

28
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:38,210
there said a lot and we've become numb
to them and they haven't convinced

29
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,044
everybody yet.

30
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,260
So instead what I like to start off
with is trying to understand what we're

31
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,420
actually talking about here.
Um,

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,880
how much money is actually spent
on space exploration, right? Uh,

33
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,790
so NASA gets $19 billion a year and
if you think of the federal budget,

34
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,190
the total federal budget as $1,

35
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,100
then NASA allocation of
that dollar is half a penny.

36
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,720
So it's a relatively small piece of
the pie, but it's still $19 billion.

37
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:06,830
That's a lot of money.

38
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,510
We should be able to have a great
justification for spending it on space.

39
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,540
Um, for example, I,

40
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,420
I think Google's earnings last
year were about $20 billion.

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,380
So if Google wanted to, they could
fund the entirety of NASA. Um,

42
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,770
that's a good perspective. Yeah. But
it's still a lot of money, right?

43
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:27,200
So that even out of that $19 billion,

44
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:32,201
half of the money at NASA is spent purely
on science efforts on studying climate

45
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:35,450
change on setting solar,
whether that, you know,

46
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:38,810
the sun emits radiation towards the
earth and that can be very harmful to our

47
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:41,600
national assets in space to gps,
things like that.

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,830
Half of the budget is spent
on education and on aviation.

49
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,400
We often forget about that
second or that first a in Nasa,

50
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,890
the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration,

51
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,930
NASA is doing a ton of work on
developing planes that can be a more fuel

52
00:02:56,931 --> 00:03:00,640
efficient, more cost effective and
fewer emissions, things like that.

53
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,390
So we're really talking about
the other half of NASA's budget,

54
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:08,650
the $8 billion or so spent
on human space exploration,

55
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,760
the traditional rockets they sending
humans to the ISS, going to Mars,

56
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,623
that kind of stuff.

57
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,790
So it's an even smaller piece of an
already small piece of that Pie. Um,

58
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,640
but when I,

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,900
theoretically if I'm talking to a policy
maker and trying to justify that money

60
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:27,190
for space exploration, I like to
talk about the three g's. Gold,

61
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:30,180
glory and God.
And those are often used,

62
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:34,060
the often used as the three justifications
for early European explorers to

63
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:38,290
explore the new world. They were
there incentives, they're motivators.

64
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,860
And for us, I think it's very
similar for space exploration.

65
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:46,180
Those are similar incentives that we
should use for space exploration for gold.

66
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,010
Nearly every resource that we have
here on earth is available and nearly

67
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:54,100
limitless quantities and outer
space, right? And so there's,

68
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,880
there's already a few private companies
working to mine asteroids and harvest

69
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,780
those resources.

70
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:02,350
And there had been prominent entrepreneurs
who have said the first trillionaire

71
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,320
will be made in space.
And if you're a policy maker,

72
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,350
you have to think which nation do you
want to be in control of those resources

73
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,820
ultimately. And then with glory, uh,

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,770
ultimately there will be a flag placed
on Mars. And where do you want that flag?

75
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,400
It'd be from,

76
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,510
because there are many players
in the space industry that
are working to do that.

77
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,440
You know, China and all of
Europe and Russia and India,

78
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:30,250
they have great space programs and one
of them is going to be the first person,

79
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,890
the first nation to land to human on
Mars. And then with God, you know,

80
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,850
with the early European explorers,

81
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:41,290
they felt like they had a moral obligation
to spread Christianity. But with,

82
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,670
with space exploration,

83
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:46,330
I think we can think of that in a
more broader context of culture.

84
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,340
And when there is theoretically,
ultimately a colony on Mars,

85
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,140
what culture do you want them to have?

86
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:54,820
What government do you
want them to set up?

87
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,950
What civil rights do you
want them to implement?

88
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,780
And if you're the first person there,

89
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,070
you have leverage to dictate
how that all plays out. Um,

90
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,630
and then the last justifications that I
give to everyone that I think are even

91
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:12,631
more important is a national security
and the survival of the human race just

92
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:15,380
to, you know, put it lightly. Uh,

93
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,570
because 99.9% of all species that have
ever roamed the earth have gone extinct.

94
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,270
And none of them, to my knowledge,
have had space programs, right?

95
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,070
They didn't have the ability to check the
climate and see how it's changing over

96
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:34,750
time and figure out where in the earth
they should live to avoid extreme

97
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,171
climate.

98
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:39,250
They didn't have the ability to track
asteroids or they certainly didn't have

99
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:42,700
the ability to have the technology to,
uh,

100
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,270
to move an asteroid away from arts path.
Um,

101
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,940
and Elan Musk always uses the analogy,
you know,

102
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,770
setting up a human colony on Mars is like
backing up the human race on a Martian

103
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,604
hard drive.

104
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,600
And I think those above all are some
of the more long term really powerful

105
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,370
justifications for space exploration.

106
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,140
So you've had a, I'm sure you've had a
chance to take their message directly to,

107
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,490
to some political leaders.

108
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,690
Do you find that your argument
is persuasive or does it get a,

109
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:14,410
and that you can break through by framing
it in a different way like you just

110
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:17,740
did or there's some just huge barriers
to understanding that that issue?

111
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,541
Yeah,

112
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:23,340
I think it's hard to understand the
really important justifications like the

113
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,570
survival of the human species because
that's not likely to happen in the next

114
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:30,510
four years. During their
next election, right?

115
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:33,630
They have to think election to
election. They have to get, uh,

116
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,140
their job in the next four
years. And it's hard to, uh,

117
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,170
make decisions based on something that
could potentially happen decades or

118
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:43,410
hundreds of years from now.

119
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,900
So you've had the cup, I'm going to
combine a couple of questions here.

120
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:47,320
You've had,

121
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,320
if you've had a both at NASA
and with a political leader,

122
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,170
what did those two internships earlier
in your career teach you about the

123
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:58,730
workings of Nasa,
a gum or organization?

124
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,480
Politics. Yeah, so this,

125
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,330
this is really interesting. So, um,

126
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:11,010
I have learned from those
experiences that when Nasa,

127
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,070
NASA is often criticized
for being inefficient or
that a lot of their projects

128
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:19,890
run over budget and over schedule.
For example,

129
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,410
eight years ago during
the Bush administration,

130
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:26,130
we were going to the moon through
a program called Constellation,

131
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,350
but for a number of reasons, the
program was over budget, over schedule,

132
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:35,160
and for a number of other reasons,
when Obama came to office,

133
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:37,410
he cancelled the program
and said, you know what? No.

134
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,390
Instead we're going to
go on a journey to Mars.

135
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:43,200
That program was really inefficient.
We're going to do our own thing. Um,

136
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,600
and it speaks to the sort of,
uh,

137
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,220
political instability of a NASA
program over time because when a new

138
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:51,300
administration comes in,

139
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,770
they have their own ideas on what they
want to do with the space program and

140
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:56,604
NASA,

141
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,610
I think it's a lot of unfair criticism
on that because when Congress gives them

142
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:04,540
an engineering challenge, like we, we,

143
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,260
we want to go to Mars in
the next 15 to 20 years.

144
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,410
They want to go back to their desks
and figure it out and find the best

145
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:14,700
technologies to do that.
But then in addition to that
problem, congress is like,

146
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,970
but also the congressman from Alabama
has a factory that builds rocket engines

147
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:23,520
and you need to use his rocket engine
because they want to keep all those people

148
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:27,030
employed. And also the congresswoman
from California, very powerful.

149
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:31,890
Congresswoman wants to have her
rocket assembly line kept in play.

150
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:35,550
And so you have to make the maximum
diameter of the booster of the big rocket.

151
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:40,140
Bayer is going to bring the humans
to Mars B, you know, this big. And,

152
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,063
uh,

153
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,070
then NASA is working under these very
ridiculous restraints on optimizing this

154
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:48,620
already very difficult
engineering problems.

155
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:53,621
So it's no wonder why things ultimately
become over budget and over schedule and

156
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,910
it's to it,

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,120
it sort of speaks to why it's so difficult
to ever implement a program to get to

158
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:00,990
Mars.
Cool.

159
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,540
Want to go run back down to,
uh,

160
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,790
before you got into college because some
of the people watching this will be in

161
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,220
high school and wrestling through
her parents of high schoolers.

162
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:14,210
So you've spoken about not
being surrounded by a lot
of stem role models growing

163
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:17,150
up. How did you make the decision
to pursue a degree in engineering?

164
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:17,984
What led to that?

165
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,520
Yeah,
I,

166
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,340
so I wasn't one of those kids when I
was little that always wanted to be an

167
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:25,530
astronaut.
I liked space,

168
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,350
but it wasn't something
that I was obsessed with.

169
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,620
Like a lot of my peers in
the space industry. Um,

170
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,090
I liked math when I was in high school
and I googled careers that would make a

171
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:40,770
lot of money after college and across
the board, they're all engineering,

172
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,930
right? And so I was like, I liked math.

173
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,040
Engineering uses math and they make
a lot of money. And so I honestly,

174
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:51,180
that is how I chose to go into
engineering. But engineering is hard.

175
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:53,730
It's very time consuming. A lot of
people leave engineering once they start.

176
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:58,731
So what kept me in engineering was
because there are more opportunities for

177
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:03,960
students who pursue stem careers, uh,
and more interesting opportunities,

178
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:07,530
more paid opportunities, more
opportunities to travel. Um,

179
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,600
then I would argue any other, uh,
a major that you could choose.

180
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,580
For example, when I was in stem, I
did as a student, I was 21 years old.

181
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:22,170
I think I wrote the vomit comet.
I did an internship in China.

182
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:26,280
I was paid to do, you know,
speak at conferences and Italy.

183
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,140
Like all of this stuff was,

184
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,400
was things that I was able to do were
things that I was able to do because I was

185
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:36,210
in stem and I didn't see my friends
who are pursuing other majors, uh,

186
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:37,350
able to do things like that.

187
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,290
So maybe drilling down at, I mean,
engineering is such a broad terms.

188
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,910
So let's drill down an
aerospace engineering.

189
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:45,920
So for a student that's never heard that
term before, but her baby is hurting,

190
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:47,710
this curious,
bringing that terminal,

191
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,900
like what does it actually mean
to be an aerospace engineer?

192
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,170
Yeah, so it's, it's Arrow and it
space. So if you go into aerospace,

193
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:58,970
you either like planes, helicopters,
missiles or rockets. Um,

194
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,720
and, uh, the people that
that go into that major,

195
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:07,340
they typically leave and they work at
NASA or they work at one of NASA's primary

196
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:09,110
contractors, uh, for industry.

197
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:12,560
They work at the Boeings or the
north of [inaudible] of the world,

198
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,980
or they work in the really new and
exciting sector of private space. Uh,

199
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,500
and the private space industry like space
x or blue origin and virgin galactic,

200
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,980
um, or they go and serve in the military
at the air force or the navy. Um,

201
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,020
or they work for the Department of
Defense or the CIA or something like that.

202
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,720
Yeah, there's private space industry.
Just to pivot off that w, what,

203
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,990
what effect has that had on aerospace and,

204
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:39,150
and the opportunities to do
new and innovative things?
It's a bit of good thing.

205
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:40,730
Has it been a bad thing?
It's been somewhere in the middle.

206
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,620
Um,

207
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,450
like so touching on what I said before
about the NASA having all of these

208
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,460
restrictions on how to implement the best
solution to this engineering problem a

209
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:52,661
lot,

210
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:57,040
I mean the private sector certainly does
have their own restrictions like making

211
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:01,930
a profit, which is a different type of
restriction, but they don't have the, the,

212
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,980
the, the congressional restrictions
that NASA does so they can innovate in a

213
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:08,620
different way, which I
think is, is really great.

214
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:13,240
And a Elon Musk came up with the
interplanetary transit system recently,

215
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:17,770
which was a really innovative cost
effective approach to go to Mars and is

216
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:21,850
different than a lot of what
NASA had proposed before.

217
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,950
So I think that is disrupting kind of
our approach to innovation in the space

218
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:27,530
industry.

219
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,640
That kind of leads right into
my next question, which is,

220
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:33,680
so the Fox series that you a host
and produce exploration outer space,

221
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:36,110
there was an episode focused on Mars.
So having a,

222
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:39,470
I mean I know there's a lot that goes
into creating an episode like that,

223
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:41,750
that the, that you don't see when
you watch it. Great show by the way.

224
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,640
He strongly recommended,
um, the, uh, what did,

225
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:49,460
what did you learn about how realistic
it is for us to conceive of having any

226
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,490
kind of colony on Mars in our
lifetimes or children's lifetimes?

227
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,160
Yeah,
it's going to be really difficult.

228
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,010
The cost I think is the,

229
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,430
is one of the primary factors of that to
the lowest number I've seen on a round

230
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:06,410
trip mission to Mars for one round
trip mission leading up to all the

231
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,220
technologies you need, um,
is $30 billion. Yeah. Right.

232
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:11,480
And if we're going to go to Maurice,

233
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:14,720
we would probably want to do something
similar that we did with the Apollo

234
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:16,220
program.
You don't want to just go once,

235
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:19,280
you want to go multiple times
and if you're really ambitious,

236
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:21,560
you want to build a colony there.
Um,

237
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,770
but the minimum number of people that you
need to build a genetically stable and

238
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:31,940
healthy colony and a new
area is 40,000 people.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,930
Interesting. Yeah, it's sort of a
rabbit hole I went down recently,

240
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:39,170
like how many people do
actually need so that, you know,

241
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:43,160
it's like not incestuous and
in 40,000 is a lot of people.

242
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,360
That's a lot of trips to Mars.
That's a lot of $30 billion trips to Mars.

243
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,220
So that in itself makes it really,
I don't want to say unrealistic,

244
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:56,540
but a really difficult challenge,
especially when you consider, uh,

245
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,420
the political sustainability
of NASA programs.

246
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,140
I mean there's rumors that with
the incoming Trump administration,

247
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,490
they may want to go back to the moon
and scrap a lot of stuff that we've gone

248
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,100
that we've already built,
uh, to going to Mars.

249
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:15,310
So it's hard to keep on
track to one destination and,

250
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,820
you know, be being able to afford those
trips is, it's just a whole another beast.

251
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,790
So I wanna circle back to something that
you said earlier about the vomit comet.

252
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,520
Um,
I've always wondered this,

253
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,060
I still kind of crocket are you actually
wait lists or is it just feel like

254
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:31,820
you're weightless cause you're
still the gravitational force.

255
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:32,740
Are you high enough?
Like what?

256
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:36,260
What is it as sensation of weightlessness
or is it technically wait lists?

257
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:36,960
I'm old.

258
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,400
Yeah, so you're weightless relative
to the airplane. Got It. Right. So,

259
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:46,401
so the airplane is diving down toward
the ground and you are both in a free

260
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:49,290
fall,
so you're free falling within a plane.

261
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,090
It's kind of like if
you were in an elevator,

262
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,500
they cut the cables and you both
started free falling towards the ground,

263
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,310
you would feel weightless within
the elevator. So that's exactly the,

264
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:02,900
the plane flies and parabolic motion
like this and it's essentially a 10,000

265
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:03,890
foot roller coaster.

266
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,840
And when it's diving toward the ground
and your falling within the aircraft,

267
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,090
that's when you feel about
30 seconds of weightlessness.

268
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,300
Yeah. That, that weightlessness.
If you were in a,

269
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,720
you basically in a constant free
fall and when you're in orbit and it

270
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,760
physiologically different,
in other words,

271
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:20,230
when you're waiting
list the space station,

272
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,680
are there different physiological effects
then when you're in the vomit comet

273
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:24,850
for that little window of time?

274
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,700
It's so it's the same feeling,

275
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:31,680
but the physiological effects I think
become problematic when you're in that

276
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,130
period for a longer period in 30 seconds.

277
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,480
There's a lot of fluid issues,
especially fluid in your brain.

278
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:43,860
They have a lot of vision
impairment issues because
you're the fluid inside your

279
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:47,250
body acts a little bit different under
extended periods of weightlessness.

280
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,690
If you're looking for
gifts for the holidays,

281
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:52,830
vomit comet on my wishlist
or at the head of these days,

282
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,360
low,
low price of 6,000

283
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,710
a little little, little more attainable
than the mission to Mars. Yeah,

284
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,360
that's true. Relative to your cool factor,

285
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,550
you get to work with
Bill Nye the science guy,

286
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,140
probably one of the ultimate science
communicators and a role model for me.

287
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,980
So what can you share about your role
on bill? Nice upcoming Netflix series.

288
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,420
Yeah,

289
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,880
so he has a new show that's going to be
airing on Netflix in the spring called

290
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:21,840
Bill Nye saves the world and I
am one of five correspondence.

291
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,330
So if you imagine what
the daily show was like,

292
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:27,660
they have field court or is like they
have field correspondence that go out and

293
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:29,460
do different stories or segments.

294
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,770
And so I'm one of the correspondence,
Derek Muller of potassium,

295
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:39,660
youtube severity. Tassian he's another
one. Then there's two comedians, uh,

296
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,870
Joanna Hausman and then Nazeem Hussain
who's from Australia and then Karlie

297
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,290
Kloss,

298
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,290
the supermodel slash Victoria secret
model slash advocate for coding.

299
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,160
So yeah, so it's a really
great, smart, funny,

300
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,400
super talented group of people
that I get to work with.

301
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:04,401
And we each have tackled two to three
different stories in different countries

302
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,810
around the world. Uh, and then the show,

303
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,770
we'll be talking about the stories that
we've done and then bill and I will do a

304
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:15,450
lot of experiments and bits and they have
a lot of really amazing guest stars on

305
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,460
the show.
So I think I'm,

306
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:21,780
what I'm really excited about with this
show is that I personally think that it

307
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:26,040
can do what the daily show did
for politics, which was, you know,

308
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:31,041
politics can be confusing and sort of
annoying and sometimes very boring.

309
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,300
And I think science in many ways
can be similar. And I'm hoping that,

310
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,900
and I believe that this show can
do the same thing for science.

311
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,650
Cool. Well, another initiative,

312
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,260
if you didn't know enough on your
plate is you recently announced,

313
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,040
which I picked up just a
couple of days before this,

314
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,180
is that you're working
in a chapter book series,

315
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,950
Simon Kids to bring a love of
science and tech, the girls.

316
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,210
Tell me a little bit about the series
and the first book, Ada lace on the case.

317
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,330
Yeah,
so this is in general,

318
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:05,250
I have this chapter book series that's
meant for third graders and it's called

319
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:05,941
Ada lace,

320
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:10,440
a nod to Ada Lovelace that what many
people consider the first computer

321
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:13,300
programmer. Um, and I,

322
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,070
I wanted to do something like this
because representation in stem is so

323
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:22,071
important and there's not that many books
out there with strong female leads who

324
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,400
have a knack and an interest
in science and technology.

325
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:28,290
So Ada lace is the main character.

326
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,630
She's a third grader with a
knack for science and tech.

327
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:34,920
She loves building gadgets and robots
and she uses her inventions to solve

328
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:36,480
mysteries and solve problems.

329
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,110
Cool.

330
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,200
It sounds like a partners with Goldie
blox would fit into the words there at

331
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:41,790
some point. This very similar, very cool.

332
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,420
Engineering has a reputation of being
one of the harder decrees to tackle.

333
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:46,470
And you mentioned that,
that it's,

334
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,880
it's tough and some people
don't make it through.

335
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:51,480
What advice do you have for surviving
and thriving in an engineering program?

336
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,590
Yeah, so I, I will say that, uh,

337
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,680
when I was younger I didn't consider
myself one of the smart kids.

338
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,740
I was more of a slow learner and I was
very intimidated by the topics of science

339
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:06,380
and engineering and all of that.
And so I get it.

340
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,130
I understand how it's very intimidating
because it was very intimidating to me.

341
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:15,070
But I will remind people that there's
a lot of time in the day, yes.

342
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:20,430
That you can work to make yourself
smarter about on various topics.

343
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,030
We waste a lot of time watching
Netflix and on social media.

344
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:30,980
And so there's a lot of time in the day
to make yourself be better at at certain

345
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:31,341
topics.

346
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:34,460
And I've learned that personally because
I wasn't one of the smart kids and I

347
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:37,670
had kind of tried to work
my way up to becoming one.

348
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:37,941
Yeah,

349
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:40,420
that's actually the follow the next
week you didn't consider yourself one of

350
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:41,021
those markets yet.

351
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:44,250
You got a Ford Auto and in college and
you've got through a very tough part and

352
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,600
then went on to get a
master's degree in a way.

353
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:50,560
Do you think that that maybe it helped
that you didn't have the arrogance of I'm

354
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:53,020
the smart kids and you felt
you had to work really hard or,

355
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,180
no, I, I,

356
00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:00,270
that's hard because confidence can be
really helpful in certain situations.

357
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:02,350
It can make you sure of yourself,

358
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:07,210
but in the same way knowing that you
don't know everything makes you always

359
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:08,140
check your sources,

360
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:11,920
always check your answer and make sure
that you're always studying a little bit

361
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:15,460
harder than maybe you
need to. Uh, so having,

362
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:18,580
being humble about your own
intelligence is probably helpful.

363
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,930
Cool.
Uh,

364
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,850
what's the most common misperception
about engineering that you find yourself

365
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:27,100
correcting other than engineers? Drive
trains. Yeah. He's still here though.

366
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,860
Yeah, that's it. Go on for little kids.

367
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,000
When we go and talk to little kids
about joining stem fields, the,

368
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,850
the narrative that's often told is,
you know, you can be part of, of the,

369
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,490
the generation that shapes the future.
You can build the next Tesla,

370
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,320
you can build the next a rocket.

371
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:49,321
You can do work on iPhones and all of
these tech gadgets that we work with every

372
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:49,570
day.

373
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,570
But I don't often hear the narrative
that you can use these skills to help the

374
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:56,311
world do.

375
00:20:56,311 --> 00:21:00,460
You can use the skills to not just make
it cool and fun and interactive to, to,

376
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,560
uh, you know, virtual
reality and things like that.

377
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:06,190
But you can do it to help people
less fortunate than yourself.

378
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,600
And I like speaking about that side of
engineering engineers without borders,

379
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:15,070
for example, which was something I was
active in when I was an Undergrad. Um,

380
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,100
because I think that speaks really loudly
to kids who want to help the world in

381
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:25,390
some way. And if you can tell them that
stem will give them specialized tools.

382
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:28,140
Did you that I think that can make
it sound really, really interesting.

383
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,490
Well, it's, it's, it's a giving time
of your engineers without borders. Um,

384
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,650
tell me a little bit about that.
I'd actually had heard of that before.

385
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,450
Yeah. Oh, and this is an
incredible organization.

386
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,980
So it's a student run organization,
uh, Thor, I believe it's under,

387
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:43,260
I participated in it
and it as an Undergrad.

388
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,350
So maybe it's also for Grad students,
but you,

389
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,550
you find engineering problems in,
in developing countries or in,

390
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:55,551
in areas that that are in need and you
can apply engineering solutions to them.

391
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,910
So for example,

392
00:21:56,911 --> 00:22:01,911
we sent a group of students to Nicaragua
to build a water filter made out of

393
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:04,590
sand because when it's a,

394
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,620
they always had these really interesting
engineering problems. So this,

395
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:08,880
this village in Nicaragua,

396
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,940
there was a school where
kids were constantly getting
sick because their water

397
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:16,500
was contaminated with fecal matter
with waste, things like that.

398
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:20,410
And the kids were getting really sick and
some of them were dying every year. Um,

399
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:25,610
and you can't just build
the infrastructure for an
elaborate water filtration

400
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,790
system that we have here, right?
That that's unsustainable.

401
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:34,791
So instead we built a water filter made
out of sand because a wet sand has these

402
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,680
wonderfully magical properties that
there's a bio layer that exists on the top

403
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,980
of wet sand that can kill
many types of bacteria,

404
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,780
including fecal matter bacteria.

405
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,040
And if you pour wastewater on
top or contaminated water on top,

406
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,170
it's like just a huge bucket of
sand out the other end comes,

407
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,810
uh, clean water, potable water to
drink, cause the sand itself acts as a,

408
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,930
a mechanical filter.
And then the,

409
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,270
the biolayer on top kills a lot of the
fecal matter bacteria or kills the fecal

410
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:07,104
matter of bacteria.

411
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,041
Very cool.
Well,

412
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,970
I got a few more questions then I'll
open it up to the audience and I'll check

413
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:13,190
the dory. So, um,

414
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,670
you noticed that you noted in a recent
interview that it was once you get to

415
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:20,570
college, you kind of looked around
and were, where are all the girls?

416
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,920
What are your strategies,

417
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,230
what were your strategies for
success in that environment?

418
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:26,570
And then I'll pivot to more
what we can do about it.

419
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,870
But first what we just strategies for
getting through and graduating and not

420
00:23:29,871 --> 00:23:31,370
being one of the statistics.
It didn't,

421
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,370
yeah, I, you know,

422
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:37,060
I don't know that I have a lot of
good advice for that because it's,

423
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:40,990
it's not easy and it's,
it's a little bit uncomfortable.

424
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:44,230
I always try to turn the situation
on my guy friends and imagine,

425
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,430
you know what if you
had no preconceptions,

426
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,250
preconceptions about engineering
before you got there,

427
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:53,750
and then when you got into your first
class, it was filled with all girls.

428
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:56,270
It was a total girl club
and you're the only guy.

429
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,090
It would be kind of off putting it, make
you feel a little bit uncomfortable. Um,

430
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,090
but if you really like the
topic, you, you deal with it,

431
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:08,570
you cope with it and you become like what?
I became a guy's girl.

432
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,500
All of my friends were guys.
Um,

433
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:15,500
I would tell other girls to make sure
that they are making in sustaining strong

434
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:19,640
female friendships because those are
absolutely necessary through life.

435
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,880
And they are hard to make
if you're pursuing stem.

436
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:27,380
So you have to be more proactive
about it then, um, then maybe your,

437
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:30,490
your male peers. Um, but for me, that's,

438
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:35,420
that's been one of the ways that I've
remained sane through my career. Um,

439
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,740
and it's absolutely necessary.

440
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,180
Cool. Well, on the positive side,

441
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:41,870
what have you found to be
the most impactful when
speaking with groups that are

442
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:43,190
underrepresented in stem?

443
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,410
For me,
it's always about representation.

444
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,790
I always introduce if parents are trying
to make science and tech sound more

445
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:54,620
interesting to their kids who
may be a minority or a girl.

446
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:59,830
I showed them role models who are in
stem that may look like or come from the

447
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,410
same community or whatever,
like their kid.

448
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,490
Because you can talk about the same
things. Science is interesting.

449
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:09,140
Science is great.
Science can help the world.

450
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:14,030
But when it comes from somebody who
looks and sounds a little bit like you,

451
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:19,220
the message, uh, rings louder
and it feels more relatable.

452
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:23,360
So I always try to find
people on Youtube or,

453
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,200
or good books or good toys that have
role models that look like their kid.

454
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,510
Just to wrap up with a
couple more. So the, uh,

455
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:34,320
you've spoken in Ted talks and others
about stem literacy, which is, uh,

456
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,520
when we started talking about politicians
and how to articulate to them why is

457
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:41,400
stem literacy going to be
so important going forward,

458
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:44,100
not just for our political leaders,
but the population as a whole.

459
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,650
And maybe describe what
you mean by stem literacy.

460
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,230
Yeah,
so similar literacy for me,

461
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:54,231
it's any time there is a science
related issue that affects your life

462
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:55,734
personally.

463
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,890
So things like genetically modified foods
or climate change or net neutrality,

464
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,890
basically it's anything that sounds
really scary and complicated,

465
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,280
but with a little bit of
knowledge of science and tech,

466
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:10,050
you can understand the situation better.

467
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,060
And I think it's so critically important
because I haven't checked the recent

468
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:17,010
congress,
but the last congress,

469
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,360
there were fewer than 7%
of our representatives who
had a formal background in

470
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:22,194
stem.

471
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,910
And when we're talking about
issues like net neutrality,

472
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,950
that is so scary to me
because if or you know,

473
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:35,880
or genetically modified foods or climate
change or basically, you know, uh,

474
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,050
self driving cars or drones
that deliver packages,

475
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:40,950
things like that,

476
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,100
we need policy makers to science and
technology and if our policy makers don't,

477
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,990
then our citizens must.

478
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,960
Very cool.
Just to close,

479
00:26:50,961 --> 00:26:54,350
so imagine you're speaking to a
room full of a high school girls.

480
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:56,780
What advice do you have for them as
they think about college and beyond?

481
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,480
With my frame of reference with stem,

482
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,750
the best advice I give to
girls is to lift each other up,

483
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,900
lift other girls up. Because when an
engineering, if you're the only girl,

484
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,370
you have this,

485
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:14,610
this feeling throughout college or Grad
school or even your career that you're

486
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,910
the token girl in any given group,

487
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,970
you are one of one girl or two girls
in any situation that you were ever in.

488
00:27:22,011 --> 00:27:26,180
And so if all of a sudden you're in
a group with, uh, multiple girls,

489
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,170
you have a natural instinct to
want to be competitive with them.

490
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,790
So I try to tell them to fight that
instinct because life will be a lot better

491
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,130
and a lot happier if you
are lifting each other up.

492
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:42,180
Um, you talked about, uh, role
models and mentors. When you're,

493
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,440
um, meeting with people who
are underrepresented in stem,

494
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,520
how about for yourself?

495
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,810
Have you found good role models and
mentors or do you feel like you're

496
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:53,880
trailblazing and kind of
figuring it out by yourself?

497
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,910
I, there's always someone
I'm looking up to. I mean,

498
00:27:56,911 --> 00:28:01,680
it's hard to find people that I,
I see exactly myself in,

499
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,310
uh, I mean my role models are
bill Nye, Neil degrasse Tyson,

500
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:10,311
people who are a great storytellers
and also really effective and efficient

501
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:15,330
science communicators. That combination
of skills I think is, is really unique.

502
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,800
And I find it in people who are on Youtube
and people like Neil degrasse Tyson

503
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:23,880
and uh, and Bill Nye. So those are
my role models even at, for me,

504
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:26,410
it's hard to find,
um,

505
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,940
women in this science communicator
role who are much, uh,

506
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,750
you know, more into their career. I have
peers that I look up to who are, you know,

507
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,730
at the same stage that I am.
Um,

508
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,040
and I think that's fine to
have a role model that's,

509
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,890
that's your friend as well cause you
can always learn from each other.

510
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,500
So a question from the virtual viewers is,

511
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,870
you've already mentioned
the volume of content.

512
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:54,250
What's the coolest thing
that you've gotten to get
exposed to through either the

513
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:58,180
programs you've done or internship with
NASA in the space field as a result of

514
00:28:58,181 --> 00:28:59,590
this opportunities you've had?

515
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,810
Uh, well working with they'll
NYSE hands down the coolest.

516
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,610
All right. What makes them so cool? I'm
that everything you've already said, this

517
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,750
is exactly as you would expect.
He is,

518
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,730
he's somebody who has been in this field
for so long and has incredible science

519
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:18,440
stories that I imagined him
as sort of a, you know, your,

520
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:22,970
your uncle or your grandpa that has a
million stories to tell and just will go

521
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,930
on and on and on telling really
fascinating stories. But you know,

522
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,320
it's just somebody that will ramble
about science for as long as you will let

523
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:31,450
him.
And He,

524
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,630
it's so endearing that he is something
that he genuinely cares about and is

525
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:39,990
really excited to talk about.
So I love that with my show. Um,

526
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,990
I've, you know, anytime I get
to fly, I'm really excited.

527
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:48,991
So I interviewed Dick Rutan recently who
was the famous test pilot who flew the

528
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:55,540
first nonstop flight around the world on,
on fueled nonstop flight with voyager.

529
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,430
And Dick Rutan is part
of the, uh, aviation duo.

530
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,380
His brother is Burt Rue Chan,

531
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,540
who built actually designed spaceship
one that's in the hallway out there. And,

532
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,940
uh,
Burt Rutan designed voyager.

533
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:14,080
And I was interviewing Dick Rutan and
he was talking about that nonstop flight

534
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:18,130
around the world. And, and I asked
him, what was your expectation,

535
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:22,240
what like was it as just as good as you
expected? And he started to tear up.

536
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,500
And it was one of those emotional
moments that was the last milestone in

537
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:27,334
aviation.

538
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,180
And I was talking to the man who
achieved it and he was getting emotional

539
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:33,850
telling the story and
that was so powerful.

540
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:37,090
And then after that we flew in,
um,

541
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,210
a test vehicle that his brother had
designed that was not FDA approved and we

542
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:45,910
were doing aerobatic maneuvers. And this
plane, I mean inside the plane it said,

543
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:50,260
warning, this airplane is
not FDA approved. And then
Dick Rutan wrote under it.

544
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,350
That's what makes it so fun.
Cool.

545
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,400
Other questions from the uh,
we here, we got one back here.

546
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,010
I love all this great science
programming that I'm starting to see.

547
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:03,020
I the 12 year old daughter who was really
into science and so we used to love

548
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:07,840
things like mythbusters. Oh,
you just discovered the white
rabbit project. Yes. Um,

549
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,740
and then now there's your program and
those two at least are both on Netflix.

550
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,420
So I'm wondering if you're seeing Netflix
is really taking this as a focus area

551
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,370
for them and how's it
been working with them?

552
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,870
It's been amazing working with them and I,
that's my impression too.

553
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:26,830
I don't have any insider knowledge on
that front, but from what I've seen,

554
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:31,000
it seems like Netflix is really
investing in science programming.

555
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,880
I been talking to my manager
a little bit about this. I,

556
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,900
it feels as if there's been a reality
TV show bubble that has bursted people.

557
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:43,540
It's been a completely saturated
market and now people are craving more

558
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:46,140
educational programming.
Um,

559
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,350
then Netflix I think is answered that
call and they've been investing in these

560
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:53,860
projects. I hope they continue to
do so. Uh, it's been really great.

561
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:57,010
And in terms of finding jobs,
so yeah,

562
00:31:57,011 --> 00:32:00,430
I mean we feel that the people who work
in this industry feel the same way.

563
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:05,230
It feels like there are more opportunities
available now than there have been in

564
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:09,190
the past even four or
five years. So yeah, it,

565
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:12,250
it feels like there's going to be even
more educational programming coming

566
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:13,210
online soon.
Cool.

567
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,590
Great question. So another one
from the virtual sphere is, uh,

568
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:21,060
you graduated from MIT,
probably going many different directions.

569
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,180
Um, the decision industry
versus science communication.

570
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,210
They're both industries,

571
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,680
but I'm very different than versus
going forward for a corporation.

572
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,150
How did that decision that,

573
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,730
that sort of happened organically
or was it a conscious choice?

574
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,680
Um,

575
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,680
I was looking for jobs and one day I got
an email from a production studio that

576
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,590
like, would you like to be the host
of the outer space TV show? Um,

577
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,630
and I was like, yeah, that sounds
cool. And so that's honestly,

578
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:49,850
that's how that started.
That's how that began.

579
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,810
I had never tried to be
the host of a TV show.

580
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:56,840
I had never professionally
done science communication.

581
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,260
I did a lot of outreach and that's
how they found me is I had, um,

582
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,160
I had spoken about the benefits of
NASA and the value of NASA, uh, to,

583
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,570
to public audiences before. And there was
stuff on youtube of me doing that. Um,

584
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,620
and I really liked that.

585
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:14,360
I think if I weren't doing
science communication on
TV because of my masters in

586
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:15,740
technology and policy,

587
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:20,180
I would have wanted to work at it on
the hill for maybe the office of Science

588
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:22,970
and technology policy influencing
science related policy.

589
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,770
So I was already going that routes
that sort of non technical routes,

590
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,720
but working with science and technology.

591
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:33,110
And then that came along and it
sounded like a really cool adventure.

592
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,090
And now that's just become my career.
Cool.

593
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,750
The question about colonizing Mars.
So there's a lot of uh, you know,

594
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,280
talks about colonizing Mars.

595
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,100
I wonder if you think it's a one way
trip given that it's a very expensive

596
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,500
taking people there is going to
spend some time like in the trip, uh,

597
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,540
ms specialist living there for awhile,

598
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,010
then coming back to earth will
be a problem because first, uh,

599
00:33:56,011 --> 00:33:58,230
I imagine like a bodybuilder
and Mars is going to be like a,

600
00:33:58,231 --> 00:34:02,040
just a regular person here are weaker.
I Dunno.

601
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,490
So how feasible is all
that now people talk about,

602
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:06,991
yeah,

603
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:11,820
so I will say that I think the only
way to go to Mars is going to be with

604
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:16,821
government funding and that NASA would
never allow a one way trip to Mars.

605
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:22,470
So I think in general they will
figure out how to do a round trip.

606
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,110
People argue that the
technology is already there.

607
00:34:25,111 --> 00:34:29,490
It's just making better technology
to make it more cost effective.

608
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,450
For example,
the,

609
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,840
one of the problems right now is the
radiation that astronauts would experience

610
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,080
on the way to Mars by some calculations.

611
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:42,000
And an astronaut would definitely have
cancer by the time that they got to Mars

612
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:46,260
or by the time that they were returning,
um, just because of that radiation.

613
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,500
But what you could do is literally fill
a space ship with a foot of water of

614
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,490
simply h two o, um, and that
would solve the problem,

615
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:01,830
but that is extremely expensive
and that can be really, uh,

616
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,860
fuel and efficient and propelling an,
uh,

617
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:09,780
an astronaut group to Mars. So there's
technologies that are out there that are,

618
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,540
could be simple, but it's not really
cost effective. But anyways, I,

619
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,670
long story short, it will eventually,
I'm sure it will be a round trip.

620
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:21,450
I can't imagine anyone participating in
a one way trip to Mars or funding a one

621
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:25,050
way trip to Mars. Cool. We had a
question right behind you there. Um,

622
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,730
do you want to go? Oh, definitely not.
No. No. I'm don't even like camping.

623
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,830
So that's, yeah, Mars is definitely
extreme camp. Can we talk about, so one,

624
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,670
have you guys heard of Mars One? You
guys have heard of this? So this was,

625
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,470
this was a big,
uh,

626
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,520
I don't want to say gimmick because I
think they were very sincere and their,

627
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,690
and their ideas,

628
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,530
but they didn't have the technology
to really describe their mission

629
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,060
thoughtfully. But they put out a
request for proposals for, you know,

630
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,010
people who would sign up for a one
way trip to Mars and they got 200,000

631
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:01,590
applications.
And I saw that and I was like,

632
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:06,390
I would bet my firstborn child that
half of you have never wanted to go to

633
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:09,990
Antarctica. Half of you have never even
thought about climbing Mount Everest.

634
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,080
And probably many of you are like
me and don't even like camping.

635
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,020
Like Mars is a terrible planet to live on.

636
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:20,190
I don't think people really
understand the full ramifications of,

637
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,780
of going there Starbucks to very light.
There's not many there.

638
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,840
So there's a lot of talk today about how
we now live in this post truth world.

639
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,140
Does that change the strategy
for you as a stem educator? Is,

640
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,350
is there some context there?

641
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,860
We have to communicate differently if
facts may be don't mean what they used to.

642
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,121
Yeah.

643
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:46,040
My strategy with that and I think that
there's always been some hesitancy to

644
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:50,300
believe experts or there there's,

645
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,080
there's distrust of the scientific
community and there has been for a while.

646
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:57,880
I think it's, I don't know if
it's growing, it's, it's uh,

647
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,370
a hard under a situation to understand.
But for me,

648
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:05,960
the way that I address it is I always
tell people you are the most influential

649
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:08,660
in your own circle of family and friends.

650
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,540
And the most effective way to combat,
uh,

651
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:16,570
stem illiteracy is to speak to the
people who care about your opinion and to

652
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:22,031
have those hard conversations
about climate change or
about whatever topic that

653
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:25,640
you find interesting and
personally care about. Cause they,

654
00:37:25,641 --> 00:37:29,360
you are the person that they are
most likely to listen to. Cool

655
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,060
Tech. I feel like we, uh,

656
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,890
at least in software development we get
to kind of stay as far away from the

657
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:39,770
government as we possibly
can unless we have to.

658
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:43,670
Like we'll do the bare minimum to interact
because it's just generally a very

659
00:37:43,671 --> 00:37:46,370
slow, uh, institution.

660
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,710
I feel like in space exploration,

661
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,140
working with the government
is at least half of it.

662
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:54,920
So it's certainly not just about
science and math and technology.

663
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,770
It is half about like policy makers.

664
00:37:57,771 --> 00:38:01,430
So we'd love to hear your thoughts about
what it's like working a little bit

665
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:02,720
more with policy makers,

666
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:06,980
like how you navigate some of that
bureaucracy and not nepotism, but like,

667
00:38:06,981 --> 00:38:08,080
you know,
uh,

668
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,800
short term goals that a
lot of policymakers have.

669
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:18,420
Yeah, I mean, so I don't personally
work with the government, but you know,

670
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,680
through my show I speak with
NASA who often does. And, um,

671
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,160
what I think that the trade off there
is that for people who work at NASA,

672
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:30,930
it's, it's very annoying to
deal with that bureaucracy.

673
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:32,760
It's annoying to deal
with those restrictions.

674
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,180
But at the same time they are working
on some of the most profound questions

675
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:41,410
humans have ever asked. Like, where
did we come from and are we alone?

676
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:45,790
And so they get to work on some of the
most exciting projects that any engineer

677
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,710
could help to work on.
Um,

678
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:51,220
but they are working
under a government salary.

679
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,940
They're not getting paid as much as
they would if they were in industry. Uh,

680
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:57,730
and then they have to deal with all
the red tape and the bureaucracy.

681
00:38:57,731 --> 00:39:01,180
So I don't know that that
answers your question, but it's,

682
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,450
if you're in the space industry
and you're working for NASA,

683
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,410
you get to do some really incredible
work and really exciting projects.

684
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:11,530
But there's, you know, there's
a give and take to that.

685
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,210
So I just want to close with one question
since it's the end of the year and

686
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:16,370
it's always good to end positive.
So what's the,

687
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:21,050
what of all the things that are happening
right now in space exploration or

688
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:24,920
science in general that has you most
positive, enthusiastic, optimistic?

689
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,030
Yeah,

690
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:31,030
I think the fact that people like ending
this is a very specific technology that

691
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:32,360
I'm excited about,

692
00:39:32,361 --> 00:39:37,361
but blue origin and space x working to
perfect reusable rockets is just changing

693
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:41,180
the game in the space industry.
I mean,

694
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:46,490
Elon Musk thinks that he can take
that $30 billion price tag with,

695
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,540
with Mars.
Um,

696
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:53,710
and that would equate to
about a $10 billion ticket
for sending a person to Mars

697
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:59,251
today to a $200,000 ticket to sending a
person to March today because of rocket

698
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:01,340
reusability.

699
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,260
And so I think that once that's
perfected and proven to be safe,

700
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:11,000
it's going to completely change our
mindset on going to Mars and expanding the

701
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:14,030
human race into the solar system.
Cool.

702
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:18,710
Thank you very much for those virtually
avoiding the rain and those in the room.

703
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,430
Thank you, Emily, for sure.
Thoughts. Really appreciate
it. Thank you. Thank you.
