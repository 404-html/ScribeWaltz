1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,120
Good afternoon.
Welcome to talks at Google.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,860
My name is Rebecca Moore.

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:15,630
I'm director of Google Earth and I'm
very pleased to welcome my dear friend,

4
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:19,500
Dr. Victoria Sweet, who just published
a new book called slow medicine,

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,760
the way to healing.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,230
I've known Victoria for several decades
since nearly the start of her journey as

7
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:28,134
a physician,

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,650
including her 20 years practicing at
Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco and

9
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:38,961
taking time to get her phd in the
history of medicine during this period.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,390
She's been on the front lines of dramatic
change in her profession as practicing

11
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:49,851
medicine has transformed into delivering
healthcare and not always for the

12
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:54,120
better. Her first book, God's hotel,

13
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:59,010
one widespread or awards in a claim
leading to a Guggenheim fellowship and the

14
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,370
time, pay attention to that word
because you will hear it today a lot.

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,290
The time for her to synthesize and
develop our ideas further around what she

16
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:12,240
called slow medicine and fast medicine
and how these two approaches are both

17
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:14,580
complimentary and necessary.

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,570
Googlers will particularly appreciate
that Victoria got her undergraduate degree

19
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,890
in mathematics from Stanford.

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,760
Go to Stanford and a so
please join me in welcoming

21
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,160
Dr Victoria. Sweet. Thank you.

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Uh, thank you very much Rebecca for that
introduction and thank you all for being

23
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:42,361
here today and thanks to Google for
doing something this really unusual for a

24
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:47,710
big for profit company to
be willing to sponsor, uh,

25
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,720
books and speeches by authors.
It's,

26
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:55,300
it's a really wonderful thing and special.
I think it tells a lot about Google.

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,280
Um, I would like to add that, I know I do.
I get my mathematics degree at Stanford.

28
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,780
It was my major, but my minor was
classics and that is a stream.

29
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:07,720
This two things have, have woven
their way through through my life.

30
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,170
So what I would like to do this afternoon,

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,710
I'll speak for about 40
minutes and all be, um,

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
explaining kind of how I
actually got right here. Uh,

33
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,310
that's the first part of the talk.
In the second part,

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,100
they're going to want to talk about
what's going on with medicine and, uh, in,

35
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,830
during my career and what I think
we can do to make it better.

36
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,400
So I'm going to start with my,

37
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,080
yes. So the first one, first

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,100
thing you should know about me is that
I don't consider myself a natural born

39
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:44,554
doctrine.

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,560
And by that I mean growing up I never
watched doctor shows or went to a

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,500
volunteered in the hospital
and if somebody was sick,

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,880
I didn't want to hear about it or have
anything to do with them. And in fact,

43
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:00,430
the first time I had to draw blood
medical school, I passed out.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,920
So definitely not a natural born doctor.

45
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:06,160
But what happened was at the end of
college I was looking for a way to

46
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,940
synthesize these two parts of myself, the
mathematics, the classics, the history,

47
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:14,380
the humanities and the sciences.
And I ran into the writings of Carl Jung,

48
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,240
the psychiatrist. He'd written a memoir
called memories, dreams and reflections.

49
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,750
And I ran into it by accident in the
library and I found myself and thrawled.

50
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,590
I wasn't enthralled first of all by the
meaning he expected from his own life

51
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,710
and also by the kind of
life he set up for himself.

52
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,600
This is a stone house he had built
for himself and the Lake Zurich.

53
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,730
And this is where he saw patients
in the morning and neurotic,

54
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,050
well paying patients in the morning
and illuminated manuscripts and studied

55
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,250
alchemy in the afternoon.

56
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,060
I thought this was a great life and
that's what I wanted to do when I grew up

57
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,170
and that's how I got to medical school
because I was going to be a union

58
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,043
psychiatrist.

59
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,580
Then it turned out I liked medical school
a lot more than I thought it would,

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,970
especially the last two
years of medical school.

61
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,140
When you finally get a chance
to see real patients. I,

62
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,670
I loved what's called the workup.

63
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:13,480
I loved the history taking the history
tied to figure out the patient's story

64
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,030
because there was so
much psychology to it.

65
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,060
Hearing what the patient
said and didn't say,

66
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,840
sing what the way he said or he,
she said what?

67
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,500
What the answer to the question and
then there was examining the patient.

68
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:28,540
It turns out I actually
liked touching people.

69
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,010
I particularly like the physical exam
because there was so much I could learn

70
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,320
from it about with the
patient had and didn't have,

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,880
and then there was putting it all together
in a diagnosis and the treatment and

72
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:44,050
the plant. It was a logical,
brilliant method. Nevertheless,

73
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:49,051
I continued my first idea and I went
into a psychiatric residency that was a

74
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,190
little bit naive.

75
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:55,900
So my psychiatric residency took place
in the only locked psychiatric ward in

76
00:04:55,901 --> 00:05:00,020
our county. So consequently
the patients were not humans,

77
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,950
well paying neurotic articulated patients.

78
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:07,630
They were severely psychotic and
they responded a lot more to the

79
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,980
medicines we use and they did
to the talk therapy. I tried,

80
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,490
so after I got my license,
after that first year of internship,

81
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,520
I just went out and practiced medicine
for several years in various clinics and

82
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:25,360
it was fascinating because the county
clinics in the community clinics would get

83
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,160
waves of immigrants every time there was
a war or a rumor of war and they would

84
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:34,330
bring with them their diseases and also
their different way of looking at the

85
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:37,990
body.
I saw everything in those clinics.

86
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:42,490
I saw three cases of leprosy,
and this is right around here when I,

87
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,383
when I did this,

88
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,130
I saw almost every parasite there was
and saw many unusual diseases and it was

89
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:52,180
also interested in these different
ways of looking at the body.

90
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:56,620
And so after a while I decided that I
might as well bit that I liked medicine.

91
00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:00,920
I went back and did a three years of a
regular medical residency and then I went

92
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,130
back to the community clinics.
The longer I practice medicine,

93
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,320
the more impressed I was by the logical
method of writing at a diagnosis and a

94
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:14,150
treatment. But it was also more and
more impressed by what this medicine,

95
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:19,040
modern medicine left out, which was of
course anything that wasn't a logical.

96
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,200
So after a while I started
reading, uh, alternative medicines,

97
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,610
natural apathy, homeopathy, Chinese
medicine, and Ayurvedic Medicine.

98
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,120
And for a while,
uh,

99
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,540
I even thought about learning Chinese
so I could understand Chinese medicine

100
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,520
from the inside or Sanskrit.

101
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,580
So I could understand Indian
medicine from the inside.

102
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,840
But eventually I decided that even if
I did get to that point that I could

103
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:45,471
understand them,

104
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,190
that their cultures were still two
different from my own to understand their

105
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:51,380
different ways of looking at the body.

106
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,280
It was just rather discouraging moment
that I discovered the writings of uh,

107
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,980
a very, uh, unusual 12th century woman.

108
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,670
Her name was Hildegard of
Bingen and she was a mystic.

109
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,080
She was a composer. Uh, she
was an artist. She was a,

110
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,710
she was a field login,
but she also has a turned out,

111
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:15,020
it was a medical practitioner that
you written a book on her medicine.

112
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,010
And as I stood there and read
her book in the library again,

113
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I was impressed by the medicine that
she was recounting cause it wasn't the

114
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,510
medieval medicine that
expected tongue of new to,

115
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,030
I have frog medicine expected
from a medieval medical texts.

116
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,500
It was a real medicine for real patients
with real diseases I could recognize.

117
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,010
But it was based on a completely different
model of the body from our modern

118
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:46,940
medical model. I couldn't quite put
my finger on how it was different,

119
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,380
but I decided then and there that I was
gonna go back to school and get a phd in

120
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,780
medical history with Hildegard of,
of my focus.

121
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,450
But I didn't want to
stop practicing medicine.

122
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,710
I wanted to do this half time and I spent
a couple of months looking around for

123
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:01,700
halftime position,

124
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,010
which was rather difficult at the time
until finally I discovered I was offered

125
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:10,130
a position at a very unusual
hospital in San Francisco,

126
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,270
which is called Laguna Honda
Hospital attempt disco.

127
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,660
And when I drove over for the first
time and saw it high on that hill,

128
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,050
I wasn't taken aback.
There's about 20 years ago now,

129
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,910
it looked like a medieval monastery.
They had had red tile roof,

130
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:30,911
senate cream colored walls and it turned
in a bell tower where patients I turned

131
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:35,060
out, used to go up in smoke and uh,

132
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,180
I went to my interview and the medical
director took me around and I had never

133
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:43,181
seen a hospital like this need was on
62 acres of land in the middle of San

134
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,400
Francisco.
It had 1200 patients.

135
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,150
It was is he enormous grounds.

136
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,740
The patients were all got taken care
of on these old fashion a wards,

137
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:59,741
those open wards you see in the old
movies from the 1930s he had had an x ray

138
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:03,360
department where we could take our own
x rays and a lab with a microscope where

139
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:04,740
we could look at our own slides.

140
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,790
It had a a chapel,

141
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,370
a little small chapel that
was run by the county.

142
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:16,371
It had a chapel that actually looked
more like a church with stained glass

143
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:21,831
windows and I'm Polish wooden pews and
a very politically incorrect stations of

144
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,810
the cross along the walls.

145
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,950
And then we went out and the medical
director showed me the grounds,

146
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,030
which were enormous.

147
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,620
There was an aviary so that patients
could watch chickens hatch from eggs.

148
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,340
There was a green house so that patients
could pop plants and there was even a

149
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,580
barnyard for the patients could see
animals even if they were bed bound.

150
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,130
And we walked back to her office and she
offered me the job. Well, I didn't know,

151
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,810
I wasn't sure. I had never seen a
place like that before in my life.

152
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,720
But I was the only place that would
let me practice medicine part time.

153
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:01,920
So I said I would stay for two months
and they ended up staying for 20 years

154
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,700
cause it turned out to be a
fascinating place to practice.

155
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,590
And that was for one specific reason.

156
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,670
It had originally been called
the San Francisco almost south.

157
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,680
This was the first rendition of Laguna
Honda in an 1860s and the aunt's house

158
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,300
was actually how we used to
take care of just sick poor.

159
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,230
Before there was health insurance, we had
a way of taking care of the sick poor.

160
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,970
And that was this system that was the
big old county hospital where anybody

161
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:31,470
could show up and get taken care of.
And then if they need more care than that,

162
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,030
we had some place to send them.

163
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,580
So this was where in the old days we could
send people who were mentally ill who

164
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,450
needed more care, who were unemployed
or just been let out of prison.

165
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,570
We actually had a system and Laguna Honda
was the San Francisco [inaudible] and

166
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:52,761
it's how I got the title for my last
book because this is the system that we

167
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:57,450
have came from France
and Europe in general.

168
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,280
And in French, the word for alms
house is hotel. Gm is God's hotel.

169
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,240
So that's why I got the name.

170
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:07,030
And the reason I ended up staying so
long is because typically the Almshouse

171
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:12,090
would get the bottom one
10th of 1% of patients.

172
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,370
So my patients were all three
standard deviations from the mean,

173
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,500
any meat, they were the
tallest, they were the shortest,

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,280
the fattest.
And they were the dentist.

175
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,710
They were the oldest and the youngest
and the nicest and the immune system.

176
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,300
Any patients I ever had.

177
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,410
And because the whole catchment
area was San Francisco,

178
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,440
it's time with 600,000 people.
Uh,

179
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,130
if a disease would occur in
one in 100,000, I'd say couple.

180
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,710
So it was fascinating place medically.

181
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,650
I just went through the rare diseases
in Harrison's textbook of medicine and

182
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,940
check them off as they would come up.
So it was a fascinating place to practice.

183
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,920
And an ended up staying for 20 years.

184
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,450
There's also a wonderful place to practice
because healthcare efficiency had not

185
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,500
yet arrived.

186
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,630
We were over the hill to the poor house
literally and people kind of left us

187
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:08,020
alone. I mean we had standards and things
people paid attention to what we did,

188
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,890
but mostly I had something that
doctors today mostly don't have.

189
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,070
That is the time to take
care of my patients,

190
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,900
to properly examine them, to figure
out what was actually wrong with them,

191
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:24,310
to get the right diagnosis and the right
treatment. And the longer I was there,

192
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:27,870
the more impressed I was by not only how,
um,

193
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,940
how, um, satisfying that
was for me as a dog,

194
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,050
but how efficient it was even from a
healthcare efficiency point of view.

195
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,700
Then I'll give you an example.

196
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,600
The typical patient at Laguna Honda
would arrive with on between 15 and 26

197
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:51,781
medications of which they only
needed about four or five.

198
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,370
But no other doctor had had the
time to go through the chart,

199
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,760
go through the patient, figure out whether
they actually needed that medicine,

200
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,390
maybe even try and taking them off
that medication to see how they did.

201
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,760
I found that most of the patients could
be handled very well in five medications.

202
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,320
So I was taking them off
between 10 and 15 medications,

203
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,090
which if you figure it out,
um,

204
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,440
economically is incredibly cost effective
for the extra few hours of time it

205
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:22,180
took me. So I was quite happy there.
And then I, meanwhile of course,

206
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:24,340
I'd gone back to study,
um,

207
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,360
this is actually what I call
the efficiency of inefficiency.

208
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,161
Meanwhile,

209
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:35,161
I'd gone back as I decided to do to get
my phd in medical history with Hildegard

210
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:36,460
of Bingen as my focus.

211
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,300
And what I decided to do was to really
learn Hildegard's medicine as if I were a

212
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:47,991
student by reading her medical text
in its original language and by

213
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:52,650
understanding what people
were doing around her. Uh,

214
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,170
so I took classes in learned Latin
cause she wrote in Latin and I learned

215
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,770
medieval Latin cause she read
actually in medieval Latin.

216
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,860
I learned medieval German and German
because that's what the secondary

217
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,490
literature was in and learn
paleography and code ecology.

218
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,490
So I could actually read the handwritten
texts, which they had back then.

219
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,010
And he also experimented because I
figured if I had been her student in the

220
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,490
Middle Ages,

221
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,630
I'd sort of have a sense of using her
different recipes and prescriptions.

222
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,960
So I planted a medieval or garden and
I brewed up some of her potions and

223
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:27,230
Syrup's I uh,

224
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,050
tried her medicinal beers and I baked
some of her antidepressant cookies.

225
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,270
And what I've found over time I got more
and more interested in the difference

226
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:41,380
between Hildegard's model of the body
and our model of the body because they

227
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,670
were clearly very different.

228
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,210
Our model of the body is fundamentally
based on the idea that the body is a

229
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:53,251
machine and the doctor is a
mechanic looking for what's
broken and trying to fix

230
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,890
it,
repair it or replace it.

231
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,400
Hildegard's model was very different.

232
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:06,401
I gradually learned over the years the
guards model was much more of the body as

233
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:11,360
a plant rather than as a machine. And
then doctor, more like a gardener.

234
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,660
And a mechanic.
What's the difference?

235
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,160
The difference is that someone
has to fix a broken machine,

236
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,470
but a plant can heal itself.

237
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,840
Hildegard had a name for uh,

238
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,730
the power of a plant deal itself and
she called it Verdad toss from the Latin

239
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,620
Veritus that means green. So it was
the greening power of a plant to grow,

240
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,530
to produce seeds and to repair
itself when it was injured.

241
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,540
And she believed that uh,
human beings also have this power.

242
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,000
And then the job of the doctor was more
to remove what was in the way of the

243
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:54,500
patients for at a task and to support it
with the basics then to do something to

244
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,334
the patient.

245
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,630
So this was a very interesting model
and it took me years to understand how a

246
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:02,720
plot to apply it to the
patients I had at Laguna Honda.

247
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,720
But gradually I began to see that not
only could I help a patient by figuring

248
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:10,820
out what diagnosis they actually had,

249
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:15,610
once I had the diagnosis to step back and
see what was in the way of [inaudible]

250
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,880
and what could I do to support it. The
longer I practice medicine within a Honda,

251
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:24,881
the more I realized that this was a very
helpful way of looking at patients and

252
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,600
I began to think of it as sort of that
slow medicine as opposed to the fast

253
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:34,190
medicine I also use, which is so effective
for what I considered Beth disease.

254
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,120
So for instance,

255
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,660
if you get to come to the hospital because
you have appendicitis and you need an

256
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:42,920
appendectomy or you come to the hospital
in you had or having a heart attack and

257
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:45,380
you need an angioplasty,
or even if you have cancer,

258
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,100
this is when what I would call
by contrast, fast medicine,

259
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:53,270
our modern medicine based on the model
of the body as a machine works great,

260
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,050
but after your appendectomy,

261
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,140
after angioplasty and
after your chemotherapy,

262
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,580
this is when modern medicine
with this idea of coming in,

263
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,800
fixing what's broken falls down.

264
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,120
And what I learned at Laguna Honda is
when I used both models together first

265
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,610
fast and then slow medicine,

266
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,840
the patients did the best.
They did remarkably well.

267
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Many of them were actually able to go
home sort of unexpectedly during the 20

268
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:27,290
years I practiced medicine while he was
practicing medicine at Laguna Honda,

269
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,130
we eventually got discovered a and are
Alison days of having enough time began

270
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:37,790
to disappear and uh,

271
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,960
first by health care efficiency experts
who showed up one day walking through

272
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:46,961
the place and horrified to discover
the aviary and the greenhouse and

273
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,100
particularly the open wards.

274
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,150
And the Department of Justice finally
eventually showed up and told Laguna Honda

275
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:57,920
that they were going to have to tear the
place down and rebuild a new healthcare

276
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,740
facility that had private rooms for
all the patients rather than keep the

277
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:04,590
patients on the open wards.
Um,

278
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,150
and at that point I decided to take some
time off and write a book about what

279
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:13,590
I'd seen there. That was my first
book and also to think about, uh,

280
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:16,470
what I've seen so far in
my life as a physician.

281
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,800
It seemed to me when I thought about
that in my life as a physician, um,

282
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,120
the pendulum of healthcare is swung
from the personal to the efficient.

283
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,800
And I've been more and
more impressed by what, uh,

284
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,610
that leaves out.
So for instance,

285
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,150
the results of the kind of health care
efficiency we've had over the last 20

286
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:39,990
years as you can see,

287
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:44,260
is that healthcare costs have kept rising
no matter what healthcare economists

288
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,113
have tried to do.

289
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,190
They've tried to do all kinds of screens
for getting a coat of healthcare.

290
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,300
And this is not true just in the
United States, but across the world,

291
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,630
healthcare costs keep rising every
year despite DRGs and h emos and manage

292
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:58,830
health care systems,
everything.

293
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:03,090
We've tried trying to understand what
was going on in the system as a whole.

294
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,080
I decided to look at Laguna Honda
specifically and asked myself what was had

295
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:08,940
gone on there in the last 20 years.
So,

296
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,110
so I figured out that in the last
20 years as a cost cutting measure,

297
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,320
the patients we had had gone from about
1,178 down to 780 this was as a cost

298
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:25,590
cutting measure. So we were taking care
of a lot fewer patients. Of course,

299
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:26,490
correspondingly,

300
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:31,491
the number of doctors we had went
down was cut from 32 to a nine and

301
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,240
correspondingly also the clinical stuff
that's the nurses and the therapists and

302
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:42,960
the social workers was also
cut as a cost cutting measure,

303
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,340
cost cutting measure from um,
about 1500 to 1200.

304
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,770
And yet at Laguna Honda every
year to budget had increased.

305
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,100
So I asked me what accounted for that
and I realized that even though the

306
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:03,180
patients were fewer and the doctors
were considerably fewer and the clinical

307
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:07,320
staff had been cut,
the total staff was actually the same.

308
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,340
There were more and more
administrators every year.

309
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,920
What did all those administrators
do? I asked myself, well,

310
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:18,240
what I realized was that

311
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,970
when I thought about it that the one
thing we had more of at Laguna Honda, uh,

312
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,430
at the time,
at the end of my time there,

313
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,870
then at the beginning of the time
we're forms. So when I first got there,

314
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,250
we had paper charts and we had two
single page forms in the chart.

315
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,190
And the day before I left Laguna Honda,

316
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:41,970
I pulled out one of the paper charts just
randomly and I started looking through

317
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:43,980
it and I counted how
many forms there were.

318
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,570
And there were 43 forms in that chart
and none of them were single page forms.

319
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,270
They were 10 page,
20 page.

320
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:56,290
There were so many forms that the
charts would explode from the forms and

321
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,130
medical records had to show up
and thin out the doctor's notes.

322
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,380
Okay.

323
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,640
And this to sort of clarify things because
I do have someone have a mathematical

324
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,400
mind.

325
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,220
I created this chart at the time
when I was figuring this out. Okay,

326
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:13,054
now this is working.

327
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,900
So this is a try to create it at the
time on a Napkin as Becca pointed out the

328
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:21,120
other day. Um, so these are the patients
going down. I was trying to figure out,

329
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:25,540
understand the system. They're the
doctors going down. There's the, uh,

330
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,830
budget going up, the clinical staff, the,

331
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,660
the total staff saying about the same.
And this was the number of forms.

332
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,830
What I realized is is that if current
trends continued by 2024 there would be no

333
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:46,030
patients at Laguna Honda,
there'd be two doctors there.

334
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,080
It'd be a staff of 1400 a budget of
$275 million and an infinite number of

335
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:57,250
forms.
And I decided this is,

336
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,350
I began to think of this
as doing this with more.

337
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,600
And the thing that's interesting about
it is and crucial that it is exactly the

338
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:08,330
same as being the thing has been
happening in the country as a whole.

339
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,710
Let me give you a show. You what I mean.
So this was the country as a whole.

340
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,320
So if you look at the growth of
its physicians and administrators,

341
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,460
here's what you find.

342
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:17,850
Okay,

343
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,550
so I'll interpret this a little bit
for you. These are the number of docs,

344
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:25,320
percentage growth. So it's about
double. So the dots about doubled in,

345
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,500
in tandem with the
population is about double.

346
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,280
So those are about the same number of
dots per patient and vice versa as there

347
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:36,840
always have been. The yellow is
a number of administrators there,

348
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:40,800
35 times as many administrators
as there used to be.

349
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,950
And as you can see,

350
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,270
just like [inaudible] to the budget
is continued to go up every year.

351
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,490
And what do all those docs do? What of
all those administrators do, I should say,

352
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,930
well, this just is an interesting,
this was HHS paperwork. Really.

353
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:02,950
They should take the electronic
computer work and millions of hours,

354
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,040
millions of hours.
Just in the last 10 years,

355
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,220
it has doubled from 350 million hours.

356
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,570
It has doubled to almost
700 million hours.

357
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,760
Why? Well, what's happened is,

358
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:23,410
is that because of all of this paperwork
that the administrators have generated

359
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:24,370
for various reasons,

360
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,080
we've ended up in a situation where your
doctor doesn't have enough time to look

361
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,260
at, uh, patients anymore.

362
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,130
This is a sentence I've heard over and
over again in the last five years as I've

363
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:38,100
gone around and spoken about the book,
and I put it,

364
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:39,930
I don't know if you can see
when you're sitting here,

365
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,630
but this was a rather scandalous.

366
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,790
I'm drawing that appeared in the Journal
of American Medical Association a few

367
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,950
years ago. Uh, a doc had it published.

368
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,190
It was a mother who brought it to him.

369
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,510
It was a drawing by her
five year old daughter, uh,

370
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:00,920
about my visit to the doctor and uh,
can't see it too well,

371
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:05,630
but this is the daughter sitting on the
exam table behind it as mom holding a

372
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:07,610
little baby and at friend I believe.

373
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,040
And this is the doctor who's
looking at the computer.

374
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,010
This is where we're spending our time.
And um,

375
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,070
from experience in general and experience,
particularly at Laguna Honda,

376
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,170
I believed in order to have
a good healthcare system,

377
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:26,171
we actually need to put inefficiency
that is unregulated free time for the

378
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:31,190
doctors and the nurses to have the time
to look the patients and to get off the

379
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:34,100
computer.
And the question then becomes,

380
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,570
how can we get that time back?
Because as you've just seen,

381
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:42,590
we have actually the same number of
doctors and patients as we've always had,

382
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,790
but the doctors are spending a bunch of
time not with the patients so that the

383
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,820
patient doesn't feel lifted anymore.
And isn't looked at it anymore.

384
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,330
So when I was thinking about
this, trying to figure out, okay,

385
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:55,850
so how could we get the time
back? I asked myself, well,

386
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,900
what do we spend our time on in a way
time is the Verint Atossa healthcare.

387
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,970
So I can do a written toss
analysis and ask myself, well,

388
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:08,240
what are, what is in the way of doctors
having enough time with patients?

389
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:09,860
What do doctors spend their time on?

390
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,500
So I came up with three
fundamental things.

391
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,510
Doctor spend their time on forms when I
called fast administration as opposed to

392
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:23,450
slow administration and lousy
electronic health records.

393
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,911
By forms,

394
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:30,740
I mean this whole contraption that has
come upon us with electronic health

395
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:35,270
records and administration
screens, logins, alerts,

396
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,040
email scripts and this that are based
on this whole idea that if it's not

397
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:44,090
documented, it did, it didn't
happen. And if it is documented,

398
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,200
it did happen. And we can talk
about that a little bit. Um,

399
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,440
and fecund what I'm thinking
of is fast administration,

400
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,110
which I consider a problem with style.

401
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,770
This idea by administrators that
if they come up with a form,

402
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,600
they're done, they come up with a
paradigm, a script for us to follow.

403
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:07,601
The problem is solved and last and really
mainly the easiest thing to fix to get

404
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:14,900
doctors back their time. Electronic
health records that take all our time.

405
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,640
And this is what I'd like to sort of
zero in now and the the for for a little

406
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:23,210
bit about the problem with electronic
health records and how I think we can

407
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,680
actually get back to doctors back
some of our time with patients,

408
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:29,810
some of our free time,
some of our inefficient time.

409
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,480
So we can sit down with patients and
look at them and actually examine it.

410
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,950
So what's happened in the past about
10 years is electronic health records.

411
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,620
We used to use the paper charts,
right,

412
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:43,830
which had their biggest flaw with paper
charts was that if you went to the

413
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:47,700
emergency room and having happened
and then you came back to your doctor,

414
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,920
they couldn't tell you what,
nobody knew what was going on.

415
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,700
We had to get them to send us to
xerox things and send the papers.

416
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:58,410
So what 10 more than about 10 years ago
they do was that if we had electronic

417
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:01,830
health records on the computer and
you went to the emergency room and had

418
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:02,664
something done,

419
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,540
it would magically appear in your
doctor's office and the doctor's computer.

420
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,480
And so that's kind of was the way that
electronic health records were, um,

421
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,150
envision.
But that's not what happened because,

422
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,450
because there's so much money in
healthcare these days and so much money in

423
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:22,530
electronic health records at this point,
the last time I checked, there were 1000,

424
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:27,531
104 profit electronic health record
companies and they're engineered so that

425
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:31,530
they don't talk to each other. So it's
actually even worse than it used to be.

426
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:35,670
So how bad is it? Well, um,

427
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,630
doctors have ended up,
so first of all,

428
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,830
electronic health records haven't
done what they should've done,

429
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,220
but in addition had been used to acquire
big data for the pharmaceuticals,

430
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,510
marketing and advertising.

431
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,690
And the doctor has been right in the
middle of that doctor has been plumped in

432
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:53,430
front of the electronic health records,

433
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,730
which are based on a model of based on
an old billing model that comes back from

434
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:02,940
the 1970s and is incredibly clumsy.

435
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,510
So clumsy that in a Stanford study doctors
were actually spending 70% of their

436
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:10,830
time on the computer.

437
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,570
But in a more sort of shocking study,

438
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,070
Kaiser got tired of hearing how whiny
their doctors were about how much time you

439
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:21,960
spend in the computer.

440
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,910
So they actually decided to see how much
time do our doctor spin on the computer

441
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:31,500
and they picked two hospitals
and they spend two months, uh,

442
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,340
actually keeping track of all the
stroke doctor, all the keystrokes.

443
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,700
And then they added all that time up and
they divided by the number of doctors.

444
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:42,150
This was in two separate hospitals over
two months and they discovered that the

445
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:46,830
doctors out of an eight hour day,
we're spending 10 hours on the computer.

446
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,860
So this is where our time is going.

447
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,660
And we could get it back
if we had electronic health
records that only took as

448
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:00,120
much time as the paper records,
which were,

449
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,540
which would take about 15% of our time.
So in a 15 minute visit,

450
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,860
they take two and a half
minutes of time rather than, uh,

451
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,460
taking more than 15 minutes
of that 50 minute time,

452
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,210
we could get the doctors off the computer
back to doing the kind of care that I

453
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:19,290
was able to give a Laguna Honda where
we can actually get the right diagnosis

454
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,380
and the right treatment. So that's
actually what I'm focusing on now.

455
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:27,000
And one of the reasons I wanted to speak
to, uh, to this particular audience,

456
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:30,590
cause I think it's very possible to
create an electronic health records that's

457
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:32,040
simple,
that's cheap,

458
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,870
that takes like two and a half minutes
instead of 15 minutes and that everybody

459
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,600
could use and would want to use. So, um,

460
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,750
some of my rather larger ideas for getting
control would be to have the opposite

461
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,680
of the three things I had before
about what we spend our time on.

462
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,940
So we could start in terms of forms with
a lock for the conservation of forms.

463
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,440
So my experiences that we have enough
forms already and that we don't need any

464
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:00,274
new forms.

465
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,210
And I think in most hospitals situations
that when an administrator comes up

466
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:08,270
with a new form, they should find at least
one form of equal length to get rid of

467
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,430
second of all, uh, slow administration.

468
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,570
I think that if administrators would
think and would realize that every time

469
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:20,620
they send an email, organize a
meeting or come up with a new form,

470
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,950
they are directly taking
time away from the dock.

471
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,260
And last we need the electronic
health records, that preserve story.

472
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,650
Because the problem with electronic health
records based on the billing platform,

473
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,600
I don't know if anybody
hears ever seen them,

474
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,930
but they make it literally impossible
to s to understand what's actually going

475
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:41,740
on with your patient.

476
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,990
And the last thing that I think we need
to do in our healthcare system is to

477
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:49,990
also start some experiments
with being slow.

478
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,590
And some of the ideas I've come up
with for that is to just in a hospital

479
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:58,591
situation to have a slow medicine clinic
where the doctor would get as much time

480
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:02,980
as they need it with patients.
That's a novel idea,

481
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,630
a slow medicine beds so that we had a
few beds in the hospital where patients

482
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:11,860
could be admitted when they needed to
work up instead of getting piecemeal being

483
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:16,450
sent all over town when they get sick
and finally a slim at us and consult

484
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:17,284
service.

485
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,950
That would be the equivalent of an
oncology consult service or a cardiology

486
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:21,784
consult service,

487
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,540
but it would be for slow medicine for
the patients that we end up as doctors

488
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:29,830
getting in the hospital that are so sick
and complicated and we know we can not

489
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:33,550
figure it out what's going on with him
and we have to discharge them. Instead.

490
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:37,720
We could call it the slow medicine
consult service and have them arrive and

491
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,060
figure the patient out because in the end,

492
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:44,440
I'm not a complete pessimist
about healthcare. I'm a
pessimist and an optimist.

493
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:47,930
I think that healthcare
is with healthcare,

494
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,160
the glass is half full and
half empty in this way.

495
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,410
That in a lot of ways, uh, we've done
a fantastic job with fast medicine.

496
00:31:56,411 --> 00:32:00,010
That this model of the body
as a machine and the doctors,

497
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,870
a mechanic has been incredibly powerful.
Uh,

498
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,270
if you look at what's happened over the
last hundred and 50 years in medical

499
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:10,300
history and nobody would
ever want to go back to, um,

500
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,310
to practicing medicine the way
we did even 20 or 30 years ago.

501
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,370
But on our way to fast medicine this,
I did,

502
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:22,120
the doctors would have enough time to
get the right diagnosis to examine the

503
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:25,630
patient to get the right
treatment has sort of disappeared.

504
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:30,631
And I think we need to go back and re
institute this second way of looking at a

505
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:36,160
patient for more on my book,
which some of you have.

506
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,000
And last, uh, I always like to
remember who in the end won that race.

507
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,200
So thank you very much for your time.
We'll have some questions.

508
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,193
Thank you.

509
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,540
I do have a question to start with,

510
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:57,120
but people please think
of questions for Dr Suite.

511
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,720
So you're here at Google and a big focus
for us now is machine learning and AI,

512
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,840
which is being applied to all facets of
human endeavor and actually creating a

513
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:11,400
lot of breakthroughs.
Um,

514
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,480
do you have any thoughts on how machine
learning and AI could in fact play a

515
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:23,130
role in solving this problem
with electronic medical
health records that lose

516
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:23,970
the story?

517
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,040
Dr Spending too much time as data
entry clerks in thoughts on that?

518
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,350
Yeah, I do. So, so that's really
the issue of the hour, right?

519
00:33:32,351 --> 00:33:34,480
There's 1100 different electronic
health records systems,

520
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:37,870
but they all look exactly the same.
They're all fundamentally the same.

521
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,750
And um,

522
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,480
they all lose the story there.

523
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:47,710
Little bits of information. They're
boxes that the docs have filled out.

524
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,070
The old paper charts,
we're basically books.

525
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,060
They were basically books and they
preserve the story of that patient.

526
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,450
They were books because they had pages
and they went through time that a

527
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:01,210
beginning and a middle and an end.

528
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,680
And this was incredibly useful as a doc
because you could go through and you

529
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:09,150
could read about how the patient first
come in and the things that were done and

530
00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:12,220
with the nurse thought and with the social
worker didn't what meds they were on,

531
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:13,030
what labs.

532
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,620
It was very useful for preserving
the story and then what happened when

533
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:20,710
electronic health records came in
because they were built on this buidling

534
00:34:20,711 --> 00:34:22,480
platform,
electronic health or as a,

535
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:27,130
we look at today with the doctors all
looking at a screen and it's a screen with

536
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,040
boxes and alerts and Login,

537
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,650
so the dog is sitting
there logging things in.

538
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,780
Pharmacies got a whole different section,

539
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,680
nursing as a different section and these
are all little boxes and you cannot

540
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:43,090
figure out from the electronic health
records what's gone wrong with the person.

541
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,130
I know this because my own father got
sick a couple of years ago and was

542
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:53,050
admitted to a hospital with the wrong
diagnosis and this particular hospital at

543
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:53,471
the time,

544
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:57,340
the doctors and nurses were actually
reading God's hotel and their book club,

545
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,270
so I was a bit of a VIP.
Nevertheless,

546
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,310
I could not get those docs
to change his diagnosis.

547
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,950
They'd thought he'd had a stroke,
but he hadn't had a stroke.

548
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,010
He has a seizure and he had a history
of seizures and we all knew he had

549
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:16,900
seizures. I couldn't get them to
focus. They even tried to change the,

550
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:19,750
the, the, the diagnosis and
the electronic health record,

551
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,980
but they couldn't change it.

552
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,950
So every time a new shift of
doctors and nurses came down,

553
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,120
they continued to treat my dad with,
uh, the treatment for a stroke.

554
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,100
And eventually he was on so much medicine,

555
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,650
medicine for the stroke and then medicine
for the side effects of the medicine

556
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:37,000
for the stroke and the
medicine to the blood,

557
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,000
kind of this sort of thing that he was
clearly going to die in the hospital.

558
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,110
So I was rather worried about him and I
realized the only way I could really get

559
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:49,410
them out of the hospital was to convince
the doctors that we thought we had

560
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:52,230
decided he was a hospice
level, uh, patient.

561
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:56,430
And we were wanting to just let him die.
So once they accepted that,

562
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:57,450
they let us take him home.

563
00:35:57,451 --> 00:36:01,410
And I took him off all the medicines that
he was on and he had his 95th birthday

564
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:05,610
last about two months ago and cut
his own cake with a very large knife.

565
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:09,060
I might add. He did it on purpose. Um,

566
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,580
so I thought perhaps I'd missed something,
right because I couldn't,

567
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,780
there was no chart for me to
look at and I was worried, well,

568
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,440
maybe did have a stroke.
I mean, maybe I'm wrong.

569
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:22,530
So I asked for those
electronic health records,

570
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,620
his electronic records from 10 days
and I got them and it was amazing.

571
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,000
I took me four hours to go through those
electronic health records of my dad's.

572
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,950
There were 810 pages.

573
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,370
I had two questions I
was trying to answer.

574
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:43,260
What medications was he on at any
particular time and why had they made the

575
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:47,070
diagnosis of stroke?
And I could not figure it out.

576
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,960
I couldn't figure out anything.
It was just page after page of,

577
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,510
it was just,
there was no way,

578
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:56,490
and I spent four hours and I
knew what I was looking for.

579
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,730
So nobody who came to see him when
they looked at those electronic health

580
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:02,220
records could possibly a figured
out what was wrong with him.

581
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,950
So when you compare these beautiful
old fashioned paper charts,

582
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,113
it would have been easy.

583
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,780
I would have just gone through and looked
at as original diagnosis how we got it.

584
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,390
I would have turned back
and looked at the labs,

585
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:17,790
which would have been in a section,
I would have looked at the x rays,

586
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,290
I could have seen the nurse's notes,

587
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,600
I could have followed
the doctor's narrative.

588
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,880
I could have followed this
story would have been a snap.

589
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,670
So my idea is that we take this model,

590
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,380
this old fashioned model that's made
out of paper and we just turned it into

591
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:38,730
electronics, right? So we have
an electronic paper chart,

592
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,960
um, that preserves the story.
And how would we do that? Well,

593
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,890
so my imagination is that we have, we
already had this technology, right?

594
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,780
It's called an Ebook,
right?

595
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,550
So why not just use this idea of an
ebook for our electronic health record?

596
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,100
So if you, for instance, came into
my office, you're a new patient.

597
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:01,080
We have some Hipaa privacy protected cloud
that I can take a new chart out of it.

598
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:04,830
That's your chart and it looks like a book
like look books. It's on the computer,

599
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:07,650
but it looks like a book.
Right. And I should be able to,

600
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,490
I think I should be able to,
if I want, if I like to write,

601
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:15,240
how come I can't like handwrite a note
or if I like to dictate why can't,

602
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:18,390
if I like to type, I should be able to
do that. If I want to write in French,

603
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:20,070
I should be able to do that.
Right?

604
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:23,730
I should be able to write the narrative
of what happens and my physical exam,

605
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,740
I should be able to turn that chart
around, go look at fluffy the chart.

606
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:32,340
Right? Why can't we do that? And then that
would mean that if we did it this way,

607
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:35,070
then when I'm done with your chart,
I put it back in the cloud.

608
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,150
Let's suppose you have to
go to the emergency room.

609
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,870
They can just go take that
chart out of the cloud. Right.

610
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,460
And and write right it with themselves.
I'm sure we can do that.

611
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:50,110
Um, and so then the problem becomes, well,
what do we do? Because these electric,

612
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:52,390
one of the reasons electronic health
records have been used this ways for

613
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:56,410
billing. And the second
reason is because of big data,

614
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,320
right?
Big Debt is very valuable.

615
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:03,550
This idea that you can
figure out instantly how many
patients have hypertension

616
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:08,230
or what, how many patients this, this
kind of information is very valuable.

617
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,030
Uh, just financially it's very valuable.
Twilio, the marketing is valuable,

618
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:13,900
but pharmaceuticals,

619
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:17,680
it's value in the healthcare industry as
a whole to right now what we have is we

620
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:22,450
have the docs acting fundamentally as
data care providers. That's what we do.

621
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:27,160
We had a care provider, that's
a new one, right? We put,

622
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:28,150
that's our job.

623
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,610
We spend 110% of our time in front of
the electronic health records simply

624
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:38,611
entering data so that big data can be
produced so that big data can be sold and

625
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:43,240
used by these companies.
And so what I don't seem to me,

626
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,860
Becca and I have actually talked
about this, is with art. If,

627
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:50,110
if artificial intelligence can
do all these marvelous things,

628
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:55,620
why can't they take my handwritten
notes and all this stuff and just stick

629
00:39:55,721 --> 00:40:00,400
artificial intelligence
between the unnecessary big
data and my electronic paper

630
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:00,880
chart.

631
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,780
And if artificial intelligence turned
my chart into all the big data you want,

632
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,470
why do I have to do it
works for me.

633
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:14,410
So that is a, that is a your challenge.
Yes. That's why I challenge Google. Okay.

634
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:16,450
But the gauntlet is now thrown.
Yes.

635
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:19,750
I think we should do that because if we
could do that, it would be phenomenal.

636
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,540
We could have doctors who could
spend two and a half minutes,

637
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:26,300
we'd have our 12 and a half minutes
back with patients to examine them.

638
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,230
The big data people who
like all that stuff,

639
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:34,150
they'd still be happy and you
guys could do something fantastic.

640
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:37,630
And I think it would be very interesting
for artificial intelligence to look at

641
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:39,400
that as a problem.
Right.

642
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,110
So I have one more question,

643
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:44,560
but then I want to want to
let other people do it too.
So in the news this week,

644
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,060
um,
I think it was just like yesterday,

645
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,070
the day before was suddenly now
announced that some of the health,

646
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,450
you know,
policy setters are,

647
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,930
have changed the standard for hypertension
and they've lowered the level of your

648
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:07,561
blood pressure at which they consider
that you have a problem and should go on

649
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:10,084
medication.

650
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,600
And I think I saw yesterday that now
50% of the adult population is now

651
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:18,040
considered hypertensive.

652
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,990
And in fact then I heard on NPR last
night something about someone who was sort

653
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:26,200
of an apologist for this was saying,
but it's okay.

654
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:30,880
We've determined that it's safe to
medicate people at these lower levels of

655
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:34,010
blood pressure. So it's
fine. I that alarming

656
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,560
and I just wondered if you
had any thoughts on this.

657
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,670
Okay.

658
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,480
Yes, I do have thoughts. Well, well,

659
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:44,520
so my first thought actually was,

660
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,760
so they've been doing this
for decades and decades,

661
00:41:47,761 --> 00:41:52,260
so long ago when I was in medical
school and they had actually,

662
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,560
okay.

663
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,760
So the way the docs
determine what's, what's, uh,

664
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,330
what's high and what's low is
we don't really know. Actually,

665
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:04,590
it's mostly statistical.

666
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,420
We basically decide one standard
deviation from the mean or two standard

667
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:11,310
deviations from the mean by definition.

668
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:14,400
That's that's what we do
because we don't a priori,

669
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:17,160
we wouldn't know what a normal sodium
is though we didn't even know in normal

670
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:22,161
sodium as we do billions of sodiums and
people and then we declare these to be

671
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:26,490
normal within let's say one standard
deviation and everything else to be

672
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:30,120
abnormal and then sometimes we'll be
able to connect up a disease state or a

673
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:34,920
symptom with those abnormalities.
Yes, so with hypertension,

674
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:40,130
that was done in around the 60s and
seventies and the original definition of

675
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,390
hypertension was actually,

676
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,960
I may be one of the only people that
remember this was actually about 180 over

677
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:48,660
110 I was two standard
deviations from the mean.

678
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:50,750
Okay,

679
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,460
so that,

680
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:57,461
and that was correlated with significant
kidney problems when you have the high

681
00:42:57,891 --> 00:42:59,980
blood pressure,
heart problems and extra strokes.

682
00:42:59,981 --> 00:43:04,981
So that actually was actually shown
is evidence then over the years.

683
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:07,430
But that doesn't, that's two
standard deviations. What do you get?

684
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:11,120
7% of the people who are taking your
medications, right? That's not very much.

685
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,470
Right.
That's not very good.

686
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,440
So about about 20 years
ago that they lowered the,

687
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,440
they just randomly lowered and said,

688
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,870
well now it's going to be one
standard deviation from the mean,

689
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:24,110
which is 160 over 90
which nobody has ever,

690
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:26,510
ever correlated with actual damage,

691
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:29,960
but they just assumed if really
high blood pressure was bad,

692
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:34,580
then kind of this, this was still high.
It was one standard deviation mean well.

693
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:39,560
So then we had an an epidemic of high
blood pressure because suddenly we had 15%

694
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:43,040
of people had rights. Touristically
you guys are all mathematicians.

695
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,530
Once you go from two standard
deviations to one standard deviation,

696
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:47,570
you have 15% so you,
oh my God,

697
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:50,750
we have this epidemic because he used
to be 7% of people that hypertension,

698
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:55,730
now 15% of hypertension. So, but then we
have 15% more people taking medications,

699
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:59,730
which is very useful. So then
about think you're being sarcastic.

700
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:04,731
15 years ago we declared that
140 over 90 was a hypertension.

701
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,620
So then we had about 20% of
people were now hypertensive.

702
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:14,621
About 20% of people and
then the cardiologist got
together and decided that any

703
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:17,510
amount of blood pressure was bad for you.
They did.

704
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,550
Did remember they did do that.
Um,

705
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,960
but this is that they didn't really
officially declare it into this last week

706
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,650
where they've lowered it
once again down to one 30,

707
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,220
which falls actually with
way within the mean, right?

708
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:33,210
The mean of a blood pressure.

709
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:38,450
So consequently 50% of it's not
surprising that 50% of people now have

710
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:42,320
hypertension with a definition.
How would they not? Right.

711
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,650
Just statistically,

712
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,630
and that means 50% of people are
going to be on medications and um,

713
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,350
do these medications have side effects?
Yes,

714
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,000
they all have side effects. Okay.
Anyway, I, I'm asking too many questions.

715
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,930
Anyone else have a question for Dr
Suite or comment? Comment, comment?

716
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:07,290
I have a microphone. Okay,
great. Yeah, go ahead.

717
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:08,983
Yeah.
Actually

718
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,670
how much does that mean shifting
over time though, since the 60s.

719
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,480
What do you mean what you said it's so
many standard deviations from the mean.

720
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,770
That's right now

721
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,320
is that the itself over time?
So the main I switched you're saying?

722
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,130
That's a really interesting question.
That's actually a very good question.

723
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:33,190
As far as I know the mean is still the
average ish is still about one 20 over 70

724
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,550
as far as I know. I mean that's
actually a real interesting question.

725
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,250
I don't know the answer to that.
I don't know if anybody does.

726
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,840
Do you know what you mean offhand?

727
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,310
I think it's still one 20 over 70 it's
just they keep coming down just like

728
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:50,270
they've done with statens. It's exactly
the same model. I mean status you're,

729
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,290
you're elevated cholesterol
was two standard deviations
from the mean which was

730
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:55,260
going to be an Ldl,

731
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:59,990
the bad cholesterol of like 180 right
and then they went to 160 and then they

732
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:03,710
went to 130 which again
meant that 50% of the people,

733
00:46:03,711 --> 00:46:08,090
not surprising where hypercholesterolemic
because that was like within 50% of

734
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:11,930
the people had an Ldl of one 30 and
then the cardiologist declared that it

735
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:15,530
doesn't really matter and we should
have as low cholesterol as possible.

736
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,190
Even though the white matter of your
brain is white because it's made out of

737
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:26,510
cholesterol
and okay.

738
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,000
You want me puts in and your sex
hormones are made out of cholesterol.

739
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:34,390
Vitamin D is actually, you know,
d one d hydroxy cholesterol, so,

740
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,820
okay. Yes. All right. Um, mescaline. Yup.

741
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,300
I get your name right.
It's selling

742
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,590
Selene. Yes, correct.

743
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:48,750
So I will say my question about forms
and administrators for later maybe,

744
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:53,710
um, but I'm, I'm more curious, but maybe,
maybe I'll start with the preface that,

745
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:54,310
you know,

746
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,400
we're a part of a technology company
and it certainly feels like the world is

747
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:00,930
moving faster and faster and we want to,
you know,

748
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,150
whether it's multitasking or
enabling people to move faster,

749
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,400
you put a lot of onus on the
medical system and doctors
to slow the system down.

750
00:47:09,401 --> 00:47:12,900
It seems like to not treat the
body like a machine yet. What,

751
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,740
what are your thoughts from a
patient's perspective? Um, the, the,

752
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:21,280
the ability to take some ibuprofens when
I have a headache and solve the problem

753
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,210
is, you know, it's nice to hand
that off to the doctor and say,

754
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:28,120
why are you prescribing me? I prefer
orphans, but I can get this off the shelf.

755
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:33,670
How do patients approach
medicine differently and
slow things down and look for

756
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:36,300
longer solutions, more
holistic solutions? Okay.

757
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:39,600
That's a really thoughtful
question. Thank you. Um,

758
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,160
well,
you know what I would say is this,

759
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,720
I think there's actually two flavors of
patients to believers or people really.

760
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:52,880
Some people really like medications.
They like manZ , like labs.

761
00:47:52,881 --> 00:47:55,870
They like going to the doctor, they
like, they just like it, they like meds.

762
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,170
And then there's a whole other group
that don't like meds of which I happen to

763
00:47:59,171 --> 00:47:59,651
belong to them.

764
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:03,580
And what usually happens with docs
in an open system is the docs like to

765
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:06,820
prescribe meds and just
naturally practice this way.

766
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,310
Collect patients who liked
to have medications. There's,

767
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,430
there's a whole lot of people
believe in meds, right?

768
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,580
But I'm not one of them either
as a doctor or as a patient.

769
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:19,780
And I would tend to collect patients who
think like me. So I don't think it's,

770
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,760
you know,
just one or the other.

771
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,650
I think for the people who are
reluctant to take meds, um,

772
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,740
they don't usually take
meds you very much.

773
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,650
And if they can get away with just
taking something off the shelf,

774
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:35,470
sort of why not? Um, so,

775
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:36,850
okay.

776
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:40,630
I think that's how we would answer
that question. I'm not sure if I get,

777
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,590
if I got to the nub of it, which, cause
you started out with talking about,

778
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,030
you know, everything moving faster
and faster and that is a patient,

779
00:48:50,031 --> 00:48:54,270
how can you get things to slow down in
an [inaudible]? He thinks his patient,

780
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,320
it says a person. I mean,
I think, so. This is again,

781
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:01,400
maybe a little off from me talking about,
but you know,

782
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,970
I think as far as our health goes,

783
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:09,971
we couldn't live in a society that was
more difficult to be sane and centered

784
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,080
and enjoy your life then the
society we live in right now.

785
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:16,410
Okay.

786
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:19,710
And I think, you know, sane
actually is from Sonos,

787
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:24,330
which means healthy inland and health,

788
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:28,020
which has solos actually
is connected to salvation.

789
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:35,130
Then I like the one that's hello,
which actually means health to you.

790
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,990
Cause the old English hall was held
and they're all related to this idea of

791
00:49:39,991 --> 00:49:40,824
wholeness.

792
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:45,360
So Paul and how and how health and wealth,

793
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,520
I think I could looked that up your,
but I decided the other day,

794
00:49:47,521 --> 00:49:50,880
I think wealth fits into
this wholeness model.

795
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,950
We're fragmented, our attention
is fragmented. Our, our,

796
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,970
we're just in this kind of piecemeal
sort of state and I think it's not a good

797
00:49:59,971 --> 00:50:00,804
state to be in.

798
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,910
Another question, building on sleeves
thing. I think he says, you know,

799
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,490
I think it's separating
symptom from the source.

800
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,770
So if you have a headache
and that's a symptom,

801
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,220
you said I can take an Advil and that
will go away and you can just keep doing

802
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,890
that for awhile,
but you're not addressing the root cause.

803
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:24,200
So if I can treat a symptom I'll do with
myself, but if I can't get past that,

804
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,680
then that's where I go to. The doctor
helped me figure out what's going on.

805
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,490
Great answer. Thank you. Won't
you're supposed to comment on,

806
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:36,160
oh, I'm totally good with
it. It's exactly right.

807
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:40,840
That's exactly it is. If you can make it
go away on your own and that's, you know,

808
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:44,380
then I don't have a problem with that
actually. I think that's a good way to go.

809
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,800
That's your measure of efficiency though.

810
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:48,740
Are you looking at church and efficiencies
through that headache? Headache today?

811
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:52,370
It took a bill and went away.
I looks like it's extremely efficient,

812
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:56,540
but if every single day I'm taking this
pill and I'm constantly dealing with

813
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,430
that over the longterm,

814
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,530
that's extremely inefficient and
if I treat the source of that,

815
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,120
it takes me longer to treat the source,

816
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,840
but it solves it for much longer duration
and therefore it's much more efficient

817
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:06,674
in the loan.

818
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:12,000
Could answer. I just, it's super
thank you. Two so means point.

819
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:17,060
I think it's very hard for certain
segment of patients to get over that.

820
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:19,700
They want the quick fix.

821
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:24,620
So in some ways many physicians
respond to that by prescribing.

822
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:27,740
You know, I think many of, and
I speak as a physician myself,

823
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:31,820
many of us would like to sit down,
talk to our patients, spend time,

824
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,790
and sometimes patients like me, you
know, talk, I don't have time for this.

825
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,130
I'm not gonna invest in my health
care. I just want, you know,

826
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,780
give me the antidepressant
and I'll feel better.

827
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:41,390
And I have time for therapy later,
but I don't have time for that right now.

828
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,140
So I think there's this whole sea change
that has to also start from paint the

829
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:49,670
patient point of view, actually wanting
to invest time in there and themselves.

830
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:53,840
So if you ever see a thousand
patients, you don't have time. Correct.

831
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:59,750
Anyone else? One last question maybe. Um,

832
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:03,210
do you feel that you
as a clinician that a,

833
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:07,540
you are alone in this or as you go around
and you're talking with other doctors

834
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,220
and nurses and so on around the country,

835
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:13,960
is this message of slow
Madison resonating?

836
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:14,920
Okay.

837
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,790
Yeah, it sure is. And I,

838
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:21,400
I sometimes wish I was a lot more about
the general rather than a philosopher

839
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:26,200
because there's a whole movement
that is brewing out there is,

840
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:31,201
there's so much frustration among
doctors and nurses especially,

841
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,490
I mean as much nurses,

842
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:37,750
doctors that were just stuck
in front of the computer.

843
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,740
It's just maddening.
So there's a huge,

844
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,320
I I've spoken to like
thousands of people by now.

845
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:48,100
I mean personally in all these different
talks and everybody wants something

846
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:48,611
done about it,

847
00:52:48,611 --> 00:52:50,770
which is one of the things I thought
about the electronic health records and

848
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:53,380
getting, because that would at
least get us off the computer.

849
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,120
It's not complicated.

850
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,470
I don't think it's as complicated as
solution as it looks like at first.

851
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,780
If we can just get back the time.

852
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,260
Okay. Yeah, sure.

853
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,110
Since we're at Google,
um,

854
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:15,300
be curious about your comment on the use
of Google glass in the doctor patient

855
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:16,121
setting.

856
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:20,740
So clinic that I will not name has
now gone to using Google glasses.

857
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:22,690
So you walk into the clinic room,

858
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:27,660
your doctor has a Google glass on and on
the other side of the Google glass is a

859
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:30,960
transcriptionist probably in India,
somewhere outsourced.

860
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:35,160
That is documenting every single word
that it occurs between you and your

861
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:39,570
position during that encounter.
So it's some ways its off sitting,

862
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:43,140
it's taking more time. The doctor
doesn't have to do the data entry,

863
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,590
but there's this third person in the
room through the Google glass that you're

864
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:50,880
wonderful. An amazing company has
enabled doctors to use this technology,

865
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:54,240
but it has affected the
doctor patient interaction.

866
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,200
Many of my colleagues who are using it
claim that it's given back their lives,

867
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,500
that they're now completing all of their
charting within the course of the day.

868
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:03,930
They're going home and they're not taking
their charts home with them because

869
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:07,530
they don't have to because everything is
transcribed for them. But I'm wondering,

870
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:10,830
you know from all of you and from you
what your perspective on this as a

871
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,450
possible solution would be.

872
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:20,060
That seems to me, not a solution
but impossible problem. I mean,

873
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:25,310
I just, you know, it's like I was just
horrified when I, when I heard about that.

874
00:54:25,311 --> 00:54:25,581
I mean,

875
00:54:25,581 --> 00:54:30,581
I can't imagine anything worse than
going into my patient like this.

876
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,173
Hi,

877
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,720
I'm doctor [inaudible] and trying to
look at the Google glass in their records

878
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:40,340
out of the corner of my eye,
it just seems whacked. Um,

879
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:44,420
there is something called the scribe,
which gives me the same feeling,

880
00:54:44,421 --> 00:54:47,000
which is doctors, so they don't
have to sit in front of computer.

881
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,050
Now there's an actual physical third
person who follows you in the room and

882
00:54:51,051 --> 00:54:54,860
fills out your electronic health records
while you supposedly are talking with a

883
00:54:54,861 --> 00:54:57,590
patient, which is a lot
better solution, I think,

884
00:54:57,591 --> 00:55:01,490
than the Google glass where at least
you're physically looking at the person.

885
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,820
But Rebecca,
do you have any thoughts on Google?

886
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:04,990
Well,
actually I,

887
00:55:04,991 --> 00:55:09,991
I had a clinician who wanted to do that
and I was uncomfortable and she did give

888
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:13,080
me an option that you didn't mention,

889
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:17,070
which is what I was uncomfortable with
was Google glass is about looking at

890
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:17,341
things.

891
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:22,341
It's not just about audio transcription
and so it could be beaming images.

892
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,520
Right.

893
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,420
Which feels like it could be a violation
of the page and patients' privacy.

894
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,430
So there were two modes.

895
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:34,110
So the mode that I allowed her
to use was just recording audio.

896
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:39,320
But even so that I where I felt as an
imposition in that trust relationship.

897
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,020
Okay.

898
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,790
Personal anyway. Anything
else? Oh yes please.

899
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,830
That you have to have a paper trial,

900
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,980
absolutely everything and that that's
part of what's inhibiting your efficiency.

901
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,580
Can you say that a little bit?

902
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:03,590
How much of it is driven by legal reasons
and not like big data and collecting?

903
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:08,840
Oh, I see what you're having in paper
towel and yes, he says, well we have,

904
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:13,850
you know, we do like to document things
for, you know, for malpractice reasons,

905
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:16,730
but if you just handwrite it,
it's perfectly fine.

906
00:56:16,731 --> 00:56:21,080
Doesn't have to be in a
computer per se at all. Um,

907
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:26,620
so there's no reason that we have to
have a clumsy electronic health record.

908
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,730
It takes all our time and produces
big data in order to document.

909
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,290
It's actually a much better documentation
if I actually write the story about

910
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:35,880
you.
You know,

911
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,480
this 32 year old woman came
in with chronic headaches
and I thought this and we

912
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:44,950
did this and this is what I think it is
kind of story than it is to have what I

913
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:49,480
found with my father, which was
incomprehensible. So it's not,

914
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:53,890
that's not the legal thing. There is
a legal piece that the United States,

915
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:58,120
the one reason we've gone to having
electronic health records was then in 2009

916
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,810
there was hidden in the
reconstructing America Act.

917
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:06,460
This little infant, they
called it, sorry, uh, this,

918
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:11,461
this little sub La thingy that every
doctor that has anything to do with the

919
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:14,440
federal government I think has to
have their electronic health records.

920
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,960
That's how it happened.
It didn't happen gradually.

921
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:20,710
It was like 2009 then they would start
taking money out of your practice if you

922
00:57:20,711 --> 00:57:22,390
didn't have electronic records.

923
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:27,160
So it was one of the reasons that suddenly
they took this billing platform and

924
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:30,160
just immediately tried to add
things on so they could sell it.

925
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:33,640
The doctors and the doctors can do that.
So there is some legal piece of that,

926
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,660
but it isn't so much like getting Sudi
kind of thing. It's more like government.

927
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:42,010
I do want to point out that Dr Suite
has one of the few people on the planet

928
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:44,830
who's actually read the
entire affordable care act,

929
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,800
922 single spaced pages.

930
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:52,060
It's as long as Harrison's principles of
internal medicine. Okay. On that note,

931
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,460
thank you very much.
Thank you very much for having me.
