1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,540
Please join me in welcoming
Susan to go go over.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,660
We're really delighted to have her.

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,623
Yeah,

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,050
that's great.
To be back.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,310
Yesterday was so much fun and I see some
repeat basis people who brought their

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,153
partners.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,380
So
it's my joy to do this work.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,040
It's my joy to speak with parents about
perhaps the most important thing going

9
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:40,730
on in our lives. Yes, we care very
much about the world, the planet,

10
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,090
our careers,
our jobs.

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,490
But something happens to
us then we become a parent.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,050
That's the changes as a
reference. I mean, I know for me,

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,970
um, when I became a
mother, actually I had a,

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,790
when I went into labor, I, I really didn't
know it was going to be that intense.

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,350
So after the second,
I think the second contraction,

16
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,330
I told my then husband,
um, I've changed my mind.

17
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,800
I don't want to do this actually.

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,400
And 27 hours later and nine
and a half pounds later,

19
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,170
I became a mother and
I'm,

20
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,040
I'm a different human being
in every possible way.

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,290
Not only because of the love that was

22
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,810
birthed in my heart,
but also because no one,

23
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,250
I don't know if this is your experience,

24
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:47,970
but nobody can push your
buttons or challenge you,

25
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,710
like your children. I'm
getting a lot of nods, lousy.

26
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,790
You know what I'm talking about

27
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,290
because not only are we really not
all that prepared for what it is to be

28
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:06,411
responsible for the unrelenting
demands of other people all the time,

29
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,293
but

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,570
also, you know, we're the same species.

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,650
We don't become a different
species when we become a parent.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,500
So we're still getting tired,
overwhelmed.

33
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:23,920
We still have our baggage
from our own upbringing,

34
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,980
feeling overpowered or
invisible or whatever our
particular flavor of challenge

35
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:32,260
might've been as a child.

36
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,610
And so when we become a parent,

37
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,530
we have this opportunity to
grow our children, raise them,

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,300
but also to grow ourselves.
And that's one of the,

39
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,410
the gifts of this work. And one of the
reasons I have so much fun doing it.

40
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:51,880
I speak all over the world.

41
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,160
I've delivered the same
talk or as similar in,

42
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,840
in almost every continent.

43
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,770
And then I do as as or
Tico said a lot online.

44
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,000
We have a lot of programs.

45
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:08,620
I have a monthly membership where I've
got people from every country that meet

46
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,560
with me every month for you know,
not very many dollars a month.

47
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,080
We just talk about whatever's up for them.

48
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,820
So I'm working with parents now for
you to progressively to help them

49
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,150
internalize what we're
learning because the truth is

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,080
okay

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,820
the things I teach work really well.

52
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:29,000
In fact we were talking this morning
cause I did a three hour workshop here at

53
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,610
Google yesterday and then,

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,750
and I've also done some other talks in
the area of various organizations and

55
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:40,220
churches and schools and people
try something the next day.

56
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:45,221
And you were saying just this one little
adjustment avoided a meltdown with her

57
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,600
two and a half year old or maybe
two year old. Right. And, and how,

58
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,610
even though it isn't intuitive,

59
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:56,090
the things I'm going to teach you
today may not be how you were raised.

60
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,610
It's not rocket science.

61
00:03:58,611 --> 00:04:03,611
It's not that difficult to begin doing
it in a parenting in a way that both

62
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,050
reassures our kids that there is a grownup
in the room, which is very comforting.

63
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,930
And that also

64
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,770
preserves the love and the connection.
A lot of us were good kids, right?

65
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:21,410
We cooperated, our parents
said do something, we did it,

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,480
but sometimes that came at a cost.

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,080
Sometimes we got sneaky and we just went
underground about the thing we wanted

68
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,930
to do that they were
preventing us from doing.

69
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,310
Or sometimes we just built up resentment
we did, or, or worse, maybe not worse,

70
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,300
but we would also,

71
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,230
when we were in trouble or struggling
with something and we needed a sane person

72
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:45,170
to sort out the tangle
moments of our life,

73
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,360
we would turn to our friends instead of
our parents who had life experience and

74
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:54,380
who, who. So you know, hopefully
cared about our best intent.

75
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,750
So my work is very much about holding a
place for our children that allows us to

76
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:02,840
parent them, guide them, support them.

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,010
Yeah.

78
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,690
Uh, and continue to build a very
deep and strong connection with them.

79
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:12,840
So I'm going to go over a few things
today and then we'll have some questions.

80
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,850
And let me start by giving you the,
the initial piece,

81
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,250
the fundamental piece of my work.

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,960
And that is that I believe that parents
need to be what I call the captain of

83
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,550
this ship for their children.

84
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,020
That means not that you're
in control of your children.

85
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:33,390
I am definitely not advocating control.

86
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,760
I'm about being in charge,
being the person that they can turn to.

87
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:43,320
If you're using this nautical theme
of captain of the ship, you know,

88
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:47,580
if you're on a ship and
you hear this alarm go off,

89
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,380
you don't want the captain leaping over
the side of the ship because he or she

90
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:57,240
doesn't know what to do or as overwhelmed.
You want the captain who's steady,

91
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,880
who's calm,
who's competent,

92
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,640
who can handle the news that there was
a leak or that there's a heavy storm

93
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,500
ahead and does it jump ship. I
guess that's the term, right?

94
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
And so the idea,

95
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:16,270
I'm going to demonstrate a very simple
hand motion for you so that you can

96
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:20,080
remember it. And lots of people telling
me that they, they and their partner,

97
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,270
we'll end up using these signals behind
the Tillman to that just to reinforce

98
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,130
and remind themselves of holding
this place for their children.

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,170
Even when our buttons are getting pushed.

100
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,240
My right hand's going to represent the
parents and my left hand will be the

101
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:40,330
child. Okay. Parent Child,

102
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:45,010
I have a watch on the child and if
that helps. So the child might say,

103
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,840
um, maybe your, your nine
year old says, Daddy,

104
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:54,841
I want to watch horror movies
from hell tonight at 11 o'clock.

105
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,190
And you say, Oh, well
I'm afraid not, you know,

106
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,560
because as the parent, as a captain,
that's not a good idea. You, you know,

107
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:07,650
you have a child who is very
impressionable. Images are very powerful.

108
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,250
This is a kid is not going to sleep for
the next six months if he watches horror

109
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:16,230
nights from hell. So you say, well, I'm
afraid not. And the child says, why not?

110
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,530
And you say, now watch this carefully
because you'll have that dream.

111
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,810
No, I won't. Yeah.

112
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,010
You watched a movie that wasn't nearly
that scary and you couldn't sleep for

113
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:33,870
days. I know, but that movie had man pyres
and the blood was oozing. This movie,

114
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,250
all my friends have seen it and there is
no vampire oozing blood in this movie.

115
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,500
Well honey, it's not about the oozing
blood. So who's in charge here?

116
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:48,240
You guys? No one. Nobody's in charge here.

117
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,290
So I called this the captain of the ship.
When you go here,

118
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:57,180
I call this the two lawyers,
the two lawyers.

119
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,110
This is where you're arguing.
You're each arguing for your position.

120
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,030
One is defending against guess the other
usually rational thought and arguments

121
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,610
to try and convince the other
person of why you're right.

122
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,910
Does that sound familiar to any of you?
Parents say,

123
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,170
oh, I lived there, but wait, there's a,

124
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,000
another evolves even further.

125
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,860
If you don't let me watch that movie.

126
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,780
I'm not doing my homework or I'm not
doing my chores or I'm not going to feed

127
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:34,160
the dog or I'm going to go be tease my
brother, you know, knocked down his tower.

128
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,230
And now you're down here
and you're,

129
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,000
you're feeling internally,
how are you feeling when
you're, when you're like that?

130
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:49,001
Like your child is attempting to put
you into the corner holding you hostage,

131
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,440
desperate, angry,
disrespected, out of control.

132
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,540
And from this place,
which I call the dictator,

133
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,490
because dictators don't have authentic
power. They have no genuine authority.

134
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,040
They ruled by fear and intimidation.

135
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,440
They can wipe out bank accounts through
your family and prison. Take your home,

136
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:17,160
confiscate your possessions.
So it looks, it's full power,

137
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:21,330
but they don't have any genuine power.
But from down here in the dictator mode,

138
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:26,331
you will bribe or threatened because
you feel overwhelmed and you feel out of

139
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:32,340
control. And in an attempt to feel
in control again. But remember,

140
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:34,680
this is not about control.
This has been in charge.

141
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,800
You will assert your way, but that
comes at a cost because your child,

142
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,800
now, as I said, there can be
resentment. There can be fear.

143
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,710
None of us like to be intimidated into
doing what we're being asked to do. Do we?

144
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,560
So captain of the ship to lawyers,

145
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,873
dictator,

146
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,950
everything that I teach and all these
Richard had talked about the summits and

147
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:05,220
the membership program and the
classes I do online classes,

148
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,800
everything is about this

149
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,800
because when we come
alongside our children, okay,

150
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:18,801
so this is my little hand motion rather
than at our children as the lawyer who

151
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:24,321
argued or as the dictator who threatened
when we come alongside them as that

152
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,340
confident happen,
life is so much easier.

153
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,280
They want to say yes, they want to
cooperate. They look to us for guidance,

154
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,680
they're receptive to our wisdom.
It's so much easier to parents.

155
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,530
So I want to do a quick demonstration.

156
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:47,320
Would you come up and have I prepared
you or anything? Okay. Nope. Nope.

157
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,810
So he's not been primed.

158
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,440
All I want you to do is face me right
there and if you put your hands out, okay.

159
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:57,030
Ready? Okay, great. Okay.

160
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,040
Thank you so much. Would they rather
have a pause or did I ask you to push?

161
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,580
No, no, but you pushed.

162
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,100
And I've done this in every part of
every part of the world.

163
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,980
Okay. And without exception,
everyone pushed it.

164
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,390
So it's not, I'm not. Yes, he shouldn't
have pushed. That's your instinct.

165
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,610
And the reason for this is that we push
against that which pushes against us.

166
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,100
That's how we're wired.
So when I began to push against him,

167
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,780
of course he was going to push back.
Now if you were in the martial arts field,

168
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,820
which some of you may be,

169
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,450
I suppose you know that you could just
move out of the way and let me fall

170
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:49,270
forward of my own momentum.
But we're not wired like that.

171
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,740
So when you come at your child
from lawyer mode or from dictator,

172
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,820
they are going to push back.

173
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,540
If you'd like to have power struggles
with your children, if that's your goal,

174
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,050
come at them.
Why didn't you start your homework?

175
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,030
Of course you can't go see that movie.

176
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,430
How many times have I told
you to brush your teeth?

177
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,160
All of those are push and you will
more often than not get pushed back.

178
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,230
And there is a better way. I mean, that's
the thing. If there was no other option,

179
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,910
then I would say, oh well we all
turned out all right, it's fine.

180
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,370
But since there's a way to parent our
children staying present, staying in, uh,

181
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,190
you know, you know, more receptive,
creating more receptivity.

182
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,570
I think it's worth exploring
not only because it's so,

183
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,230
it makes the climate in
our home or peaceful and
harmonious and happy and safe.

184
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,910
But here's a, here's the bonus. There's
a bonus to this. We get to heal.

185
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,540
Yeah,

186
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,410
we get to heal.

187
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,850
I know in the raising of my
son doing it differently,

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,730
certain things of course are similar
to the way my parents with me,

189
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,640
but some of these things
as I learned along the way,

190
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:08,480
and I certainly didn't know all this
when he was first around either I'm,

191
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:09,690
I'm a work in progress,

192
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,440
but so much healing has
happened for me internally.

193
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,560
Even beyond therapy.
Just that,

194
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,790
okay,

195
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,850
that this is what it feels like to,
to be,

196
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,160
be watch a child bloom,

197
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,290
watch a child feel they can shine and
be who they're supposed to be and have

198
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:33,990
their own point of view and
feelings. And you know, it's,

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,210
it's a learning process for sure,
but it's a glorious one.

200
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:42,250
So when we're captaining this ship,
things go better.

201
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,580
I want to give you some ideas
for how you can do just that.

202
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,800
The first piece that we know about what
motivates children to see us as that

203
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:56,700
cabin is connection and attachment.

204
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,010
So if I gave this example, remember, um,

205
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,870
let's say that you were part of a,
of a tribe.

206
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,350
And so in times past or in some
other part of the world even today,

207
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:14,811
and your child drifted or wandered over
to the edge of the perimeter of that

208
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:18,420
tribe's territory,
let's say it's your,

209
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,520
your four year old child and a stranger
approaches from the other side says,

210
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,010
Hey, you come with me. Huh? What
do you want your child to do?

211
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,810
Say No.
And who do you want them to run back to?

212
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,220
You? Right? This is a good thing.

213
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:44,900
Okay?

214
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,030
Children,
this is very important,

215
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,990
are wired to resist being bossed.

216
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,880
This last,
in case you hadn't noticed,

217
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,880
children are wired to
resist being bossed around.

218
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,250
The good news is because that would be
highly inconvenient for us as parents.

219
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,270
How do you ever get anything accomplished?
Do they want to brush your teeth? No.

220
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,400
Do they want to do their
homework? No. Do they want, right?

221
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,600
We can override that
instinct by attachment.

222
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,030
So the child runs back to you because
you're the one to whom he or she is

223
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:24,350
connected and we get,
that's the loophole for this.

224
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:30,130
Why is instinct that Mother Nature has
embedded in our children for survival?

225
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:35,090
We don't want them subject
to the influence of those
who might not have their

226
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,290
best interests at heart.

227
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,050
So it's good that they're wired to
resist being bossed around outside that

228
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:46,110
circle. That's safe influence. How do so?

229
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,060
So the way we override that, the way
we foster greater, greater receptivity,

230
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:55,061
greater cooperation begins with as
that captain developing attachment,

231
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:59,840
the way the roots of a
tree go wide and deep.

232
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,520
We s we develop a sturdy
foundation of connection.

233
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,350
So here's the tree,
everyone see the tree above the ground.

234
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,060
There's the tree and below
the tree are the roots.

235
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,920
This is the root system.
Now

236
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,170
the health of a tree is not really,

237
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:25,100
you can't really determine by looking
at what's going on above ground.

238
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:29,600
It's really based on what what's going
on in the ground underneath how wide and

239
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:31,340
how deep and sturdy those roots are.

240
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,230
So there are six stages of attachment
that a child moved through in their first

241
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,720
six years of life and then
continues to go through in life.

242
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,670
I used new felts model, which I think
is an excellent model in my courses in,

243
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,750
in what I teach because it very clearly
illustrates this beautiful journey of

244
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:53,000
bonding and connecting.

245
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,540
And if attachment is weak in
any or all of these areas,

246
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,200
you will see evidence of
that in the child's defiance.

247
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,090
It's not the only reason a child might
be chronically oppositionally defiant.

248
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,300
But if you have a child, when I get a
call for coaching or in our membership,

249
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:17,300
when somebody gets on,
you know, cause you know,

250
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,580
Tommy's just saying no to everything.

251
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,240
One of the first things I'll ask is
what's the quality of the attachment?

252
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,240
So when a baby is born,
the journey of attachment begins.

253
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,680
If you imagine the root just beginning
to enter the ground here, the first

254
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,200
movement into this process is proximity.

255
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,880
That's the first date I talk about
this in the books and then all my other

256
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:46,520
things. But if you taking
notes, it's proximity.

257
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,120
Proximity is the sound of your
voice. It's smell, it's touch.

258
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:55,770
It's very sense oriented because that's
where the infant is starting to connect

259
00:17:55,771 --> 00:18:00,210
with you.
The second state is sameness.

260
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:04,680
So this is how two year old children
acquire language. They mimic you.

261
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,280
They want to be like
you. And if you have, um,

262
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,550
in one of my classes I had the
parent of a 16 year old who is very,

263
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:15,990
very drifting further and further away
toward her friends, away from mom.

264
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,820
And we started to look at where
they had similar interests.

265
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:23,400
And it was photography.
And so she,

266
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,690
she started to do photography with her
daughter sort of seriously pursuing it

267
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,780
and it reconnected them.

268
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,400
And this can be true across the board.
Even if you have a very young child,

269
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:39,080
they like ponies. They like,
I mean they like puppy men.

270
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,940
It is that you,

271
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,890
you look for a place where you have an
interest PR ideally that you share and

272
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,760
you build connection in that way.
The third stage,

273
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:53,590
so the roots are going even wider
and deeper is belonging or loyalty.

274
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,980
And this is the sense of the child
feels that you're on her side.

275
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,290
You know, we see issues
of this. For instance,

276
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,300
if you're the coach of your child's
soccer team and you're the coach,

277
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:10,720
and so from time to time you might have
to treat your child like all the other

278
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:14,440
children and you might have say, hey
dude, you know, you should have done this.

279
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,970
Sometimes kids don't do very well with
that because it compromises their feeling

280
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,220
of loyalty or dad or
mom having their back.

281
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,770
Three year old children in this state
of developing attachment may push their

282
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:30,520
sibling off of your
lap, my daddy, my mommy,

283
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,470
and they may also, um,
propose marriage to you.

284
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,860
I just never used so much fun.

285
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Fourth stage roots going even wider and
deeper is significance and significance

286
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,210
is the sense that the child feels seen
and celebrated and cherished by you.

287
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,950
Just as they are not based on their
achievements or their accomplishments are

288
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:02,490
how good they make you look
as a parent or as a person.

289
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,330
It's the delight that you have in their
existence in your life and it's very,

290
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:14,290
very powerful for children
to feel cherished by you.

291
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,540
It helps them feel close to you.

292
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,700
The fifth stayed around the eighth.

293
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,950
The roots even going
wider and deeper is love.

294
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:28,090
It's this pure unadulterated transmission
of warmth and connection that your

295
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,330
child feels in your presence,
not just the words,

296
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,930
it's the way your face might light up
when they come into the room or they,

297
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,990
they call you on the phone.
I know when my son calls this days,

298
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:46,670
now they put five and 26 years old. And
if he walked in the house, it's like,

299
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,610
Ooh, just love him. And it's
not just the words, it's this.

300
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,000
I connect.
I,

301
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,250
I move into a place where I remember that
love I lined myself up with it doesn't

302
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:04,120
mean always. It doesn't mean I'm
a few of all the time, but, but I,

303
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,540
but there's something very
pure about that that is felt.

304
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,100
We feel it with anyone who we love.
And then the final stage,

305
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,540
if all has gone well with these
stages in the age of six onward,

306
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,290
is being known,
being known.

307
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,910
So this is the child who wants
to tell you their secrets,

308
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,590
doesn't want to hold back from you
feel say.

309
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,800
And we teach children by our reactions
because if we react to their news rather

310
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:42,061
than responding in ways that
make them feel ashamed or afraid,

311
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,500
then we teach them not to tell us
what's really going on in their lives.

312
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,300
Especially as life gets more complicated.

313
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,490
So if you want your 14 year old to
tell you when she's thinking about,

314
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,480
um,

315
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,650
drinking with her girlfriends on Friday
night cause they're all going to try it,

316
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,790
then you want to ideally make it possible
for your four year old when that child

317
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:11,080
is four to come to you.

318
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:16,081
When she's afraid of something
or someone's been mean
to her at school or maybe

319
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,070
she was mean to someone
and got in trouble,

320
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,750
you want to make it safe because you're
that captain who respond rather than

321
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,000
reacts out of your own,

322
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,530
her or need or story.
Does that make sense?

323
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,180
So we can fortify and build connection
with their children all through their

324
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:39,130
lives. Proximity means you me,
let's play a game of chess,

325
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,150
right?

326
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,150
I seek out the child when they're not
chasing me or hanging onto my leg.

327
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,920
Please, one more game. Get any of that.

328
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,910
But you initiate out of a
generosity once in a while.

329
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,610
Go find your child when you're not
expecting it or demanding and say, hey,

330
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,320
I just had this great idea.

331
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,840
Do you want to go color and
your coloring but together?

332
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,980
And they haven't even asked
for it. Wow, that's amazing.

333
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,960
Sameness for something the two
of you enjoy doing and do it.

334
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:12,970
Take a cooking class,
go,

335
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,810
go study the bugs in the backyard if
you have at least some interest in new

336
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:22,540
child's fascinated,
belonging and loyalty.

337
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,690
If they have a homework assignment, rub
their shoulders, making a cup of tea,

338
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:28,180
be on their side,
let them feel that you're on their team.

339
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,960
And I've talked about significance
and love and being known.

340
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:36,760
So these are very fundamental
elements of my work that when we

341
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,480
change what I call the Ph of
our relationship with our child.

342
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:47,660
So imagine there's a cylinder
with a solution in it. And
it's funny, I'm a Google,

343
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,860
I have zero background is science.

344
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,580
So I'm going to sound
like a no more than I do.

345
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,620
This is like the one thing I kind of know.

346
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,430
So if you had a solution
that was too acidic,

347
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,580
the Ph of that solution
is to has too much acid.

348
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,610
You don't neutralize it by removing acid.

349
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,300
You add alcohol and you add base.
If I get a call or I,

350
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,390
I'm working with a family where the child
is chronically resistant or defiant.

351
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,440
One of my first questions will be
how would your child rate that?

352
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,670
The level of attachment on these six
areas in India in or the overview.

353
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,280
Because typically a child who feels very
close to you and connected tries their

354
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:38,270
best to behave for you.
They want to please you just like you do.

355
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:39,960
Okay.

356
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,820
You try harder for someone
that you genuinely like who
you feel genuinely likes

357
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:48,720
and enjoys you then then
out of obligation or duty,

358
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,840
it's just how we are.
So these stages of attachments,

359
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,770
while simple are so fundamental to being
the captain of the ship because they

360
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,190
change the Ph of that relationship.
So it's healthy.

361
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,090
See if something kind of to work with.
Does that make sense so far?

362
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,280
So far so good.
Okay.

363
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,660
There's a second piece that
goes into being that captain,

364
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,830
I won't go into this two months.
This is a, uh, a deeper topic,

365
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:22,150
but I want to just touch on it.
So imagine that you're holding a snapshot.

366
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,490
I always think of Polaroids, and I'll
bet many of you, if not Missouri,

367
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,280
don't even know anymore what a
Polaroid picture. But in my day,

368
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:31,690
which wasn't that long ago,

369
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,650
there were these cool cameras and you
could instantly take a picture and print

370
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,770
it. So I always picked it, the
Polaroid. So here's a Polaroid,

371
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:42,430
and this picture that you're
holding is of your ideal child.

372
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:43,910
Okay?

373
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,840
This is a child who when
you say, um, sweetheart,

374
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:51,350
it's time to start your homework. They
say, sure mom, thanks for reminding me.

375
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,400
And this is the tiled.
When you say, honey,

376
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:58,430
it's time to brush your teeth and
get new Jeremy's, you'd go, oh great.

377
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:02,150
I'm just so ready for that.
Good night.

378
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,830
Have a good night, mommy. I know you're
so tired. You get a good sleep. Now

379
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,520
this is your snapshot child.
I call it Snapshot Child Syndrome.

380
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,860
How many of you suffer from
snapshot childs and no.

381
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,380
And the reason that we move into lawyer
mode or dictator mode is that we lose

382
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,090
our cool

383
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,830
happens to the best of us.
And,

384
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,810
and so I'm always interested in
getting to the root of things.

385
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:41,410
Like I'm not a bandaid person. I'm not
a person that's scripts for you. What?

386
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,860
Here's what to say when your
children are fighting the backseat.

387
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,530
Here's what to say. When you found
out your daughter was teasing,

388
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,450
I want to know why. Why does some,
why does that behavior makes sense?

389
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,690
So the root of this issue of why we lose
our cool and move into that argument of

390
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:03,261
lawyer where we're pushing
or that dictator who is
overpowering and intimidating

391
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,710
to feel some sense of flow control is,

392
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,410
is not because our child's
kicked down his brother's tower.

393
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,710
It's because we think he shouldn't have.

394
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,743
Yeah.

395
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,160
It's the mismatch between this photo of
our idealized child and that real one in

396
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:30,030
flesh and blood in front of us.

397
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:36,330
That mismatch causes us to lose our cool.

398
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,600
Does that make sense?
It's an inside job.

399
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,420
It's what we're believing in our
head that contradicts reality.

400
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,330
Richard can mentioned Byron Katie,
and I don't know if any of you familiar,

401
00:27:50,331 --> 00:27:54,110
but I love the work of Byron Katie and
I've been doing some parenting programs

402
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:59,111
with her and it's been set to the light
because she has a process of inquiry

403
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,800
that I include in my books and in my
classes. We don't do it right now,

404
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:08,720
but that gets you to look at the stories
that you're telling and believing that

405
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:13,721
caused you to create stress and distance
and difficulty in your life and in your

406
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:14,894
relationship.

407
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,500
So staying captain means that we
have to throw the snapshot away.

408
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,660
Okay,

409
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,130
this is the child you have
for better or worse,

410
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,130
maybe it's not what you expected.
I think for most of us,

411
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:36,130
not all of us, if we're really
allowing our child to be who they are,

412
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,170
there's going to be some variation
between the imagination that we had,

413
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,170
who they might be and their personality.
Maybe you have a child who's,

414
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,630
I've had sessions with
people on the phone who,

415
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,890
who end up sobbing within
10 minutes because, uh,

416
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:55,020
this person is a very gentle,
was very passive, was as a,

417
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,860
as a little girl, not allowed to really
be very assertive or express herself.

418
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:04,690
And she's got this intensely
fiery five-year-old, no,
I'm not going to do that.

419
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:07,720
And, and boy, you know, mom
just bumps up against that.

420
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:12,280
Now on the one side where we've gotten
to in our work is what a gift this

421
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:14,710
daughter is revealing to her.

422
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:19,180
How she can locate within
herself her own strength,

423
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:20,740
her own will to some degree,

424
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,430
maybe not clumsy and intense
way that her child is.

425
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,040
Sometimes you're a very intense person
and you really are competitive and you

426
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:34,900
love sports and you get this very gentle,
sensitive, a little child, not like you.

427
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,660
So it's when we are stuck on holding
this image up against the real child that

428
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:45,661
we our cool and we try and argue them
into or intimidate them into being

429
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:46,714
different than the off.

430
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,910
So that's a side piece that helps us
be the captain looking at what we're

431
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:56,080
believing our child should be looking
at the story that we're telling in our

432
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:59,800
head of how they should feel. He
shouldn't knock down the tower, the tower.

433
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:00,634
Is it true?

434
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,840
What are three reasons why you're a
little boy should have knocked down to his

435
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:08,530
brother's tower?
And I know that don't take that literally.

436
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,810
I'm not suggesting he
should have knocked it down,

437
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,820
but if we look at that question,
why does this behavior make sense,

438
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,700
then I'll bet we could find white.

439
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,760
That was an obvious outcome of what
had happened up in the moments or hours

440
00:30:27,061 --> 00:30:30,810
leading up to that.
That make any sense to you.

441
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,270
We look at the snapshot,
we throw it away and we,

442
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,160
we meet the child where they are.

443
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,200
The third piece that's so important, and
I want to make sure I cover this today,

444
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,100
is about coming alongside our
children rather than coming at them.

445
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,740
So I talk about um,
how when a child is frustrated,

446
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,510
it's like they're on this road
of frustration. Here's the road.

447
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:58,200
It's called frustration.
Okay?

448
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,020
Children are on this road many,
many times a day.

449
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,900
They can't have the cookie that they want.

450
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,210
They have to go to school and
they'd rather stay home with you.

451
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:10,400
They don't want to go to bed,
they don't want to brush their teeth.

452
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,340
They don't like you holding
their little buck brother.

453
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,550
All kinds of things happen where
children are frustrated. So the goal of,

454
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,610
of our parenting life is not about
preventing them from ever being pressed,

455
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:22,580
waited far from it.
In fact,

456
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,290
my position is that it's very important
for children to discover they can

457
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:30,470
survive and live through frustration.
Why?

458
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,380
How else are they going
to develop resilience?

459
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,450
Children become resilient because they
know they can survive something difficult.

460
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,690
So our job is not to fix everything for
them or move the universe over to where

461
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:46,040
they would prefer that it be,

462
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,810
but it's to be that loving,
compassionate,

463
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,780
present captain through the storm.

464
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,920
So the child on this road of frustration,

465
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,690
and there's only two ways this
can go if they go this way,

466
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,870
in that direction,
they come to a fork in the road.

467
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,680
So there's only when they come
to the fore, if they go this way,

468
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,000
they become aggressive. I
hate to, you're so mean.

469
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:19,510
Maybe they take it out on their sibling
or on the family dog or they they hate,

470
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,770
I hate myself,
we see that.

471
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,230
But if they come to the fork in the road
of frustration and they go this way,

472
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,000
the end of that little path is adaptation,

473
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,520
acceptance that you've come to
terms with life as it is. However,

474
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,050
however it's a process that
you can help them with.

475
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:47,051
So I've borrowed from the work of
Elizabeth Kubler Ross in death and dying

476
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,710
because the way I see it,

477
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,760
frustration in a way is like loss.

478
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,100
It may be loss of autonomy or freedom
of choice and maybe loss of you if they

479
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,730
have to go to school,
maybe loss of a really good cookie.

480
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,990
And so I work with this model of
grief because in a way it's a,

481
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:14,121
it's a small condensed grieving
process to get through that loss.

482
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:17,270
So who has an example of the
similar, want to share an, uh,

483
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,220
an example of a time when a
child has made a complaint?

484
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,643
Hmm.

485
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,880
Actually just happened yesterday.

486
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:28,860
My 12 year old came home from school
with a big sad oh attitude and went

487
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:32,640
straight to his bed. And it
was very unlike him because
normally he's very happy,

488
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:36,450
positive. And I went to him and I
said, what is the problem? And he said,

489
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,920
I can't believe it.

490
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:42,700
Somebody slashed my backpack while I
left it outside the bathroom. Yeah, yeah.

491
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,020
Why would they do that?
And I was, you know,

492
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,860
I could totally understand where he's
coming from because he felt like he was

493
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,130
yes. And in that process, that's unsafe.

494
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:54,640
So sorry to hear that
in that process really,

495
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,390
I already can watch you and get a sense
that you just joined them where he was.

496
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,620
And so that's a great example of her
getting to the end of this process,

497
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:07,570
which is feeling sad. So I,
if it's all right with you,

498
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:11,950
I'm going to invent a another version
just because you already did it. Okay.

499
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,810
So let's say that your
child complains that, um,

500
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,830
he never,

501
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:22,830
he doesn't get to watch more TV and
he really wants to watch this one more

502
00:34:24,551 --> 00:34:28,690
program. Okay. That
anybody relate to that?

503
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,140
Just this one more program.
Does anyone want to play this out with me?

504
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,520
All right, I'll just do it. So
we have, we have a shot. Yep.

505
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,020
And also we're on camera.
So the child says to you,

506
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,370
mom, Dad, I just want
to watch one more show.

507
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:48,560
This is a really important episode

508
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,970
and we'll pretend there aren't
dvrs and all that. Okay.

509
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:59,590
For the purposes of this demonstration.
So the child, when you say,

510
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,470
I'm afraid now this time to start
your homework or get ready for dinner,

511
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:08,410
first goes into the, on the, on the road
to acceptance, first steps into denial

512
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,573
because

513
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,500
maybe he or she,

514
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,550
he has reason to believe that you
may change your mind based on prior

515
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:20,930
experiences.
If I rally hard enough,

516
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:25,070
maybe I'll get to watch this show. So come
on please. I just want to watch a show.

517
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,480
So the child's birth and denial.
If you still say no,

518
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:34,460
then we're in anger. You're so
mean. You never let me do anything.

519
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,020
You're, you're so strict. But Jacob's
parents let him do what I mean,

520
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,850
he gets to watch like five
of these episodes. You're
so strict. So there's anger.

521
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,770
You are [inaudible] park. Okay, next,

522
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,530
if we don't engage on that level,
we have bargaining.

523
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,120
Please.
If you just let me watch this one episode,

524
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,210
I promise I'll never ask for anything
again for the rest of my life.

525
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,110
He said, only thing I want. I promise you,

526
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,010
if you just let me watch this show,
I'll never ask for anything.

527
00:36:13,011 --> 00:36:17,490
I'll do all my chores. I'll feed
the dog aisle, massage your feet,

528
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:18,840
whatever it is.
Okay?

529
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,380
Now if that doesn't yield the
desired outcome, we'll move on.

530
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,560
But it's not so easy because those
are invitations to go into lawyer and

531
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:34,280
dictator mode, right?
So your child denial,

532
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,790
you know he's going to just push and push.
Then anger,

533
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,880
you might counter the anger with
threats or anger of your own.

534
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:47,450
If he moves into bargaining, you
may go into lawyer mode. We'll know,

535
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:50,390
because I know that's not true.
You've promised many times before.

536
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:51,800
That's the only thing you wanted,

537
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:55,100
and then 10 minutes later you
wanted something else. Well,

538
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:59,210
that was different because it says your
child, because that was when you know,

539
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:03,200
I mean, listen, you're going
nowhere fast. If you go there,

540
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,680
these first three stages where
there's conflict intention,

541
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,840
I call it the Dab denial,
anger bargaining.

542
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,970
So the model is Dab, Duh.
So the first three stages,

543
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,030
the DAB,
we perpetuate.

544
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:25,031
We've prolonged the misery by arguing
why threatening all those things.

545
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,020
The fourth stage,
which is where

546
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,620
the shift actually can happen,

547
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,830
this is what you were talking about
with your son is disappointment now and

548
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:43,830
Kubler Ross's model. It was
depression. It's the disappointment.

549
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,150
It's inhabiting
your sadness.

550
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,850
It slamming against the truth that I
am not going to have what I wanted.

551
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,250
I have to let go for your son.

552
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:01,430
It was the truth and the sad truth
that somebody was so unkind who he has

553
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:06,240
contact with for the child who
wants to watch another show.

554
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:10,500
It's the realization of
the futility of his effort.

555
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,440
He is not going to get to watch that show.

556
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,570
So there's some children they need to cry.
Some kids just feel it,

557
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,920
a sinking feeling.

558
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,860
And if you can hold the captain
plays without being tempted to,

559
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,180
but it's only rare,
I'm good or which is what we do.

560
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,440
But you've gotten so many
thing you don't appreciate.

561
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,870
If you'd appreciate me more and all the
hard work I do and the organic food I

562
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:36,640
buy, then I would, I
might feel differently.

563
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,680
But if we stay clean
as that captain,

564
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:47,010
then the child magically moves through
this process through the final step,

565
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:52,000
which is acceptance.
They make peace with life as it is.

566
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,010
They come to terms with it

567
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,460
and we have not fractured or
compromise the relationship.

568
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:05,090
Does that make sense? This is not
easy because when we have a child,

569
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:07,970
every bone in her body
wants them to be happy.

570
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,910
So if a child is unhappy or complaining,

571
00:39:10,911 --> 00:39:15,560
a lot of times we go down here because
we feel a desperate need for them to like

572
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,630
us or to feel happy again.
So we,

573
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,220
we changed the world to suit
them because they don't,

574
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,070
we don't like witnessing
them being unhappy.

575
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:28,970
And I'm not saying you never change your
mind, by the way. Here's the back door,

576
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,310
let's say that you're super tired.

577
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,680
Okay.

578
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,140
If you'd like, like, uh,
an out a loophole for the,

579
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,840
let's say you're really tired
and your tradition is that you,

580
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,473
um,

581
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,830
read to bedtime stories at
night and you've read your
two stories and your tiles

582
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,803
like,
oh,

583
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,110
I have a third story and they haven't
yet lost their mind or they're not being

584
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:57,100
awful. They just would really like
another story. And in your mind,

585
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:58,750
you kind of weigh the pros and cons.

586
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:01,840
Do I want to do this thing that
Susan's default one was talking about

587
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,870
or do I just want to get this over with?

588
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,130
So what I remember,
I just want you to be the captain.

589
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,830
So if they're being reasonable and you,
you know,

590
00:40:12,831 --> 00:40:16,130
you think it might be quicker and easier
just to read the other, an extra story.

591
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:21,110
You know what you get to say, oh
my gosh, you must be a mind reader.

592
00:40:21,111 --> 00:40:25,640
I was about to suggest we read
another story that's amazing.

593
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,540
Or you know, they want the
other cookie. How did you,

594
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,030
how did you know I was about to ask
you if you wanted another? Okay,

595
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,560
so you make it your idea
and you still hold that place not loving.

596
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,820
So I know that we have just a few minutes
and I want to take some questions,

597
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:49,490
but I wanted to sort of tie this up with
the last piece that goes into being the

598
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,100
captain. Just briefly. When
we come at our children,

599
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,510
you can't watch that show. It's
a scary movie. You're too young.

600
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,430
What do we get from them?

601
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:07,610
Pushback and resistance, right?
We can move into that anger

602
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:13,300
when we come alongside them with
what I call act one parenting.

603
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,070
Then we help the child feel understood,
validated,

604
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,810
and they soften and there's uh, uh, uh,

605
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:24,530
the guard comes down,
the walls come down.

606
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:28,190
There's a receptivity and we use act
one with the one I just taught you with

607
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,480
helping the child feel sadness.
So here's an example. Um,

608
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,540
the says,
I,

609
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:40,340
I hate my school and I never want to go
back to that stupid school. I hate it.

610
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,170
They come home from school
and say that to you.

611
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,820
Most of us do what I
call act to parenting.

612
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,680
We appeal to the towels left logical,
rational language based brain.

613
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,320
Okay.

614
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,380
Even though when they're upset,
they don't have one of those.

615
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,900
And I know I'm oversimplifying,

616
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,360
but Dan Siegel reassured me a couple of
weeks ago that I can still talk about

617
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:06,180
the rain. It's having these different
points of, so I'm comforted by that.

618
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,660
So we appeal to them with rational,

619
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,250
logical arguments to talk
them out of their position.

620
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,140
Does that work? No. Not
when they're already upset.

621
00:42:19,141 --> 00:42:23,430
Because when they're upset, they're over
here in their feeling emotional brain.

622
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,140
That's where we need to join them.

623
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:30,530
We do that with what I call
act one parenting act one
parenting allows the child

624
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:35,850
to be where he is,
stays the captain.

625
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:39,270
We stay the captain.
We are already,

626
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,920
most of us say way too many words and I'm
convinced kids tune us out after about

627
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:44,754
seven.

628
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,320
And we,
um,

629
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,590
acknowledged briefly, I call it
comics. We're going to be like, oh hmm.

630
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,143
Shit.

631
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,820
Why? How? Fam Go boom. Okay.

632
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:03,070
So we're minimalists
when it comes to words,

633
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,310
but we're in passing and most important,
and this is a little formulaic, we,

634
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,470
we look to help the child,

635
00:43:11,471 --> 00:43:16,471
not his head or say yes at least
three times so that it diffuses,

636
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:17,951
wow.

637
00:43:17,951 --> 00:43:22,951
You're actually hearing me not like
you're angry because I would never presume

638
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,470
to decide I know what
someone else's feelings.

639
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,220
So please don't attribute that approach
to me cause I don't believe it's our

640
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:33,760
rights and decide how someone is
feeling and announced it as if we know.

641
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,200
But we could say it sounds like I get
the feeling that it seems as though,

642
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,750
so let me demonstrate this and then
I'd love to take some questions.

643
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:45,850
Is there anyone brave who has an issue,

644
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:49,390
a child who's complained about something
and they want to play this out with me?

645
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,110
All right, so you're my, how old are you?

646
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,900
How do you want to be you to eight year
old? Okay. So you're my eight year old.

647
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,610
And what's your complaint?

648
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:04,000
First I'm going to demonstrate act two
which is why they don't want you to do,

649
00:44:04,001 --> 00:44:07,300
but you will probably intuitively do.
Cause that's how we were.

650
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:11,430
Most of us were raised. Okay, what's
your complaint you spend here?

651
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,750
You spend all the time with my little
brother and you don't spend any time with

652
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:20,430
me. Can you stand here? So like,
yeah, that's ridiculous honey.

653
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:24,850
I'm knocking on her left with, that's
your left, right? I'm knocking on her.

654
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:26,170
That's ridiculous.
Ice.

655
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:31,350
I played my little pony with you for like
two hours yesterday and was wanting my

656
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:32,664
attention.

657
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,990
But today you didn't spend any time today
because we had to go to the doctor's

658
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,730
office and I had to take, but I'm
right here with you and here mommy.

659
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,830
Okay, so how does this
feeling? Very disconnected.

660
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,490
I'm arguing. I'm validating, right?
So can you all relate to that?

661
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,460
There's almost an urgency
that we feel like,

662
00:44:55,461 --> 00:44:57,620
let me just quickly
talk you off the ledge.

663
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,870
Let me quickly talk you
out of what you're feeling.

664
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,670
And I seem to believe or whatever reason,
largely how we were raised,

665
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:10,040
that the quickest route to that is to
convince your left logical brain to think

666
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:13,400
differently. It just
doesn't work. By the way,

667
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:18,460
I've done this same program for
businesses and employee relationships and

668
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,150
couples. I mean, this is not just
confined to the parent child relationship,

669
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,650
this dynamic. But we know that
that didn't, I didn't go over did.

670
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,940
Did you all relate? Okay, so
now I'm going to model act one.

671
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,070
You may see me in this act
one demonstration guiding
her to some sadness through

672
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:39,830
that Dab. Okay Betty. So
make the same complaint.

673
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,200
You always spend time with my little
brother, but no time with me mommy.

674
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,950
So now in my mind I might be thinking that
is so far from the truth that his own.

675
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,760
So it seems like you feel shortchanged

676
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:00,170
and like your brother has been
getting more time than yes.

677
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,170
And I wonder,
you kind of miss me.

678
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,930
I do,
yeah.

679
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,980
I'm so glad you told me.

680
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,453
Yeah,

681
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,560
of course. It's not always that tidy and
simple, but how was that for you? Oh,

682
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,320
that was more connected and that you care.
Yeah.

683
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,970
I'm not arguing her out of her position
now. There's so many ways this could go.

684
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:31,690
It might be that I find out that it's
not really sadly about me at all and my

685
00:46:32,691 --> 00:46:33,770
fabulousness,

686
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:38,930
but really that her friends left her
to eat by herself at lunch. Right.

687
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:39,320
If I,

688
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:44,320
if I make room for her to feel
express herself safely and tell me,

689
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,080
is there more to that? I mean, is there
more about that you want me to know?

690
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:49,760
Okay.

691
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,390
Yeah. If you'd really aloone these
days because there's no friends

692
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,900
at school right now in my
lap. Right. I'm thinking,

693
00:46:56,901 --> 00:47:00,860
I picked her up and saw her playing
with seven people on the playground.

694
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,460
So the temptation is very great to say,
what are you talking about?

695
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:09,050
The typical thing would be, but I saw you
with, you know, vivid edit at an event

696
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,560
and instead I joined her where she is.

697
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,860
So it feels like you're just on
your own a lot. Huh? Friends?

698
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:21,040
Hmm.
That doesn't sound fun

699
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,130
there anything that you think you
want me to help you with about that?

700
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,980
I'd like to have a play

701
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,970
date with Ella.

702
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,410
I wonder if we could set that up.
So there's, there's a possible,

703
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:40,270
I've empowered her to be a participant
in solving it. Thank you. Thank you.

704
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:43,510
That's good. It may also be that, um,

705
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,030
that it,

706
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,320
she just has to cry that maybe she's going
through a rough patch with all of her

707
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:54,460
friends. It may be not that
this would be for your child,

708
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,470
that she's not being a very nice
friend and she's been very bossy,

709
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:02,860
are very controlling of the other kids.
And so she's getting honest feedback.

710
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:07,960
But I want to know that because I'm the
captain and there may be a leak in the

711
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:12,961
whole of my ship and if I make everything
glossed over and perfect and I only

712
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:17,230
want to hear the good stuff, I
really can't effectively. Yeah.

713
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,650
So, um, all these things are,

714
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,070
are interplaying with each
other to be that loving,

715
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:29,460
present captain of the
ship and in the process,

716
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,870
this is what I said at the beginning.

717
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,880
We get to heal our
unfinished business at looms.

718
00:48:35,881 --> 00:48:36,810
It's angry face.

719
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:41,640
Sometimes when we feel disrespected
or overwhelmed or confused or sad,

720
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:45,720
or maybe I was that child who had no
friends and now I'm going to jump through

721
00:48:45,721 --> 00:48:47,570
hoops to make sure that by Gosh,

722
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,980
every child on that playground
plays with my daughter.

723
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:54,330
So I didn't have to re activate my
own pain of loneliness as a child,

724
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,690
not a healthy way to go.
I worked through my own material.

725
00:48:57,691 --> 00:49:01,590
I support my child with the resources
that she has. She's a different person.

726
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,770
So it's a pretty magnificent
process. And I, as I said, just feel

727
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:14,740
overjoyed to have landed in what feels
like the work I'm supposed to do and have

728
00:49:15,111 --> 00:49:18,670
met so many amazing parents
around the world. Um,

729
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,820
even the online community. I have a
Facebook group and I have a, Oh yeah.

730
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,490
That's to say I have this newsletter
who said, I was going to say this.

731
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,230
If you'd like to stay in touch with the
work I'm doing, please send the news, uh,

732
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,290
a text message.

733
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,680
I'll just give you this phone number
with the word newsletter in it.

734
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:41,490
It's 310-NINE-058Y-16TY-5
310-NINE-058Y-16TY-5 and
you can be part of our

735
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,050
movement, our tribe. We're doing
so many interesting things.

736
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,910
The next program coming up is on
coparenting liver narcissist and very,

737
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,690
very interesting with a woman
who wrote, uh, she's uh, uh,

738
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,960
highly respected expert in the field
when have a Harry called disarming the

739
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:05,471
nicest since.

740
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:09,160
But we do all kinds of parenting programs
online so that we can reach people

741
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,140
remotely. This is, we're doing today.
So who has a question that they get out?

742
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:18,690
Uh, so we have a, you want a kid
when you were in four months.

743
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,620
And so do you have any tips for how to
communicate with kids who don't talk yet?

744
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,450
Sure.

745
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,380
So you have a one year old,
so it's pre-verbal.

746
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:29,180
So some of the things I'm talking
aren't quite relevant to you yet.

747
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,250
They will be if you blink about five
times, that's how fast it take this.

748
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,050
So it's great that you're learning now.
In fact,

749
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:40,580
I want to do more work with expectant
parents because they have more time to

750
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:44,690
actually start learning new approaches
and then they can be more prepared.

751
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,090
Um,
with a young child,

752
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,950
a lot of the work I do tends to do
with you so that as you start to feel

753
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:55,280
overwhelmed or stuffed folks
getting triggered for you,

754
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:59,450
you have the resources to kind of
look at your own side of the equation.

755
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:03,590
And then with a toddler
you'll be doing a micro,

756
00:51:03,591 --> 00:51:07,910
like a very simplified version of
some of this. Like I love Harvey Karp,

757
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,930
who talks about, um, um,

758
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,580
when it toddler really want something
that you don't get real wordy, you,

759
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,120
you go match about 30% of the
effect you want, you want,

760
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:25,121
you want to go outside so you can
meet your child on a very primal,

761
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:30,470
simple level. Even though the verbal
processing may not be what you, you know,

762
00:51:30,471 --> 00:51:35,150
they may not be able to perfectly
translate, they'll get the feeling.

763
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:39,730
And so you acknowledged them
in that way and um, and,

764
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,140
and prepare yourself for what's to come.

765
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:47,130
What are the things that happens in
our house sometimes is they'll ask for,

766
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:47,371
you know,

767
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:50,970
one of my two daughters will ask for
something like another dessert or more

768
00:51:50,971 --> 00:51:55,200
screen time or something like that and
we'll say no, and then they'll say why.

769
00:51:55,350 --> 00:52:00,140
Which is I think a real invitation
to go into a lawyer mode there. Um,

770
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,370
so what do you think is a, you know,
some good approaches to handle it?

771
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,410
I love the question.

772
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:09,180
A lot of times when you have established
that something is not an option,

773
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:14,430
the child will say, why? And I want
you to get this. It's code for,

774
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,570
I really want it.

775
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,750
It's not why you're just getting confused.

776
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:24,050
Because we think that the
word part of the towels,

777
00:52:24,051 --> 00:52:27,060
the message is actually their message.
That is not the case.

778
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,430
When a child is feeling a lot of feelings,

779
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:33,960
there's this glossy wrapping paper that
they wrap around the emotional content

780
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,970
of what's going on for them and they
deliver this gauzy wrapping wrapped up

781
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:43,290
thing of feeling and the Gazi wrapping
papers, the word part of the message,

782
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:48,210
it is not the message. And so
there will be times, however,

783
00:52:48,211 --> 00:52:51,990
when your child is calm, respectful
and says, I really want to know why,

784
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:57,360
and you can say, are you sure? Do you want
to know why you can't have the dessert?

785
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,590
Or is this your way of saying, I really
want the dessert? I would just ask her,

786
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,050
get it clear. I'm not
sure if you're saying, uh,

787
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,590
that you genuinely want my rational
reasons or if this is just another version

788
00:53:10,591 --> 00:53:15,450
of I so desperately want that
dessert, tell me what it is. Now.

789
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,500
I will also point out that in my work,
I don't suggest that you keep saying,

790
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,080
I know you really want the
dessert but you can't have it.

791
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,300
I know it's really good,
but I told you, you know,

792
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,150
I know you really want more deserved,

793
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,990
but in our house you only get one if you
keep reiterating the no. First of all,

794
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:33,000
it's like salt in the wound.
It's kind of mean,

795
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:38,430
but it also disempowers you
because if you know what,

796
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,970
and this is why many parenting issues,
when I do work with my members,

797
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:45,360
a lot of it is just helping parents
become more clear in the size. It,

798
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,280
when you're clear,

799
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:52,190
you have an aroma and
that's the captain thing.

800
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:57,720
And um, and so then you may
need to get super clear,

801
00:53:57,721 --> 00:54:01,320
but once you're clear, don't keep saying
no, you can't, but here's why. But no,

802
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,750
you said at once it's already
established in your house.

803
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,690
I wouldn't even touch it.
I know you really want the dessert.

804
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:13,520
I know it doesn't seem fair.
Not, I know it doesn't seem fair,

805
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:17,240
but we don't have second desserts in
our house. Does that make sense to you?

806
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:18,074
Am I saying that?
Okay.

807
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,050
So, um, my nine year old daughter,

808
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:25,100
she's really addictive to a
Nintendo counselor games. So,

809
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,640
um, so when she's not
playing, she's, you know,

810
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:32,120
trying to get onto youtube to watch
other people playing all the time. So,

811
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,050
so I'm thinking about maybe
I ship because myself,

812
00:54:36,051 --> 00:54:39,760
I have no interest in
gamma at all. So, so I'm,

813
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:44,450
I'm thinking about maybe I should
consider playing with her or to be more

814
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:47,030
attached with her in
terms of this interest.

815
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,490
Do you think that's a good way to yeah,

816
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,440
really interesting question.
I just did a this year,

817
00:54:53,441 --> 00:54:56,320
it's still on it Susan stifelman.com
you can still get that,

818
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:01,490
a wonderful series on parenting
in the digital age and um,

819
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:06,400
it's a huge topic for me that I've been
writing and thinking and teaching about.

820
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,570
And that question is,
is a tangled one.

821
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:16,710
I would prefer that you find an interest
that doesn't involve parallel looking

822
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:22,360
at a screen, more contact, more
real life, really engagement.

823
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,520
That's what I would prefer. No, I'm not
saying this is an altar for your daughter.

824
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:29,920
There are children,
for instance on the spectrum,

825
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,380
some degree of autism or Asperger's
where that is a very effective way and

826
00:55:35,381 --> 00:55:37,000
perhaps the easiest way to connect.

827
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:42,010
And there are children who
are depressed and again,

828
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,430
this is not your daughter, but I
have, when I've done my classes,

829
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
when we start to work with helping kids
sort of wean off or limited amounts of

830
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,630
time on the screen,

831
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,160
it's often a mask or cover up
for anxiety and depression.

832
00:55:58,450 --> 00:55:59,283
And I would,

833
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:04,830
I would want to rule that out that she
is able to function and enjoy the world

834
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,380
because otherwise it's just
covering up another issue,

835
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,670
which sadly is true for many
children. Um, many kids,

836
00:56:12,671 --> 00:56:16,510
that's the only time they
feel good or relaxed or c.

837
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,200
And then finally, um, you know,

838
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:24,670
it's a process and you would need
to be about what the limits are.

839
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,810
But I guess my short, shorter, coming
back to the original answer would be,

840
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:33,970
I wouldn't mind her teaching you a little
bit about the game as an entry point,

841
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:39,070
but I guess I would prefer that you think
outside the box with something really

842
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:40,630
interesting navy as an off suit,

843
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:45,160
maybe drawing and to characters or
building them out of something that's a

844
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:46,150
little more three d

845
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,490
actually,
she did try to teach me,

846
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:52,950
but I guess I did not
meet her expenditure. Oh,

847
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,960
well that's good information.
It's not you're right

848
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,220
thing and you can be very honest
with her and say, here's the truth.

849
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,420
I love authenticity with our kids. They,
they love the truth and they smell it.

850
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,620
Anyway, sweetheart, I'm wanting
to connect with you more.

851
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,520
I was thinking maybe I
would try and intend to,

852
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:15,990
but clearly it's just not my in
my wheelhouse. So here let's,

853
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,640
here's a big pad of paper.
Let's just together, right?

854
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:23,380
All the things we love doing and see where
there's some overlap and make that an

855
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:26,020
activity,
a bonding activity to do with her,

856
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,140
to come up with ideas of other
things that you could do.

857
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,040
It could be digging holes in the backyard.
I don't care whether it is,

858
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,050
could be a worm farm.
Okay. I guess that's it.

859
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:41,990
We need to wrap up.
Thank you all for tuning in and listening,

860
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,510
and thank you so much for
Chico for hosting this event,

861
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:50,160
and I look forward to staying in touch.
Yeah,
