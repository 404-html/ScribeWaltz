1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,810
It's a privilege to be here.

2
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:12,810
Thank you all for taking your time today
out of your busy day to hear me talk

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:15,840
about warrior women in
leadership. Um, excuse me,

4
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,700
I'm getting over a little bit of a cold.
So if I cough,

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,150
I hope you understand I'm armed
and dangerous with water up here.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,220
So this is a topic that's
near and dear to my heart.

7
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:26,100
I've been doing women's leadership
work for really my whole life,

8
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:30,090
but in my corporate environments are
guide project for women's leadership arm

9
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:34,080
really goes into corporations like Google
and plenty of other places and helps

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:35,370
women leaders to achieve.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,760
One of the things that's really key to
where we find ourselves right now though

12
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,310
at this moment in history
is that as you all know,

13
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:44,760
we're in the midst of a massive cultural
shift where like a tectonic shift in

14
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,600
women's leadership.

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,320
And that means certain things right now
for what women leaders are doing and the

16
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:52,650
way in which we're operating that is very
different from the messages that we've

17
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,980
had before and the ways in which
leadership has functioned before as well.

18
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:59,310
Because we're having more influence than
we've ever had before on the leadership

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,770
of companies, institutions, governments,
not withstanding, uh, you know,

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,850
where we find ourselves at the moment.
Um,

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,260
and also that we are in a position
where our skills as women leaders are

22
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:12,450
influencing how corporations
function generally.

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,290
So we're going to talk through today,
um,

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,180
when warrior women leadership
as it stands right now,

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,230
and give you guys some really practical
tools to walk away from in terms of what

26
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:25,620
this means and what it means
for leadership and what
it means for professional

27
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:29,550
development and also what it means
for our culture in our world. So, um,

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,900
one of the things that I want to just
start with is what is a warrior woman in

29
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,730
leadership?
What does that look like right now?

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,860
So when I talk about warrior women,

31
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:42,100
what I'm talking about is how we have
armed ourselves for change in this er,

32
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,730
this corporate and cultural
environment that we're in right now,

33
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,970
worried or women in leadership to me
is about an activist model of women's

34
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:48,690
leadership.

35
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,420
And we're going to talk through what
that looks like in the context of your

36
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:56,010
every day. But we've seen more and more
women really rising to create change,

37
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:59,250
especially in the last 12 months.
Um, I think for obvious reasons.

38
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,640
And we're also obviously, as I mentioned,
seeing major cultural shifts right now.

39
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,600
So one of the things that is important
when we talk about warrior women in

40
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:09,480
leadership is the historic backward
looking view point of where we find

41
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:10,314
ourselves.

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,640
So traditional masculine
models of leadership generally
only measure two metrics

43
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,180
that matter, the time that we
invest and how much money we make,

44
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:21,330
whether that's the money we
make for ourselves or the
money that is made that we

45
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:22,830
make for others.
Um,

46
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,690
and that those models are really
difficult for women to rise within for a

47
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,500
variety of reasons because many of us
choose to have children because many of us

48
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:35,860
historically also do so much more work
at home than we do out in the world. Um,

49
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,620
and the metrics that we measure our
success by also our difference. Um,

50
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,100
because generally speaking, we're more
concerned with the quality of our lives.

51
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,610
And this is a broad overgeneralization,

52
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,750
but we're more concerned with the
quality of our lives in total. Um,

53
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,720
and this is why we don't often hear men
talking about work life balance in same

54
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:55,230
way that we do women then men tend to be.

55
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,800
And so one of the things that is important
to think about here is who do we have

56
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:02,560
as models for what warrior women in
leadership look like or what women leaders

57
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,460
look like generally.

58
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,820
And as I talked through warrior women
as a concept in the first stages of

59
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:09,880
getting ready for this talk,

60
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,480
one of the things that really struck
me is that going back in our history,

61
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,940
women in general have lost a lot
of our history. It's been erased.

62
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:19,330
And there's a lot that's been written
about this generally really encourage you

63
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,850
to look at it cause you'll be amazed
by what has been wiped from the history

64
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,480
books.

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,430
But we have had stories going all the way
back to like the Odyssey of how men go

66
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,950
through journeys that make them leaders.
Um,

67
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,420
the hero's journey is a trope that
we're all deeply familiar with. Um,

68
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,080
and one of the things that we haven't
had historically is the journey of a

69
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:38,740
heroin.

70
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,740
What is the journey of a woman look
like when we are progressing toward our

71
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,860
highest leadership?

72
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,220
And so one of the things that I want to
start with today is a discussion of what

73
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:52,390
the heroine's journey might look like in
the context of the history that we know

74
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,740
of from the hero's journey.

75
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,700
So the heroine's journey is
one that as an initial matter,

76
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:00,520
I want to say this about, it's not
like we go through this journey once.

77
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,490
One of the things that the studies
show about, the way that women learn,

78
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:06,250
for instance,
is that we learned cyclical sick quickly,

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,130
generally much more than we
learn in a linear fashion.

80
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,180
And so you may have noticed that my
corporate logo for instances a spiral,

81
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,320
there's a reason for that.

82
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,130
It's because the journey that we are
on is women leaders continues to cycle

83
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,420
around over and over again.

84
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,110
So what I'm going to share with you
today in the context of this journey is

85
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:24,820
something that I want to make very clear.

86
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:26,230
You're not just going to go through once.

87
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,030
Some heroin's journeys are
harder than others. Right? Um,

88
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,460
we're in a particular one as a
culture right now for women leaders.

89
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:37,900
That is quite brutal. I think we can
all agree. Um, and yet at the same time,

90
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,920
we cycle back continuously to learn over
and over again the things that we need

91
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:42,910
to learn on our path.

92
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,720
So as you think through this for yourself
in the context of what this might mean

93
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:50,650
for your life, as you think through what
it might mean for you in the context of,

94
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,260
um, the, the women you know,
and the women you work with,

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,190
please remember that it's not like this
is all just an over, I'm done game.

96
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,870
I wish it was, it would probably
be a lot easier on all of us. Um,

97
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,960
so where we start the
warrior woman journey,

98
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:04,150
the heroine's journey is first
in the place of illusion.

99
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,550
And when we think about
women's leadership,

100
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,310
this is the place where
we talk about conformity.

101
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,710
So it's the idea that, um,
if we dress a certain way,

102
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,580
if we lean in enough, and don't
get me wrong, I'm a fan of Sheryl,

103
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:21,550
but I have to say I have very strong
opinions about what meaning has done for

104
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,760
women leaders and they're
not all very good. Um,

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,510
if we show up in the right way as
assertive but not too assertive,

106
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,810
as opinionated, but not too
opinionated, if we smile enough, um,

107
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,840
if we are people pleasing enough,

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,710
we will get along just fine in these
traditional masculine leadership

109
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:40,810
environments,
that is the place of illusion.

110
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,810
And I'm gonna talk through a little bit
more what this looks like in greater

111
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,260
detail, but this is where we started our
journey with the belief that if we cope,

112
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,070
if we have coping skills that work for us,
then everything will be fine.

113
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,841
Unfortunately,

114
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:55,690
I think many of us can recognize that
that's generally not the way it works.

115
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:59,540
And so the next stage, the heroine's
journey is the stage of the trial.

116
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,570
And this is the place where you recognize
that your coping mechanisms have

117
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,270
failed you.
That you can still do it all.

118
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,900
And do it all in the way that we've been
told you have to do it to succeed as a

119
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,780
woman and still not have it happen.

120
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,450
And part of that is systemic.

121
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,050
And part of that is because we've been
taught that this is the only way that we

122
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:21,000
can do it. Don't worry, we're
going deeper into all of this. Um,

123
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,450
the next stage of the heroine's
journey is the one of awakening.

124
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,370
And this is really the place of choice.

125
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,900
You have a choice about whether or not
you're going to just continue coping or

126
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,250
you have a choice about whether or
not you're going to rise and fight.

127
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,010
And I don't necessarily mean
this in the wonder woman way,

128
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:37,130
but that's kind of a nice little image
to get in your head if you would care to.

129
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,040
The awakening is the moment of
recognizing that where we have been,

130
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,090
it can no longer continue and where we're
going has to be something different.

131
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,840
And we are the agent of that change
either individually or collectively.

132
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,360
Then comes the descent.

133
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,220
And this is the really kind of like not
nice place in the heroine's journey. Um,

134
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,400
this is the place where we
start to recognize the cost
and we recognize the cost

135
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,020
of what we have paid to
get where we are currently.

136
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,540
We recognize the cost
of continuing to fight.

137
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,800
We recognize that nothing is ever going
to quite be the same from where we find

138
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,030
ourselves.
And by the way,

139
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,180
this all may sound very
culturally familiar in terms
of where we find ourselves

140
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:18,080
right now as well. Um, and it is
the place where we choose our tools.

141
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,680
And before we leave today, I'm going to
talk through what some of these tools,

142
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:25,280
Aka weapons might look like in the
context of warrior women in leadership.

143
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,290
But it is a place where we determined
what it is that we need to succeed in a

144
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:34,460
new model, the dissent, the pit,

145
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:36,410
and the bottom of the heroine's
journey as the hurricane.

146
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,970
This is the place where we experienced
the Maelstrom of transformation.

147
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,880
Um, some of you who follow me on
Facebook now that I have this,

148
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,430
this thing that I talk about in terms
of where we are culturally right now,

149
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,100
which is the cauldron of transformation
and the way it feels like everything is

150
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:49,934
on fire.

151
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,630
We're boiling so much is changing in our
culture and in our world right now and

152
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:56,990
in our nation and it's
swirling all around us.

153
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,990
The dangerous point of the hurricane
is that sometimes there are points of

154
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:02,120
relief. It's like the eye of
the storm and we're like, oh,

155
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,880
maybe it's not quite so bad.
Maybe I can let my guard down,

156
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,700
maybe I don't have to fight so hard.
And then Lo and behold,

157
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,590
the next thing you know,
and the next day you're back in it.

158
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,970
And we're off to the races again.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,460
So the hurricane is really the bottom
and it's where we need the most,

160
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,690
the most tools that we can
possibly, um, prepare ourselves for.

161
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,180
The next stage is loss.

162
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,540
And this is really the place where we
come face to face with the grief of what

163
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,960
we have to sacrifice in order to move
on to a new way of doing things. Um,

164
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,420
this is a place, by the way, that many
of us find ourselves in right now. Um, I,

165
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:33,680
you know, as uh, as I mentioned,

166
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,590
I host this daily broadcast on
Facebook called resistance live.

167
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,550
And just last night I had
to post something about, um,

168
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,290
I know everybody feels like they're in
a pit of despair and in the pit of grief

169
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:46,280
based on what has happened in the last
couple of days in our nation, um, please,

170
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,540
you know, recognize the grief is
real and also recognize that it's,

171
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:54,350
this place that we're in is not going
to last forever lost on the heroine's

172
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:57,600
journey necessarily leads to intervention.
Now,

173
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,470
some of you who may know the historic
heroes' dirties may recognize this as the

174
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,850
point where like the gods send
into tools, right? Um, you know,

175
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,260
Zeus kind of throws down the lightning
bolts and all of a sudden everything gets

176
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:07,800
better.

177
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,970
In our case intervention is actually
really about connection because it's about

178
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:15,180
taking on our own agency and connecting
with other women to move forward.

179
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,580
And again, we're going to talk
through this in a bit more depth,

180
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,410
but intervention is the moment of change.

181
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,580
It's the moment where we adopt our own
agency and step forward to make the world

182
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:28,140
more of what we want as
women. Um, and then rebirth.

183
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,770
That's the place where we really build
the future and continue to move forward

184
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,240
toward the world that we want to live in.

185
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,070
And then we return to our home territory
back to the top of the cycle. And again,

186
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:40,320
remember we're spiraling through
all of this all the time.

187
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,390
So rebirth and return is really
about return to a place of stasis,

188
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,670
not returned to the place
that we weren't before.

189
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,610
And so the journey of the
warrior woman is one that,

190
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:54,480
and this is going to be a theme in what
we discussed next is a place of constant

191
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:58,950
growth. It's not like the change ever
stops. It may ease up from time to time,

192
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,840
but the growth is continuous.

193
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,280
So where does this take us in the
context of women in leadership and

194
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:06,420
particularly in corporate,

195
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:11,070
but also in government and politics
and nonprofit and our lives and how we,

196
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,060
how we move forward.

197
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:16,290
So the first place we start on this
is we're at the place of illusion,

198
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,090
which is that what we were
promised is a lie. Um,

199
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,210
and this one is a particularly tough one,

200
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:24,870
I think for a lot of us to swallow because
for many of us who came up as women

201
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,700
leaders, what we were told was, again,

202
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,910
you do all these things right and
it's gonna be just fine, right?

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,090
All you have to do is x, Y, and Z. And
every time that you don't quite make it,

204
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,010
there's just one more little
thing that you need to do.

205
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,850
You add to that the myth that
women have been indoctrinated with,

206
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:41,490
which is the idea that
we can have it all right,

207
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,050
that there isn't all to even have.

208
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,160
And that if we do all the right things
in terms of our home life and our work

209
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:48,180
life and you know,

210
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:52,230
we cope and we hire the right help when
we needed or we seek out other resources

211
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:56,100
just to make it all work, that somehow
we're going to hit some perfect balance.

212
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,910
It's going to allow us to feel like we've
hit some arbitrary measure of success.

213
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,660
This whole thing is a lie. Um, and the,

214
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:07,530
the key point about this illusion that I
want to just make at the moment is that

215
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,370
we're starting to see all
of this disintegrate right
now in our culture, right?

216
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,320
The idea that, you know, again,

217
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,020
me two maps very strongly on to
what I'm going to talk about today,

218
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:17,480
but the idea that,
you know,

219
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,180
we have to just put up with a certain
degree of discrimination and a little bit

220
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,070
of harassment here,
we're just not going to talk about it.

221
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,700
This is just part of what you have to put
up with in order to achieve on the job.

222
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,000
All of that lie illusion.

223
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,700
So where does this take us to now?

224
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,890
We get to the point of
betrayal next in the journey.

225
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:38,190
And what I want to say about this is that
women's leadership advocacy has done a

226
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:40,320
lot, right? I don't want to discount that.

227
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:44,370
There are some very powerful voices out
there in the leadership methodology that

228
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,330
I work in, in my industry who have done
an awful lot to help women succeed.

229
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,360
But what we have failed to do is teach
women how to become their own best

230
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:57,790
advocates to teach women how to work
together as change agents in leadership.

231
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,610
And so to me,
lifelong feminist right here,

232
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:04,300
I just want to say that very big believer
in the principles of equality and

233
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,130
equity that many of us are working toward,

234
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,570
we have not gone far enough in the context
of helping women to claim their own

235
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:11,830
authority.
Um,

236
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,210
it feels often as though what we're
doing is pleading for change rather than

237
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:19,120
stepping forward and effecting
change ourselves. Um,

238
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,870
and so the standpoint of betrayal is
the point where we recognize that the

239
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:26,680
coping skills that we had before that
we have been taught sometimes top I want

240
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:29,350
another or not enough to
get us where we want to go.

241
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,580
So the next place that
we come to his awakening,

242
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,750
and this is the principle of why
we need warrior women. So you know,

243
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:41,140
one of the things that I want to emphasize
here when I talk about this is that

244
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,860
the impact of powerful embodied activists,

245
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:49,861
women leaders on corporate cultures
and the world is potentially dramatic.

246
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,140
Um, because one of the things that we have
to recognize is that we have different

247
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:56,440
ways of leading than what
we have seen traditionally.

248
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,320
And the studies bear this out,
right? We are more collaborative.

249
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,040
We are more communicative corporations
that have more women on their boards of

250
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,490
directors are investigated less, they're
more productive, they're more profitable,

251
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,860
they generate more revenue, generally
speaking, compared to their peers. Uh,

252
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:14,140
and all of this has to do with the
fact that women as leaders connect.

253
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,220
So warrior women in every
environment can make a difference.

254
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,450
Assuming that we are empowered to
step forward and create change.

255
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,740
And so the point of awakening is the
point that each one of us decides that we

256
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:31,030
are going to step forward and claim our
ability to advocate for different models

257
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,510
of leadership.
Um,

258
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,080
and I want to encourage all of you and
no matter where you find yourselves in

259
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,460
your career points at this point,

260
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:40,900
to think about what's the choice that you
have in front of you right now to make

261
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:44,890
more of a difference in your lives
and your working environments and your

262
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,000
culture in your world.

263
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,410
What's the choice that you are faced with
right now that may lead you to become

264
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,380
more of a voice for the change
that you want to see in the world?

265
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:57,010
Because it benefits everything. It
impacts everything that we do right now.

266
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,830
So this brings me to a point of
critique. Here we are in the descent. Um,

267
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,370
and one of the things that you all may
remember from back in 2016 is that when

268
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:08,740
we had a Hillary Clinton
running for president,

269
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,570
and we saw a lot of the sort of what I
like to refer to his lady power movements

270
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:15,190
or commodity feminism,
right?

271
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,210
All of these kind of like pet powder
pink websites for women's empowerment.

272
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:21,940
And if you just wear the right suit
and you put on the right pair of heels,

273
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:22,810
everything's going to be okay.

274
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:26,350
And I will admit that in my
industry I worked for some of these,

275
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,900
like what a lot of people don't know is
that I actually used to collaborate with

276
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,750
Ivanka Trump, um, many months ago. Uh,

277
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,540
but that is a prime example
of commodity feminism.

278
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:39,010
It's selling a solution that
is not internal to yourself.

279
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,360
And so what part of the messaging here
in terms of how do we build stronger

280
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,480
women's leadership? It has to be
about self origination. You know,

281
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:49,060
one of the things that I talk about all
the time in corporate environments where

282
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:53,600
I train and teach women leaders is the
idea that when we change what's on the

283
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,240
inside, we inevitably change
what's on the outside.

284
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,540
And so it's not like there is some easy
one size fits all solution that shifts

285
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:04,100
us toward equity.
We have to be that.

286
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,550
We have to be empowered internally to
make the shifts that are necessary to step

287
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:12,170
forward to effect change. So, um,
commodity feminism is the descent.

288
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:15,230
And by the way, this is also the point
where we start to recognize the cost,

289
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,970
right? Where we start to look inside
ourselves and see, I have been guilted,

290
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,160
I have been shamed into
not being good enough.

291
00:15:22,161 --> 00:15:24,290
I had been told that my
voice is meaningless.

292
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,680
What does that mean in terms of what
are the tools that I'm going to pick up

293
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:30,380
next?
How can I communicate more effectively?

294
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,990
How do I need to refine the way that I
operate in every environment so that I am

295
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:35,030
using my voice?

296
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,810
And so one of the things that we
talk about when we talk about tools,

297
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:41,630
and I'll talk about this in just a
couple of minutes a little bit more,

298
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,900
is the idea that we do need to adopt
new weapons as women in leadership.

299
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,110
So that may look like things
like nonviolent communication.

300
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,820
And for those of you who don't know,

301
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,310
nonviolent communication strategies were
developed by Marshall Rosenberg in the

302
00:15:56,311 --> 00:16:00,630
1970s and there are means by which you
can effectively communicate your needs

303
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:03,950
and wants so that they are heard from the
perspective of the person on the other

304
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:05,930
side of the table from
you with compassion.

305
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,530
This is a skill set by the way that I
think everybody needs in every corporate

306
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:14,060
environment. Um, it is very
much about this, what I
experienced, what I witnessed,

307
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:18,080
what I value, and then requesting
buyin in a collaborative way.

308
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,220
That skill set is one that for women
in leadership is absolutely critical

309
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,660
because we need to be able to learn to
advocate in ways that are different from

310
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,610
pounding the table to demand what we want.

311
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,010
Very much traditional
masculine leadership model.

312
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,240
Whereas our collaborative means of asking
for change and propelling forward and

313
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:40,241
communication can actually shift things
and help others to see the value of what

314
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:42,950
we're after.
So that's one tool,

315
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,400
but I will also just add that in a lot
of corporate environments these days,

316
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,230
there's a lot of toxicity underway.

317
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:51,590
And some of the tools that we need to
think about empowering ourselves with our

318
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:53,180
tools that, you know, five,

319
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:55,430
10 years ago I couldn't teach
in corporate environments.

320
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,120
Things like how do you protect your
energy so that when you're under attack,

321
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,700
which we're about to get to in a minute,
we're getting into the hurricane,

322
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,350
you know that you aren't,

323
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,350
you're not taking on and internalizing
the negative messaging that you're

324
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:07,100
getting.

325
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,840
How can you step forward and feel
empowered in your body and in your

326
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:15,650
presentation so that you are making an
impact that shows others that you are not

327
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,550
to be messed with.

328
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,450
All of these skill sets and tools
are new ones that we need to learn.

329
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:23,720
And so one of the things that I do
recommend for women leaders who are in the

330
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:24,950
ground on the battle,

331
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:29,150
on the battlefield every day with
this is that you think through how the

332
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:33,350
experience that you have as a
warrior woman is affecting you.

333
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,480
Are you internalizing negative messaging?

334
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,190
Are you having a hard time with how you
can advocate and succeed and keep going?

335
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,850
You may need to refine your skill
set in this way. And you know,

336
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,010
these are the baseline on the ground
skills that I teach every day in corporate

337
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,480
environments.
Um,

338
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,470
but it is an important point of
recognition that we need new tools for new

339
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,304
times.

340
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,740
So now we get to the hurricane and this
is how worried are women are punished.

341
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,700
So, um, you know,

342
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,640
one of the things that I like to be
very blunt about in the warrior woman

343
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:05,520
journey that I'm talking about today is
nobody is saying this is easy, right?

344
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,210
No one is saying that like,
we,

345
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,350
we're all going to step forward and like
kick some ass and win and it's all just

346
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:13,710
going to get better overnight. Um,
warrior women are punished relentlessly.

347
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,670
All we have to do is look at the 2016
election. It's about how you talk,

348
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,380
the sound of your voice, how you laugh,
what you wear, your hair, your makeup,

349
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,243
your body,

350
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,940
whether or not you're meeting certain
codes that convey certain bits of

351
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,710
information that make
you qualified or not.

352
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,970
And I will also just add that as we work
to transform our culture and we work to

353
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:36,750
transform our society privileges
a hard thing to let go of. Right?

354
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,530
We see the experience right now
of old ways of doing things,

355
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,970
old models of leadership,

356
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
old means of operation clinging on by
their fingernails to avoid any change in

357
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:48,610
the world.
Um,

358
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,680
and one of the things that mean that
means is that crazy attacks will come out

359
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:56,550
of nowhere. Pizza Parlors in Washington
DC come to mind, for instance. Um,

360
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,820
the level at which we have to be prepared
to go to battle for the world that we

361
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:05,070
want to build is significant.
And as well,

362
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:09,960
it's critical in this environment that
we work together to hold one another up.

363
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,550
Um, so one of the things that I talk
about when we talk about the importance of

364
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:19,020
collaboration as a way
through and connection as a
way through is the issue of

365
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,550
why we're better off together.

366
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,430
So one of the things that I want
to point out here by the way,

367
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:27,000
is that traditional male models of
leadership encourage women to compete with

368
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:27,834
one another.

369
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,020
That's because we've been told that
there's only room for so many of us at the

370
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:34,850
talk that by the way, as
a part of the big lie. Um,

371
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,400
and one of the things that it means
is that when we are competing with one

372
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:40,140
another,
when we are tearing one another down,

373
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:43,800
when we are not helping to lift other
women up in the corporate environment or

374
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,300
elsewhere,
um,

375
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,700
we are not focused on how we can work
together to actually affect change. Um,

376
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,160
it's a really convenient self reinforcing
mechanism of patriarchy that women

377
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:55,800
like to tear each other down
and beat each other up. Um,

378
00:19:55,801 --> 00:20:00,801
and so one of the things that I really
encourage here is that we think about how

379
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,940
we can instead adopt a model. This is a
very serious thought leadership pivot.

380
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,120
But instead adopt a model that says,
when one of us wins, we all rise.

381
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,000
This is a very hard thing for
women to internalize honestly,

382
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,940
because we've been raised in a culture
that says that's just not the way it

383
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:19,020
works. But my standpoint
on this is the following,

384
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,080
when we recognize how much
damage we've done to one another,

385
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:23,940
and this is really why we're
sitting in the place of loss.

386
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:24,810
When we talk about this,

387
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,490
how much harm we've done to one another
by not adopting a thought process that

388
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,800
says,
let me see how I can help my sister up.

389
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,840
We recognize all the time that's been
lost that would have affected change

390
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:40,620
before now. And it also propels us
to make change more in the future.

391
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:43,570
So the image I like to work
with on this is the idea of um,

392
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,110
an an Everest sending pillar of humanity.
Women,

393
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,520
if you would like to think about it.
And that way it can just be women.

394
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:50,200
But I honestly think about
it as gender neutral.

395
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,620
And the idea of it is that we leave
no one behind. And hopelessness.

396
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,530
We leave no one behind
without opportunity and so on.

397
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:58,050
One of her sisters is
falling off the pillar.

398
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,000
You are the person who leans down with
your hand to grab her and pull her back

399
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:04,330
up. This as a, as an image, as a metaphor,

400
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:08,650
functions so well in the idea of how we
can affect change in the environments

401
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:11,110
that we are in.
Because when we see someone struggling,

402
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:15,010
another woman's struggling. When we see
another woman working so hard to succeed,

403
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,850
what can we do to help lift her up
rather than saying, oh, she sucks.

404
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:21,040
Let me just let her fail
over there on her own.

405
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,700
The more that we can consider the
collaborative nature of how we can work

406
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,960
together and abandoned this idea of the
zero sum game, you know, I, I, by the way,

407
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:31,600
the quote I always refer to on
this front is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

408
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,520
She was asked one time when,

409
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,370
how many women needed to be on the supreme
court to make her happy. And she said,

410
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:41,020
nine and the reporter was horrified by
that story and she said, what? You know,

411
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:44,230
for centuries it was nine
men on the Supreme Court.

412
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:46,080
What's wrong with the idea of a s,
you know,

413
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,990
all women on the Supreme Court all put
together and it's such a shocking idea to

414
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:50,591
us,
right?

415
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:53,620
Because we've been convinced that there's
just this tiny little slot that we

416
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:54,311
have to fit into.

417
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:58,990
So the pivot of abandoning the zero sum
game and then moving toward a place of

418
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:03,991
collective and collaborative advocacy
as women makes a huge difference in what

419
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,290
we are able to accomplish.

420
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,760
And so that takes us to several
points of intervention here. Um,

421
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,070
one of which is how to be
a warrior woman at work.

422
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,220
And we're going to talk through a couple
of different ways in which we can be a

423
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:18,020
warrior woman here to really
affect change. So, um,

424
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,930
and I'll just say to all
the guys in the room,

425
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:22,990
I want to just really appreciate your
listening to all of this too because the

426
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:25,270
skill sets are honestly gender neutral,

427
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:29,740
but from the perspective of what warrior
women need to do in the workplace.

428
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,250
Um, if we're at a really
interesting turning point right now.

429
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,200
So to me this is about a refusal
to accept the status quo.

430
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,670
So if you are in a working environment
where you've seen instances of

431
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:45,010
unconscious bias and you
have not shattered out,

432
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,020
this is now where it needs to start.

433
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,500
If you are aware in your workplace that
somebody has been discriminated against

434
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:53,170
or harassed,
silence is no longer an option.

435
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,400
We are really in a place right now from
the standpoint of advocacy where we're

436
00:22:57,401 --> 00:22:58,720
at zero tolerance.
And again,

437
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:03,190
me too is a prime example of this because
you see all the seizing frustration

438
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:06,730
underneath the surface of what women
and others, it's not just women,

439
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:11,731
but women in predominant numbers had
experienced that has caused such rage,

440
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,000
such rage at every,
all the dreams that have been lost.

441
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:18,400
All the opportunities that
have been taken from us,

442
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,830
he experiences that have
been mapped onto our bodies.

443
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,760
And from the perspective
of how we shift this,

444
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,120
some of it has to be about
speaking the unspokens right?

445
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,610
For the first time ever saying
the things that we had been told,

446
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:34,330
we are not allowed to say telling the
stories that we've been told over and over

447
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,980
again that we are not allowed to tell.

448
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,390
And simply the use of our voices in that
way in work environments changes the

449
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:44,290
corporate culture. And I'll tell you, you
know, I do work inside investment banks,

450
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,690
huge financial institutions,
publicly traded companies all the time.

451
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,220
The ability of women when they are
empowered to actually speak the truth of

452
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:55,640
their experiences in those environments
can change those cultures overnight

453
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,110
because all of the sudden it's
not like they're unspoken things,

454
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:04,010
hidden stories that are oppressing
certain qualities and preventing women

455
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:06,860
fundamentally from living
out their true gifts. Right?

456
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,990
Cause this is really what it's
all about for me. It's this,

457
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,950
it's about talent and it's about why
we're here. It's about talent and purpose.

458
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,850
And so one of the other things that's
really important to me when I talk about

459
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:21,590
warrior women in leadership at work is
that we think through why we're here.

460
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,350
What's the purpose, right? And
if we look back at the metrics,

461
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:27,470
I started with a traditional
masculine models of leadership,

462
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,060
only valuing money and time,

463
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,750
what worry women and women in general
in leadership bring to the table as an

464
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:36,650
idea that we are all here with certain
gifts that can be contributed to the

465
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:37,484
collective.

466
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,670
And the metric that I talk about when
I go in and even in gender neutral

467
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:44,690
environments teach about leadership is
the idea that we shift from that metric

468
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,550
toward a metric of growth, continuous
growth, continuous growth of service.

469
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,020
And part of that requires each and every
one of us to be able to recognize the

470
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:57,260
gifts and the purpose for
why we're here fundamentally.

471
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,030
So to me,

472
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,690
one of the things that has to happen in
order for us to be able to fully embody

473
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:05,780
our gifts, to live on our purpose,
to serve out in the way that we,

474
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,290
we need to serve,
um,

475
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,960
is that those stories are taken away so
that the true totality of our voices can

476
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:13,160
be heard.
Um,

477
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,300
and so part of this aspect of stepping
completely into our leadership as warrior

478
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:21,890
women has to be about that use of voice
that then allows us to contribute our

479
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:25,280
gifts in different ways. Does that
make sense to everybody? I hope so. Um,

480
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,800
and you know, one of the things that
I want to say about this as well,

481
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:32,801
just while we're on the topic of purpose
is that if we are measuring success by,

482
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,200
um, consistent standards of
growth, are we growing ourselves?

483
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,280
Are we growing our teams?

484
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:40,310
And this is not like the bottom line
revenue growth that we're talking about,

485
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:43,250
right? It's about the growth of the
impact that you want to make in the world.

486
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,440
If we are focused on that,

487
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,220
then we are asking different questions
about what success looks like.

488
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,850
And this is where we get to, to have a
true benefit for women in leadership,

489
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:57,290
right? Because if we are modeling success
on our growth, on our collaboration,

490
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,120
on the difference that
we make in the world,

491
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,830
then inherently we care more about
things like the quality of our lives.

492
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,920
We care more about whether or not we
can create work environments where, um,

493
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,940
you know, women can contribute even
if they've got children at home.

494
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,860
We work to create cultural shifts
that allow for, um, you know,

495
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,500
childcare to be absolutely available to
all of us so that we have an opportunity

496
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,810
to contribute at the
totality of our gifts.

497
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,550
So the mental pivot away from money
and time is the only metric towards

498
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:29,150
different models of success is really
key here. And I hope that makes sense.

499
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,830
Okay. Um, just a little bit
on warrior woman at home, I'm,

500
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,890
one of the things that I just want
to point out here is that, um,

501
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,460
even in households where a
women are primary earners,

502
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,010
we still do two thirds of the housework.

503
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,200
And we do right now at
this moment in time,

504
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,350
50% more childcare than women did
in the fifties. Believe it or not,

505
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,960
that's because models are parenting
have changed. Pure research.

506
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,850
If you go look at these
numbers, it's astonishing. Um,

507
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,140
one of the things that I want to make
plain when we talk about cultural shifts

508
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:02,070
here is that everything that we do,
by the way, is political. I mean,

509
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:04,650
I think this is kind of a given if you've
been in a feminist movement at all in

510
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:05,461
any way,
shape or form.

511
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:10,170
But then most intimate conversations
that we have about our needs and our and

512
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:13,950
being supported inevitably impact
the way that we are in the world.

513
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,870
And so one of the things that is key here
in the way that I think about this is

514
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:23,100
that if we are not able to ask for
what we need in our home environments,

515
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,210
it also therefore becomes
much more difficult for us
to ask for it in the world.

516
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,350
And so even at the tiny
baseline conversations that
we have with our partners

517
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:34,140
and our spouses about like
who's doing the dishes, right?

518
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,400
Like who's taking care of the kids?
Do we need help? How can I get help?

519
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:41,700
I myself am a single mom and I'm really
big on like can we create collaborative

520
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:45,330
models in our communities that can help
to support women in different ways that

521
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,530
maybe have not been discussed before,

522
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,710
that are outside of our old school
historic model of, you know,

523
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,340
women doing women's work at home and
men being out working in the world.

524
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,280
We need to start getting creative
about the solutions that we seek here.

525
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,520
Those proactive conversations where
we draw a line in the sand and say,

526
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:01,020
this isn't working for me anymore.

527
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:03,510
Let me think creatively about
how to make it different.

528
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,170
Inevitably lead us to places of
being able to have more high stakes

529
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:12,060
conversations out in the world at large.
Um, and so we can't forget that. Right.

530
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,770
And I also just want to
mention one other thing here.

531
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:16,350
I do not believe in work life
balance. I think, you know, again,

532
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:20,430
it's like a total myth that it could even
be possible. I think what is possible,

533
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:23,130
however, is to have lives that are
in alignment with what we value.

534
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,200
And for each of us, that's
a unique metric, right? What
do I value most in my life?

535
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:30,490
How do I create a life that gives me that?
Um,

536
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,900
and if we are not thinking about
that individually for ourselves,

537
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:36,330
we also can't create solutions
for it in the collective.

538
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,310
So starting at the baseline of what do
I need most in my own home is a really

539
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:45,420
important way to lead to being able and
more courageous to have higher stakes

540
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:49,830
conversations in other
places. Um, okay. And lastly,

541
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:52,470
the point of intervention of how
to be a warrior woman in the world.

542
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,260
So one of the things about activist women,

543
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,830
women's leadership that to
me is so compelling at this
moment in time is that we

544
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:01,470
are in a place where we actually
have an opportunity to make a massive

545
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:03,630
difference.
Like the world is cracking open right now.

546
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,710
And the opportunity for change and to
create a future that we want to live in is

547
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,840
more compelling now and more
possible now. I even saying, um,

548
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,670
despite the dark days that we seem to be
living in then it's been for quite some

549
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,370
time. I think we can all,
you know, I'm 46 years old,

550
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,970
those of us who are sixties and
seventies babies may have some vague

551
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:25,020
recollection of other historic turning
points in time where opportunities like

552
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:29,410
this felt like they were possible. This
moment feels particularly rich to me. Um,

553
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:34,230
and I want to remind you all that,
you know, in lots of mythologies, um,

554
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,220
the cremation ground,

555
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:38,880
the place where everything is burned to
ash is actually the most fertile place

556
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:42,820
for growth. It's the place where you
can plant seeds and create a future. Um,

557
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,580
and so where we find ourselves
right now really has to be,

558
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:47,080
and I'm such a big advocate for this,

559
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:50,290
and my daily resistance broadcasts a
place where we think about the future that

560
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,950
we want to live in, into. And we start
living from that place right now.

561
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,170
So that means, for instance, that
we don't, um, how should I put it?

562
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,980
We don't,
uh,

563
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,610
we don't get down in the gutter and fight
dirty if that's not the future that we

564
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:07,720
want to live into. And it means that if
we make choices about how we advocate,

565
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:10,720
we advocate from a place of kindness
and compassion and acceptance.

566
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,700
It also means that we are constantly
working toward the future that we want.

567
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,720
And so to me,

568
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:19,780
part of this as well is about how do we
stand up and fight for the future that

569
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:23,950
we want in our world for our children.
Um, you know, in government, in,

570
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,750
in the corporate
environments that we work in.

571
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:30,610
How everyday can we step into modeling
the future that we want to live in?

572
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,220
Not Easy. Like I want just want
to say this is not easy. You know,

573
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:34,300
managing our emotions,

574
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:37,960
especially in times of turmoil and stress
and trauma and our nation is really,

575
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,610
really hard and we have to envision the
world that we want to live into where

576
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:44,800
the people who are going to lead the
way on that. By the way, I mean I think,

577
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,740
I hope that makes sense that like women
who stepped forward and really own this

578
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:50,350
moment and take it through
the transformation. You know,

579
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,320
this is like a birth process we're in
right now as a culture. And as a country,

580
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,690
we know how to give birth. Right? Um,

581
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,080
and one of the things that I think is
key there is that we have to claim it,

582
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,960
right? No one's swooping in to
save us on his front, right?

583
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:05,620
We have to be the people who lead the
change at this moment in time to build

584
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:08,020
that future because we can see it. So, um,

585
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,350
it's a very unique opportunity where
we are right now, honestly. And, um,

586
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,030
if I could kind of, um, leave
everybody with a thought here about,

587
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,670
um, what we're, what we're leading into,

588
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:24,090
the question I get asked more often than
not is why or what is this vision that

589
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:26,680
you have of the future? What is this
going to look like? When we got there, um,

590
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:29,350
I did a speaking tour this fall and that
was the number one question that I got

591
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:32,680
asked in every location around the country
was what's this vision of the future

592
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:35,470
that you have for women and for all of us?
Um,

593
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,750
and so to me the point of this is that
we have an opportunity now to create a

594
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:42,640
world where there is equity,

595
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:47,530
where from the standpoint of even just
corporate hiring and recruiting po

596
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,101
policies,

597
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:50,230
like where are we going to recruit
the next generation of women leaders?

598
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,320
We can do all of that differently
where we can do things like, you know,

599
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,530
pay equity analysis inside our companies
and see how people are getting paid

600
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:01,450
from that all the way up to
how do we create, um, you know,

601
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,460
a place where no one is left behind,
your hopelessness.

602
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:05,170
A government that represents all of us.

603
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,670
I'm a world where everyone
has opportunity. What, what
does that look like? Um,

604
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,170
to me it looks like a place where we
know that every human life has value and

605
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:18,820
where we step outside of the arbitrary
hierarchies of race and gender and

606
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:23,770
national origin and preference and
everything else and orientation.

607
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,400
Um,

608
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,420
and think through the idea that the idea
that there's an arbitrary hierarchy of

609
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:31,870
humans is just that it's just a myth,
right? And so if we approach the world,

610
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:34,990
we want to live in from a place of all
of us having equality and equity and

611
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:35,824
value,

612
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,950
that means necessarily that we can't
have policies that some of us who don't

613
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:41,450
benefit others,
right?

614
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,370
That create artificial
differences between us as humans.

615
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,060
And so, um, to me this is
kind of like the big Kahuna.

616
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:54,260
We're in a big Kahuna moment right now
and warrior women will change the world

617
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:58,760
by being the people who write
the path. Right? Um, so, uh,

618
00:32:58,761 --> 00:32:59,300
I know this,

619
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,360
a lot of this has been a lot more esoteric
and heading than I anticipated it was

620
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,760
going to be when I ran through it
this morning for like the fourth time.

621
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,240
But I think I'm going to wind
down there and just say that, um,

622
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,470
for all the women in the room,

623
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:11,330
I really want to encourage
you to think through like,

624
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,660
what's the next step to taking your
voice to the next level and where can you

625
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,490
step more fully into your own leadership,

626
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,710
take up new skills and new
armor and new weapons, um,

627
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,190
to change the world and make it better.

628
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,190
And to recognize as well
that your heroine's journey
is your own story and you

629
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:31,190
get to choose how you live it and that
inevitably there's a heroine and a

630
00:33:31,191 --> 00:33:32,390
warrior woman and all of us.

631
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:36,800
I think that's what I believe and
how we get there is within our own,

632
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,650
uh, our own path and our own
story and our own dividing.

633
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:42,710
But that it's really critical
that we are action oriented in it,

634
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:46,100
that we claim it ourselves rather than
allowing ourselves to just be pushed

635
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:48,710
through the flow of our lives.
We really need to swim with the current,

636
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,390
if that makes sense.
Um,

637
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,660
and step fully into the opportunities
that are there for us to battle for the

638
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:57,440
world that we want to live in.
So I think that's it for today.

639
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,900
Very heady and esoteric,
but I hope you guys enjoyed it.

640
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,910
I'm more than happy to take
some questions if he was like,

641
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:07,120
well, thanks for coming in. I
have like many, many questions.

642
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,820
I'll limit it to one. That's fine.
You can ask many, many questions.

643
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,330
Maybe we can talk after that,

644
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,480
but my question is around I try my
best to subscribe to feminism blogs and

645
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,260
listen to different speakers and,
and promote.

646
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,280
But then I feel that when
I am sometimes asked to,

647
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,880
uh,
summarize what I've heard of it,

648
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:35,410
very difficult time summarizing it
because I don't live the experiences that

649
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:40,480
many women experience. Um,
and do you have tips and,

650
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,440
yeah. Good question. When
are you asked to summarize it

651
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,940
generally with other men?

652
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,210
Yeah. Okay. Got It. So that's,

653
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:51,820
that's a really interesting point
because let me just say this.

654
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,000
I am a very big believer that we are
not just at a turning point for women.

655
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,170
We're at a turning point for men.

656
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,190
And I talk quite a bit about the idea
of sacred masculinity and modeling good

657
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:02,470
masculinity to other men.
So first of all,

658
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:05,200
Kudos to you for being willing to
be a change agent on that friends.

659
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,830
Cause there are a lot of men who aren't
willing to even make the effort. Um,

660
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,360
but the second thing I would say about
this is that there is in some sense,

661
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,920
um, no substitute for men
talking to women about their own,

662
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,360
about the experiences of women,

663
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,940
meaning that you can
summarize to a certain extent.

664
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:26,140
And of course you can do it to the best
of your ability and the next thing that

665
00:35:26,141 --> 00:35:28,810
comes out of your mouth. If it
were me, it would be, by the way,

666
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:30,400
are you talking to your wife about this?

667
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,290
Are you talking to your sister about this?

668
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:35,860
Are you talking to your daughter about
her experiences so that you're learning

669
00:35:35,861 --> 00:35:37,580
it? Um, you know, I,

670
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,860
I'm learning it through the prism
of multiple women's experiences,

671
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:41,694
if that makes sense.

672
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,380
And I will also just add that there is
nothing wrong with asking what can I do

673
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:49,170
to do it better? You know, what
can I do to make it better for you?

674
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:50,940
What can I do to make it better for women?
Generally?

675
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,830
How can I be a better advocate? So, um,

676
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,910
I think it's not just about how can
I summarize what I'm reading about,

677
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:03,840
but also how can I propel men to be more
engaged in the conversation about what

678
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,440
a healthier masculinity would look like
and how to make the world a better place

679
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,020
for women generally. Does
that make sense? Yeah.

680
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,050
Yep.
Thank you so much for coming here.

681
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:13,920
Thank you so much for your talk
is actually pretty nice. Uh,

682
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,720
and really enlightening.
Um,

683
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:20,120
you mentioned a couple of times this
idea of a masculine model of leadership.

684
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,940
I was wondering what in your view,

685
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,810
a feminine model of leadership or
a gender neutral board agendas,

686
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,630
new gender neutral model of
leadership would look like?

687
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,690
So this is a really,

688
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,600
this is actually what we normally do when
I go in and do corporate training and

689
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:37,470
consulting. So you, you've given me
a, um, a nice little transition here.

690
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:41,370
So we have something we call the aligned
leadership model, which is a model that,

691
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,790
um,

692
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,150
that actually has what we would consider
it to be like more feminine qualities

693
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:46,260
of leadership attached to it.

694
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,200
It is fundamentally an emotionally
intelligent model of leadership.

695
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,010
And it starts from the place of thinking
through leadership from, I mean,

696
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,210
there's 12 points on a pivot.

697
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,160
We all like it would take me a
whole other hour to go through it,

698
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,490
but fundamentally it starts from a place
of the most effective leadership in

699
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:02,850
today's environment. Being leadership
that starts with curiosity and compassion.

700
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,600
Um, and so it's not, I'm,
I am the, I'm the king.

701
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,610
I am the ultimate note all of
how this company should run. Um,

702
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,490
but really more of a more of
a questioning, a consistent
questioning of how can,

703
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,030
how can we improve? What am I good
at? What, what does my team good at?

704
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:21,300
How can I look at what my gifts are and
where I'm weak and build an organization

705
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:25,680
that fills in the gaps? How can I value
everyone's gifts on my team? Right?

706
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,790
And it also talks through the concept
that I shared with you today. Uh,

707
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,350
growth is one of the main
metrics of success. Um, so to me,

708
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,950
I wouldn't want to call it a feminine
model of leadership. I think it's,

709
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,900
I think it's far more healthy,
right?

710
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,560
Are Align leadership model that we
teach is really about how do you create

711
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,270
healthy ecosystems inside companies
where everyone is functional and moreover

712
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:52,260
that is holistic so that it's not just
about what the person can perform at work.

713
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,850
I mean,
you guys are amazing in here by the way.

714
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:57,000
I have to say that of all the working
environments that I've stepped into,

715
00:37:57,001 --> 00:38:01,170
this one seems to care the most about
the totality of the human beings who work

716
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:04,090
here. And that is amazing to me. Um, and,

717
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,950
and truly something to be honored
and admired and uplifted. Um,

718
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:12,000
but so many environments that I walk
into only care about what happens to the

719
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:15,750
individual in terms of how they
can provide for the company, right.

720
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,340
And how they can perform
when they're there.

721
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:21,420
And if somebody's spouses dying or
someone's child is having a crisis,

722
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,490
who cares? As long as the
bottom line needs are met. Um,

723
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,130
aligned leadership to me is
really about recognizing that, um,

724
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,330
that we're all connected,

725
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:33,090
that organizations are only as healthy
as the individuals who are within them.

726
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,830
And that,
um,

727
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,810
just in the same way that each of us have
gifts to contribute to the world, um,

728
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,150
organizations do as well.

729
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,020
And so mission is really critical and
important and making decisions based on

730
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,790
mission that are aligned with also all
the individuals that make up that mission,

731
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,510
um,

732
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,840
creates environments that people want
to live in and work in and are loyal to.

733
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:53,351
And that,
you know,

734
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:56,710
you can't imagine leaving and just talk
and talk to some of you today as I was

735
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:59,860
walking around before here. I mean,
that's very present here, right?

736
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,820
That degree of respect and understanding
of the way in which everybody who works

737
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,950
here is connected and the
needs of everyone being met.

738
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:10,450
So that to me is about as close as I can
get without doing like a full blown all

739
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:13,900
day long training like I normally do
in corporate environments on this. Um,

740
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:14,531
but yeah,

741
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:17,830
it really is about emotional intelligence
fundamentally as a principal and then

742
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:21,280
mission and purpose and making all of
your decisions about your people and the

743
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:25,810
people who work for you as if we're a
family because we are. Right. Makes Sense.

744
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,290
Okay.
Good.

745
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,210
So I had a question about
something you mentioned earlier,

746
00:39:29,211 --> 00:39:32,210
earlier you said that these stories
of many women had been erased.

747
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,060
Is there someplace place we could go to
look at and we could find those stories

748
00:39:35,061 --> 00:39:35,894
that you've been with breasts?

749
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,660
Well, so if they've been a it, it's
that you have to do a lot of digging.

750
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:41,240
So I will tell a story about this,
this kind of um,

751
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,090
that really brought this home to me.

752
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:47,420
But I will tell you that it took me
about three hours of like serious,

753
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:51,640
serious digging on the Internet to find
anything that remotely looked like a,

754
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:55,160
so my, my maiden name is crow.
Nice. Um, as you all know,

755
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,830
and my father is really into ancestry.

756
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,060
So one of the things that we discovered
when he did all of this work is that, um,

757
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,320
our family on my father's
side is originally from
Alsace Lorraine and the, um,

758
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,040
the spelling of our name originally
in German means iron crown.

759
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,040
And so I went digging
because my father was killed.

760
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,560
We were ironworkers apparently. And
like the 15th century, you know,

761
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:17,970
my dad's gone all the way back through
all this, but I went digging to see,

762
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,330
well like what's the
reference point for this name?

763
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,310
And I discovered in like three hours of
kind of falling down a rabbit hole. Um,

764
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,980
this is, you know, the old lawyer in
me with a researcher, um, that there,

765
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:33,950
there was this thing called the iron
crown. Some you may know historically. Um,

766
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,380
but the iron crown was
originally commissioned by, um,

767
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,420
a queen in like the third century.
Um,

768
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,300
whose name I'm now going to forget
because nobody's ever heard of her because

769
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:45,590
the history has been completely erased.

770
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,740
But I did a whole podcast on this podcast
called the women's leadership podcast.

771
00:40:48,741 --> 00:40:51,620
I did a podcast on justice experience,
uh,

772
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:55,030
recognizing that there had been a
woman who basically had been the head,

773
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:56,490
had something like that,

774
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,050
something the size of the Ottoman Empire
at some point in our history that none

775
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:01,220
of us know about.
Like,

776
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,580
I literally had not heard of this woman
ever before until I went digging for all

777
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:08,030
of this because the stories
that we talking about
history or the stories of men

778
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,850
and so you know,
to some extent it's about your degree of,

779
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,670
we're back to curiosity again, your degree
of curiosity about women's history. Um,

780
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,830
and to some extent it's
also about recognizing that
many of our traditions have

781
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:20,030
always been oral traditions.

782
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,180
And so this is one of the reasons why
women's storytelling still is really

783
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:23,690
important.

784
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,900
And one of the reasons why I encourage
women who want to know about even the

785
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,480
history of their own families
to go interview their
grandmother's on tape before

786
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:30,500
they die,
um,

787
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,140
because the otherwise it gets lost
if it's not written down somewhere.

788
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,820
I wish I could say that there,
there was like a magic, um,

789
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,260
on a racer button that would
bring all of this back.

790
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,280
But I think some of it has to be about
how far are you as an individual willing

791
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:46,410
to do the day to then share it
with the collective. I mean, I,

792
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,780
this is a great opportunity by the way,

793
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:50,780
for a project like somebody should start
a reclaiming women's history project if

794
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:52,320
it's not been done already.
Um,

795
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,960
just so that we can start to see
like all the gaps there. Um, yeah,

796
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,340
so that's my answer to that individual
individual choice I think at this point.

797
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:06,370
So I am lucky, um, to,

798
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:11,410
to be in a leadership position and I have
a team that has one other woman on it

799
00:42:13,411 --> 00:42:17,700
and the rest are men and the team that
I lead are generally somewhere in the

800
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,290
range of about 15 years
behind me career wise.

801
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:26,270
And what I've tried to do is to adapt
my style to the needs of each person on

802
00:42:28,891 --> 00:42:32,330
the team because they are very different,
their experiences are different, the,

803
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,000
their communication styles are different.
Um,

804
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,930
and try to give that hand
up to all of them. Yep. Um,

805
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:45,180
and what I have found in the
last year or two is that, uh,

806
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,630
I sometimes have people call me out as,

807
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,870
as I'm favoring the woman on the team,

808
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:56,010
even though when I sit down and talk
to them about all of the ways that I'm

809
00:42:56,011 --> 00:43:00,570
investing in their careers and, and, and,
and the things that I'm doing for them,

810
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,430
they recognize that they're getting as
much or more. Yup. Um, and so, you know,

811
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:09,090
as you were talking about our
responsibility of kind of bring, you know,

812
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,210
bringing up other women, you know, what,

813
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,290
what about the people who stand by
on the sidelines and go, we'll see.

814
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,090
You're just playing favorites and
that's just know better. Right,

815
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:22,990
right, right. So, um, so it's hard to give
up privilege. You know, I was so excited.

816
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:25,500
It's really hard to give up print
woods and some of it, some of,

817
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,660
some of what the communication
that we all need to learn. Uh,

818
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:33,700
I think to do better is also to say
equity is not about playing favorites.

819
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,360
Right.
Meaning that the image that I,

820
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:41,170
that I share with people about equity
versus equality is that in order to reach

821
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:42,370
true equity culturally,

822
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,510
you do have to lift up people who
historically have not had the extra lift,

823
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,140
right? It's like you think about,
think about it from this perspective,

824
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:53,530
the images that I've seen on this is,
it's so descriptive as you know,

825
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:56,650
you've got people at three different
heights behind a fence, right?

826
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,950
And equality is that everybody gets to
stand on the same place on the fence.

827
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,860
Equity is that everybody can see over it,
right?

828
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,620
And so sometimes that means that
from a historic perspective,

829
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,980
you ha you have to do things
differently in order to create equity.

830
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:11,920
There will be a point, hopefully in the
future where we don't have to do that.

831
00:44:11,921 --> 00:44:16,060
But to me, first of all,
that's not playing favorites.
So I wouldn't call it that.

832
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,220
You know, I guess it's the thing,
you can shout it out and say,

833
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,920
actually that's not what I'm doing and
do what you're already doing there.

834
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:24,970
Which I think sounds like, I hope it's
working to a certain extent. Um, but the,

835
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,300
but the flip side of that as well is that,
um,

836
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:31,090
if we do not actually start
to make different choices
in corporate environments,

837
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,630
leaders, nothing shifts, right?

838
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,150
Like my biggest client is a
publicly traded investment bank. Um,

839
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,120
and they have,

840
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,150
they discovered they did some research
last year and they discovered that only

841
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:45,150
4.7% of their senior executives are women,

842
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,480
even though they hire 35%,
um,

843
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,170
as women and they're losing people and
they've never kind of investigated why,

844
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:54,810
which is crazy to me, but
they've never looked at it. Um,

845
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,000
one of the things that
I've had to say to them is,

846
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,360
why are you not recruiting a
historically women's colleges? Right?

847
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,230
Why are you not thinking about maybe the
fact that you need to provide different

848
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:07,530
kinds of leadership training for women
so that they understand how to navigate

849
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:08,460
this environment better?

850
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:13,590
Why are your senior male leaders not
signing on to initiatives that say,

851
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:16,650
we're making a commitment as an
organization to gender parity?

852
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:17,910
And here's what we're
willing to do about it.

853
00:45:17,911 --> 00:45:19,560
Here's the investment that
we're willing to make.

854
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,780
Here's the training programs
that we want to ascribe to you.

855
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:25,590
Because the other thing is
that the unfortunate thing
about being a woman leader

856
00:45:25,591 --> 00:45:29,160
right now in some environments is that
you have to do the emotional labor of

857
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:32,550
educating people about what
it is that needs to change.

858
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,230
And it is so much easier if senior male
leaders also sign on to that as allies

859
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,230
so that the messaging comes
from other men. Right?

860
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:43,260
We're back to this issue of how can you
kind of like how can other men work as

861
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:46,890
allies to educate other men about the
benefits of what's happening. So, um,

862
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:47,760
okay.

863
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,820
I Dunno, I don't want to tell you what
all the solutions should be for you,

864
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:55,020
but it does sound to me like you need
some male allies as well on this front who

865
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:59,550
can communicate this to your team in ways
that make sense so that you're not the

866
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:04,551
one that is bearing the burden of doing
the right thing and having them feel

867
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:05,670
like that's unfair.

868
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,273
Helpful.

869
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,660
Yeah.
And it was more,

870
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,380
I mean I feel like on our team we have
very good communication and we've talked

871
00:46:12,381 --> 00:46:15,890
through this and yeah, and everybody's
on the same page. But as, as I,

872
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,430
as I look around and as you use that
analogy of kind of giving a hand up to

873
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:20,264
other women,

874
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,800
it is something that everybody kind of
has to think through in terms of is this

875
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:26,720
going to be misperceived as,

876
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:30,210
as preferential treatment or what's
the best way to communicate that?

877
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,990
It isn't really, and I think you did a
good job of covering that. Thank you.

878
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:33,983
Well,
you're welcome.

879
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:39,070
Hi. I wanted to get your thoughts on the
situation. It's not happening in this,

880
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:43,670
this company, another company
to a friend of mine, she uh,

881
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,060
she wanted to switch teams
within the same company,

882
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:47,850
had an offer with another team.
Uh,

883
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:52,270
she was pregnant a few weeks
before her delivery, um,

884
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,560
ducks to the manager, new new
manager, uh, is offered this position.

885
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,980
Um,
she based the devil's advocate thing.

886
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,510
I'm going to be gone few months.
Totally understand that the response,

887
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,100
we still want you here. We value here.
Babies born. It's been two months now.

888
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,600
Now she gets a call saying,

889
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,290
we think this position
is no longer a great fit.

890
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:19,000
We're not sure we would value you as much.
It's pretty reputed company.

891
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:23,920
I can tell you what it is. Very
close friend of mine. I'm angry. Um,

892
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,110
and uh,
the manager talks to her saying,

893
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:30,780
I want to grow the people who work on
clean the team to this manager will,

894
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,800
nothing's changed.
Her pregnancy hasn't changed.

895
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:36,940
The same people continue to be in the
team. Now there's suddenly a question,

896
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,910
the way she's responding to us that
she's paying the mentoring role for this

897
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:44,830
manager and saying, Hey, do what's right
for the team. Um, so business wise,

898
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:47,890
the right thing for the team is not to
wait for a couple of more months for her

899
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:51,640
to return back and which is
what is likely the manager.

900
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:53,680
We're hoping to hear from her.
Um,

901
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,860
and I don't want her to be in a position
where she's no longer going to be as

902
00:47:56,861 --> 00:48:01,570
much valued. Uh, the other
options are he, we'll create one.

903
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,190
We'll create a new opportunity.

904
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:05,650
That's like one third of what
you were supposed to own.

905
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,510
It doesn't make sense from
owning the whole thing.

906
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:11,470
Why would I go back to winning a third?
This is a big corporate corporation here.

907
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,830
I don't want her to fight against this
corporation that her career would be

908
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:18,700
ruined after this. Um, and, and so she,

909
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,480
I mean if you just where the
business had it feels like, yeah,

910
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:26,320
the manager made a stupid mistake probably
to offer her a job when she's going

911
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,630
to disappear in a few months.
But I was happy that he did.

912
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:31,960
Thinking the long term potential
and the longterm value,

913
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,060
what do you typically recommend this,

914
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:37,660
I'm sure it's just one of many instances
that are happening out there today.

915
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,620
It's true. I, you know,

916
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:41,980
I have to say that it's really unfortunate
because I hear stories like this a

917
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:45,190
lot. Pregnancy discrimination
is still very real. Um, and I,

918
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:48,100
and I'm to the point where when I'm
coaching women leaders one on one,

919
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:51,910
we have conversations proactively when
they want to even get pregnant about how

920
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:53,590
they have to prepare their team for that,

921
00:48:53,591 --> 00:48:57,610
how they have to prepare their senior
leadership for it, how to disclose it.

922
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,080
Women I coach through job transitions.

923
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:01,390
Like when do I tell people I'm
pregnant while I'm interviewing?

924
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,560
These are all incredibly
difficult questions that we
still have to think about,

925
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:09,690
which is crazy to me. But all that said
for your friend's situation, you know,

926
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,800
I guess my,

927
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:15,910
the lawyer in me initially says she
should find a good employment lawyer and

928
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,190
actually ask some questions about what,

929
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,120
what the strategy there has
to be from a legal standpoint.

930
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,510
And I know you don't want her to sue,

931
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:25,840
but I will tell you that the employment
lawyers that my company refers our

932
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:30,841
clients to help help people negotiate
situations like this so that they walk the

933
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:32,740
edge of it.

934
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,490
Meaning that like that manager knows that
he's doing something that's not quite

935
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:37,241
right.
You know,

936
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,520
I mean it's obvious or you wouldn't be
having the conversation the way that he's

937
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:43,090
having it. If she is able to come
back with something that says,

938
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,880
you made me this offer when I was
pregnant, you knew that I was pregnant.

939
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:47,380
I understand you now
want to grow the team,

940
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:49,060
but this is the offer that was made to me.

941
00:49:49,061 --> 00:49:53,710
And I still add value here with
the right kind of language.

942
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:57,910
That's that like basically signals
that she knows what her rights are.

943
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,700
That may actually help the
situation dramatically.

944
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,260
And I can give you the number of,

945
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:05,140
I have a very dear friend who
like the past head of the, um,

946
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,320
the employment bar in DC
and knows everybody in the
country who does this kind

947
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:10,900
of work and could find
her someone to talk to.

948
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,080
But that would be an initial strategy
that I would want to approach it from.

949
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,040
And then from the place of thinking
through the business end of it, you know,

950
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:23,530
the idea of what value you add, um,
you know, her value has not changed.

951
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,590
And so to me, I don't see that
there's any business. He, he,

952
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,820
I don't think he made a mistake.

953
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:32,210
I think what's happening now is that
he's second guessing for all the

954
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,760
traditional stereotypical reasons.
Is she going to be available?

955
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:35,900
She's going to have a baby at home.

956
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,600
Is she going to be as dedicated to
the job as she was before? You know,

957
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:39,590
all those sorts of issues.

958
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:44,360
And some of that has to be about
her taking lead to say, I'm here,

959
00:50:44,361 --> 00:50:47,590
I'm available, I'm ready, I want
this, I'm going to do it. Um,

960
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:50,270
nothing's going to fall through
the cracks. I'm committed.

961
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,480
It's sucks that women have to have these
conversations still forward looking,

962
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,090
but they do.
And um,

963
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:00,020
so I think it's gotta be the combination
of her own self advocacy to bring us

964
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:00,651
back to where we were.

965
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:04,580
We've been today and also she
definitely needs aware to just talk to,

966
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,070
and I'm more than happy to give you that
number after the fact if you would like.

967
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,263
Thank you.
Yeah.

968
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,830
That's all the time we have for questions.

969
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:12,260
Thank you very much everybody for coming.
And thank you very much. Elizabeth.

970
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:17,150
Thank you all.
[inaudible].
