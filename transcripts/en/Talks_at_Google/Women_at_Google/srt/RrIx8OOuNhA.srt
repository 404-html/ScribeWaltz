1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,640
Actually unusual for me to talk to
people who barely know me and my work,

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,060
but also they give him five minutes to
summarize my entire career and then have

3
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,810
a conversation. But, um,

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,040
but it's actually more interesting to
talk to people who don't know anything

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,860
about my work. But as you explained, um,

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,120
I am Iranian born but I've lived in the
u s I think now longer than in my own

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,190
country. And, um, the first, uh,

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,340
body of work that I made after being
proven to be a terrible painter was

9
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:43,610
photography. And, um, actually
I'm not a photographer.

10
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:47,540
I don't even own a camera.
I actually hire photographers,

11
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,890
site director photography,
and then I deal with, um,

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,510
the process after. Um, but I'm just going
to, since I want to speak very little,

13
00:00:56,511 --> 00:01:01,260
I have a conversation. The first
serious body of my work, um,

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,730
after 10 years of not working at all at
art was a group of work called woman of

15
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,234
Allah.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,360
And this is basically a
series of photographs that I
did and that sort of really

17
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,880
focused on the Islamic revolution in 1979.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,360
And the role of woman in militancy during
the Islamic revolution and the whole

19
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:27,491
concept of martyrdom and the idea of being
a murderer and what it meant in terms

20
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:33,521
of being in this intersection of love
of God and yet cruelty and violence and

21
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:38,900
death. Um, and in for
most of those photographs,

22
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:42,410
I post myself and I photographed friends.
Um,

23
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,620
and this photography continued
later on after I made many movies,

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,560
uh, into this book, a series
called the book of Kings,

25
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:56,470
which was like over 10 years
later. And it really was about, um,

26
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,110
the 2009 green movement in Iran.

27
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,730
Now it's more than 10 years
is far more. Um, but it again,

28
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:07,820
it captures another pivotal moment,
Iranian history.

29
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:12,170
If the first one was Islamic revolution,
this shows them more modern, uh,

30
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:13,310
Iranian society,

31
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:18,311
but still battling with people were
fighting against tyranny and political

32
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,960
oppression, etc. So this body
of work was about, I don't know,

33
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,020
65 photographs.
I'm going rather quickly.

34
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,770
But what you'll see constantly
is the female body. Uh,

35
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,330
I mean the male and female body being
a significant part of my photographs.

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,880
And obviously this inscription
of texts that were, uh,

37
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,930
poetry by people of Iran. Um, and, um,

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,310
so now I'm going again quickly. This is
another body of work that I did in Egypt,

39
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,910
uh, which was immediately
after the Arab spring.

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,360
And that sort of captured the notion of
patriotism and the euphoria around the

41
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:01,030
revolutions that we experience
all over the Middle East,

42
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,680
yet the terrible aftermath, which was, uh,

43
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,620
a lot of genocide and
death. Um, the next group,

44
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:13,621
big group of photographs I created
in 2015 and 16 was in Azerbaijan,

45
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,560
which previously was a part of my own
country called the home of my eyes.

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,270
And in this series I basically acted
more like a documentary artists.

47
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,140
I photographed the local people and as I,

48
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:33,400
by John being a place of mixed
ethnicities from Turks, Armenians,

49
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,740
Persians and Russians.
Uh,

50
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,050
but all of the people that I photograph
had common hand postures that were very

51
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:44,800
similar to the cushion payments
that are Greg paintings.

52
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,110
And the team being the idea of home or
the absence of home and what meant to

53
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,944
these people.

54
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,550
They're little inscriptions written
all over their bodies that are there

55
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,580
transcripts of the
interviews that I conducted.

56
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,680
I make a lot of videos.

57
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,710
I've been active in media of video since
1998 and this was my breakthrough into

58
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,340
the art world with video,

59
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,930
which won the golden lion
in Venice biannual. Um,

60
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,190
but again, it was literally taking
the aesthetics on my photographs,

61
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:23,191
but having it move and that having music
and choreography and a story that had a

62
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:29,110
beginning, middle and the end. This
is another piece fervor, which again,

63
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,200
it became a little bit more narrative,
but as you can see,

64
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:36,890
they're highly stylized
and very fictionalize.

65
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,760
And, um, these were all shot in Morocco.

66
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:44,761
So by now I began to shoot videos and
films outside of us must be in Morocco and

67
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,340
Egypt and Turkey in different places.

68
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:52,790
So these are examples
that said, okay. Um, and,

69
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:57,791
and so the next thing I wanted to share
with you is that since 2000 known yeah,

70
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,630
since 2002 I've been very
busy making feature films.

71
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,490
I made a film called women without men
that was based on a magic realist novel

72
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,420
that won in the Silver Lion
Award in Venice Film Festival.

73
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,010
That took six years.

74
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,850
And I just completed this new film
looking for Omakase assume that, uh,

75
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,640
we will show some clips. Um, but that
was based on Egyptian singer in Egypt.

76
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,240
And I spent 12 years
making two feature films

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,540
and I did an opera. So that said,
we go right to the conversation

78
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,430
being an Iranian female living in New
York. This informs a lot of your work.

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,890
You lived in exile basically
in the United States. Can,

80
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,350
can you talk about what it was like to
have that happen and what your return to

81
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,490
Iran was like given that that was sort of
the starting point of all of your work?

82
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,000
Well at the time, and
I grew up, there was a,

83
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,190
a lot of Iranian families were sending
their children abroad to study because

84
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,680
lack of, um, you know, situations
at colleges, universities.

85
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,390
And so the,
we were all sent out the,

86
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,760
we didn't predict the revolution.
And at that time,

87
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:10,610
my father sent me and
my sisters and brothers,

88
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,500
they all went back and I happened to be
in the u s when the revolution happened.

89
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,840
And, um, so unfortunately at
that time I was very young.

90
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,020
I came when I was 17 and
the Russian happened. Um,

91
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,040
I was in college actually.
I was at UC Berkeley.

92
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,710
And immediately after the revolution,

93
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,390
they took over the American embassy
in Iran. The hostages were taken.

94
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:39,800
So there was an incredibly strong
anti American sentiment. Um,

95
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:44,240
so I found myself alone in a country
without financial help and without the,

96
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,070
and the loving family
around me. Um, but also, um,

97
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,880
against the wall politically as
there was a strong reaction. Um,

98
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:56,540
so I didn't see them, not for
the 20 years, but 11 years.

99
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:01,520
I didn't go back. And, um, and
eventually when I went back,

100
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,550
I started to make art and then the,
the country,

101
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,710
the government found my work problematic.

102
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,940
And then since 1996,
I have not been back.

103
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,770
Wow. And I think that sort of leads us in
when you said the government found your

104
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:17,090
work problematic.

105
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,070
You're work is highly political and
you often talk about having a social

106
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:23,060
responsibility.

107
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,230
So I was wondering if you can talk
about the idea of being the voice of a

108
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,570
country that you haven't lived
in in a very long time. You know,

109
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,280
you don't have the possibility,
uh,

110
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,020
to distance yourself from the
political reality. And is,

111
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,540
is that the political consciousness
is something that is not a choice.

112
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,590
And I think that's difficult for Americans
to understand that if your everyday

113
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,300
life is defined by a this and that,
for example, this reason breakdown,

114
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,590
you know, again, the, the exit
of America from the nuclear deal,

115
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,380
it's a huge issue for my family in Iran,

116
00:07:57,381 --> 00:08:01,820
for me and the future of us
as immigrants. And so, um,

117
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,090
so I think the work is a manifestation
is kind of artistic reflection on the

118
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:12,290
political reality, but it's
not, it's not a propaganda.

119
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:17,291
It is rather a kind of a fictional work
that somehow tries to shed light on the

120
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,240
complexity of the situation.

121
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:24,800
And so I don't see myself as the voice
of the country or, but the fact that,

122
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,370
um, my work has, um,

123
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,640
properties in the way that it communicates
about the people and to the people.

124
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:36,050
If you're on well, you've
made, you've made photographs,

125
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:39,260
you've made short films,
you've made feature length films.

126
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,490
Can you talk about how your process
changes between each medium?

127
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,670
Well, it's a, I think that, uh,
this kind of nomadic behaviors,

128
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,710
a little bit of my personality because
I'm extremely restless and nervous.

129
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,440
Yeah. And all of his living
in a very nomadic lifestyle.

130
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:01,460
And I'm never anywhere for very long.
People like me.

131
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:04,520
And I think a lot of us are like that.
And,

132
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:09,150
and that we turned to learn very
quickly a new places, new languages,

133
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:12,930
new food, new environment. It's
just a way of life. So it's not,

134
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,440
we're not really fixed at any place,
any situation.

135
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,210
And so somehow I feel like this lifestyle
has also been my relationship to the

136
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:24,780
mediums that I'm not really
faithful to anything.

137
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm not really good at anything and I
haven't been really thinking you're good

138
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:33,360
at. I'm not educated in it, but I,
I spent a lot of times, like I said,

139
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:34,980
I spent six years making a film.

140
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,580
So I spend a lot of time
studying whatever I'm doing,

141
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,900
but I give myself the license
to feel adventurous and uh, and,

142
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,100
and also to struggle and
beyond that edge because I,

143
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,530
she like by embracing a new medium,

144
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:54,531
you really inventing yourself and that's
often keeping yourself excited as a,

145
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,170
as an artist, as a human being,
that even as you get old,

146
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:00,660
you feel young and you fail.

147
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,210
And I think that's been nice.

148
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,310
My nature as a person and I think in
a way that informs the way I work.

149
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
What's the process?
Over six years of making,

150
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:18,540
I do other things as well because I
have source of survivors and artist.

151
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,410
I do exhibitions. Um, the process
of the film has been, first of all,

152
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:25,980
it's a script writing and then
finding the right producers,

153
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,450
then finding the money,

154
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,130
location scouting and actually casting,

155
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,830
etc. And,
uh,

156
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,160
I think the two films have been the
most painful experience I've ever had.

157
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,250
Worst thing giving birth to a child,

158
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,120
but the point is that at the end of it,

159
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:49,080
I feel like it's a great
accomplishment in some ways.

160
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:54,081
I think every frame of the film becomes
a photograph and every few minutes

161
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,430
becomes a video installation.

162
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,230
And that also you're able to communicate
to a larger audience that are not just

163
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:01,681
gallery,

164
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:06,681
museum goers and you're really thinking
about the masses and the general public.

165
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,850
And I think that gives
me a great pleasure.

166
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,790
Wow. Um, so I think that's a
good point for us to turn to.

167
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,650
Looking for a home called Tim,
which is your most recent film project,

168
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:21,760
one of these projects that has
taken a very long time to complete,

169
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,410
it's a movie within a movie.

170
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,650
It's about a Persian directors attempts
to film the life and legacy of the

171
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:32,490
Egyptian singer called Tomb.
Um,

172
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:37,530
can you give us a little bit of the
backstory about how you discovered her,

173
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,450
why she was so fascinating to you?

174
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,131
But first of all,

175
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:45,550
I'd have to say that even though my
work looks very sociopolitical on the

176
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:49,120
surface, it, there's always something
they personal about the work.

177
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:53,110
It's always been about my experience,
my perspective, not my experience,

178
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,130
the way I viewed things. That
way I find my questions. And,

179
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:01,620
and so it has this very
personal, um, um, approach, uh,

180
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,980
with looking for Onco zoom.
Zoom is the biggest,

181
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,700
the most important artists of the 20th
century in the middle is without a doubt.

182
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,630
He happened to be a woman, happened to
be gay, happened to be non traditional.

183
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,520
She never got married, she never had
children. And yet she's loved by men,

184
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:22,180
by women. The Sunday news is she
is secular and ours, you know,

185
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,760
so Cuellar and from Israel
to Saudi Arabia to Iran to,

186
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,430
it's an amazing phenomena.

187
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,200
And so this film is about an
Iranian woman artist living in Aza,

188
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,210
uh, questioning the, the, the success
of the iconic artists from them,

189
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,230
that ease and really facing the
question of how can be as women become

190
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:47,150
successful,
uh,

191
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,970
and does this mean that we have to
sacrifice personal lives and, uh,

192
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,790
issues that are deeply traditional
expectations from a woman.

193
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,590
And so this woman and myself,

194
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,440
I've had a child and single mother.

195
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:04,970
And so how do you navigate between,
you know,

196
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,260
romantic life and traditional
role as mothers, but yet, uh,

197
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,450
pursue your passion and pursued
your career and be successful.

198
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:18,060
So it's really a question of a smaller
artist to an iconic artists. And,

199
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,300
and of course the script
was impossible and you know,

200
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,150
so if you call in and
out of a period film too,

201
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,980
so the film behind that and a highly
controversial because she's the biggest

202
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,440
artists of Egypt.
Um,

203
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,300
so it's been showing in the Arab
world and interesting reactions.

204
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,260
That's actually one of the things we
wanted to ask you about is how was it

205
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:46,030
perceived in Egypt and in Iran?
Well, the Iranians are upset.

206
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,900
They said,
what can you find an iconic woman singer?

207
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,280
Why do you have to go to Egypt?

208
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,170
Because there's no Iranian artists
as ever reached that popularity. Um,

209
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,180
and I needed a break from Iran. Um, but I
think with the Egyptians, um, it's been,

210
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,400
uh, really at the beginning they
were like, what you, I mean,

211
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:11,130
not even Egyptians are there to make a
film about her because she's too sacred

212
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,080
and untouchable. And
some people say, in fact,

213
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,060
maybe this was the best
way to approach it.

214
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:20,680
I think it film inside of a film because
we were very honest about this, that,

215
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,520
you know, this isn't a time, this
is the vision of Iranian artists.

216
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:27,550
This is not a documentary.
This is not a biopic.

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,680
This is not exactly the story,

218
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:33,470
but this is the way this woman is
struggling to tell the story. Um,

219
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,140
and I went with the film to
Tunisia, it in Egypt, in Lebanon.

220
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,840
It's opening in Morocco and you know,
of course in a small scale and um, but,

221
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,440
but it's interesting that the film is
finding its audience and I think it is not

222
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,780
ever a film that would have
a huge audience and he's
not targeting a commercial

223
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,680
audience. But I think it's
something that would last,

224
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,580
it would have a life a
longer because it's a really,

225
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:04,940
an artistic project is not meant to be,
you know,

226
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,110
anything that you'll see and you know,
Union Square,

227
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,100
what do you call them? The
movie theater. Regal cinema.

228
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,430
If he's lucky somewhere you
didn't take it to Toronto though.

229
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,070
And they were opening more
mouth for a week in July 26. Uh,

230
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:26,390
and uh, it will have a week
run, which I'm very happy about.

231
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,490
So go see it.
Um,

232
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,500
what was it like to sort of take it to
the Toronto Film Festival? What was, um,

233
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,810
what's it like?
You've done a lot of film festivals,

234
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,330
you've taken things on the circuit.
How does that,

235
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,770
this one made me very nervous because,
uh,

236
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,670
first of the second term is
very difficult as so, uh,

237
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,570
it was an Arab story.
And I'm not Arab.

238
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,130
So a lot of the audience often are
Arab and I know you're like, Oh God,

239
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,500
they're going to like throw tomatoes
at me. Um, and also that is,

240
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,410
it's a very artistic film,
so you always have a mix.

241
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,870
It's always sold out.

242
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,590
The screenings are full and because
people love her and everything, but,

243
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,890
and there's always a great mix
of receptions and people who, uh,

244
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,490
critics who don't like it,
who like it,

245
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,350
I have absolutely don't relate to it,
to those who appreciate it.

246
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:20,120
So like everything I've done,

247
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,480
it's never ever like praise
completely or destroyed,

248
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,800
but I'm still going on. Um, so it's a mix,

249
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:30,710
but I think slowly it's
finding its audience.

250
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,370
And in terms of the story and the main
character in the film seems to have some

251
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:41,150
reflection of you in terms of,
um, it's a female director.

252
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:45,890
She encounters, um, some
pushback from being a female,

253
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,620
um,
from being Persian.

254
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,480
Is this personal?
It's about my experience.

255
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,520
It's about, um, you know,

256
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:59,720
my own struggles to make this
film my own shortcomings.

257
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,800
Even the script we wrote is problematic.
It's not a perfect script.

258
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:05,990
And this woman also
struggles with the script.

259
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,670
It was just impossible to know how to
go under the skin of this incredible,

260
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,880
incredible woman that was a myth. You
know, it was not even a human. And she,

261
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,080
she actually wanted to remain as an image.
So what I asked for,

262
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:27,081
it was an impossible task to devour
and demystify a myth that it was just

263
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:32,420
impossible. So, so in this film I tried
to be really honest about, you know,

264
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,340
I chose a very difficult subject
and I didn't completely succeed and,

265
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,080
but, but, but what did I learn about
this from her? And what was the angle?

266
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:44,330
What was the obsession about?

267
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,650
And I think then when you get
the intimate about the process,

268
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,730
there's honesty about the
film that, you know, then if,

269
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,640
if you are that kind of person,
you understand this film,

270
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:00,330
by no means try to be pretentious
or trying to compare me with her,

271
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,660
but really showing the artistic practice
involving a lot of struggles and

272
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,080
failures of an artist,
but also doubts.

273
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,800
And I think that's something that
we don't give credit to the artist,

274
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,060
but the process,

275
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,240
it's often painful and it involves
taking the risk and that doesn't always

276
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:25,190
succeed in a positive way. But
that is part of the process. And I,

277
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:29,100
that's all I tried to show and
even the film has at the final,

278
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,370
it's not a perfect film and
I'm the first one to say it,

279
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,790
but I think that's what it was all about,
you know?

280
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,890
And what do you think is so imperfect
about it? The script I think, um,

281
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,330
because you know, again, um,

282
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,190
the way that we try to navigate between
different periods and the story of the

283
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:54,441
Iranian woman versus the story of
this iconic artists and how to balance

284
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:58,650
everything between the political
reality when she lived her own political

285
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:02,470
reality as a woman in [inaudible],
there's a lot of information there is,

286
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,900
there is a lot of metaphorical
meanings that we wanted to,

287
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,980
to weave into the story that about woman,

288
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:16,010
about being artists that are living within
political reality that affects their

289
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:21,040
work and their success and failures.
And me as an exotic artist,

290
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,110
she is the one who,

291
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,610
who became very loyal to the political
leaders in order to stay successful.

292
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,380
So there was just so much intentions
that we tried to build into the narrative

293
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,380
that maybe just wasn't
perfect, you know? Um, and,

294
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:37,560
and I think that's okay.

295
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,910
It's totally okay.

296
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:43,650
And I think one of the things that's
interesting is obviously this fits into

297
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:47,040
your larger practice in
terms of um, uh, you know,

298
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,080
in Islamic female protagonist,
but you,

299
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,580
you often talking about that you're more
interested in form then you are in the

300
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:54,414
content.

301
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,080
And so I was wondering if you can talk
a little bit about how making narrative

302
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:01,620
films sort of fits into your
larger practice of photography,

303
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,000
of sort of short
experimental film. Um, and,

304
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,830
and if you think you
were successful there,

305
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,910
and I'm glad you said that because they
often people just focus on the scene

306
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,020
because I'm Iranian,

307
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,190
but in fact I think I consider
myself among some of the western,

308
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,250
also artists who are beginning to break
through the way from the museum and

309
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:28,750
Gallery walls and tried to experiment
with what it's like for visual artists to

310
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:32,050
tell the story, what kind
of form would it take, uh,

311
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
without mimicking conventional cinema,

312
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,720
but also not making things that
are completely incomprehensible.

313
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,440
I also directed opera last read,
Salzburg Festival,

314
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,290
Ada and I sort of go and,

315
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,320
and Ricardo Muti the conductor and
what is the nature of ambitiousness

316
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,080
experimentation. But I think that is
happening more and more where, um,

317
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,940
both at film festivals,
the music festivals,

318
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:02,941
and are really welcoming artists coming
from other mediums to experimenting with

319
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:10,270
this. And, and I have to say that,
um, I, you know, I do photography,

320
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,890
I do video installations, I do film,
I'm making a new song, uh, and,

321
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:17,560
and I, you know, still do performing arts.

322
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,750
And not because I'm good at all of these
things because I enjoy the process and

323
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:26,190
I think it's good to
give yourself, um, the,

324
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,630
the goal of being able not to stay
stagnated within one form of work.

325
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,330
I could have stayed with those pictures,

326
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,250
writing calligraphy for
the rest of my life,

327
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:41,050
make a bundle of money and make
zero money making some, in fact,

328
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,050
I put everything I have from
the photography into the film.

329
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,120
So it's a kind of stupid because
there's money never paid a place, uh,

330
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:53,440
in its equation. And, and so I
think that's a decision I made.

331
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,610
It's a true labor.
I think it is an eye.

332
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,860
I stand behind it and I
will never be very rich.

333
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,010
You mentioned the Ahhbra,

334
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,700
something that you said that I really
thought was interesting was you said

335
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:08,820
sometimes the boundaries between
Ada and myself are blurred.

336
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,393
MMM.

337
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,880
What do you mean by that?
What's your relationship to Aida?

338
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,210
I either is the story of its European
businesses in exile in Egypt.

339
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,000
And the director of the music festival,
uh,

340
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:26,730
invited me because I either
just historically has been
highly problematic, uh,

341
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,820
opera for,

342
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,940
for a lot of middle easterners because
it's the most cliche and orientalist I

343
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,410
opera. And that sort of,
um, badly stereotypes.

344
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,680
The Middle Eastern, even in the
ancient times, each have an inner tube.

345
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,510
Ian's make them into this very
barbaric, um, you know, and,

346
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,010
and then the westerners are the glory
of know it's written by an Italian

347
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,890
composer Verde. And so he found it very
interesting that if I could take this,

348
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,300
which was a huge task, um, Eh,

349
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,410
this narrative and sort of maybe a new
reinterpretation of it that somehow kept

350
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,990
the grandiose, uh, of
the classical Aida and,

351
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,670
and didn't compromise the value of it,
um,

352
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,320
but yet was able to address
the kind of cliche and,

353
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,290
and sort of it didn't have the elephants
and the horses and the people painted

354
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,124
black walking.

355
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,610
So I took three years and I had to
do it is also very controversial,

356
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,840
is never done in this way. Um, but um,

357
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,870
it was completely successful in the
way that was really highly attended,

358
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,390
but it was also very controversial.

359
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,010
That sounds like a huge undertaking as
are a lot of your films now that you're

360
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:46,820
doing,
you're doing really elaborate projects.

361
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,690
And I want to turn back a little bit to,
to your work with film,

362
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,260
one of the films or short films that
you started with with turbulent,

363
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,160
you went to women without men
that you mentioned before.

364
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,520
What sort of happening on your
path with film right now and, um,

365
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,580
they have this undercurrent or at
least turbulent does about music. Um,

366
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,990
when you talk about the power of music,

367
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,630
so you're a visual artist
who is using music. Um,

368
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,670
yeah,
I mean I think again,

369
00:24:14,671 --> 00:24:18,450
because so much of my works about the
sociopolitical religious realities,

370
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,990
music brings with it, its something
they, a gospel, very emotional,

371
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:24,240
something that doesn't need translation.
Uh,

372
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,380
I think that helps in a way
neutralized someone saying, Eh,

373
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,980
that political content of my work.
Um,

374
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,960
and because I think my work is as
much about existential universal,

375
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:41,550
timeless and emotional issues as it is
about today's realities and political

376
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:46,130
realities. And I just want to take
this point and just mentioned that, uh,

377
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,140
another reason that I go toward very
stylized of surrealistic narrative like

378
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,280
woman would happen then was based
on a magic realist novel. And, and,

379
00:24:56,281 --> 00:25:01,281
and the reason I feel so comfortable
with dreams and surrealism is because it

380
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,140
allows you to make reference to reality,

381
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,090
but yet also staying in another place
that sort of gives you some space from

382
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,250
that.
And the current film that I'm working,

383
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,470
I think it's the first time
I really talk about it,

384
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:17,030
it's called Dreamland and it's
really in a summarized way,

385
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:21,510
is about this surrealistic novel
that would be shot in the u s uh,

386
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,560
about Iranian people
spying on Americans dreams.

387
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,640
Um, and, and, and his episode,
there's a political satire,

388
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,740
but it really is a,

389
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,660
is institution is Kinda Evanion colony
that is the future of Trump doing with

390
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,980
Iranian people. I would say refugee
camp full of Iranian people,

391
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,350
but sort of oddly,

392
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:48,351
and ironically there is an institution
within this colony that it's actually a

393
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:51,480
room for interpretation of
American people's dreams.

394
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:56,400
And there's a woman who every day goes
on the highway to a small little American

395
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:59,790
town and her job is secretly,

396
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,410
she goes as a census worker,

397
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,300
the door to door to people's homes asking
information at the end she says, I'm,

398
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:11,160
what is your last dream? People say
dreams that we have to uh, Jennifer, yes,

399
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:15,030
it's part of the survey from Washington.
So she was a spy,

400
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,740
but she carries their photographs and
their dreams back to that call and so they

401
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:21,840
can interpret the dream.
So,

402
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,320
so my idea again of creating a
narrative that there is symbolically and

403
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,740
absolutely absurd and fat tire go away.

404
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,810
It's sort of critiques this, um,
tension between two countries.

405
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:41,730
The superpower would dominate the
world, uh, and the fanaticism,

406
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,300
right?

407
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,300
That exists in the upsert
Iranian government and that
the humanity in between

408
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:51,730
the two parts and, and,
and, you know, so there's a,

409
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,670
this is the story we're doing and
I'm hoping we can shoot it 2019.

410
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,950
Wow. Well, we look at

411
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,720
forward to seeing that and um,

412
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,340
there are so many dichotomies in
your work including this sort of, um,

413
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,920
play with reality versus
sort of these more magical,

414
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,740
fantastical, um, sort of aesthetics
that you even bring into Miquel tomb.

415
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:18,270
And there is a sort of abuse
attention between the beauty and, um,

416
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,830
and also, you know, the undercurrent
of what you're, you're having to say.

417
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,190
I think that's, you put your finger
on absolutely the right thing.

418
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,550
Every single thing I've ever done
is about the notion of opposites,

419
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,490
the paradoxical men or men,
east,

420
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:38,440
West mysticism and
violence and, um, you know,

421
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:41,730
women without men was the orchard
and the city of [inaudible].

422
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,180
I think that's the only way I
can think in general about the,

423
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:51,010
the good and evil and all of that.
And so I never see anything in one way

424
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,290
you were named artist of the decade
by Huffington post at one point.

425
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,990
It's a pretty,
it's a big deal.

426
00:27:56,991 --> 00:28:00,860
And you've received a lot of awards and
you've worked on so many things. And uh,

427
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,620
I'm just curious sort of at this point,
you know,

428
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:07,670
what accomplishments are you most
proud of? Um, and what do you look,

429
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,660
he's interesting. Anytime somebody says
nice thing about me, I said I was, I,

430
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:16,770
I always considered myself,
um, struggling artists.

431
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,210
I think it's a good thing
maybe. And I, I'm, I,

432
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,240
I know I seen that I do is so hard
to accomplish and we work so hard,

433
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,130
like I work seven days a week, um, and,

434
00:28:28,131 --> 00:28:32,940
and so I never see myself as a success
story and it always blows my mind when

435
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:34,350
people say flattering things.

436
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,060
I even criticize my work more than
necessary because, not to be humble,

437
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:42,960
but I just see it that the way
that it deserves criticism, so,

438
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,050
and they flourish when
people say Nice things.

439
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,540
Well,
there are a lot of Nice things to say.

440
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:53,541
I think we should at this point roll
the clip and then we can open it up to Q

441
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:55,014
and.
A.

442
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,400
So I'm saying I'm from Egypt.

443
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,400
And growing up you always hear about
her sexual orientation as a rumor,

444
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,350
not like a confirmed fact.

445
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,170
So I was wondering why do you have to
say about that and whether the movie

446
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:05,640
addresses the issue at all or no?

447
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,430
Yeah, I mean, uh, I'm really glad
you brought that up because, um,

448
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,220
what option you would speak to her
has a different explanation or,

449
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,980
or impression and, and, and
relationship to Amoco. Some.

450
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,560
So what I found also about
her sexual orientation,

451
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,000
everyone says something different.

452
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,200
Some people say she absolutely
was in love with so and so and,

453
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,420
but she did eventually marry her doctor
who, you know, at the end when she died,

454
00:29:35,421 --> 00:29:39,610
she was married to him, uh,
and she adopted a son. Um,

455
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,320
but in Riyadh and many say that she
was absolutely working with men,

456
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:47,470
but they love with woman. And she had, um,

457
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,740
at the beginning we did a
lot of research about that.

458
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:55,360
And indeed there was a lot
of images and videos. But,

459
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,400
um, of her really the time that
she laughed a lot and seem,

460
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,770
cause when she was performing,
she was always very rigid.

461
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,740
The time that she was seeing most
relaxed was around woman. You know, uh,

462
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,090
she seems like she
really felt comfortable.

463
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:13,860
Of course it happens for a lot of
women just even if she not get, um,

464
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,170
but I think everything
hinted at the fact that, um,

465
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,220
for her conservative environment that
she lived there was absolutely out of the

466
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:24,310
question that she could,
um, be open about it. But,

467
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,240
but also the Egyptian theater really,
you know,

468
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,310
wanted to devour her
personal life in that way.

469
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,370
Like the way we do with celebrities
here, which I really respected. Um,

470
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,680
some people I talked to and say
it didn't matter to us. You know,

471
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,250
some people said, oh no, she was not
there. Some people said, yeah, she was.

472
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,550
But in general, I find that the
status that she reached, um,

473
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,410
it's, you know, like
wildly different, like in,

474
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,000
you have Michael Jackson here and made
his sexuality like the biggest, you know,

475
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:58,480
American icon as a pop culture,
pop artists.

476
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,480
But you understand that he really was
devoured in the way for his celebrity

477
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:08,870
status. But the, the customer, they
just loved her music, you know, and,

478
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,360
and it didn't matter if she was a woman
or a man or, you know, gay or not.

479
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:17,590
And that's what I admired about her
and her relationship to her audience,

480
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,900
that they didn't destroy her like they,
the way we do, you know, Amy Winehouse,

481
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,640
Whitney Houston, it did pay off,
uh, Billie holiday. Uh, you know,

482
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:32,290
every great artists that we build up, we,
we bring down because we just, you know,

483
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:37,180
oh, she was very freaky. But in
reality, you know, like I said,

484
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:42,181
I found that she has this very secret
place that you just cannot take away from

485
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:45,850
her. And, and people were really the,

486
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,930
the most religious conservative community
just left her alone because they loved

487
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:51,784
her.
You know,

488
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:57,450
and I think that's so rare and it honestly
is something I took a lot of pride

489
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,940
that we in the Middle East have an artist
in that level of popularity where 4

490
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,583
million people went.

491
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,300
It was one of the largest funerals ever
in the history of Egypt after Nasir,

492
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:13,240
I think, um, in the America, in the West,

493
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:18,100
you have never ever seen this many
people go for, even for Michael Jackson.

494
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:22,650
So if she, artists just never
that popular and that in,

495
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:27,040
in a way that she, you know, it didn't
matter her sexuality as you, so much

496
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,400
long answers.

497
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,020
Any other projects you would like to
tell us about that are forthcoming beyond

498
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:38,170
the movie? That we'll have to wait
a couple of years to see that. Well,

499
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,920
the movie were, as I had
an art component, right.

500
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:45,250
I'm working on an exhibition in relation
to that, but it will be confirmed soon.

501
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,600
So I would be both for
New York and Los Angeles,

502
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:52,601
so hopefully it will be all in
2019 and so all we look like,

503
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,320
thank you for spending your
lunchtime instead of eating. Yeah.
