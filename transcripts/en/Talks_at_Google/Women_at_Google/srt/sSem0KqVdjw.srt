1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,830
I ladies and gentlemen, Garfunkel
ourself doing Tom am I saying here?

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,660
That was clearly not from the special
that was from last season of another

3
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:15,920
period. If you haven't seen it, it takes
place in 1902. It's like a reality show.

4
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:20,810
70 need to know too. And that's all real
stuff. It's based on all real stuff.

5
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:24,680
That finger contraption is real from
the turn of the century. It's, yeah,

6
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:27,410
those are all afraid techniques
except for the bicycle. We're like,

7
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:32,330
we have to add something to it. Yes, we
had to. Yes. And so we have the bike.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,740
Oh Ricky, you are really a renaissance
woman. You are a actress, a comedian,

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,770
a musician. You created another period.
You were right or another period.

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,380
The show runner. Now we have new special
uh, coming this week. It was great. Yeah.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,660
Well thank you for making time
and coming here to Google.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,270
I like tried to tell my parents
what I do all day. I'm just like,

13
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:53,610
I don't know everything. I don't
know. Just everything in there like,

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,400
well what do you like? It's always
different. It's always, no, no, no.

15
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,330
I got to go and yeah, that's basically
their understanding of my job.

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,580
And you were here today without your
cohort. You were here without oats today

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,160
in La Doing Conan today.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,030
Oh, I know. Here we are.

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,050
You drew the short Straw, I'm
sure. Um, so Garfield's one notes.

20
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,420
Let's just start with what people
need to know. Why Garfunkel?

21
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,630
Well,

22
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,630
I was at a a hall and Oates concert
at the Hollywood bowl and I really bad

23
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,400
seats. I was, it was
like I was waitressing,

24
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:32,780
I was in the back and so basically you
can only watch it on the monitors and the

25
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:36,830
camera had a close up of Darryl that he
kind of had like a wind machine kind of

26
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,830
situation. It was the close of Daryl and
then it was like, oh, it's in the band.

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,580
So oats was only in the wide shot
or like the moving right past him.

28
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:46,880
And there was no two shot.
It was just Daryl and then everyone else.

29
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:49,550
And for some reason that just made me
laugh and I was like, who set that up?

30
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,150
Like how does it feel to be oats? And
then, yeah, we kind of went from there,

31
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,320
but we didn't realize about two years
ago someone sent us this like Simpsons

32
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:01,260
thing where they had almost
the same joke. You're like, ah,

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,270
they have something called like it was
like Nash Oats and Garfunkel or something,

34
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,420
but it was close enough where
we were like, well okay.

35
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,840
Oh well I mean too late now.
That's her name.

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,650
So, uh, of course, uh, Kate is
oats. You were Garfunkel? Yes.

37
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,970
How did you guys get together?

38
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,070
We were both auditioning for commercials
and neither of us were working cause it

39
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:26,310
was all kind of like maxim girls, like
that Doritos girl, if you guys remember.

40
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,690
It was all like that kind of look.

41
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,170
And then all of a sudden they just
started casting girls with big eyes.

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,380
And so she and I just got called
back for everything. I've nowhere,

43
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:35,250
like I got dropped by,

44
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:37,560
I like I just shouldn't for like a couple
of years got dropped by my commercial

45
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,870
agent, never booked anything.
And then out of nowhere,

46
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,200
like Kate and I were just in all the
commercials were like, what is happening?

47
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:44,070
It didn't last that long,

48
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:47,310
but we just kept seeing each other
at callbacks and then she came up and

49
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,300
introduced me, introduce yourself to
me at UCB and then went from there.

50
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,190
And how did the uh, have the musician,
uh, kind of blind get into it? How did it

51
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,390
became like these weird soulmate friends,
I don't even know how to explain it.

52
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,750
Like Kate's boyfriend who was with
her when we met, like on the way home,

53
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,490
he was like,
you like her more than you like me.

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,500
And Kate says she remembers
going like, yeah. So yeah.

55
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,980
And then we found out that we both
wrote comedy songs on our own,

56
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,160
nice to play them in college and Kate
was kind of playing these comedy songs

57
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,780
around town and I would play at parties,

58
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:23,740
like we'd been doing it on our own in an
unofficial capacity for like 10 years.

59
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,260
And so then we're just like,
oh, let's just do this together.

60
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,790
When was your first
Gig together? Um, Gosh,

61
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,390
when I think it's been like eight years
maybe. It's been a long time. Yeah,

62
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,111
I think,
yeah,

63
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:39,220
I think it was 2008 is we made this short
that like Kate was my imaginary friend

64
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:43,660
and it was a musical and we wrote the
songs for it and just made it. Yeah.

65
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,220
Very cool. And kind of since then, yeah.

66
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,890
Uh, what is your song process like? I know
the old creative process question, but

67
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,770
basically it's evolved because we've
kind of like sound out like our,

68
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,450
what we're good at and how to do it.

69
00:03:56,451 --> 00:04:00,070
So basically we'll have a topic and
then we just brainstorm on it for ever.

70
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:02,090
And this is only the songs that make it,
like the songs that don't,

71
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,340
I don't even know, they just like
we just throw them in the garbage,

72
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,380
but basically we brainstorm forever.

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,380
Well it's like a 20 page document of
anything we've ever thought about this

74
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:10,190
topic.

75
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,570
And then she gives it to me and I sort
of like narrow it down and come up with a

76
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,900
title. And then after I had the title,
I go and do a first pass of the lyrics,

77
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,210
give it to Kate,
she does a first pass at the melody.

78
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,960
And then we get together and sort
of, you know, make it together.

79
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,950
But she just has these like catchy
melodies that are always in her head. So

80
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,920
what did you guys ever go on?

81
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:33,970
Like a specific bitch of like you want
to like hit a joke and then a song comes

82
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:35,200
around that or

83
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,880
sometimes we'll get a title if we,
but like if you cause this,

84
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,920
there's not enough to sustain a joke for
like three minutes and we don't do it.

85
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,690
Cause like some things
are good as one line,

86
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:47,780
but then like what do you say after that?
You know,

87
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:49,130
it's just like I've got nothing left.

88
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:52,280
So a lot of most things ended up
in the garbage because they don't,

89
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,710
we can't like blow them
out to a whole song.

90
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,710
Now this leads to the very first
special trying to be special. Yes.

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,870
And of course a spoiler alert. I have
seen it. So I'll try and keep it, uh,

92
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,960
keep it close. But uh, the specialist
about trying to make a special,

93
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,640
yes, it is. It's very meta.

94
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,850
It's basically Kate and I are like in a
hotel room and we had this gig that you

95
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:18,120
think went really badly and we're just
like, this sucks. That is, we're so tired.

96
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:20,390
We're on the, and I'm like, do you
think we should do something different?

97
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,700
She's like, I don't know. And I'm
like, well, we're, we're 36 years old.

98
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:28,650
We have no husbands,
no real jobs, no kids.

99
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,130
Like our lives are amazing.
And she's like, yeah, totally.

100
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,770
Like the only Nigga can make it better as
a comedy special. And so we're like, oh,

101
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:37,080
we don't have money to
make a comedy special.

102
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:41,970
So we do a fundraiser concert in order
to make money to be able to put it on the

103
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:46,020
special. So, and then you see, you
see the fundraiser concert. So yeah.

104
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,540
And this, uh, this comes out this
coming week on Cinco de Mayo, May 5th.

105
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,440
It's a available on Vimeo. Yeah.
So going the digital route.

106
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,780
Yeah. We decided to do something
different because the meal,

107
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:00,920
it's like they have the best player.
Like they just do like businesses use it,

108
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:01,760
they're the best player.

109
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,760
And you can just download it and have
it on your computer forever. I'm like,

110
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,550
that's just, I don't know. It seemed
like, and they don't give notes,

111
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,270
they have full your full 100%
creative control. So we were like,

112
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,410
that kind of feels the same
budget as everyone else.

113
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,170
Kind of like oh no notes and yeah,
let's do that.

114
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,450
So that's what we decided to go with.

115
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,820
Um,

116
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,360
one thing in the special that we were
talking about prior is just the quirkiness

117
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,400
of your guys' characters and it makes
everything seemed so just spur of the

118
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:31,100
moment.

119
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,450
Right. And some of it is, some
of it is like a lot we don't,

120
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,410
when we go on tour,

121
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,810
we don't know what we're going to talk
about when we walk out, unless we like,

122
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,750
unless something really weird happened
right before then we're like, okay,

123
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:42,321
we're going to talk about that.

124
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:46,490
But usually we just walk out and like
begin and sometimes it goes better than

125
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,324
other times.

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,660
You actually said that
you and Kay had s uh,

127
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,520
she stuff like UCB Improv background?

128
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,970
No, we were there seeing a
friend's show, what we were seeing,

129
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,090
a dead Benson show and yeah,
we were both friends with him.

130
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:05,110
I made friends with him on Friendster.
That's real as real.

131
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,960
He saw some play that I was in. It was
like, your plate is funny. And I was like,

132
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,190
I just saw you do comedy.

133
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:11,230
And then we were like loose
acquaintances and he's like,

134
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,270
well come to my next show.
That's where I met Kate.

135
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,650
It's actually funny. I was first exposed
to you guys from Doug Benson's podcast.

136
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,130
Really? He's been so nice to us since
day one. He always has us on there.

137
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:24,960
He's just like been a good friend to
us. Fair enough. Yeah. He opened first,

138
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,950
last time we were in la just to be nice,
like didn't want any money.

139
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:30,520
He just like opened for us.
It was, yeah, it was cool.

140
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,920
All right, so just shifting over since
we saw the another period clip to start.

141
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,750
Um, so another period has
created and written by you
and Natasha Gara and you did

142
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,560
say it's a,
it's like a reality show based in 1902.

143
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,660
Yeah. We save. It's
like, it's like a family,

144
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:48,860
like the Kardashians moved into Downton
Abbey. So this is it set in America.

145
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,150
It's a Newport,
Rhode Island.

146
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,690
These people are not class
either new money and they just,

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,250
they have unlimited money but it's brand
new and our dad has a magnate magnate.

148
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,650
He owns all the badness
in the world I guess.

149
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,730
And then we just are like pieces of
garbage that have no problems but complain

150
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:08,180
all day long.
So

151
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,840
on comedy central, a season two comes
out in June, June 15th, June 15th,

152
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,390
comedy central. How did that
come about with you and Natasha?

153
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:19,640
Was that just a conversation?

154
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,780
Natasha and I, we went to, um, do,

155
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,800
we went on like a charity trip to
Senegal for malaria, no more it,

156
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,930
which is actually an incredible
organization like you have to,

157
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,470
they're like actually curing malaria.
Like they're actually doing stuff.

158
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,730
It's so crazy.
But I love that company.

159
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:40,620
And we went to Senegal and it was just
like, we just bonded. It's so hot.

160
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,550
And we were just, we didn't know we
were doing and it was, it was intense.

161
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:48,210
And so we just became friends and
then kind of when we were flying back,

162
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,340
Natasha was like, I looked
at your imdv and I'm like,
yeah, like, okay. She's like,

163
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:54,174
no,
I just,

164
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,200
you have like 80 credits on there and how
many of those things if you've been in

165
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:02,430
that are actually funny. And I was like,
I was like, that's a good question.

166
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:06,270
I was like, I don't know too.
And she's like, I have zero,

167
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,200
I've like 50 things and zero
things are funny. And she's like,

168
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,880
I feel like that's weird.
She was like,

169
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:15,900
I think like we needed to write stuff
and make funny stuff cause why is

170
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,510
everything not funny? And I'm
like, all right, good point.

171
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,870
And so we started trying to come up with
an idea and then we were like kind of

172
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:22,521
stuck.
And then if,

173
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:26,370
so we went out and drank a bunch of wine
and then came up with the idea as you

174
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:30,380
do when you're like, fuck it, let's get
wasted. And they're like, I know the idea.

175
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,180
Like it's a terrible creative process,
but it totally works.

176
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,020
So, uh, speaking of volume to be,

177
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:37,570
actually I found myself watching
million dollar baby recently.

178
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,680
I was totally blind side and I was
like, oh my God, that's an intense,

179
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,590
I'm a renaissance woman as,

180
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,230
yeah, no, that was my first
movie. It was so crazy.

181
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,270
I just thought it was going
up from there. No, I was like,

182
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:51,210
my first movie has ever been won.
The Oscar like sky's the limit.

183
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,490
And then I like still didn't get an agent
for like another two or three years.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,650
I was like, okay, so it's going to be
slower. Yeah. But it was really awesome.

185
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,150
It was crazy.
Do you have to make my first name?

186
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:04,500
It was the Clint Eastwood and Hilary
Swank and Margo Martindale did I ever did

187
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:09,430
and I'm like, okay, it's fine. I'm
fine. I totally deserve to be here.

188
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:10,340
I just,
you know.

189
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,570
Well congratulations. Thanks.
Picture. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

190
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:17,690
It really changed my life.
I'll just,

191
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,580
you guys know we will be taking
questions from the audience.

192
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:22,310
There are microphones in both the aisles.
If you want to just go up there,

193
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:25,370
I'll call on you and do it like school.
I feel like

194
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,910
my back and you clap the hardest so you
have to ask me a question and get the

195
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:33,140
ball rolling. I just, I, I
sense you're like, I just,

196
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,290
I like your whole energy and it made me
feel good at, as I was walking out here.

197
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,740
So not to put you on the spot, but you
have to think of something to ask me.

198
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,570
You can wait. Okay. So you think about
it and we'll get back to you. Okay.

199
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,810
Uh, if I was in the audience and I wasn't
lucky enough to be moderating this,

200
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,010
I would ask you a very important question.
What does it like dating Fozzie bear?

201
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,670
It's pretty sexy. It's like, yeah, he's,

202
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,310
he's pretty smooth. He's,
yeah, no, I actually loved,
I loved being on the methods.

203
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,400
I wasn't big methods fan. I know that
people are like always sat there.

204
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,830
Like I always loved the flash and it's
like, no you didn't. No you didn't.

205
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:10,560
You didn't love that growing up.
But I actually did love the muppets.

206
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,390
I would have Mrs. Miss, miss piggy, miss
piggy birthday cakes and you know, I just,

207
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,110
I loved it. So it was pretty
cool. I didn't know how it worked.

208
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:23,340
I didn't know there was so many people
controlling a up or there's like monitors

209
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:27,320
everywhere and you're on just like raised
platform and it's pretty, you know,

210
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:30,120
what is the process of like
doing a scene with Fozzy? It's,

211
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,220
there's just so many people involved.

212
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:35,250
There's so many actors like
making this thing come to life.

213
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:38,370
There's like one guy that does the left
arm and when they're all working in this,

214
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,150
like they just know each
other so well and they,

215
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,440
they have like these things on their
heads where they can see through the mud.

216
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,310
Like it's just a whole technical
process that they find very easy.

217
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:51,210
And the guy who played Fonzie also
does the voice of piggy and animal.

218
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,870
That's like his talent
basically unlimited. He does
all three of those. Yeah.

219
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,773
What do you got?

220
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,960
[inaudible] I guess first of all,
thank you so much for coming.

221
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,100
Um, huge fan and have been for
years. I like to feel that your song,

222
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:11,630
I don't know who you are, is my
own personal anthem. I know, right?

223
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,950
I'm terrible with names and
faces and it's really your fault.

224
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,480
Yeah. For people that don't know what this
is, we have a song about, it's called,

225
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:20,130
I don't know who you are,
which you can figure out what that is,

226
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:22,560
but as people who have come up to you
and they know who you are but you don't

227
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:26,940
know who they are and they get mad and
we have this hypothesis that it's like

228
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,270
their fault because they're
not interesting enough.

229
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:33,630
They would have like a thing and so
they kind of blend and then it's not our

230
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:34,590
fault.
Yeah.

231
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,090
Oh, so that's amazing. So thank
you so much for opening up my life.

232
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,670
Um, so, uh, I discovered you
guys are amazing Garfunkel
notes. There's another, uh,

233
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:49,010
comedy folk duo, I'm sure you've heard
of called flight of the Conchords. Yes.

234
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,430
And it seems such an odd thing to me that
there were two comedy photos that were

235
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:54,720
so hysterically funny,

236
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,800
had really successful songwriting
careers and then made specials where they

237
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:03,120
incorporated those songs.
You guys inspired by each
other? Do you collaborate?

238
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:05,490
Do you guys all hang out in
some really cool bar somewhere?

239
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,500
I've never met Brett,

240
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:11,460
but I know Jermaine and Jermaine is
actually on the upcoming season of another

241
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,920
period. He's doing two episodes
a season, which is so cool.

242
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:18,450
He flew in from New Zealand just to
do the show and he plays a priest.

243
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,170
It's like, it's like every single thing
he says is funny. So we were very,

244
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:24,960
very excited. But you mean I
actually became friends on Twitter.

245
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,900
Like he just sent me a DM
one day being like, hey,

246
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,020
there's like eight people in the
world to do what we do. What's up?

247
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,890
And I was like, I know, it's so crazy.
Right? And he was like, how weird is it,

248
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,490
what we're doing? We're in comedy
folk. Like who does that? So I'm like,

249
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:41,550
I don't know. And then we just lived in
like Twitter acquaintances since then.

250
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:43,290
And then he agreed to do the show,
which was so cool.

251
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,490
So no plans for some grand
mega band or something.

252
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,960
I mean, I would be so down
quartet. I mean I wish,

253
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,230
I hope I'm going to put up,
I don't know Brett,

254
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:56,470
but I would love to just putting it out
and now it's out in the world. Yeah,

255
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,440
it's in the universe now. It's going to
happen. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.

256
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,820
[inaudible] I don't know who you are song.

257
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,480
It was really weird because everyone
like takes your point of view,

258
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:07,010
which is like,
I don't remember people either,

259
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:10,520
you know you put yourself in the hero
position but then one person came up to us

260
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:14,420
after a show and I'm like, that's all he
is so mean. And I was like, wait, why?

261
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,260
Like what? He goes, people
always forget me and I was like,

262
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,300
Oh God.
And he put it,

263
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:23,990
he put himself in the other like
split yourself in like the hero shoes.

264
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:27,160
Like you hear a bit about other people
being annoying. But like I am a note.

265
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,310
Like you don't put your,
I don't know.

266
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:31,010
I thought that was so strange and I
didn't know what to say. I was like,

267
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:34,910
I think you should not, you should like,
like change your perspective on this.

268
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:39,470
Like do you forget people? And
he's like, no, really sorry man.

269
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,483
I Dunno.

270
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,940
But speaking of that,

271
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:44,970
another one of your songs seems like it
may come across as aggressive to people.

272
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,890
Pregnant women are smug.
Have you ever had any of

273
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,750
for that? I mean, yeah, but not
any of that. Like you care about.

274
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,780
I don't know. What are you going? Oh, you
know, like I don't like that. I'm like,

275
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,510
okay. Right. Like it doesn't, it
doesn't ever hurt my feelings ever.

276
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,780
But like so many more
people had been like,

277
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,120
like Amanda Palmer is pregnant,

278
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:10,700
she sees saying pregnant women
are smug and her whole tour,

279
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,130
like she's like took it on.
And a lot of people,

280
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:16,520
like we got these onesies made that say
my mommy's smug and they just like sold

281
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:18,470
out people.
Just people that just buy them.

282
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:22,760
So I think probably for gag gifts for
baby showers, but I think, I dunno,

283
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,750
most people own it. I feel like if
you're pregnant and acting like that,

284
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:30,190
like you know it and like you can, like,
you're allowed to, there's no, yeah,

285
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,730
you're just allowed to do that. But
I think you know it, the woman card,

286
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,480
the woman card,
I know the pregnant woman card that's,

287
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,180
that's more powerful than the
woman card I think. Cause like,

288
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,730
cause no one can say that you're not going
through whatever you're saying you're

289
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:48,410
going through. Like they're like, no,
my, my ankles hurt. And you're like,

290
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,370
okay. Like you can't, you can't be like,
no they don't. You know, you have no idea.

291
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,670
I'll speak your songs. I want to, uh,

292
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,420
I am dating a 31 year old woman
who loves 29 31. Oh cool. So, uh,

293
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,250
thank you for that.
From her.

294
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,660
She feels like there's no one left
and that's why she's dating him.

295
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,190
Maybe I'm telling you,
I mean,

296
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,430
that's exactly what I said when she
was like, Oh man, that's so cool.

297
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:14,580
And I was just like, wait a
second. Just got really real.

298
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,580
We'll take that.
Like some people have taken it is here.

299
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,900
Like I was at a baseball game the other
day and this girl turns out, she's like,

300
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,680
are you the girl from the 29 31
video? And I was like, yeah, yeah.

301
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,700
And she didn't think we wrote it.

302
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,150
She thought we were like acting
in this video and she's like,

303
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,980
I relate to that song still match.

304
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:33,820
I'm 30 and I know my life is about to
get really bad. And I was like, no,

305
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:36,730
it's just a joke. It's not
even like, it's not real.

306
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:39,910
Like it's not necessarily that,
it's just like a joke.

307
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,240
It was about like basically me and
kids kind of perspective on love and we

308
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,790
weren't even 29 31 at the time.
We just thought those were funny numbers.

309
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,350
We were like 31 and 33 but we're like,
no, it's not. It's funny. Um, yeah,

310
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:50,771
but she's like,

311
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:53,990
I just know everything's going to get bad
and I got to meet someone soon and she

312
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:57,250
was so pretty and like I was,
I'm like, okay. I'm like, sorry,

313
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,370
maybe you shouldn't watch that video.
It's like just a joke.

314
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Oh that's it. Out of all of the
songs, you and Kate, if put together,

315
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,920
what is like your go to like which of
which is your favorite baby basically?

316
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:09,960
What's your favorite thing?
My favorite

317
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,260
song is one that we've actually never
played on. It's just an an album,

318
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,300
but it is on our TV show.
It's called such a loser.

319
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,310
And it's this anthem for people who are
trying, cause like we like just like,

320
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,610
I mean you guys are all on the Internet.
You understand?

321
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:26,340
Like when you put something out there,
you just get all this criticism and,

322
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,210
and it kind of feels like there's like
this hierarchy where it's like winners,

323
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,440
like people who just don't do anything
but like comment on it and then losers.

324
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,210
But like we just feel like
those should be switched.

325
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:38,610
Like winners are just like they
want and you got it like they did.

326
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,880
But like the people who try and
the people who comment on it,

327
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:43,950
it should be like a different hierarchy
so that the commenters should just be

328
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:44,784
like whatever.

329
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,830
And so we wrote a song about in praise
of people who are trying and because if

330
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:53,160
you're failing, not much, you're trying
that much. So it's, it's not a funny song.

331
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:55,320
It's totally sentimental, but I think
it's the best thing we've ever written.

332
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,720
So yeah,
look it up.

333
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,240
It was like a cartoon made of it.
People play it for their kids.

334
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,510
Uh, with the, with your song
writing process, you seem
to then also go into video.

335
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,400
Uh, so what is that like? Do you ever
like get kind of bogged down and like, oh,

336
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:16,330
this would look great visually
so we should enter the
song or is that well after

337
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:16,780
that,

338
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,990
nope, we don't have that
kind of forethought when
he's like, oh, I don't know.

339
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:21,430
I guess we just film some stuff.
Yeah,

340
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:24,280
we don't really ever think
about that part of the song.

341
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:25,120
And like for such a loser,

342
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:28,450
we had an animated by these people in
Boston who are so incredible and they just

343
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:29,620
sent us this thing and Kate and I,

344
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,490
we always have a million notes
were always were so nitpicky,

345
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,590
it takes us forever and do anything. And
they sent it and we just started crying,

346
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,453
both of us and we're like,

347
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,440
this is perfect.
And they were like,

348
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:40,870
well we have like four rounds of
notes built in. And we're like,

349
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,040
so sometimes it's like that easy.
That was going to say,

350
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,390
so for you to know it's a really a bad,

351
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,110
oh no, no, no, no. I always have so many
notes, but this one, it was just like,

352
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,360
it was perfect and so you don't want
to, if it's perfect, it's perfect. Yeah.

353
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,530
You know, so, but yeah, I'm
pretty, I'm like pretty hands
on with everything. Okay.

354
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,020
I like to be in every moment of
everything like Natasha or editing another

355
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:07,840
period right now and we're in the
editing room from like 10 to eight every

356
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:12,330
single day. We just get her nails
done in there. I mean like, yeah,

357
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,860
we're hands on. Great. Um, okay.

358
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,730
In another period, um, uh, uh,

359
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,810
in another period coming up,
what can we look forward to?

360
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,550
You mentioned that Jermaine
was going to be on me

361
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,010
and Andrew Reynolds is on this new
season playing like a dashing prince type

362
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,810
person. We have, um,

363
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Harriet Tubman is in our premiere and
which is so crazy that now she's on money,

364
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,470
well about to be on money. Um, because we
have her as a, she's a branding expert.

365
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,230
We have her as like this Oprah type
person. And she's basically like,

366
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,710
how do you think I'm the only name
associated with this entire movement?

367
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,780
She's like,
I did that shit.

368
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,120
Like on our show. People are going to have
mixed reactions to it. They really are.

369
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,230
And we're prepared for that.
But it is

370
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,170
funny if you watch it, it's
just like it's, you know,

371
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:59,540
cause you think about your like how
did one person, how did that happen?

372
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,890
Like there was so many people, but yes.
So you just think through history. Yeah.

373
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,530
And now she's going to be on money.
So I guess it worked

374
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,190
in that vein.
Uh,

375
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,930
you mentioned earlier than a lot of
things are from 1902 and then you, yes.

376
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,720
Yes.
I'm so much stuff is true though.

377
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,900
Some people think we make up this stuff
and it's like, like we have like cocaine,

378
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:21,620
wine. Like that was just a popular drink
that was not, we didn't make that up.

379
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,150
People had cocaine mine all the time.

380
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,590
It's just those kinds of things are
just real Freud masturbating people.

381
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:28,424
It's just real.

382
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,940
So that's a real, uh, a real clip entirely
with Freud. Yes. That was not right.

383
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,720
Cause Cornell, Sigmund
Freud. All right, great.

384
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,570
Um, thank you so much for being
here. We really appreciate it.

385
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,320
If anyone would like to meet
Ricky afterwards, we'll be
right here. No, right here.

386
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,990
Yeah. If you didn't want to
ask your questions directly,

387
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,133
I mean,

388
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,490
thank you so much for being here.
Thank you for having regular. No.
