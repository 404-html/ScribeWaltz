1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,893
Thank you

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,170
you so much for having me.
Google.

3
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:16,740
I'm really honored that y'all showed
up during your lunch break. Very cool.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,770
And for those in the audience
who haven't read the book,

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,080
can you summarize what
it's about? Sure. So, um,

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,480
the book breaking cover is
a memoir and it's about, um,

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,620
it answers all the key questions. Like
how in the world did you get into the CIA?

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,090
Uh, it talks about my career
at the CIA, which was, um,

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,050
being an undercover counterterrorism
officer along with my husband.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,890
We served together for 10 years,
uh, primarily in the Middle East.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,120
And then also follows us after we leave
the agency and what we did afterwards.

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,610
So it's a memoir. And, um,

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,290
the whole point of the book is to
use my story to inspire others.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:55,950
Uh,

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,690
cause I'm from a small town in Florida
and I come from a very rural area and I

16
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:05,250
never imagined myself doing anything
remotely like the CIA. And, um,

17
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,010
I eventually found out that um,

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,250
ordinary people can do really
extraordinary things when
you don't let your fear

19
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:17,010
get in the way.
And that's the point of the bike.

20
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,730
How did you go from being someone who
wanted to become a ballerina to actually

21
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,210
becoming an expert with counter
terrorism and at CIA? Yeah,

22
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:29,880
so people will say,
they just assume like,

23
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,740
you must've grown up wanting to
be a spy. I'm like, really? No.

24
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,240
Um, I wanted it to be a
Rockette or a ballerina.

25
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,920
And,
um,

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,920
but instead I actually found myself
being very fascinated by foreign affairs,

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,080
um,
because of National Geographic magazine.

28
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,600
I love National Geographic.

29
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:55,860
And so as a kid introduced me to a world
completely outside of anything I knew

30
00:01:55,861 --> 00:02:00,240
from central Florida and I
eventually followed that passion,

31
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,440
um,

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,790
to the Middle East for study
abroad programs in college.

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,820
And then I went to Georgetown for my
masters and Arab Studies and got recruited

34
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:16,130
out of Georgetown and to the CIA.
In the book you talk about, uh,

35
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,220
your mentor who wouldn't even make eye
contact with you because of your gender

36
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,730
and would only address your
male colleague in the room.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,010
How did you deal with that? Okay. So here,
here you are. You're from a small town,

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,760
you've been offered a job in the CIA,

39
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:35,430
but now you've got to go through
a year's worth of training,

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,050
which is kind of like bootcamp for
intelligence officers. And so I had,

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,450
I totally had imposter syndrome.

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,070
How in the world did I get hired
into the CIA? What am I doing here?

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,240
Am I capable of this job?
And so during that year of training,

44
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,490
because you're learning a trade craft,
it's very intense.

45
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,220
And so you're,
you get placed with a mentor.

46
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,030
So there's one mentor and to students.
And so it was a male, a male student,

47
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:08,680
and myself,
and this guy was a legend at the CIA.

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,430
And on the first day in the little
tiny office where we were meeting,

49
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,040
he introduced himself and,
and um,

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,990
I realized he was only talking to
my male colleague the whole time.

51
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,580
He couldn't even look at me. And
I was like, that's really weird.

52
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,480
And, uh, after, after we were
done with that hour long session,

53
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:33,460
my male colleague said, well, that was
strange. And I said, did you notice that?

54
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:35,230
He goes, yeah, he didn't look at you once.

55
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,820
And eventually it came out that this
gentleman who had already been retired for

56
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:44,770
about 20 years had only worked with women
and the context and being secretaries

57
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:49,450
and the agency and he could not conceive
of the idea of a female being an

58
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:53,770
intelligence officer. And he just
couldn't wrap his brain around that.

59
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,370
And so I realized in that
moment, you know, that, okay,

60
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,430
so I guess I'm going to have to deal
with being a little bit invisible,

61
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,370
but you got to do what you gotta do.

62
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,150
How do you transition something that
can be a perceived weakness into an

63
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:13,090
advantage?
So I decided in that moment like,

64
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,260
I can't help what this
guy thinks about me. Um,

65
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:21,610
he has his own preconceived ideas of
what women may or may not be capable of.

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,770
And he kept saying things to me like,

67
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,330
are you sure you want to work
in the Middle East? And I
kept saying, yeah, I mean,

68
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,930
I've actually spent a lot of time already
in the Middle East and I'm fascinated

69
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:36,070
by this culture. And he said, but
you know, it's dangerous. And I said,

70
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,620
I'd get that any,

71
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,690
he admitted to me one day that he
could not envision me carrying out

72
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:47,200
clandestined operations on behalf
of the CIA as a, as a woman.

73
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,390
But I just decided like, okay, um,
there's nothing I can do about that,

74
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:57,391
so I'm just going to learn everything
I can from him and just push past it.

75
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,000
So like there are places like
I'm sure a company like Google,

76
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:05,740
if you perceive a systematic issue or a
problem, you can address that officially,

77
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,230
but the agency is not one of those places.

78
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,120
So I just had to like put up with it.
I'll show him eventually.

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,130
And it's interesting because I remember
there was a part of the book where you

80
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:22,820
talk about it's the HR department
that decides to place people at,

81
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,800
especially women at desk jobs
and it's intentional. Yeah, it's,

82
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,850
it's an intentional
decision. Uh, at the agency,

83
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,050
certain positions they, uh, they would
like women to be in primarily, uh,

84
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,580
when you're talking about field
positions being deployed overseas in the

85
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,830
clandestine service,
um,

86
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,690
there's a case officer role and they
tend to like having men in that role,

87
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,580
particularly in the Middle East region.

88
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,250
And then there's one that's
more behind the desk, uh,

89
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,980
that's managing the flow of intelligence.

90
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,070
And so they put me in that position
and they said, your husband,

91
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,190
who's a native speaker of Arabic,
he,

92
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,600
he can do this field role much
better than you as a female.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,030
And I was like, okay,
well they're the CIA.

94
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:15,170
They must know because they kept saying,
these guys are not going to respect you.

95
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,770
Um,

96
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,480
the kind of sources that we're dealing
with are very hardened terrorist and

97
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,750
insurgents and you're just never gonna
be able to do this job. And so I,

98
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,020
I thought, well, this CIA must know.

99
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,990
And when I got to Baghdad
in my third deployment,

100
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,260
I'm and in the field,
and I'm seeing that my,

101
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,150
my male colleagues other than my husband
and a couple others had never been to

102
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,750
the Middle East. And it suddenly
dawned on me, wait a minute,

103
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,560
how can these people do a better job
than I can when I've been busting my butt

104
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:54,980
to study the Middle East? And I, and I
know this culture really, really well.

105
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,001
And it,

106
00:06:56,001 --> 00:07:01,001
and I finally realized him in Baghdad
when I finally got into the debriefing

107
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:05,330
room that the CIO is wrong. But it took
me a really long time to figure it out.

108
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,050
And

109
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,950
unfortunately, this is not
just at CIA is, you know, um,

110
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,740
we all deal with it in various
forums. Um, a lot of my friends, uh,

111
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,520
not just in the tech field, but even
outside, uh, they get to control.

112
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:24,120
You'd have the biases and they decide
to leave the workforce. How have you,

113
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,860
um, ever felt like doing that?
And if so, what made you,

114
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,540
you know,
what kept you going?

115
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,381
So I,

116
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:37,381
I would be lying if I said that I
didn't consider leaving the CIA about a

117
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,370
thousand times. There was a
really hard career and, um,

118
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,370
but I'm also a very stubborn person,

119
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,050
so if somebody tells me I can't do
something or I'm told I'm not good enough,

120
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,590
or, um, I'm pushed aside,

121
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,760
there's something deep inside me that
just wants to prove everybody wrong.

122
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,370
And so I think that determination to win,

123
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,580
just what kept me in
there kept me in the role.

124
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,850
Based on your experience,

125
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,240
what advice would you give to a woman
who feels somewhat marginalized and their

126
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:14,920
role?
Yeah,

127
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,300
so it's really tough to be completely
underestimated all the time.

128
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,490
And,
but at the same time it can be useful,

129
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,840
especially in the agency
when you're dealing with like
counter terrorism issues.

130
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,680
There were a lot of,
uh,

131
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:33,750
experiences in which it was
good to be underestimated.

132
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,250
So meeting with special cases where they
thought we could be dealing with double

133
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,580
agent. And so what was really
useful as walking to a meeting, uh,

134
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,930
an individual from a different culture,
some were from the Middle East,

135
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:50,430
somewhere from different cultures who
essentially thought that I didn't know

136
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,080
anything. And so that
I use that to my, um,

137
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
my advantage and there was meetings and
so I would get people to open up to me

138
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,880
not realizing what they were doing.
So being underestimated.

139
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,240
You can't help what other
people think about you.

140
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,050
You have no control over what's
going on in somebody else's mind.

141
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,660
But what you do have control over is the
extent to which you develop yourself to

142
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:17,760
a point you can no longer be ignored.

143
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,360
So all those years when people thought
I wasn't intelligent and couldn't

144
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,900
anything about Arab culture,
I put my head down and I decided to do,

145
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,200
to figure out how to do this job
better than anybody else. I mean,

146
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:35,100
they just decided I've got to figure
out how to be a really good intelligence

147
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:38,940
officer. And so I built up
this expertise over time,

148
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,240
a counterintelligence and
counterterrorism expertise.

149
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Until finally the point at
which I demonstrated very
clearly that I could walk

150
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:54,540
into a debriefing room with an Arab stores
and get him to give me intelligence.

151
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,990
He wouldn't give other people.
And then finally,

152
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:59,940
I finally,

153
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:04,941
after years and years of building up this
knowledge could prove myself and then

154
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:09,810
I could use that leverage to get the kind
of job I wanted in the CIA, which was,

155
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,370
um, that special job looking at potential
double agents and things like that.

156
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,830
But it's a slow process.

157
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,360
It takes time to become an expert in
your field. But I would just say like,

158
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,070
do the best you can to become really
good at that thing you're most passionate

159
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:31,071
about and then make it so that people can
no longer ignore you because you're so

160
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,310
good at your job.

161
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,980
Um, this is a bit of a loaded
question though, I admit,

162
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,960
but do you think you would have ultimately
achieved more in your career if you

163
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:41,794
were a man?

164
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,250
I know that is a loaded
question. Um, I don't know.

165
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:51,080
And I guess I try not to think
of it that way. Um, I just,

166
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:52,370
I'm the eternal optimist.

167
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:56,810
So even when I'm up against something
that's a huge challenge. I just,

168
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,850
you know, I guess I feel like
eventually on the other end of this,

169
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:03,260
something good is going to work out.

170
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:06,680
And if I think back to what if I had
been a guy or what if this it just,

171
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,950
I guess I try not to think of it that way.

172
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,700
Um,

173
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,400
in the book you talk about how
sometimes being open and s,

174
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:16,860
you know,

175
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,860
smiling can be misconstrued as
a one dimensional and naive.

176
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,830
Um,
how did you deal with it?

177
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,860
Do you think that sort of assumption is
warranted and also does it make sense

178
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,290
for us to put up a tougher exterior?

179
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,280
Are you guys can tell just in a short
period of time you've been in this room

180
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:42,180
that I'm a fairly outgoing,
Smiley personality. Um,

181
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,290
I really enjoy interacting with people.
And so I have noticed,

182
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,140
especially in a environment
like Washington DC, um,

183
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,050
people assume that when nice and
friendly and open and smiley,

184
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,570
you are not,
um,

185
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,070
multifaceted that you're not intelligent.
And,

186
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,270
and it's not people being jerks,

187
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,260
they don't even really often understand
they're creating these ideas about you

188
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,940
in their head.
Um,

189
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,860
but I learned in DC and in the Middle
East how to show other aspects of my

190
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,750
personality at different times.

191
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,850
So I learned when I was in a
place like Cairo as a student,

192
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,550
I'm studying culture.

193
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,180
I learned how to stand up for myself
in situations where I was being taken

194
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,030
advantage of. You know, and that's
when the smile comes off your face.

195
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,110
And that's when you show the rougher part
where the more aggressive part of your

196
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:36,010
personality.

197
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,490
So coming from the south as a good
southern girl where you don't show when

198
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:44,970
something's wrong or you don't,
um,

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,240
you have to be very subtle in how you
approach people. When something's wrong.

200
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,950
It doesn't work in a place like
Washington or the CIA or the Middle East.

201
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,290
You have to find that.

202
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,320
You have to find ways to
reveal the multidimensional
nature of your personality.

203
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,600
So I can stand up for myself.

204
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,540
I can get aggressive when I need to.
Um,

205
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,950
and understanding and having
the confidence to do that
was something I learned

206
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:12,970
in the Middle East.

207
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,020
And earlier in the talk you mentioned
imposter syndrome and this is something

208
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:24,520
that's not, um, you know,
time to just, you know,

209
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,360
being a woman that it cuts across gender.
Um,

210
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,720
and you also talk about one of your male
colleague who also built with it. Uh,

211
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,750
how does one overcome imposter
syndrome? Yeah. Um, okay.

212
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,520
Has anyone in this room raise your hand
if you've ever dealt with the whole

213
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:46,450
imposter syndrome issue?
Okay.

214
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,410
I feel so at home right now.
Um,

215
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,480
that's so interesting cause I came to
Google thinking you guys all knew how

216
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:59,410
awesome you are all the
time. And Jasmine's like, no,

217
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:04,240
we feel it too. And so, um,

218
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,100
imposter syndrome,

219
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,310
I think there's something refreshing
about knowing that you're not the only

220
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:12,280
person who suffers that.
Okay.

221
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,260
So I get into the CIA. I've never
known anybody who worked at the CIA.

222
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,500
I've only seen it in Hollywood movies.
So in my mind,

223
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,400
people were prep their whole
lives to be CIA officers.

224
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,690
They're all martial artists with black
belts. They all speak five languages,

225
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:32,020
they're all total cultural
savant who traveled the world.

226
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,310
And so you walk in there all meek and
mild and thinking, you know, I'm not sure,

227
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,410
I'm not sure I can do this.

228
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,420
And then you discover how very wrong you
were and you look around you and you're

229
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:48,010
like, okay, these are just regular
human beings here in this building. Um,

230
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,480
the way that I dealt with
imposter syndrome is simply
by not quitting and much

231
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,890
of the time was just because
I was too embarrassed to quit.

232
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,360
And so sometimes I tell like
to tell people I've had a
lot of success in my life

233
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,820
simply just cause I hung in there longer
than other people with the secret to my

234
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,060
success.
Um,

235
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,640
and it's because I
think when you struggle,

236
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,710
when you work so hard to deal
with your imposter syndrome,

237
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,190
the process of that struggle breeds
something really beautiful in you in terms

238
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:26,030
of your expertise.

239
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,780
When I had a meeting and the guy sitting
across from me is telling me he's an l

240
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:37,751
Catia Amir and he's telling me he's
been running operations in Baghdad and

241
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:44,771
something about his body language is
telling me intuitively that it's that he,

242
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,150
there's something wrong with this guy.

243
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,990
And I sat in the struggle for weeks after
this debriefing trying to figure out

244
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,520
why is it bothering me, what about
this guy is giving me this bad feeling?

245
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,970
And after weeks of trying to go
through this debriefing in my head,

246
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:06,971
I suddenly realized this guy was
an acting like an l Cada Amir.

247
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:13,250
He wasn't behaving like all of the other
terrorist I had dealt with when they

248
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:18,080
walked in a room, these other guys,
they walked in like they own the place,

249
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,530
they had the biggest egos I
have ever seen in my life.

250
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,040
And it suddenly I was suddenly realized
this guy didn't have an ego and he was

251
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:30,230
scared.
And when I picked him up in my car,

252
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:33,470
I actually had a moment where I thought
this guy is going to pee his pants.

253
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,050
Like he was shaking like a leaf.

254
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,640
And after weeks of going back
through the entire meeting,

255
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,550
this struggle brought me
to a point where I said,

256
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:48,080
I don't think he's what he's telling us.
I don't think he's in Okada Mirror.

257
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,890
I don't even think he's in El Cada at all.

258
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,930
Nevermind being the
leader of a cell group.

259
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,360
And it turns out that after a couple of
months of intensive efforts for me to

260
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:03,440
vet his information,
he was never an all Cada.

261
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,380
And so that, that, that struggle,

262
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,560
it brought me to a place where
I suddenly had this confidence.

263
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,810
Like I can read body language,

264
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,170
I get the culture enough to
realize when something's wrong.

265
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,070
And then finally that whole
imposter syndrome thing,

266
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,870
it finally went away.

267
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,820
And it was like a turning point in my
career when I realized that I was actually

268
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:27,590
really good at intelligence.

269
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:31,490
So the moral of this story
is just hang in there.

270
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,390
You know how, uh, biocese
goes both ways, uh,

271
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,080
like how people judged you in Middle East.
Uh,

272
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,100
we tend to have all these stereotypical
ideas about people from at least as

273
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:50,160
well. Uh, but you have
spent a of time with them.

274
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,110
You know them on a personal basis,

275
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,500
what are some of the misconceptions
that we as Americans have against them?

276
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,080
So I mean the first thing is that,
um,

277
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,360
when you don't interact with it,

278
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:06,390
certain people group you tend to
have the worst ideas about them.

279
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:10,140
And the thing that I love about
people from the Middle East that I,

280
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:15,141
that you realize immediately when you
go to the Middle East is how hospitable

281
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,650
people are and how they will literally
give you the shirt off their back.

282
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,810
The way they treat visitors,

283
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:26,811
the way that they welcome you into their
home or welcome me to their country is,

284
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,900
um, I learned what
hospitality wise from Arabs.

285
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,300
And it taught me a lot about
being a better person. So that's,

286
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,310
that's one thing I like to tell people.

287
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,320
And another thing that makes me crazy
is when I hear people say things like,

288
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,420
Oh,
you served in the Middle East.

289
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:49,230
It's that place where people just
kill each other all the time.

290
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:53,100
And this has been going on for thousands
of years and it, and it sounds like, oh,

291
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:55,680
they're just animals over there and
they just love to fight. You know,

292
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:57,000
they're just warmongers.

293
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,870
And what makes me crazy about that is
it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the

294
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,463
Middle East.

295
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,790
There's a lot of identity politics
that exist in the Middle East that are

296
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,440
different than where we have in America.

297
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,910
Our political system here is very
different than the political system in the

298
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,170
Middle East. And so what you have, you
don't have separation of church and state.

299
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,060
They're integrated into one.

300
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,380
And so that creates a completely
different dynamic in terms of identity,

301
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:29,460
politics and fighting for
control over ideology,

302
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,450
which is fighting for control over power.
Um,

303
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,580
it's not because people aren't biting
each other because they just love warring

304
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,170
or they're just these animals is that
they're dealing with a different set of

305
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:47,310
political circumstances.
And in order to understand that,

306
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:51,420
you really have to look at and recognize
how different the systems are that

307
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,254
we're dealing with.

308
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,020
That's quite fascinating because most of
us hear about terrorism and terrorists,

309
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:02,680
you know, based on headlines that
we get, you know, through media,

310
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,360
but you know them as
people beyond criminals.

311
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,350
And um, and that is really
interesting. You know,

312
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,610
we don't get to see that
side of those people. The

313
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,940
most fun part of my job isn't
as an intelligence officer.

314
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,380
Everybody thinks of Hollywood.
You're driving fast cars,
you're drinking Martinis,

315
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:24,630
you're doing all this high speed stuff.
Um,

316
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,220
but what I find the most fascinating
aspect of being an intelligence officer is

317
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:34,020
the psychological aspect of those
interactions with another human being.

318
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,500
So the way I like to explain it is you
have created a relationship with a guy

319
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,820
who you have nothing in common with.
As a counterterrorism officer,

320
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,830
your job is to get insider.

321
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,290
You need to stop terrorist
attacks from occurring.

322
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,450
So who are you meeting meeting with?

323
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,020
You're going to be meeting with
penetrations of a terrorist group.

324
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,940
These are guys who have turned on the
rest of the terrorist group and have

325
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:05,710
agreed to be the mole.
They've agreed to risk their lives,

326
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,150
to partner with the CIA to
give you this intelligence.

327
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,380
So while he's a terrorist,
while he has clearly killed people,

328
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,900
he now is at a place that
he's willing to work with you.

329
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,090
If you mishandle his intelligence,
if you mishandle his identity information,

330
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,560
you could get him killed.

331
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,430
So he's risking his life
to be meeting with you.

332
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,930
So if I'm going to be interacting with
this human being to get intelligence out

333
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:34,930
of him,
fundamentally he has to trust me.

334
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,210
And if I walked through the door and I'm
the opposite of what he's expecting as

335
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:43,330
a female,
he's not going to trust me.

336
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,370
So how do I connect with this guy
who has crazy hard and ideology,

337
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:51,970
thinks nothing. Women should never
leave home. And if they leave home,

338
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:55,060
they should have be completely
covered and have a male escort.

339
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,310
How am I going to connect with him if
I want him to see me as a human being?

340
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,390
I have to understand who he is and
it's got to be something other than

341
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,190
terrorists sitting in a seat across from
me. He has strengths, he has weaknesses.

342
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,320
He has his own motivations.

343
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,890
And if I'm going to work
with him in intelligence,

344
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,490
I have to know what his motivations are.
Is He doing this for money?

345
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,310
Is he doing this to take
out the competition?

346
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,020
Is he doing this because he no longer
buys into the ideology and he's had it

347
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:30,430
with El Catia and he's willing to risk
his life to work against them. Um,

348
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,780
so fundamentally I,

349
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,840
I can't do my job unless I can see that
person and interact with them as a human

350
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:43,180
being. You say have the agent
who interacts with them,

351
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,410
they have three big challenges and then
you don't case you have the fourth one.

352
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,910
Um, do you want to elaborate
what those challenges are? Yeah.

353
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:55,180
See your challenges as you're trying
to then make this connection with this

354
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:59,350
person. You have s you know, hardly
anything in common with is, first of all,

355
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:03,280
you're an American,
so you're the enemy from the get go.

356
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,430
And we're talking about not all middle
easterners were talking about these

357
00:23:06,431 --> 00:23:10,300
terrorists sources we're meeting with.
Then secondly,

358
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,930
you worked for the CIA,
so you're double enemy.

359
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,370
And then thirdly, it's assumed you're a
Christian if you're white, that doesn't,

360
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,950
it's obviously not necessarily the case,

361
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:25,750
but they assume that so you
are American, Cia, Christian,

362
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,800
and then female with soon.

363
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:33,710
It's like you have the deck
stacked against you and so
you'd have to figure out,

364
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,620
I was preparing for my first
debriefing in Baghdad. I realized,

365
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,380
okay, again, I can't help with that.

366
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,240
Guy Thinks of me when I
walked through the door,

367
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,910
but I've got to figure out very quickly
how to make this connection with him.

368
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,750
So I've got to take all of his assessments
about me and turn them on their heads.

369
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,330
I have to absolutely
turn them upside down.

370
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,400
And the reason why it's
got to happen quickly,

371
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:59,690
it's because we're getting
shelled constantly and there's a,

372
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:03,830
it's we're in the Green Zone and we've
got a curfew and we thought all of these

373
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:08,000
external things going on. So we have
got to make this meeting happen quickly.

374
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,800
So I walk in the room and I have to be
sure that my body language is exuding

375
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:17,240
confidence, even though I
am terrified, I'm excited,

376
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,930
I like I'm shaking, but I don't
want him to see that I'm shaking.

377
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:25,490
So I'm like deep breathing exercises.
I agree to him in Arabic.

378
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,740
I greet him using Arabic,
uh, freezes that show.

379
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,600
They're not like show Kieron off one.
Like thank you or you know, silly phrases.

380
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,550
I'm using phrases that demonstrate I've
studied Arabic and then I'm talking to

381
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:43,220
him about something that matters to him.

382
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,600
So I've studied this guy inside and out
and I know that the guy I'm meeting with

383
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:51,560
has this huge ego and he feels really
important. So I stroke his ego.

384
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,630
I say Abba,
Muhammad,

385
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,650
I am so impressed by what you
have done in the last few months.

386
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,370
You have been incredibly
brave by sharing x, Y, z.

387
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,990
What you have done is literally
pushed l Catia out of your village.

388
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,410
I'm really impressed with you.
So I'm stroking his ego.

389
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,410
I'm making him feel important because
we all want to feel important.

390
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,130
And then I got to show
him that I'm intelligent.

391
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,780
So I have to talk about Iraq writ large.
My knowledge of a rock,

392
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:22,520
what kind of a country or rock is,

393
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,120
I have to show him that
I know specifically how a
rock is different than the

394
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:29,270
rest of the Middle East.
What makes a rock unique?

395
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,960
And as I'm having this conversation
with him, this like back and forth,

396
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:35,150
nice to meet you in this,
this exchange,

397
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,510
I'm seeing his eyes like twitching
because I am not what he expected.

398
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:47,470
And so I know that it's working and so
I continue this dialogue with him and I

399
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:51,350
can see that I am shocking
the heck out of him.

400
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,720
And about five minutes into this exchange
where I have confronted every single

401
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,860
miss assessment, he has this
moment where he just decides like,

402
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,470
wow,
she's smart,

403
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,220
I like her and I'm going to work with
her and now we can get down to business.

404
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:14,411
And now I have taken my disadvantage as
a female and now I've turned it on his

405
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:19,340
head and now he wants to
impress me because I'm a female.

406
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,620
Fine. I can work with that if that's
how, if that's what we're dealing with.

407
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:28,570
Fine. And so I realized
that if you are, um, the,

408
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,960
anyone can use this strategy to deal
with people who don't fundamentally

409
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:36,260
understand who you are, but you
have to work with them nonetheless.

410
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,230
I'm going to switch gears a little bit.
Um,

411
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,620
there have been a lot
of shootings recently,

412
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:46,170
including one at our youtube campus.
Um,

413
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:51,230
is there something that we as civilians
can do to be more alert and stay safe?

414
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,930
Yeah, I know that's such
a tiny question. Question,

415
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,940
easy question you asked Jasmine.
Um,

416
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,420
so I think the most important thing is
to realize where you're most vulnerable

417
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:10,020
because some attacks were surprised like
this one, and you can't plan for that.

418
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:14,280
And you can't really prepare in many
situations for the lone wolf to,

419
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,240
to crack and do what this woman did.
However,

420
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:21,720
I do like to tell people it's really
important to know when you're most

421
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:25,380
vulnerable or to know when you're in
situations where if something's happened,

422
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:27,150
this might be a place
where it will happen.

423
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,420
So it tends to be in places where like,
um,

424
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,300
you're at a concert or you're
at a mall during Christmas time,

425
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:41,301
like buying presence in December where
you're in large gatherings of people,

426
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:45,270
you're at a sporting event.
Whenever you're in places like that,

427
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,350
you have to just say,
okay,

428
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,800
in this moment I realized that I
am in a place where this abuse,

429
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,070
we're just target rich
environment for a terrorist. Um,

430
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,310
but here's the other thing,

431
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,790
it's telling yourself ahead of time that
you're going to have the right response.

432
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:04,230
God forbid something happens
because when an attack occurs,

433
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,700
you have a surge of adrenaline that goes
to the courses through your body and

434
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:12,540
you have one of three reactions.
It's either fight,

435
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,700
flight or freeze.

436
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,290
And it sounds really basic but a lot
of people freeze and their situations

437
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:23,070
because they're so overcome by fear
or they don't know what's happening.

438
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,890
And so the idea is to tell
yourself ahead of time,

439
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:30,630
God forbid I am ever in one of those
situations, I am not going to freeze.

440
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,450
And so sometimes survival,

441
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:36,150
it's as simple as not freezing.

442
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,980
And this the ca gave us training because
a lot of us were sent to war zones and

443
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:44,670
places where we could be ambushed and
the idea is that the place where the

444
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:49,500
attack occurs is called the acts and you
have to do anything possible to get off

445
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:54,501
the ax and their situations so they
actually trained us find out where the

446
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:55,770
threat's coming from,

447
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,280
which direction and run the other way and
again it sounds really like really the

448
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:07,221
ca has to teach you people that but yes
they do and actually I think as human

449
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:12,681
beings just recognizing the potential
responses in being able to say like you're

450
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:17,580
taking your family out and you guys are
in a public place and you realize we

451
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:22,560
could be a little bit
vulnerable, vulnerable here.
Where are the exits? The exits.

452
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,880
So when I go to a concert, I look at the
concert hall and I already exit, exit,

453
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,450
exit, exit. Whereas everybody going
to go probably that direction.

454
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:33,780
Is there another direction I could
go to not get involved in a stampede?

455
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,360
These are the kinds of things
I think through my head.

456
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,920
Where's cover or concealment? If something
happened right now, where would I run?

457
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,720
And so it's a counterterrorism officer.

458
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:47,170
I am a little sick like that all the time.

459
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,511
But anyway,

460
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:52,330
it gives you an idea of what you can
think through in your head is you're

461
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:55,960
dealing with an attack, like what
just happened on your youtube campus?

462
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:00,100
How long did she have her weapon out?
Did she brand a shit for several seconds?

463
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,570
Did she give anybody a moment to respond
or does she literally just pull it out

464
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:06,730
and start shooting? So the
questions are, you know,

465
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:09,820
how much time do you have
and to just do anything.

466
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:14,650
I'm telling you guys anything
to get off the ax. That's,

467
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,730
that's actually a great advice.
Um,

468
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,410
as someone who has dealt with a
lot of people with ill intent, um,

469
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,350
can you even spot them in public?
Is it even possible? I mean,

470
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:30,080
once they pulled the gun out,
then of course, you know, um,

471
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,280
I think that you could be quite surprised
at how much you can see when you're

472
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:40,750
paying attention. Um, I was with my
family, this was during my CIA training.

473
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:45,040
So I started learning how to pay attention
to my surroundings at this period of

474
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,740
time.
And we were in a toy store and this book,

475
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,140
this story is actually in the
book, so you'll recognize that. Um,

476
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,110
but we were in a toy store and we're
walking down the aisle and I saw this guy

477
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:01,170
crouched down by the Barbie
dolls and he looked weird.

478
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,710
He looked unkempt,
like his hair was like not combed.

479
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,500
Like half of his shirt was tucked in.

480
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,940
He just looked super sketchy and he like
made the hair on the back of my neck

481
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:13,774
stand up.

482
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,230
And so I literally watched this guy's
eyes glom onto my six year old niece and

483
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:26,950
watch her walk down the aisle
in such an inappropriate manner.

484
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,120
I could barely put it
into words in that moment.

485
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,780
All I might have thought
in my head was pedophile,

486
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:39,670
pedophile and um, you know, like grabbed
her and like usher her through the aisle.

487
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,970
And I didn't have confidence at that point
to like say something cause I didn't,

488
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,590
I always like second guessing myself.
Am I correct? You know, is that right?

489
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,430
What can I say? Like I think there's
a weird guy and I'll fight and five,

490
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:58,210
like what do you tell people?
Knowing what I know now,

491
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,900
I would've gone back in
time and I would've gone to
the front desk or whatever

492
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:04,750
and said, there's a really
sketchy guy in aisle five.

493
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,710
He looks like a pedophile to me. But
you know, just letting you know. Um,

494
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,970
but it's, so, it's interesting
because I noticed something,

495
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:16,030
I was paying attention to
something that didn't look right.

496
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:21,490
And so I think you really have to honor
your gut feeling when something is out

497
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:25,300
of place. And the more you pay
attention to your surroundings and more,

498
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:30,301
you'll see things that just don't
fit in or just don't look right and,

499
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,030
and you'll be surprised.
Yeah. That makes sense. Um,

500
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,110
last question and then we'll
move on to audience questions.

501
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:43,400
What's most valuable lesson that you
learned at CIA that might be applicable to

502
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:48,110
everyone, including us,
civilians? So it really kind of,

503
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,840
it's the theme of today,
which is

504
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,840
you have to find a weak way in your
job to be authentically who you are.

505
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,210
It takes a long period of time to build
up the confidence to say, how can I,

506
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:04,040
with my unique perspective,

507
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,180
bring who I am to this job or this role?

508
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,110
And to have the confidence to say I
see things a little bit differently.

509
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,730
Can we potentially do this or that?
And what's nice is Google,

510
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,710
you worked for a company that really
honors innovation and you work in a place

511
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:25,640
that kind of upholds that, which
is fabulous. Like I'm jealous.

512
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,970
Um,
but the idea is to not,

513
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:34,330
is to feel free to disrupt
because of who you are.

514
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,350
Use your personality to
disrupt the status quo,

515
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,470
to innovate,
to change how things are done.

516
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,380
Your power comes in your authenticity.

517
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,090
When I tried to run an operation
like my male colleagues,

518
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,070
I wasn't doing a very good job.

519
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,520
But when I decided in that
moment I'm going to be Michelle,

520
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,350
my Smiley Michelle face, whatever
that seemed so foreign to the CIA.

521
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:05,240
But when I brought that into into my
job and brought it into the way that I

522
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,430
planned and executed operations,

523
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,410
I stood out in the best possible way.
And I,

524
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:17,650
I what made me feel initially like an odd
ball in this day is what enabled me to

525
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:22,610
shine eventually. And again, it took
me like five years to figure that out.

526
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,110
And hopefully it won't take you as long,

527
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:29,590
but it is to encourage you
to be as authentic in what
you do every day because I

528
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:33,650
think that's where your
success lies. Yeah. Oh yeah.

529
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,100
Say the question is what do I think about
what's going on in terms of terrorism

530
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:40,660
in the Middle East and there is it
getting better or worse? So, um,

531
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,360
we've done a pretty good job of disrupting
isis from its stronghold in Syria and

532
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:52,220
northern Iraq, as you all know.
Um, there's no longer a caliphate,

533
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:57,430
although there are pockets of Isis in
northern Iraq and obviously still in Syria

534
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,670
now what the press is not
telling you very much.

535
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,360
I think there's just been
little glimpses of it.

536
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,270
This is the big insight right here.

537
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,130
A lot of the leadership that hasn't been
killed in counterterrorism operations

538
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,720
is in Libya.

539
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:16,970
I think Libya is going to be the next
Afghanistan in terms of a base of

540
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:19,220
operations.
Um,

541
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,450
and so I think because
Libya is essentially, uh,

542
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,650
hardly functioning country, it's
a, it's Olivia as you can tell is,

543
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,650
is a mass.
There is a government,

544
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:35,390
but the government has very little
control over what happens all over Libya.

545
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,890
And so things are going
haywire in the country,

546
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:43,070
which is why you have people smugglers
and crime syndicates sending migrants

547
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:45,840
across the Mediterranean into Europe.

548
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,290
And now I think that the more
that terrorism leadership
sets up base in Libya,

549
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:57,230
the more you're going to see a marriage
of terrorism and the human smuggling

550
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:58,021
trade,

551
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:02,940
which is very lucrative in terms of
lining their pockets and helping them,

552
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,770
um, kind of re constituent,
uh, recalibrate,

553
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,720
reconstitute themselves.
And so I'd say heads heads up on Libya.

554
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,880
You mentioned earlier
getting the motivation behind
why individuals are doing

555
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:24,620
what they're doing. And one of them struck
me was to eliminate the competition.

556
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,330
Yes. Um, what kind of terrorist
competition is dinner?

557
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,470
Yeah. I let you know. This
is interesting actually.

558
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,700
So it took me a long while to figure
this out, but there were a lot of,

559
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,200
a lot of sources who pretended
like they were all like,

560
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,410
oh yeah, CIA, we're friends, we're good.
We're going to work together. When in a,

561
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,050
in effect, they had never intended
to leave terrorism behind.

562
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,620
They just wanted to take out the other
guy in the block so they could be in

563
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:56,200
charge.
So it's like a double agent,

564
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:59,860
but not in order to work
against CIA necessarily,

565
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:04,510
but a double agent to establish
their power on the street.

566
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,170
So they'd be like, Hey, that guy over
there, he's a really bad terrorist.

567
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,690
His name is so and so.
This is his phone number.

568
00:37:10,691 --> 00:37:14,080
This is make and model of his car and
this is the location of his safe house.

569
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,400
Next thing you know, ca or not, Eh,

570
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,480
military troops, uh, take out
that guy. Next thing you know,

571
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,470
we find out a year later we took out
the competition then that that guy took

572
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:31,390
over as head Honcho and was playing us.
Essentially.

573
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,910
That happened more often
than we'd like to admit.

574
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,040
Here's my Herdman.
Uh,

575
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,610
so imagine that there are many
sources who are coming to you,

576
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,900
but in my case that you're
reaching out. Like how do you, uh,

577
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,710
how are you finding the people that are
the best sources and then how do you

578
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,510
train them into sources of names?

579
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,670
It's tricky because so much of that
I'm not allowed to talk about. Um,

580
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,980
I can say,
cause this was cleared for my buck.

581
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,390
People think it's so hard
to recruit sources. Um,

582
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,230
and there's certain things
and intelligence like it's
hard to recruit a North

583
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,350
Korean cause it's hard to find them.
It's um, it's hard to recruit, uh,

584
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,710
Putin's inner circle for obvious reasons.

585
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,940
It's not hard to recruit
in the Middle East,

586
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:22,890
especially for counterterrorism
operations. It's not hard
to collect information.

587
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,390
What is really hard as
collecting good information.

588
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,560
Most of what we get as
fabrications or lies.

589
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:36,100
And so the better we are at vetting
the information and finding the golden

590
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:40,740
nuggets, the better. You know, that's,
that's the hard part of the job. And,

591
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,840
and recruiting people who are being truly
recruited versus using you to take out

592
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:50,710
the competition. That's also the
hard part. It's like a half answer.

593
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:51,544
How do you like that one?

594
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,870
Um, you were talking a little bit about
developing those instincts for spotting

595
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:01,150
things that you feel are off.
Um,

596
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:04,690
we have programs running here are Rhonda
becoming more aware of your unconscious

597
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:07,420
biases and how those
can be really damaging.

598
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:10,600
It's not something that you may cut
a potentially really damaging news.

599
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:11,590
They're not based,

600
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,060
they're based in unconscious bias rather
than it's kind of back. So I'm curious,

601
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,030
I'm not, as we were developing
those instincts that,

602
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,710
how did you differentiate between what
might be bias on the basis of how we're

603
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:25,380
socialized,
you know,

604
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,750
broadly and where you found that your
instincts were really right and how you,

605
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,410
how you sort of be those determined?

606
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,000
Gosh. Oh, that's a good question. I mean,

607
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:43,760
was it in terms of understanding my own
biases are understanding theirs. Mine.

608
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,470
Okay. Um, yeah,

609
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,820
because we all bring biases to
the job. Absolutely. All of us.

610
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:56,440
And I think it's impossible to
completely like, Eh, we're human beings.

611
00:39:56,441 --> 00:40:00,280
We're flawed. Um, but I think
the extent to which you can

612
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,320
call it out and I,

613
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:08,260
I think there's some level of emotional
intelligence involved in that, you know,

614
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:12,270
and being aware of yourself, some
people just aren't aware. Um, and,

615
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,280
and that's where a dialogue and debate
with others can be helpful to you,

616
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:22,150
you know, healthy dialogue to help us each
understand our and things. So, I mean,

617
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:26,800
I had to be,
if I'm going to deal with this guy,

618
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,110
you know, my natural, actually
this is funny, this is not,

619
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,960
I would say my natural
inclination was to not trust,

620
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:38,980
but that's actually a good
thing in intelligence. Um,
so in that case it worked,

621
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:42,400
but in, in real life, outside of
intelligence, not trusting anyone as,

622
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:45,670
as a hard way to live her life. But I
don't know if that answers your question.

623
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,070
You're gonna make me think
about that for a while,

624
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,170
not sticking around.

625
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,190
And that's are kind of internally
focused that he really good at.

626
00:41:02,881 --> 00:41:05,500
What are you doing,
gutting it out there?

627
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,250
Any ways or do you have any thoughts
about ways to kind of more directly

628
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:10,560
addressed some of the obstacles
that you faced in your career?

629
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,960
Great question.
One of the things that I did,

630
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,370
because I had to find ways to show that
expertise. So you're like, yeah, okay,

631
00:41:19,371 --> 00:41:23,810
become really good at what you
do and then what? And so, uh,

632
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:30,310
for a long period of time in the CIA
I was really jealous of a lot of my

633
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:35,300
classmates that getting
sent to really nice places.

634
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,610
I read it now,
I'm like,

635
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,370
I can't tell you where they
were eating great food and

636
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,150
they were classical architecture and
nobody's shooting at though. And um,

637
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,410
my husband and I felt like we kept
getting the shaft because, okay,

638
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:59,360
one more zone to war zones,
but really 10 years of that and um,

639
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,460
we kept doing the jobs
no one else wanted to do.

640
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:08,480
And part of that was okay,
we were Airbus. Okay.

641
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:11,180
There's a reason why you keep getting
sent to these places because that's where

642
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:13,760
a lot of the conflict is going
on in this moment of time.

643
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,260
It took me looking back at my CIA career
to realize by taking the jobs no one

644
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,580
else wanted to do,

645
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,200
we had developed this level of terrorism
expertise that I would sit with my

646
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:34,271
classmates back at CIA headquarters when
I was on on a TDY and they would listen

647
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:38,780
to my story stories if my meetings
with terrorists and be like,

648
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,310
I have nothing to relate to that
I've never done anything like that.

649
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,940
I realize by getting shaft and getting
shafted over and over again was actually

650
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:50,930
a career builder.

651
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:56,240
And so I also realized that by taking a
couple of the projects that no one else

652
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,660
wanted to do, jasmine and I talked
about this last night a little bit.

653
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,360
She did something similar.
Um,

654
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:08,120
and sometimes you don't know somebody has
given you like the project no one else

655
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,980
wants.
Um,

656
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,370
there were a couple of occasions
when I did that and I said like,

657
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,090
I kind of show my skills and
so I found some ways to like,

658
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:20,150
do these projects tend to be
unique and creative and different.

659
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:25,070
And when I actually handed it back
to the manager, they were like, well,

660
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:30,260
what is that? You actually did? You did
do the project. I'm like, well yeah,

661
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:32,410
you gave it to me. I did it. Um,

662
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,470
so there's some thing about doing the
things others don't want and knocking the

663
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:41,000
ball out of the park. I don't
know. There's something to
be said in that strategy.

664
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,400
I know that's not the only strategy,
but it worked.

665
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,770
That's one strategy that worked for me.

666
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,480
So you're talk, uh,
you mentioned that, um,

667
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:54,880
as a female and he smiled and
people were thinking that.

668
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:01,150
And I'm especially in
Washington DC as long as all,

669
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,070
and sometimes you only use the, with
people briefly. So how was your strategy?

670
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,090
Right,
the worst question,

671
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,970
I think it's really impossible to do.

672
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:16,150
If you have a really short
interaction with someone,

673
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,080
they're probably going to still walk
away from you after a five minute meeting

674
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:24,110
or a two minute meeting or an
introduction thinking when they walked in.

675
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:27,770
So I think in order to change people's
minds, you have to have some time.

676
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:31,650
You have to have some history
with them. Um, you know,

677
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:34,640
I figured out how to make it work and
there's debriefings cause it had to happen

678
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,480
really, really quickly, but that was a
very artificial compressed period of time.

679
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,970
Like we just had to get in that
room and get down to business.

680
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,910
But that was unusual.
I think that often

681
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,590
I'm not a person that feels comfortable
being like, yeah, I'm smart.

682
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,573
Yeah,

683
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,620
I,
I don't,

684
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,460
I'm not one of those people that feels
comfortable like trying to self promote.

685
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:57,510
I don't like self promotion,

686
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:02,100
but I think in some cases you have to
find some subtle way to do that that might

687
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:07,101
be against your nature
in order to survive.

688
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,660
Hi. It's very nice. It
is the CIA, CIA today.

689
00:45:16,661 --> 00:45:20,860
Is it your friend and know when you
joined or did it change in there?

690
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:25,950
I did, I don't know for sure. Cause
I, um, when you leave the CIA,

691
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,140
you can only take,

692
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,560
stay in touch with people who reach out
to you because you don't want to blow

693
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:34,950
their cover. And so it's very
tricky about who you talk to.

694
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:37,380
And so it's not like I'm
still in touch with everyone.

695
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:42,381
So I am surmising that privately nothing
has changed just because I've talked.

696
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,900
Was that, does that diplomatic enough? Um,

697
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,580
just because I talked to women and men
who served like in the 1980s and I hear

698
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:58,581
the same stories and so nothing's changed
since 1982 it probably hasn't changed

699
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:03,270
in the six years since I left agency.

700
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,560
And 2003 the war was stolen.
Two allies,

701
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:15,960
public art on the basis of
information about by us.

702
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:17,743
Yes.

703
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,100
To what extent did you feel pressured to
develop information that's important to

704
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:28,190
be the point of view and it's,
we're expanded your calendar that,

705
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,700
yes. So, um,

706
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,600
we were there when that always happening
because we were just baby intelligence

707
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:37,624
officers.

708
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:42,990
And so there was a efforts to try to
find this elusive information that just

709
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,470
didn't exist. Um, you just have,

710
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:53,970
there was a situation when my husband's
boss changed a report to reflect

711
00:46:56,471 --> 00:47:01,471
something that didn't actually happen
in the meeting and he stood up and said

712
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:04,060
that's not what happened in the meeting.

713
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,570
And that information was of
such a consequential nature.

714
00:47:07,571 --> 00:47:11,290
It was going to end up in front of
the president in the White House.

715
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,760
My husband basically got nixed on his
annual performance because he stood up to

716
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:21,940
his boss and said that
that never happened.

717
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,240
So when I say the CIA is a
hostile work environment,

718
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:26,890
that's the kind of
thing I'm talking about.

719
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:31,810
So you have a decision like are you going
to do the right thing if it means that

720
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:36,430
your setback in your career, um, or
are you just going to tow the line?

721
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,710
I wouldn't, but just to be
fair, that guy was very unusual.

722
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,440
I hope to never work with
someone like that. Again,

723
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,840
I didn't see that in other places.

724
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:50,260
I just saw that with that particular
individual. A lot of fabrication going on.

725
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,190
But it's a, it's a very,
I wish that on no one,

726
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:59,020
cause that's such a hard place to
such an awful place to be really.

727
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,800
Does that answer your question?
Yeah,

728
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,580
right. Another question. Uh, just keeping
your husband, it's obviously you, the CIO,

729
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,670
yours.
Um,

730
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,620
we see movies all the time
and I'm sure you know,

731
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:20,560
movies like we watch hacking and nobody
is this like on bypassing the fingers

732
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:21,620
right hand.
That's cool.

733
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,290
Eyes Roll back.
Yeah.

734
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,200
Um,
how often,

735
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:29,490
how true is it in your life where you
weren't allowed to tell your extended

736
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:33,410
family what you actually did it or where
you were, what like did where you, uh,

737
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,970
were you,
did you have a cover story for back home?

738
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,820
Okay. So, um, it was
really interesting. So it,

739
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:42,800
as we're going through that CII
recruitment process, the recruiter said,

740
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:47,450
be careful who you tell about the process
you're going through right now because

741
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:48,284
you can't,

742
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,040
you can't tell your 50 friends that you're
applying to the CIA and you're going

743
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:56,480
through this process and then
suddenly, er, no, I'm just kidding.

744
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,370
Then they also, once we got
into this day and we got hired,

745
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:07,090
you are allowed to tell your immediate
family but only if you think they can

746
00:49:07,101 --> 00:49:10,370
handle it. Um, and so
there are some people,

747
00:49:10,371 --> 00:49:13,490
like I had a colleague in Baghdad whose
family thought she was working on her

748
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:15,710
phd in the United States.

749
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,490
They had no idea she worked
for CIA government. I'm like,

750
00:49:19,491 --> 00:49:22,520
how do you keep that cover
story writing were like eight,

751
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:25,010
nine hour time difference.
How do you to that?

752
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,670
I don't think she hardly ever
talked to her family. Um,

753
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,780
there were people who is like,
yeah,

754
00:49:29,781 --> 00:49:33,140
if I tell my mom she's going
to shout it from the rooftops,

755
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,890
she seemed like my is so awesome.
She works for the CIA.

756
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,390
Or there's somebody who's like,

757
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:40,880
my dad's going to be watching the evening
news every night thinking he's going

758
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:43,460
to see my face on there
and he can't handle it.

759
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:48,490
So you have to make this a c because
they now have to protect your cover story

760
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:54,041
when you tell them and they have to do
it conveniently convincingly for you.

761
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,750
And if you pick up the phone
and you call him and they say,

762
00:49:56,751 --> 00:49:59,930
how are things at the CIA,
they blown your cover.

763
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,250
So you have to be absolutely certain
that the few people that you do tall

764
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,660
understand that your life
is on the line and they,

765
00:50:08,661 --> 00:50:11,570
they've got to protect you.
Um,

766
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,720
my husband's family because
he's originally from Egypt,

767
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,940
were not American citizens and so we
never told them because we didn't want to

768
00:50:19,941 --> 00:50:23,090
put them in danger.
Um,

769
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,930
I think towards the end of
our career before they passed,

770
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,650
I think they suspected that
something else was going on. And I,

771
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,820
and I think they were proud of my husband,
which makes them feel good now,

772
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:37,220
but he was never actually
able to tell them.

773
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,670
I think at one point he said to his
dad like a month before he passed away,

774
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,870
you know,
dad,

775
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:47,480
I've been doing counter terrorism
work and he goes, I know,

776
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:51,080
just shake his head like that. And
so I think you've figured it out. But

777
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:56,250
yeah, an interesting question.

778
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:01,430
Um, there is fun. Rather
they read return on it.

779
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,470
If they can make a magic
wand and have a good night

780
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,720
to create this caliphate,

781
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,750
which they thought they were creating
and Syria where they could control this

782
00:51:11,881 --> 00:51:16,150
whole new, um, uh, Ma, uh,

783
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,460
the body of believers,

784
00:51:17,461 --> 00:51:22,461
this political religious state firmly
grounded on their interpretation of Sharia

785
00:51:25,441 --> 00:51:30,310
law. And of course the guys that are
terrorists really want this to be,

786
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:30,481
you know,

787
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:34,170
the woman doesn't leave the home uncovered
and the men's are men are warriors

788
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:38,650
and you give people a choice to
convert to Islam or die like, so their,

789
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:42,810
their interpretation of Islam
is what you see on the TV.

790
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:46,170
And in their perfect world there,
their idea of

791
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,960
perfection is this,
this caliphate really.

792
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,201
Yeah. And, and,

793
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:58,200
and the caliphate then being used to then
spread Islam to the rest of the world

794
00:51:58,201 --> 00:52:03,120
and specifically their interpretation of
Islam and, and, and, uh, bringing that,

795
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,360
uh,
either by missionary efforts or force.

796
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,020
So would you say that in some
ways they're idealists? Yes,

797
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,150
absolutely.

798
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,220
I have a question about what is the
reason make you leave CIA and it was New

799
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,280
York cons. Uh, how do your
things, your cons, um,

800
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,230
commuter life compare
when was snowing there?

801
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:31,763
Um,

802
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:37,100
so after 10 years of war
zones and working weekends,

803
00:52:37,891 --> 00:52:39,030
working holidays,

804
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:45,080
I'm not seeing your family except maybe
once a year for a couple of weeks being

805
00:52:47,071 --> 00:52:48,000
undercover,

806
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:51,390
working in places where you're constantly
looking for hostile surveillance.

807
00:52:51,391 --> 00:52:54,940
Cause we were in places where there were
car jackings and kidnappings and Alcott

808
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,711
it was running around.

809
00:52:55,711 --> 00:53:00,690
So it was like this really intense
and hard way to live. We're,

810
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:02,640
Joseph and I are constantly looking at,

811
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:06,810
somebody's got an AK 47
or an RPG aimed at us.

812
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,330
You just, it's not
sustainable. That lifestyle.

813
00:53:12,331 --> 00:53:13,890
And we work saw stud.

814
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,560
And I'm also at the same time I felt this
spiritual calling to write this book.

815
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:23,640
And I knew that in order to do,
to help inspire others with my story,

816
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:26,220
I had to do it in true
name versus pseudonym,

817
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:30,540
which meant I'd have to leave the CIA and
I'd have to request permission to drop

818
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:35,400
cover, which is a big deal and
they don't have to do it. So,

819
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:39,780
um, after 10 years we left and I
actually started writing this book, um,

820
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,140
breaking cover when I was a
year before I left the agency.

821
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,670
And now I feel so free.

822
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:53,780
Nobody's trying to shoot me most of the
time anyway, right? Like, um, I, I, yeah,

823
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:57,860
I in the United States is
still a dangerous place and
all, but it's, it's a, it's,

824
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:02,330
it's very different than what our
former lives where the fact that,

825
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:07,340
um, that I can be sharing these
stories with you gives me intense,

826
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:11,120
a lot of joy to share my
stories and inspire others.

827
00:54:11,121 --> 00:54:13,460
And so I could not be
happier at the moment.

828
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,670
It was very public events,
uh,

829
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:20,650
affect your ability to build trust
with their contacts then, uh,

830
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,160
figure don't believe
you didn't do your job.

831
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,770
Um,
public events like speaking events,

832
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,880
very public events like
Benghazi and then use,

833
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,850
oh, sorry, sorry. Um, how
do those events affect you,

834
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,380
your ability to, uh, to like
develop that trust you need.

835
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,860
Got It. You know, it's really hard
to tell your sources these days.

836
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,220
Trust me,
your name will never get leaked.

837
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,940
I think there's just been so many leaks,

838
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:52,740
so much classified information has
come out and it's made our jobs.

839
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,610
I can tell you every time there was a
leak and we were still working at the CIA,

840
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,290
we had all kinds of sources
quit left and right because I'm,

841
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,520
once those names were late,
people were, was lives.

842
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:07,530
They either had to get out of
dodge or they were killed. Um,

843
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:12,360
so it is very hard these days to recruit
new sources because we can't really,

844
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:17,430
I can do everything I can to protect
you, but I can't help who, you know,

845
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:20,850
what other people do. So it's hard. Yeah.

846
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,540
So let me get this picture of
the CIA as a bureaucratic boy,

847
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:32,130
number three guy down or eat rigorous
in their determination of what we've

848
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:36,700
always done it this way.
Yeah. And at the same time,

849
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,290
the tourist organization or something
like the Westboro Baptist Church speaks

850
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:43,080
copy up. Are there any upsides? I mean,

851
00:55:43,081 --> 00:55:47,050
this doesn't look like a recipe for any
sort of improvement you do long term.

852
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:53,320
Yeah. Um, I think that this, the CIA,

853
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,200
there are a lot of,

854
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,390
there are a lot of good people at the
CIA that I succeed and protect us every

855
00:55:58,391 --> 00:56:03,391
single day despite this
bureaucratic organization
that is still living like it's

856
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:06,820
1960. Um, I, I,

857
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,880
we kind of need some serious strategic
and visionary leadership to change that.

858
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:16,690
I don't see that happening.
I really don't. I, I'm, I'm
a realist in that regard.

859
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,980
Usually I'm an optimist,

860
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:21,640
but I've been in long enough to realize
it's probably not going to happen. Um,

861
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:25,300
but I think that the world changed so
much and we're still pretending like we're

862
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:28,960
in a cold war and we haven't adjusted
the way that we carried out operations to

863
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:30,550
the new realities that we're dealing with.

864
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:35,110
So I think that we're not doing as
good a job. America deserves better.

865
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:39,430
Um, I don't know how to get us
there, but even having these talks,

866
00:56:39,431 --> 00:56:42,940
I hope in some way will influence some
people to join who are going to be

867
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:46,540
visionary people in the future and maybe
bring some something new and fresh to

868
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,374
the CIA.

869
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,570
What are your thoughts on Edward
Snowden's actions and what you reveal?

870
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:53,760
Um,

871
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,760
he put a lot of people
and sources and in danger.

872
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:03,720
So I don't have a very
high opinion of Mr Snowden.

873
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:04,680
Let's just put it that

874
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,390
a lot of the programs that he,
uh,

875
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:13,740
he talked about were not secret secret
programs in the sense that they weren't

876
00:57:13,741 --> 00:57:16,960
this, um, they were, um,

877
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,470
coordinated amongst all of the

878
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:25,050
entities in Washington that have
oversight over intelligence.

879
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:28,680
So it wasn't like a rogue, they
weren't rogue programs in that regard.

880
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,680
The way that the media
makes it sound does this,

881
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,860
they were the NSA and
its own rogue program,

882
00:57:34,861 --> 00:57:37,860
but you have congressional oversight
and you have this oversight and that

883
00:57:37,861 --> 00:57:42,270
oversight. So they were,
um, these programs were,

884
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,520
uh, as I understand it,
properly coordinated, but
he relieves so much other,

885
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:52,550
he really so much information that was
so damaging to our relationships with our

886
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:56,760
allies abroad.
You mean almost all week.

887
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:01,170
All of our ambassadors had
to have meetings after that
where they basically were

888
00:58:01,171 --> 00:58:04,230
told by the, um, the president or
minister of Interior that country. Like,

889
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:07,110
we can't trust you people.
You guys can't keep anything a secret,

890
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,240
and so we're not going to
tell you secrets anymore.

891
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,870
So our counter terrorism fight
us, suffered our, our, um,

892
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:18,210
ability to work with our foreign powers
on law enforcement and migration issues

893
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:19,550
has suffered a great deal because right.

894
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,410
That stuff,

895
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:26,640
is there any sense of responsibility
for if we weren't spying on Americans?

896
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:32,430
Um, then you get into the details
of the, is it, is it spying?

897
00:58:32,431 --> 00:58:35,380
It's metadata collection.
Then how are you using it and all of that

898
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,490
stuff.
Um,

899
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,350
yeah, I mean, cause, uh, then
then the question would be, um,

900
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:47,900
to the oversight committees. You thought
that was okay, but now we're telling you,

901
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,210
or if you disagree with that,

902
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:54,710
then there's a debate about should we
be doing this or not? Yeah. I mean,

903
00:58:54,711 --> 00:58:55,700
this was a delight.

904
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:58,400
Thank you for coming here and
sharing your experience with us.

905
00:58:58,401 --> 00:58:59,630
We really appreciate it.
Thank you.
