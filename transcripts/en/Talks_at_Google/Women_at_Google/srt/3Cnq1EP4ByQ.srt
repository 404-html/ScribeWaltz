1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,840
All right.
Good afternoon yogurts and Googlers.

2
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:12,120
I'm delighted to welcome
to the Google campus,

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,620
one of the most celebrated
names in Bollywood today.
She'll pass shatty Chondra.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,950
She'll bus an actress,
producer, former model.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,080
She's the winner of the
British reality TV show,

6
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:33,081
celebrity big brother five and has been
nominated for four film fair awards and

7
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:38,630
all the year she's delighted us with
her acting and dancing and mostly Hindi

8
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:42,170
movies, but also Tamil, Telugu
and Canada. But more importantly,

9
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:47,171
she has this passion for the auto wellness
and how we can transform ourselves

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,620
inside out through modalities like yoga,
meditation,

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,390
or good nutrition, which is one of the
main topics she wants to share with us.

12
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,590
And if you get lucky, she might actually
lead us through a short yoga practice.

13
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,370
So please help me with a Bollywood style.
Welcome to [inaudible].

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,640
She'll fuck.

15
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,263
Wow.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,040
What an amazing introduction and
from the Yogi himself ameliorated.

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,203
Thank you so much.

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,190
Thank you.
And I'm not saying welcome Shilpa.

19
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,170
Wow.
I want to Google.

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,973
This is Bob

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,110
with the yoga practice
and Googlers called Yoga.

22
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,200
I know yo gloves. How wonderful is
that? So all of you actually do yoga.

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,980
That's terrible.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,570
Well guys, let's, let's
hope we can change that.

25
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,210
So if I do come in next time,

26
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:50,890
let's see more people saying
yes to that confidently.

27
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,240
Yeah,

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,750
no, we have a pretty active program
with the several hundred classes a week,

29
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:57,760
just in the San Francisco Bay area alone.

30
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,320
We have 50 classes every week and they're
pretty packed. But on your channel,

31
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:05,590
one of your signature
[inaudible] master hall, right?

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,030
We've got to make everyone do that.

33
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:10,480
So can you demonstrate it once and then
I'll get the whole audience with Joe in

34
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,980
a couple of times?
What do you say?

35
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,340
So swaths through a whole muster all
means stay healthy and just throw caution

36
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:19,930
to the wind and just be happy.

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,220
So that truly is my mantra in life.
Uh,

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,430
stay happy and stay busts. So
I do it like this, so I slow.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,530
All right, let's do it with a
couple of times. Do it again.

40
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,300
One more time. A little louder.
Slas with the Ham hocks throw.

41
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,900
Thank you. Nobody. You can
see my biceps, but yeah.

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,510
So I understand you're here for a
woman's empowerment conference. Yes.

43
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,070
How did that go? And, uh,

44
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,740
what is your vision for
empowering women around the world?

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,680
Oh my God. Um, yeah, that went
really well. I've, I've just still,

46
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,810
I mean we're close to, you know,
women's Day on the 8th of March.

47
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,870
I thought this was a great opportunity
and when I was offered it, I said, great,

48
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,410
I'll tour around the U S and.
M.

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,720
More importantly I think,
um,

50
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,150
since I've just started this wellness
series are through digital media,

51
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,500
I just star,

52
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,150
I just thought this would
be a great opportunity also
to come and visit you guys,

53
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,180
learn from you and help.

54
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,530
I'd rather get help from you
to help me help the world.

55
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,570
And, uh, you know, I've been
acting for the last 20 years,

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,740
but this truly is my colleague.

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,980
I really believe that I became an actor
and I became someone who was famous so

58
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,880
that I could be of some
use in this sphere.

59
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,400
And, um, I, for me, health
is truly my passion.

60
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,820
I have suffered with cervical spondylosis
as seen people who are not near and

61
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,930
dear to me suffer with cancer.
And um,

62
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,970
I've been able to change
my life through yoga,

63
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,290
through meditation or
through good eating habits,

64
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,330
which I call the lifestyle modification.

65
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,630
I never use the word Diet because
I think it's just so vulgar.

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,700
Vulgarized that word Diet that the minute
you say diet, people are put off by it.

67
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,030
They think it's going to be bland food.
It's not going to be tasty.

68
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,130
It's going to be sodium, less oil lists.

69
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,760
So I said, how do I,
how do I debunk these,

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,020
these meats with food health?
And um,

71
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,930
there are, there is a lot of
information on Google. Great.

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,510
I just thought I'd make,

73
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,630
make it easier to China to kind of make
it a one stop shop for people or who

74
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:01,420
really can't afford a gym,
don't have the time to work out,

75
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,020
don't know what to cook
for their children. Um,

76
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,710
and I just think that women especially
are already in such an empowered

77
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:16,060
position. You know, since we're
talking about empowerment,

78
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,450
I thought to just give them the knowledge
of and empower them with the knowledge

79
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,890
of health,
uh,

80
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,130
which I think is something that is
far more powerful than the feminists.

81
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:33,610
Sort of empowering, you know, um,

82
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,850
I thought through my channel I'd be able
to channelize a bit of my knowledge to

83
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,540
the experts that I have on my channel
to be able to empower people with the

84
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:50,490
importance of health. How
important it is to breed. Yeah.

85
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,770
Which we're not doing
in this time and age.

86
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:58,771
We're so busy running after our goals
up or not breathing or forget doing

87
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,530
primas. How many of you actually sit
down and take a breath of fresh air?

88
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,430
Very few. Yeah, you do. Yes. You know,
I'm not directing the question to you,

89
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,580
but none of us sit down
and just inhale and exhale.

90
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,350
We don't do that. You know, our chest is
an opening. Okay. Teach them right now.

91
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,270
Let's change that. How do
you do it? Nope. Just leave.

92
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,250
Just open up, you know,

93
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,280
positivity

94
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,970
or negativity. Trust
me, there's lots of it.

95
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,200
Okay.
And when you're inhaling and exhaling,

96
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,630
you're not doing it just
from your chest in your body.

97
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:48,860
You're doing it from your mind.

98
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,240
So it's your entire mind and
soul that is getting purified.

99
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:55,850
You know,

100
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,850
oxygen is reaching your lungs and it's
purifying your body and your mind.

101
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,090
It opens up your mind and all
the space that you guys are in.

102
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,650
Trust me, it's going to help you a lot.
You need your mind. You're like Yolo,

103
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:15,170
mind workers.
And uh,

104
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,750
I just think that small little things
like that. Breathing, chewing food,

105
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,970
chewing food. How many of us to our food
study got to chew our food 32 times.

106
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,380
Each muscle has to be true 32 times as
why you would do that. Because that's,

107
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:34,970
that's the reason beginning
given 32 teens, none of us do it.

108
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,330
We just,
which has got Bullitt,

109
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,050
we've started gobbling off food.
We've stopped.

110
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:45,140
We don't even concentrate
on what we eating.

111
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,820
How many of you look at your food with
gratitude and see, oh my God, wow,

112
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,410
this is going into my body.
None of us do it. You do it.

113
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,180
That's why you look so big in the pink
of health. He looks well nourished. Yeah.

114
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,610
So we know you don't, we just have
stopped living. We, we're just living,

115
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,250
we've been not enjoying our life.
And I just think that,

116
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,990
you know,
before it gets too late,

117
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,620
because I've lost a few
people that I love very dirty,

118
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,320
all to bad health.

119
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,100
And I just felt that it was important for
me to take this off as a cause. I mean,

120
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,600
we, you know, I've worked
with HIV patients and uh,

121
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,220
I've done something and you know, in that
sphere of, of health and I'm like, Gosh,

122
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:34,490
what if we could actually just rewind.

123
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,700
I live better lives,
you know,

124
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,440
rather than reach a point of no return.
We own to,

125
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,210
you know, vitamin injections. Today
we're all d three deficient. Most of us,

126
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,410
80% of us are d three deficient because
we don't want to stand out in the sun.

127
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,000
So I'm like, um, small little things.

128
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:02,001
I just think I want to bring focus to
the old way of living and I want to do

129
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,570
that through this jungle.

130
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,600
And it really comes out of out of
my heart and less from my mind,

131
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,670
and I've said this before,

132
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:16,200
I just saw the world is going digital
and I thought let me do it this way

133
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,200
because it'll reach out to
more people are really happy.

134
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,820
Then the day we launched we,
we touched all the nearly 1.5 views,

135
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,880
yes million views and it was a huge
compliment and also reassuring that people

136
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,030
are interested in health.

137
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,490
I don't know if they just want
her to see shows by Shanti Lycra,

138
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,730
but that couldn't have been the only
reason. So we have a few subscribers now.

139
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,380
We've touched nearly 67 k

140
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,270
so health, wellness and how to
uh, one of the popular category,

141
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,470
all the questions he doesn't know.

142
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,740
But one of the accomplishments we are
very proud of among everything else is

143
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:51,810
that you choose to be
what we call a youtuber.

144
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,650
You've chosen the platform that is
more than a billion people coming and

145
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:57,870
watching some video the other every month.
Yeah.

146
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,300
So in fact the audience
may not have seen it.

147
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,620
Can we roll a video just to show everyone
a rules paste of what she'll pass

148
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,000
channel looks like on Youtube.

149
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,323
Hello everyone.

150
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm here to tell you why I'm here
and what this channel is all about.

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,160
Out of the various things
that I've done in life.

152
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,290
The reason to start this journal is to
bring about an awareness for what I value

153
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,420
the most life.

154
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,690
How many of us do we really value life?

155
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,540
Why is the quality of
our health deteriorating?

156
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,040
Why do we have to stay dependent
on artificial aids like medication,

157
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,750
vitamin injections and succumb
to deficiencies, diseases,

158
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,030
deteriorating immunity and jeans?

159
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,370
The answers to all these questions
like in one important fact,

160
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,140
our constant neglect,
an apathy towards our own health.

161
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,670
The target of this channel is to address
both weight as well as health issues.

162
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,930
Those who cannot afford
a gym or nutritionists or
don't have the time for the

163
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:12,931
regime will be introduced to a panel
of experts in various fields of health

164
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,620
along with my limited knowledge
and experience to make the change.

165
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,160
Please subscribe to the shield bash
at each channel, what you will find.

166
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,270
Quick healthy and tasty
food recipes made by me.

167
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,920
Yoga Asanas,

168
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,160
simple fitness routines and challenges
along the way with weight loss targets.

169
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,600
Remember, there is no better time
than now to start living healthy.

170
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,300
Maintaining your weight
and keeping fit is an art.

171
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,460
And the artists keep it simple.
We'll show you how.

172
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,290
One last thing [inaudible] unless throat.

173
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,310
I didn't know they were going
to play that. Gosh, I give
the hood speed on my own.

174
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:01,730
I, if I knew they were
going to have to speak. So

175
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,240
repetition is good.
So I have two questions.

176
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:09,130
Where you up first is how the experience
with Youtube and then secondly you've

177
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:12,110
got one on some of the smartest
youtube folks sitting right here.

178
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,420
Do you have any ask for them?
Yes.

179
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,220
Yeah,
I want to ask them to help me.

180
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,133
Um,

181
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,900
obviously I'd love to hear from you how
I could popularize this and I realize

182
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:27,661
why.

183
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:31,740
I think I'm one of the first celebrities
are to be a youtuber because it takes

184
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:35,640
so long, it takes so much time. You know,

185
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:40,470
we're such a pampered lot and also
spoiled in the way that we paid for every

186
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,320
minute. And this is something
that I'm doing free and, and I'm,

187
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,770
I'm seeing this song
with a lot of humility.

188
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:52,430
So I realize when I embarked on this
venture or this journey that I taught,

189
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,510
you know, I just shoot and I'll
just start putting up stuff.

190
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,070
But it wasn't that easy.
There was, you know,

191
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,380
there was work going into
what we supposed to shoot,

192
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:09,381
what we supposed to actually put out or
targeting all the important questions or

193
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,720
as a Lima and what is it that, you
know, how do we start off? How do we,

194
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,470
you don't keep that interest going.

195
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,600
What is the first thing that
would catch people's eyes and uh,

196
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,720
or imagination,
how do we get them interested in health?

197
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,220
It was so much homework and
then the hours of shooting,

198
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,760
eight hours of, of doing yoga. Yeah.

199
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,140
Eight hours every shoot of
doing, you know, six hours.

200
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:43,170
I couldn't do beyond that because I
started cramping. Yeah. And you know,

201
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:46,740
when you do yoga you can't eat.
So I was on,

202
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,550
I was just sipping on
liquids and you know, fruit.

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So I shoots would begin at like nine in
the morning and I'd have to keep light.

204
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,290
So you fully enlightened by evening? No.
So I understand what the beauty of it is.

205
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,580
I discovered,

206
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,230
I discovered so much through that
journey because I mean when you do yoga,

207
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:10,080
you don't do it beyond an hour,
but at the shoot,

208
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,220
because I obviously wanted to,
you know,

209
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,310
do my best and I wanted to do every Asana,

210
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,610
Asana to my optimum best
because I wanted people to,

211
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,860
oh, you know, to,

212
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:27,210
to realize that this is
what you can achieve or,

213
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,640
so I didn't know I had
that kind of strength.

214
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,610
I didn't know that I could actually
stay without food for six hours.

215
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,210
Yeah. And it's, that's the power of yoga.

216
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,330
It truly is mind over body.
Absolutely.

217
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,710
And so do the shoot would,
would go on, I'd be okay.

218
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,770
And soon as the shoot was over I'd
be like, I give me anything to eat.

219
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,490
So that is amazing. And then also the
cooking. So we didn't have a food stylist.

220
00:14:55,491 --> 00:15:00,350
It's youtube. We were really good,
deep goody baseball. So, so be like,

221
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,680
you know, cost cutting. I said we can't
afford me. This is not a normal shoot.

222
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,830
So everything from cutting
the vegetables to euro,

223
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,400
I'm putting it on the plate
and showing it to people.

224
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:14,930
I've done it all my self.
So,

225
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,210
and it was,
and we did nearly like eight,

226
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,440
eight dishes a day because
we wanted a bank before we,

227
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,060
we started rolling. Yeah. And
the minute we had like 60,

228
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,940
70 videos in hand,
that's when I launched it.

229
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,160
But the work has been going on
for the last nine months. So,

230
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:36,800
uh, it was a lot of hard work
and that's when I realized,

231
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,560
and then after you finished it,
I also had to debate.

232
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,220
So every asinine is dubbed by me.

233
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,320
So it was a lot of hard
work. So I realized why no
celebrity wants to do this.

234
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:50,630
I was like,
good gracious God.

235
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,010
So that's great feedback and we'll take
it away and we happy to share some best

236
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:55,910
practices with you.

237
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:59,750
But one suggestion is actually that behind
the scene story you just told me that

238
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,690
it still will make for an interesting
episode because people want to hear that.

239
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,280
Your fans want to hear that.

240
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:08,990
So go back and relive the production.
There's one more video.

241
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Crazy. Um, but what
did you take out of it?

242
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:19,090
I want to know from you because you
are a Yogi yourself and you're very

243
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:19,710
passionate.

244
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,130
Yeah. So my biggest takeaway
is when I was a kid,

245
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:25,350
I ran away to an Ashram
and I had to learn yoga.

246
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,980
And we are primarily taught
by bearded men and orange.

247
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:33,380
It was an esoteric practice
and thanks to now supermodels,

248
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,640
super actresses turned Super Yogi knees.

249
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,310
It's become more accessible
to a larger population in the,

250
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,320
it's got demystified and you frame it in
more contemporary terms and you make it

251
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,650
accessible to a lot of people otherwise
who would not have looked at it.

252
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,720
So I want to thank you for doing it.

253
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,510
You and I want to thank you that,
you know,

254
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:57,860
you're in San Francisco and
you're such a, you know, uh,

255
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,370
diligent follower of yoga and
you're trying to spread the word,

256
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:03,930
which is really wonderful.
So huge round of applause.

257
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,220
Thank you.
[inaudible].

258
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,110
So speaking of one yoga, one question
and then we'll go into a practice mode.

259
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:17,830
Bollywood is not exactly the right
environment for a yoga mindfulness kind of

260
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:20,180
practice.
It's a frenzy,

261
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:23,480
plays things more quickly and there's a
lot of tension and stress and a lot of

262
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:27,110
travel. So how do you reconcile those
two worlds and bring it together?

263
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,390
That's a really interesting question.
Um,

264
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,030
that's why I'm not doing movies right now.
I haven't done for the last

265
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,300
seven years.
I think maybe nine,

266
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,210
but I'm still here.
I'm still at Google and uh,

267
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,980
I've made my choices. I've
been there, done that.

268
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,750
I've been been part of the menu
for the last years. Um, I do,

269
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,190
I do TV.

270
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,400
I choose to do that because I can't
be part of this or erotic timings.

271
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,800
And you know, I have, I have a
four and a half year old baby.

272
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,840
And for me I'm very clear that that is my,
he is my priority,

273
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:14,841
my family is my first priority and
I want to give time to myself and

274
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,480
unapologetically.
And when you're an actor,

275
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,390
it's very hard to do that. So, I mean,

276
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,970
obviously my recognition
comes through movies.

277
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,500
That will always be my claim to
fame. I'm very proud of it. Um,

278
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,320
but if, if I do choose
to do a movie, it'll be,

279
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,080
it'll have to work around my schedule.
We'll have to,

280
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,860
we'll have to be a film that is, you
know, that'll start an end quickly. Also,

281
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:39,960
I think I turned to yoga because of,

282
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,300
of the frenzy life that we lead.
Um,

283
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,340
it's,
it's a very hard life.

284
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:51,230
You're constantly living in
a glass fish bowl and um,

285
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,600
you're getting trolled.
Um,

286
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,090
Instagram determines how famous you are,
how much you liked.

287
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,980
It's, it's, it's really shallow. And

288
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,540
though I have to say in the most hippo
and hypocritical sort of way that I love

289
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:15,110
that. I love it. I really do. Uh,

290
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,670
but the time that I share with myself,
that for me

291
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,580
is just, it's just my time. You know,

292
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,500
it just helps me cope with everything.

293
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,720
So even if I'm told and if
somebody writes about that article,

294
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,430
it's just, that's part of
my life. The morning that I
wake up and I do my plan, I,

295
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:44,280
Emma and I'm in the sun, basking
in its glory and my feet are tired,

296
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,750
you know, my feet is formally
on the grass that is life,

297
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,080
you know, just, just
being able to do that,

298
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:57,081
to breathe the air and to just
live this blessed life for me,

299
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:03,330
that is far more important than all the,
you know,

300
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,900
the craziness of,
of our job.

301
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,230
So I think that's what keeps me grounded.
So a lot of people tell me,

302
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:13,160
how do you manage to be,
you know,

303
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,170
so positive and you're
like smiling. I have, I,

304
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,100
I get upset. I'm only human.
Of course I get upset.

305
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,120
Of course. I, uh, I go
to my times of, you know,

306
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,480
why would they write something like that?
But then I'm out of it.

307
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,650
I don't carry forward. And I think
help yoga has helped me do that.

308
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,780
Yoga has made me

309
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,450
believe that what cannot
be cured has to be endured.

310
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:48,530
And that is once you understand that
all life is so much more easier.

311
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,210
Otherwise being an actor as a really hard
job that'd be telling you to be bought

312
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,960
of it for the last 23 years has been,
I don't know how,

313
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:03,350
I don't know how I've lost it on so long.
We'll do yoga, meditation really, really,

314
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,700
and I, Oh, I'm jet lagged.

315
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,960
I have traveled all the way
from India. It's, and I've,

316
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,060
I've done Orlando and I've come, I've
come here, I've done an event last night.

317
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:16,390
A baby slept like seven hours.
But uh,

318
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:21,280
I got up and I just went out in the open
and I just did a couple of breathing

319
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,870
exercises and I'm good to go.

320
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,780
Fantastic. So would you lead us
through a practice and make us do that?

321
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,010
I got one more thing for you.

322
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,850
We can't have Shilpa shatty here
and not do a little phone card.

323
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,510
That's like

324
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,750
having Michael Jordan
here and we'll slam dunk.

325
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:43,590
So teach us how to do the Tem Cup.
Oh,

326
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,220
can we have some music?
Be Embarrassing

327
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,820
for all of the respect that I bought.

328
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,800
It's only on Youtube. So only a
billion people will be watching it.

329
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,450
Yeah. Lovely. Yeah.

330
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,660
All right, so everybody stand up.
We need music. Yeah, he's actually,

331
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:09,120
he's playing some music for us on this.

332
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,513
Okay.

333
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,823
How do we do this?

334
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,320
Go.

335
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,293
Okay.

336
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,440
This is out of my faucet.
Yeah.

337
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,460
I thought this office
is, that'd be one thing,

338
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,030
but what's occupants?

339
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,530
We did a few more people joining you,
right?

340
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,630
How many people want to dance with you?
If I said it took crime?

341
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,750
Come on to your sites.
Get onto your site and now come up.

342
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,830
Yeah,
sit up.

343
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,990
Yeah. We can all sit in Sukhasana. Okay.
If y'all don't know what that means,

344
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,640
just one leg up. Still Cost
Center. So comedians happiness.

345
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,300
So it's the Austin of happiness.

346
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,530
When you order this us center,

347
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,480
the entire concentration is on your core.

348
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,720
That's where all our strength lies.
Our core.

349
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,323
Oh,

350
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,970
what is [inaudible]? Most
importantly, before we start,

351
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,700
for all those people who don't
know the meaning of [inaudible],

352
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,360
Purana means life.
And Yama

353
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,330
means control.

354
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,240
So the god of death is called
Yama cause he could draw his life.

355
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,490
So Proud Ima actually is the
control of your life force,

356
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,910
which happens to breadth.

357
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,740
So when they see a in your breadth,

358
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,870
you all controlling your mind through that
ad.

359
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,330
When your mind is in control,

360
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,460
there's nothing that you
cannot achieve in life.

361
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,490
So most importantly, while most
blood, we need such fast paced lives,

362
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,810
even if we don't get the
time to do all the Asanas,

363
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,480
if we just get the time to
just do a few bright I umas,

364
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,850
it takes 10 minutes.
I have 10 minutes.

365
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:03,410
Can actually, Elaine can
actually align your mind, body,

366
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:08,270
and soul.
What would life would be so worth living?

367
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:14,050
So we'll start off with the simple
technique of just inhaling and exhaling

368
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,620
through your nose, okay? When you inhale,

369
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,430
let your chest open out,
okay.

370
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,880
Okay.
And Yada withdraw.

371
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,490
They say this is a Moodra of width.
Wisdom.

372
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,520
Your heart and your mind are aligned
on your knees.

373
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,790
Taking a deep breath.

374
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,593
Exhale.

375
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,140
Deep breath in.

376
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,600
Exhale.

377
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,220
One small.

378
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,283
Yeah.

379
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,673
Wonderful.

380
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,050
We started off with unknown Valone where
we taking the bread through the left

381
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:32,790
nostril. Okay, so this is your
hand. Just keep it simple.

382
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,180
Okay. There's a more
complicated way of doing it.

383
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:39,460
I'm going to keep it simple for you guys.
This the index and this thing. Good dog.

384
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,960
Alright. The pommel. Okay,

385
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,220
well you can even do this, right,
so you basically need to control.

386
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,300
Yeah. Tom, on your right nostril.
Breathe in through your left.

387
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,790
I'll do it once. View. Okay,

388
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,520
thanks. See you in through the right.
Then you inhale again through the right.

389
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,570
Exhale through the left.
Inhale through the left.

390
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,300
Thanks. See you in through
the right. Get that.

391
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,680
So this is a new low and
below. We'll start. Okay.

392
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:36,850
We do five of these,
right? Go Pt up, Connie.

393
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,890

it. Do you not do this?

394
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:48,100

doing yoga for so much, so much time.

395
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:53,170
[inaudible] like if you can be in an
Austin now for more than an hour and a

396
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,520
half, you like Judy going to teen
Cindy, you become a true Yogi.

397
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:00,750
If you can be in a post for three hours.
I haven't reached that stage gate,

398
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,940
so I'm not yet quantified Yogi
eight hour shoot again. Yeah, yeah.

399
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,040

love from no, no, no, no.

Ready?

403
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,720

404
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,793
Okay.

405
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,230
Breathe out through the right.

406
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,820
Inhale and exhale long breadth.
There's no hurry.

407
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,800
Breathe in from the same
nostra that you've exhaled.

408
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,300
Breathe out through the left.

409
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,370
Yeah.

414
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,670
Breathe out through the left.

415
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,743
Okay.

416
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,580
Breathe in through the left.

417
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,350
Breathe out through the right.

00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,080
Three dots through the left,

421
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,840
the last one.
Breathe in through the left.

422
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,690

pre out, holy, completely
through the left.

425
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,290
Come into the [inaudible]

426
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,290
eyes closed,

427
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,580
concentrating on the
center of your forehead.

428
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,470
The agenda Chakra.

429
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,720
Throw all your Google as this
is the most important Chakra.

430
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,603
Yeah,

431
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:13,280
that's you concentrate.
And the Sahasrara Chakra,

432
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:15,980
which is right above that,
the center of your head.

433
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,300
Open up your mind.

434
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,893
Just breathe.

435
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,670
Open your eyes slowly

436
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,150
and I'll redo cabal Bahati.

437
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,950
[inaudible] is going to explain the
method of Capalaba, but they do,

438
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,140
cause he's done many El classes.

439
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,210
You'll basically,
yeah,

440
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,310
it's a breathing technique
where you pump your lungs,

441
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:16,190
talk about forcefully exhaling and
lift the inhalation come in naturally.

442
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,580
So one way to get a feel as police,
your right hand on your abdomen,

443
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,400
meaning see it forcefully, just policemen,

444
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,550
sports. I'm thinking, Holy Shit.
You can just let it naturally.

445
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,220
Then you'd do a CV.

446
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,410
We do sets of 20 okay,

447
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,000
we'll do two sets of 20 you
have to imagine like if you,

448
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,420
what if it's a small little
insect has gone into your nose,

449
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,033
how would you take it out?

450
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,443
Yeah.

451
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:50,320
Yup. That's one way of
explaining it. Yeah. Never know.

452
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:52,730
Doing Yoga. 20 insects. Yeah.

453
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,740
Blue or 20 insects and you have to
feel the air be bumped from the center.

454
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,430
Okay.
And what this technique does,

455
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,020
it's a Brene cleansing technique.
It's a very,

456
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:14,380
very powerful technique
and a ball for Pranayama.

457
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,960
So we start

458
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,930
hands on your one hand on your navel.

459
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,760
The center. Yup. Take a deep breath in.

460
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:42,510
Won. Won. Won, won, won. Won. Won.

461
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,460
Won. Won, won. Great. Excellent.

462
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,180
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

463
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,850
So you're doing it the opposite
way. It's not. It's out.

464
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,430
So that's the movement.
Yeah.

465
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,950
No, no. You don't have
to move your entire body.

466
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,730
It's only the breadth and your
stomach that moves towards no,

467
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,923
no.

468
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,400
Your Body's upright align your chakras.

469
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,250
You have to align your back straight.

470
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,740
Have you do it again.
Everybody coming to

471
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,230
get your breath together.

472
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,713
Take a breath in.

473
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,960
Good job.

474
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:28,420
Very nice.
Wonderful.

475
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:33,570
I know a lot of you
have just started out so

476
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,870
you would require a little more,

477
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,720
but this is a great technique
to cleanse your nasal passage.

478
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,850
I'm down with a bad cool takes to
San Francisco. I was out last night,

479
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,010
but I'll,
this is a great way to cleanse your,

480
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,420
your brain to oxygenate your lungs

481
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,813
all.

482
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,920
You suddenly start feeling a glow on
your face when you continue with this

483
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:09,600
practice for maybe a month.
If you do it every day,

484
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,360
these three parameters,

485
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:16,110
if you can do everyday or
maybe four times a week,

486
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,060
you will see the difference that it
will have in your life on your life.

487
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,260
So I always see that
fitness is like a marriage.

488
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,050
You can't cheat on it
and expect it to work.

489
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,310
So you have to give it
some amount of your time,

490
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,720
commitment and love.
So

491
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:43,090
do you want to continue? Should
we do go into Shavasana? Awesome.

492
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,220
Yeah, you tell me it's in a mascot.
We're going to be too difficult for them.

493
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,373
It's like,
Dude,

494
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,793
oh,

495
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:04,000
[inaudible] Angelo Minnow and just
breathe in, breathe out plastic,

496
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,470
no bus because a little more complicated.
So I, I, you know, when you start off,

497
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:12,680
you start with ABCD would start with Xyz.

498
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,900
So just these three concentrating
on your breath for 15 minutes.

499
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,260
Can I get a tissue and even here,

500
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,673
okay.

501
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,370
I normally never start
with a or with a student.

502
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:35,150
I'm a scar with people who
have just started to learn
because I feel you need to

503
00:37:35,151 --> 00:37:39,320
spot them and make sure that they're going
in the right position when they're in

504
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:44,090
downward dog. I don't want
anybody in doing so I'm going
to show it. Yeah. Lovely.

505
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,740
Got It.

506
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,080
First and foremost, before you get down
to doing the sooner and the postcard,

507
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,530
we have to do a stretch.
Yoga is about action reaction.

508
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,040
So every stat stretch
has a counter stretch.

509
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,830
So before starting,

510
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,320
just losing every part of your
body just to shake it all up.

511
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:21,310
Just shake it all up and
yeah,

512
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,930
just like just move. Yeah,
just every part is like,

513
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,190
it's like a dog yard. Just, yeah, just,

514
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,500
just warm your body up.
Yeah.

515
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,360
Just kick your legs around.

516
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,560
We'll just do the next rotation
cause it's very important to warm up.

517
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:54,070
I cannot be more emphasis
on warmups or never do.

518
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,360
I'll never get into a regime or an
exercise routine without a warmup.

519
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:04,610
So you just look to your right first

520
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,920
center slowly
to the left

521
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,990
center.
Look straight up.

522
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,920
Try and go as behind as you can stretch
your neck and you come down the same

523
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:32,880
way.
Try to touch your chin to your chest,

524
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,540
right in the center. Straight
ahead. Rotate your neck. Now

525
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:55,770
three times
looking towards your right.

526
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,530
Come to the center
three times on the opposite side.

527
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:25,260
I'll be going to thought Asana.
Okay. Are you standing like a tree?

528
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,953
Hands up

529
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:36,180
dry and Dutch skies on your toes.

530
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:42,950
Open up to your chest.
Breed

531
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,460
down on the side.
Come down.

532
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,500
Do the same thing again.
Going to noma.

533
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:59,210
Stay right on top.
Stretch.

534
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,690
Stretch.

535
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,863
Yeah.

536
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,840
Dawn, tragic. Dot.

537
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,280
Should fingers to the ground.
Now breathe out.

538
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,780
Breathe in.
Come up.

539
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,820
Can we do that again? How many you
do it the second time? Trust me,

540
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:41,720
you will go down low.

541
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,290
Hands Up,

542
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,663
exit.

543
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,773
Come up.

544
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,620
Hands on the side.
Come down.

545
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:15,870
We do the suit. Have a
scar. Heady Chile. Oh,

546
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:19,770
lovely.
I'll be doing the sooner that was

547
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,860
come. Let's do it together then. Yeah,

548
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:32,420
make sure that the breathing technique
is right. So with every Arsenault reading

549
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,920
without one leg behind.

550
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,423
Yeah,

551
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,210
just light up just to the floor first,

552
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,880
which I haven't got cinema.
Now you get into downward dog.

553
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,760
Make sure that their
heels touch the ground.

554
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,340
Try to go towards your dealer.

555
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,470
One legged front.

556
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,900
Then the next

557
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,610
come up slowly
adds up.

558
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,550
It did. I must stay. How
did that make you feel?

559
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,600
Awesome, right? Let's do
that now in one go. Yeah,

560
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,460
you got the technique ready.

561
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,250
Ends up going backwards.
Down.

562
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,640
Butt Up.

563
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,120
Only me starts the flow.

564
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,350
Downward dog.

565
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,930
Let's do three of these. One more. Okay.

566
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,030
Heads up.

567
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:41,063
That's fantastic.

568
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,900
Make sure when you go down that position,

569
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:49,470
I feel most people do it
wrong and you go down.

570
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,780
When you are here,
make sure you go down like this.

571
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,790
This is the right way to do it.
Most people do this.

572
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,460
That's not the right way,
so only your,

573
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,260
this is the way.

574
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,870
Then you come up and then you
go do this in downward dog.

575
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:13,890
Try and always

576
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,050
concentrate and go backwards.

577
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:26,370
Okay? I just showed it to him was when you
guys do it, you need to get this right.

578
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,060
Okay.
We just do one more fastener.

579
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,450
We do the bead Asana, which is my
favorite Asana. It's great for the legs.

580
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,153
Okay.

581
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,360
Feet, hip width. The Bot. Yeah.

582
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,620
Lovely. Now your turn. One leg

583
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,570
hands on the side

584
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,760
that's on top bend

585
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:11,060
breeds. You should feel
the tension in your glutes,

586
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,320
on your ties.

587
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,453
Come up,

588
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,710
turn to the other side.

589
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,500
Come up.
Center.

590
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,990
Hands on the side.

591
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:41,883
Yeah.

592
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,910
Yay. That felt great. Thank you.

593
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,630
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

594
00:46:57,631 --> 00:47:02,130
She'll buffer. Wonderful Clap. Thank
you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
