1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,760
[inaudible]

2
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,680
I told you they would.

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,750
Tina,
Tina Fey grew up in Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,490
She spent a lot of time in Chicago,
big fan of second city.

5
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,440
She ultimately became the lead
writer in Saturday night live.

6
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,180
And from there architected one of the
most successful shows on television and

7
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:57,921
from there had a huge impact in the last
few years on politics and media and so

8
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:02,880
forth,
and perhaps most important.

9
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,330
She announced last week that she's
pregnant with her second child.

10
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,010
Wow.

11
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,520
They'll Google. Thank you so
much. It's so nice to be here

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,020
now.
So I've been reading your book.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,150
I read it and I want to start with a,
with a reading.

14
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,710
Okay.

15
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,760
I hope it's something about
one of my periods are,

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,470
yeah,

17
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,760
here's a lot in the
book about women things,

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,570
which I'm not gonna I'm
not gonna quote from,

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,550
but now every girl is expected to have
Caucasian Blue Eyes, full Spanish lips,

20
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,670
a classic button nose hairless
Asian skin with a California is Tan,

21
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,850
a Jamaican dance hall, ass long,
Swedish legs, small Japanese feats.

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,700
The abs have a,
and I'm going to omit the rest.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,290
The person closest to actually
achieving this look as Kim Kardashian,

24
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:05,070
who as we know was made by Russian
scientist to sabotage our athletes.

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,190
Everyone else is struggling.
What does this mean?

26
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,910
This is a, uh, a little section
in the book about the state of,

27
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:17,050
of being a a woman in 2010.
I was in the book,

28
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:19,750
I talk about when I grew up
in the seventies and eighties.

29
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:23,650
You were good looking or not and if you
weren't good looking you could just like

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,830
learn a trade and just relaxing and um,

31
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,550
there's this kind of feeling now that
if you are not good luck, good looking,

32
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,940
you are to Frankenstein
yourself until you are,

33
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,090
you are to buy new teeth
and hair and other assets.

34
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:41,190
And so that's, that's what we're
living with now. Eric, that's a really,

35
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,190
so her, her book is, is wonderful.

36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,570
It's the funniest book you'll ever read
and it's book not only about her growing

37
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,280
up and all of the things
that happened to her as a,

38
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:55,790
as a young woman as well as a
professional woman, but a lot about life.

39
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,460
And so it has a lot of
lessons. It. So for example,

40
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,580
stop, I've got a gun, the gun, the gun,
I gave you five wedding anniversary.

41
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:10,770
Eric, how could you, we're not
married, we're not married.

42
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:13,380
Is it denial?
We've learned our first improv lesson.

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,040
It takes a long time to learn.
This is the,

44
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,070
with an engineer trying to learn it.
It's, it takes a long time, uh, to,

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,420
to learn those basic rules of Improv
or why don't you take us through them.

46
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:33,180
And they were in the bus or they're in
the book because I was an improviser at

47
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:37,560
second city and at a place called the
Improv Olympic, um, in Chicago. And,

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,790
and I talk in the book about Improv
having really kind of changed my

49
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,950
professional life and even sort
of my world view a little bit. Um,

50
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,200
there are some basic rules
of improvisation when you're
creating something out

51
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:53,610
of nothing. That's the first rule
is to agree, which is to say yes,

52
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,930
which we did do that successfully.
You said freeze. I have a gun and I,

53
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,450
I didn't say that's not a gun.
That's your finger.

54
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,060
Which is what a Google person
would say. Yeah. Okay. Um,

55
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,230
and uh, so we, we agreed and
the next rule is, is yes.

56
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,070
And which is to add on to what
you've already agreed upon.

57
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:18,630
So the gun, the gun I gave you for our
wedding anniversary, how could you,

58
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,220
and then we hit a brick wall,

59
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,263
Eric.

60
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,640
You know, it's funny cause it's very,
some very famous comedians have,

61
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,410
there's an old story about Joan Rivers
was at the second city briefly in 1959,

62
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:34,070
1960. And, and they use this
in class at second city.

63
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:35,890
All the time that there was
someone came in, you know,

64
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:39,170
so that I want a divorce was the
beginning of the scene. She said,

65
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:41,000
I want a divorce. And whoever
was with her on stage, she said,

66
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:44,090
but what about the children? And she
said, we don't have any children,

67
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,650
which in the moment got a big laugh,
which stops, it's killed the scene. Um,

68
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:52,540
so that's, uh, it's a very, it's a,
my response would be human instincts.

69
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,950
We have children. I just didn't tell
you. That's why we're getting divorced.

70
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,370
Yes. I have some other children. Yes,

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,510
this is exactly what, yeah. Okay. Got It.

72
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,890
Hi. For me it was this a
lot about um, being open,

73
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:12,891
you have to be open to any possibility
and you're being open to the fact that I

74
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:18,240
did an idea that you stumble upon together
is likely to be more interesting than

75
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:20,700
the idea that you started
with as individuals.

76
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:24,420
And I thought all that stuff was very
helpful as a writer. So, so when you,

77
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,620
when you were growing up,
did you,

78
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,410
did you know that you would be
funnier than everybody else? No.

79
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,590
I will tell you this. When you were
13 no, people did not say like,

80
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,210
Oh, you're so funny. I think you, I think
mostly what comedian people in comedy, no,

81
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:42,030
at a certain age is that they want
to be funny. You know what I mean?

82
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:44,730
I think that you know that you're really
interested in it and you want to do it

83
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,920
and then you don't know for a long time.
I mean,

84
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:51,921
I think at 13 year it's manifested itself
as annoying and then you hone it for

85
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:54,450
like 25 years

86
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,680
and sometimes still annoying.

87
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,810
One of the people who was,
I think the biggest influence on you is,

88
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,560
is Lauren Michaels. And you have in the
book, you have a lot of discussion about,

89
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,300
about Morgan and his rules.
He has a rule for example,

90
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:17,460
that don't work with people.
You can't hang out with a
three in the morning. Yeah.

91
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,330
Rule, never hire anyone that you don't
want to run into by the bathroom at three

92
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,164
o'clock in the morning.

93
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,700
And he has another rule about
Harvard people and people
who didn't go to college.

94
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,650
Yes. Um, some of these
wheels are, you know,

95
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,510
they're not necessarily some of the things
that he's actually says out loud and

96
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:33,200
some are things that I just sort of
gathered from spending a lot of time with

97
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:36,470
him. Um, but he, he's just
somehow knew that there was a, um,

98
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,410
the best mix for Saturday night live.
And to me,

99
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:44,411
I tried to apply it at 30 rock was
to take a mix of Harvard people,

100
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,610
uh, or Harvard style people. Um,
very cerebral, very organized,

101
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,290
um, well, and then to mix
them with kind of visceral,

102
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,710
um, fun sort of Chicago
people. So you take,

103
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,320
these are two rather broad brushes,

104
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,420
but I've been mixing, you take like I'm,
you know, I'm trying to give hard people,

105
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:09,810
you went, you take Conan O'brien
and you put him with Chris Farley.

106
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,681
You know what I mean?

107
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:15,681
And then that is a mix that makes for a
good sketch comedy because when one gets

108
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:19,970
too cerebral, the other one pulls, you
know, pulls it, pulls it out, and it's,

109
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,390
it actually does work in too much of
one or the other usually is not good.

110
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,290
Yeah. You have another rule. Never
tell a crazy person. He's crazy.

111
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,320
What's prompted that rule?

112
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,710
It just, it, it, it doesn't never
get you, uh, what you, you know,

113
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:38,720
if someone comes to you
in a workplace situation,

114
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:41,240
what sort of a strange demand or,
and confused like you,

115
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:46,050
they've had a problem that you, yourself,
you know, um, don't see as a problem. It,

116
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,670
it's not really useful to say like,
you're being crazy right now.

117
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,750
It doesn't really solve the situation.
Um,

118
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,320
just makes them more upset, which,
yeah, it just makes them not trust you.

119
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:00,820
And it's something I, cause it's my
instincts that I learned to kind of,

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,860
to move away from lists to be like, stop
being crazy. Just everybody, just be cool.

121
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,170
Just really like a good
management technique.

122
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,550
Okay.
We'll try to just be cool.

123
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,000
Everyone does knock it off.

124
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,213
We

125
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,280
now,

126
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,280
I think the most common question that you
get of all is about gender differences

127
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,940
in comedy, comedy writers,
comedy shows and so forth.

128
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,200
And alarmingly in your book, you actually
do say that there's a difference.

129
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,260
I admit to the,

130
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,480
the secret core difference that,
um,

131
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,440
that between male and female comedy
writers usually, you know, I, I try to,

132
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,730
he will ask me that question a lot.

133
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:48,860
What's the difference between men and
women comedy where they like, and, uh,

134
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,210
usually I try to just be so boring
that they lose interest, um,

135
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,330
in the answer and walk away. Uh, but
because I always say, you know, well,

136
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,750
there's a tremendous amount of overlap
in the middle of what men and women and

137
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,090
all people find funny. And
then at the outset, you know,

138
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:08,091
men kind of maybe like sharks and
robots doing things more than women.

139
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:12,300
You know, the masturbating bear, it was
over here and then serve. We're here.

140
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,290
It's like absolutely fabulous, but some
kind of detailed character study things.

141
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,200
Um, but the truth is that, um, the, uh,

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,580
the secret truth is that
sometimes the men urinating cups.

143
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,193
Okay.

144
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,960
I don't know if that happens here

145
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,450
first.
I've heard of it if it's true here.

146
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,300
Um, I think it was, and I said certainly
not all of them, but just to see me,

147
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,960
you know,
you compare two zero of them.

148
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,230
Can you imagine the women trying
to do that in their office?

149
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,190
This is really so much fun,

150
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,430
although not impossible.
I think

151
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,220
maybe we should move to this section

152
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,143
of the book.

153
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,980
Also the way the men sometimes pretend
to rape each other and the women never do

154
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:02,814
that

155
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,630
ideal in generalizations,
but

156
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,463
never do it,

157
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,750
shall we? So we moved to the
next section of the book.

158
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,913
Okay.

159
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,530
What did you want to add anymore?

160
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,620
No, that's it. Okay. Nope.

161
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,260
This book also has a lot of information.
That's very helpful.

162
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:30,261
As you become enormously
famous and successful and
one of them for yourself was

163
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,760
how to pose.
Yes.

164
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,030
How do be photographed to be
photographed and your photograph,

165
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:39,540
you've been photographed on everything
and you know, you're now widely,

166
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,630
widely recognized. Can you tell
the story of, as a comedy writer,

167
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:44,580
nobody knew who you were and now you're
recognized everywhere. Everywhere.

168
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,250
Yeah. It's a weird thing. Um,

169
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,430
and I have actually been photographed
in a lots of kind of formal model like

170
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:55,580
settings kind of a lot of
times now. And it's, uh,

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,740
it is one of the most fun things
you will ever do if you, uh,

172
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,400
people like to pretend to complain about
it and say it's hard. It is delightful.

173
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,470
Um, okay. You are treated too.

174
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:11,510
You know,
like you're treated like a queen.

175
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:13,130
You're riding like
anything you want to eat.

176
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,200
Do you want us to some kind
of special coffee or do you,

177
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:20,020
and it's like so some beautiful
loft space and the um,

178
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,720
and then they try to put
clothes on you that are um,

179
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,780
made for their doll clothes and they,
um, and did you should know that he's,

180
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,300
see anyone you ever see in a magazine,

181
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:34,301
they're clothes are gaping open in the
back with like large metal clamps holding

182
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,900
it. I don't care who it is and what's the
best way to pose that's my pose is um,

183
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,650
uh, first to, uh,

184
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,690
you have to let go of any rational
understanding that what you're doing is

185
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:50,480
ridiculous. And so you have to proceed
as if it's the going very well.

186
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,240
You need to make as many angles
with your body as possible.

187
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,360
It's just like that's how you look

188
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,610
really any kind of

189
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,840
a left.
Like you tried it,

190
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,870
try to look like you took a Benadryl.

191
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,260
That's 30 minutes ago.

192
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,900
There are a lot of tricks,

193
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,850
but most of it is just pretending like
you have to abandon your own sort of

194
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,010
intelligence of like,
this is insane.

195
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,203
Okay.

196
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,070
Well,
your relationship,

197
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,410
it's interesting that you chose
Alec Baldwin and you didn't,

198
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,030
you and Lauren tried to hire
him. He, he initially was,

199
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,230
it was not sure in the,
he sort of said yes and you talk,

200
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,460
what's in the book in an interview
is about your view of him.

201
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:45,080
Let me just read it.

202
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,210
So I think it's actually worth hearing
everything I learned about real acting,

203
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:50,760
I learned from watching Alec Baldwin,
I real acting,

204
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:53,910
I mean an imitation of human behavior
that is both emotionally natural and

205
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:57,150
mechanically precise enough to us.
It tears are laughing from humans.

206
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,300
He's a master. He can play the
emotion at the core of a scene.

207
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,400
He's falling in love.
His mother is torturing,

208
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:06,570
his mentor has been reincarnated as a
peacock while reciting long speaks his

209
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:08,790
word for word, it hitting all
the jokes with the right rhythm.

210
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,650
You like Alec Baldwin,

211
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,550
he's very good at acting.
Yeah, I do like him

212
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,200
and P and a law.

213
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,810
The two of you carry the show as best I
can tell. I, yeah, we're sort of, and,

214
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,440
and the, the, the, the sort of the, the
interaction between the two of you. He,

215
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:28,670
the, um, just say, uh,

216
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,190
overly self confident
executive and you the very,

217
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:36,520
very well meaning writer.
Uh,

218
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,620
tell me about, tell me about
how it actually works. Do you,

219
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,050
the stuff is written for you guys.

220
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,380
Do you guys invented funny by himself?

221
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,370
He is funny by himself, but this, the
show is very much a written, it's,

222
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:56,350
we shoot the show on film
and a lot of um, shows, uh,

223
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,370
are shot on high def video,
but we shoot on film. Um,

224
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,860
we sort of got in under the wire.
Uh,

225
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,570
they don't really let people do that
very much. He works, it's more expensive,

226
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,840
but it's also more kind of,
yeah.

227
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,960
And as you can tell by that,

228
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,750
it's time for another time for another
one of those is Benadryl, those things.

229
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,283
But um,

230
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,420
uh, and so we don't have time to alter
very much during our shooting day.

231
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:28,600
We shoot about 12, 14
hours a day. And so our,

232
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,030
we have an excellent writing
staff and they write for him.

233
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:35,740
And we do a table reads of the
scripts about a week before. So, um,

234
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,030
we, you know, read the thing allowed
for a group of about 25 people.

235
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,240
Um, and we, um, and so, you know,

236
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,400
we all have the chance to
kind of respond to the script.

237
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:48,220
Then a phallic has any thoughts.
Then he gives them a,

238
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,720
we do a rewrite of it and then by the,

239
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,620
by the time we're rehearsing
and shooting on the floor,

240
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:52,850
things are pretty much locked down.

241
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,640
Every now and then you do find
something fun in the moment.

242
00:14:55,641 --> 00:15:00,560
That is that thing I'm talking about
Harvard and humanity coming to meet.

243
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,640
Um, it's sometimes you, you have to,
you know, the, the Harvard brain,

244
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:06,020
I still let them be like, okay, these,

245
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,380
these humans think they've didn't
found something in the moment.

246
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:10,214
We'll let them do it.
Yeah.

247
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,513
MMM.

248
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,700
And uh, and that's sort of how it
goes. So then we rehearsed and then we,

249
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,543
and leave.

250
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,100
Yeah. B. I wanted to talk a little
bit about, you know, you were,

251
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,130
you were sort of pretty famous and then
the Sarah Pailin maneuver came along and

252
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:32,460
what really happened was she became a
national Canada and people began to notice

253
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:35,670
a resemblance.
And for a six week period,

254
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,470
you were number one topic in
a national media of America.

255
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,840
Let's talk about how that felt.

256
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,590
Yeah,
it was very weird.

257
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:47,770
I went from being what I would
describe as kind of comfortably famous,

258
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:52,090
which was if anyone knew me from
Saturday night live or from 30 rock,

259
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:56,530
it was because they hadn't really
watched it. And you know, uh, um,

260
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,100
and that, that jump,
uh, of that kind of, uh,

261
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,340
more just arbitrary, um, uh,

262
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,030
fame that it's, it's,
it's very strange. But

263
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,850
when you were originally
opposed to doing it, well, I,

264
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,330
you didn't want her on the show,
right?

265
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,260
I was,

266
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,980
I was talking to Laura about doing it
cause it was this kind of thing where

267
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:23,640
people just notice that
we had a vague resemblance

268
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,830
and brown hair and glasses.
You know, I saved the, if she,

269
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:32,730
if Sarah Palin had chosen
contact lenses 10 years ago,

270
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:37,260
I would not be with you right now.
Cause it was that, that basic glasses,

271
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:40,530
brown hair thing and people need, people
somehow knew that I had been at SNL.

272
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:43,800
No one, no one seemed to notice
that I did not work there anymore.

273
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,680
That I had a new program that
was done not for two years and a,

274
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:53,260
and that even that when I did work there,
I only did the news,

275
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,950
but people were like brown hair
glasses. And we get it, we want it.

276
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
And I, but I knew that I,
you know, that was, I had,

277
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,330
I knew people who were real
impressionists, people like
Darrell Hammond and, um,

278
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,710
and in Dana Carvey who really,
this is truly a gift that they have.

279
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:12,430
And that's why I was reluctant at first.
But then once we ended up doing it,

280
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:17,270
it was really fun. And then about
six, seven weeks into it, um,

281
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,480
so I wanted to come. Yeah. And I was
again, reluctant because it was, um,

282
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,950
it was, the election was getting sort
of weird and, and there was ugly. Um,

283
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,910
well all of a sudden people are
dealing with you. Yeah. Is that,

284
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:33,490
did they think you are a
sailor Sarah Pailin, right.

285
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,140
Or they think you hate Sarah Pailin
know and all of a sudden all of the bad

286
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,210
starts to politics come out.

287
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,140
Yeah. And I did find that there was a, um,

288
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,770
there was a weird gender difference
in that people, uh, would,

289
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,460
I would accidentally,
you know,

290
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,020
put on cable news during the day
just to get ready to go to SNL too.

291
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,640
And I would see someone and say, I saw
a guy on there once I'm talking about,

292
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,260
I was like,

293
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,610
he was just thought that I had really
conducted myself badly and she had been so

294
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:04,530
gracious about this. I was like, I'm
just doing sketches and people, you know,

295
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:07,880
uh, I think there was a perception
that it was, uh, mean, uh, so,

296
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,010
and some parts of the media because,
um,

297
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,550
and I think that was because it was two
women that that was the only way they

298
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,050
could process it was what was mean.

299
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,520
No one ever thought it was mean of
welfare all to play George Bush.

300
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:25,140
No one thought it was, you know, mean of
Darrell Hammond to, to play Bill Clinton.

301
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:27,440
It was a strange difference.
Um,

302
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,590
and she was in fact gracious to
you personally. We had a perfect,

303
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:35,210
had a nice chat yet we later she said
she complained about your role in her

304
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:35,740
campaign.

305
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,460
Yeah, she did. Yeah, we had a
perfectly lovely a day together.

306
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:44,320
And then later in some documentary she
felt that that Katie Kirk and I had, um,

307
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,210
was that I have it a mess,

308
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,960
had it exploited her family
for profit or something.

309
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,420
And I say,
show me the receipt

310
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,093
you

311
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,740
so,
so we're getting ready for,

312
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,320
for the next season of 30 rock and you
also have a movie you're going to work on.

313
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,330
I do. Yes. What's your base side? Okay,

314
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,960
I wonder what that is.

315
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,400
A couple of movies I'm
supposed to be working on.

316
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,203
Okay.

317
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,900
So what does, aside from
from the, the new arrivals,

318
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,120
what does the next few years are? I
assume if Mrs Pailin runs, you'll be,

319
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,960
I hope so. I'm around, you know, it's
tricky for them because I, like I said,

320
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't work there, so I,
you know, if some point,

321
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,920
if they want to switch it to an actual,
uh,

322
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,010
SNL employee so they can do it
with the frequency they want,

323
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:43,420
then I would understand
that. But um, yeah, if I'm,

324
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,510
I'm it would be available for that
in 2012 if they, if they need that.

325
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,703
Yeah.

326
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,030
It's so fun to just go down on us,
you know,

327
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:55,630
just show up on Saturday and do
one sketch and then start drinking.

328
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,823
Okay.

329
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,670
We have, we have lots of, lots
of questions from, from you all.

330
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,680
Uh, we also, I sent, did
a series of tweets to,

331
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,110
to get questions from people outside
of, outside of Google as well. Let me,

332
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,320
let me throw a few at you. Okay.
And then after a few minutes,

333
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:15,990
we'll also get some questions here
from folks here in the audience.

334
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:21,120
We have 47 video conferences going on
in addition to the people in this room.

335
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:24,070
So we have a lot of people watching.
Um,

336
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,260
this is from, um, Brianna
who's a Googler up.

337
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,950
Who is your favorite guest star on 30
rock favorite posts from your s SNL days?

338
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:35,540
Why?

339
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,620
Okay. God, there's,

340
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:41,300
so we've had so many guest stars on
30 rock that we've been so, so lucky.

341
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:45,140
Um, um, my favorites, I mean we,

342
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,640
there are people that just to meet
them was a dream come true for me.

343
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,310
We had Tim Conway who everyone here,

344
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,080
maybe he's too young to remember who
that is, but um, who, uh, who was on,

345
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:59,020
he was a favorite of mine.
Um, Jan hooks playing, uh,

346
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,240
Janka Kowalski's dirt bag.

347
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,810
Mother is a favorite of mine because
I grew up watching her lesson.

348
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,120
Al Loving her. Um, uh,

349
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,290
I mean people like Jon Hamm
who just now is like a,

350
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,060
a member of the family and
he's so funny. Yeah. With,

351
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,420
there's like a million of them.

352
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,590
The, um, this is from Jenny also
do, we're given a hilarious,

353
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:23,980
everyone on the 30 rock cast is what's
the average number of takes that you have

354
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,840
to Redo because everyone is cracking up.

355
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,920
Oh cause everyone's laughing.

356
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:30,070
Well we do want to take us
because no one knows her lines.

357
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,913
But

358
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,940
I would say actual cracking up happens.

359
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,800
I only like when there's also
a lot of fatigue involved. Um,

360
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,480
Jack Maguire, it gets the, gets
the giggles every now and then. Um,

361
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:51,430
Alec almost never ever breaks.
Um, Jane Jane. If she's tired,

362
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:54,430
I would say maybe once a month.
There's the giggles.

363
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,380
Interesting. So this is professionals,
right? Okay. Professor professionals. Um,

364
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,750
this is from a fan of yours and Macedonia.
Okay.

365
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,770
Which is still a country. Uh, Hi Tina.

366
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:10,250
One of the reasons I love 30 rock so much
has the amazing chemistry between you

367
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:13,310
and Alec Baldwin. Who Do
you think is, was the actor,

368
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,140
actress you've had the
best chemistry with?

369
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,900
Does it come naturally or
does it require a lot of work?

370
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,810
Oh, that's a good question.
Um, uh, well I think,

371
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:24,630
I think it probably wouldn't be
Alec Cause we've, I've never,

372
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,200
well I guess at this point I've been on
screen for more minutes and hours than I

373
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:36,150
was with, with Amy Poehler
or Jimmy Fallon. Um, but, uh,

374
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,800
I think those things come naturally.
I don't think you can take them,

375
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:44,250
although maybe, maybe he might.
Maybe he, he's good at faking it.

376
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,830
Oh my God.
He's making a bit of,

377
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,490
my favorite scene is the one with
Alec Baldwin where he is, uh,

378
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,830
he's obsessed about meetings and he has
to go to the meeting about meetings. Yes.

379
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,870
Anyone to be on the cover
of meetings magazine.

380
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,540
Gotcha.

381
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,050
My own ambition.
Yeah.

382
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,850
This is from a fan from all Auburn,
Alabama. Hi Tina. Apart from comedy roles,

383
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:09,550
will we ever see you in some
serious roles in film or television?

384
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,790
Do you also enjoy doing serious or
dramatic roles if you can get them?

385
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,403
Um,
I would,

386
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,410
I would like my career to drift
toward being a judge on law and order.

387
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,230
I feel like

388
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,150
the hours and the outfit appeal.

389
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,843
MMM.

390
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,380
I think it would be fun to do,
but I think,

391
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:38,160
I don't know that anyone ever let me
do a holy serious role and I'll know.

392
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,380
Yeah. This is from a,
a fan in Michigan. Uh,

393
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,940
thanks for being such an inspiration.
Young women. You're my hero.

394
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,420
If you had one word of advice for aspiring
twentysomething female writers and

395
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,650
entrepreneurs, what would it be? Okay.

396
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,900
Ah, not literally one word now. Now
you're in behaving like a Googler. Yeah.

397
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,030
Uh, so literal. Uh, Gosh, I,

398
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,630
I,

399
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,630
I think my advice would
be to trust your gut,

400
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,520
trust your gut creatively.
Um,

401
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,370
and in any kind of workplace situation
because it's a few times I look back on

402
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:23,620
anything that I've like, ah, I wish I'd
done this differently. It's what I had a,

403
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,170
a reaction sensor that
I didn't follow up on.

404
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,920
Yeah. That's interesting. Another
question from a fan and Michigan, sorry,

405
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:35,010
from different one from a fan,
from a Google or her name is z.

406
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,340
You said that you incorporate actual
quotes from your daughter into 30 rock

407
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:41,700
quote. I want to go there
unquote. Are there other examples?

408
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,430
How old is your daughter?

409
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,030
Ah, she's five and a half now. I was
just, I want to go to, there was, um,

410
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,080
something that Liz Lemon said that she
said when she saw the website for Disney

411
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:50,914
world.

412
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,703
Awesome.

413
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,310
And I mean your book,
you, you raped activities

414
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,500
with your daughter roughly equal
to everything else you've acquired.

415
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,290
Oh yeah, for sure. I look back, I,

416
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,820
I go through my phone and there's
this weird chunks of time where, uh,

417
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:11,760
it's like it because I was
like 4,000 pictures on my
phone. Um, and it'll be like,

418
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,280
um, pictures of us like at SNL, um,

419
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,370
doing the Sarah Palin thing and then
I'm taking her to her first day of

420
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:23,190
Preschool, 25th that and then going
to the Emmy's and there's, you know,

421
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,150
things on the table and then coming back.

422
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,850
The phone is a good way to see what is
actually really doing in your life. Yep.

423
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,150
And we want you to use
a more powerful phone.

424
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,193
Yeah.

425
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,020
And we have a lot of applications that
can help you. Where you going to go?

426
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,050
Do some of them. This is what
we do. We're good at it. Um,

427
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,230
was it, cause I did like that
you could tell it wasn't a house.

428
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,920
Her daughter gets older. You can keep
track of your daughter with your phone.

429
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,490
Trust me, you're going to want our
phones. Subdermal chip you guys. Um,

430
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,410
that's been proposed but we're
not quite there yet. Um, but yes,

431
00:25:58,411 --> 00:26:02,190
I'm trying to think what are the lines.
She's had a thing. She, one time she,

432
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:05,640
when she sits, she sits like
this when she, she calls this,

433
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:09,590
I'm sitting on our knees. Yeah.
But until we use that, makes sense.

434
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,380
Tracy Jordan's and talking about his
knees. But I mean it pretty much,

435
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,950
it usually works out very well
for, for Tracy. Jordan's care.

436
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,440
They have a lot of similar interests.
They both get really excited. Benihana

437
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,400
they have to be told they can't
have McDonald's every day.

438
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,480
There's similar people. Uh, this
question is too embarrassing.

439
00:26:30,481 --> 00:26:34,170
I'll let you read it. Okay. This is,

440
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,200
I'm a Googler. Um, I don't know
what these numbers and things are,

441
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,030
but this is it. This is easy.
When it's Eric Schmidt. Get
a guest appearance on 30,

442
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,183
I would say.

443
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,120
Absolutely. I just wanted
to, I just wanted them

444
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,790
prove that I did not submit that question.
So you could have typed this thing.

445
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,360
We will give this. I did not type that
will give this employee a raise, however.

446
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,490
MMM.

447
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,420
Her name is Julie.

448
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:04,430
Julie. Yes. Uh, this,
uh, absolutely. Uh, in a,

449
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:08,290
in a universe where our guest
stars have been everyone from, um,

450
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,520
Jack Welch's too. Um, which,
um, you know, Bob Ballard, what?

451
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:15,200
We tried to get the real Bob Ballard
the explorer, but he was unavailable.

452
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,520
You're just the kind of guest star
that we keep our ratings blow.

453
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,003
Hello?

454
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,150
Yeah. Actually the
question, next question.

455
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,710
This is from a fan in Fresno,
California.

456
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,550
The entire question is pirates
or a Ninja as question mark.

457
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:38,160
No, I've been asked this question
before recently. I'm not making it up.

458
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,480
Yes. Uh, Chaz and Melton.
Who screening? Um,

459
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,830
I think I said I said pirates the
last time because I think, um, Yup.

460
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,360
Is this strong hierarchy?

461
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,900
I think you're by the water pirates
and I like the outfits better.

462
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,800
Another question. This is a, uh,
from a Googler in 30 rock flashbacks,

463
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:05,060
you often do depict yourself as a geek
in high school and you're a mean girl

464
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:09,320
script, identifies more with the uncool
crowd. What's your actual experience?

465
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,820
Is it more sort of comedic value? Did you,
were you sort of geeky where you sorta,

466
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,100
because in the book you describe
yourself as sort of a growing up,

467
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:18,280
a little bit tentative,
right?

468
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,760
I would say I was sort of Geeky.
I think I also,

469
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,390
I think that almost everyone perceives
themselves as being on the outside in

470
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:30,670
high school except for no insiders
who kids. Yeah. And those two,

471
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:35,270
if they don't look that great now, like
when you go back, they peaked at 19.

472
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,730
Um, uh, yeah. And I was, yeah,

473
00:28:37,731 --> 00:28:41,990
it was very revenge with revenge of the
nerds are the nerds is look where we are.

474
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,150
Yeah. It was, it, you know,

475
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,660
AP student on, on the newspaper and in
choir and, and typical overachiever.

476
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,560
Yeah. I mean I was an achiever. I there
were, there were better achievers.

477
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

478
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:07,520
The, um, another question
from a fan in Munich,

479
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,910
Hi Tina.
I know sometimes Google yourself.

480
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,940
No, no, it's, it's exceeded
a level where no really,

481
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:18,190
no good will come of it.
I think my parents,

482
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,350
we encourage people to use Google.

483
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,050
Yeah.
I use Google a lot,

484
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,980
but I don't Google myself
because inevitably it terrible,

485
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:29,680
terrible things come up. And I've
tried to explain to my parents too,

486
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,380
they've had,

487
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,400
I think they have a Google alert on my
name and that's not a good thing for

488
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,234
parents.

489
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,070
Wait Til your child does
it. Oh, what's mommy up to?

490
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,890
Yeah, it's, yeah, me and John Goslin.
That's what we're worried about.

491
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,333
Yeah.

492
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,730
Uh,
a question from a fan and Mexico,

493
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,530
what high tech gadgets do you use?

494
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,160
Um, uh, not so many. It's about
my husband. She has her, I mean,

495
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:05,220
I use an iPhone and an iPad.
Is that bad? That's what I use.

496
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,070
Do you guys make it,
come on guys.

497
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,140
We have lots of Google
services on these products.

498
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,430
Yeah, I have. Yeah. I have
Google products on there.

499
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,510
Um, and uh, computers,

500
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,113
cute

501
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,550
to write scripts. Okay. And um,

502
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:26,940
that's about it.

503
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,920
We're going to have fit you a
little bit better now that you're,

504
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,620
now that you've visited, visited
Google, another question from a Googler,

505
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,400
you know, and you've got,
you're going to be a nerd.

506
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,950
You might as well have all the right
gear. Yeah. Right? Yes, that's true.

507
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,640
In any advice for new or want
to be sketch comedy writers?

508
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,850
Yes. I'm I a say go to, uh,

509
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,610
either Chicago, New York or
Los Angeles if you can. I mean,

510
00:30:49,611 --> 00:30:52,400
you can find a lot of improv
comedy and other cities now,

511
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,650
but I would just say try to get to a,

512
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:57,720
an upright citizens brigade
theater to take class if you can.

513
00:30:57,721 --> 00:31:01,790
And in New York or Los Angeles or an
Improv Olympic Theater in Chicago,

514
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:06,440
second city and just to, um,
do it as much as you can do it,

515
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,830
you know, five, six nights a week if you,

516
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,350
if you do believe a lot of this can
be taught, Improv can be taught,

517
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:15,980
the writing can be taught. The
comedy. Comedy is both an art as a,

518
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:16,910
as well as the science.

519
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,490
Yeah, the basic rules can be taught,
but I have tight improv. At second city,

520
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:24,730
I used to be a teacher there and you
can teach the rules a certain point and

521
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,720
then then about six months in it's,
there's a,

522
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,580
there's people who can truly,

523
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,670
who truly fit that kind of
work and people who don't.

524
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,910
It's true of a lot of things.
Correct. Why don't we get some folks,

525
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:39,670
we have some folks here on the
questions, so go ahead. Yes ma'am.

526
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:45,680
Um, Hi Tina. Hi. Actually,
my question follows nicely
to the last one we just had.

527
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,350
Um, I was wondering if, um,

528
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,910
I kind of assume that from that first
day that you took a class at second city

529
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,580
to maybe like that first
day when you started at SNL.

530
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,600
Imagine that was a bit of a long road,
probably full of a lot of fun,

531
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,130
but also a lot of challenges.

532
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,670
And I was wondering if you could talk
a little bit about that experience and

533
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:08,230
maybe share any advice for somebody
who wants to go down a similar road.

534
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,030
Um,
I started class,

535
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:16,031
I moved to Chicago in 1992 on
Halloween of Knights 92 and,

536
00:32:16,941 --> 00:32:21,380
um, started class at January. And
it was, it was a very fun road.

537
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:25,860
It was cult-like. The improv world
is, it's all encompassing. Uh,

538
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,210
like I said, we would go take cla.
You all you did was take class,

539
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,350
try to get on stage, watch other
people on stage. I mean, I think, uh,

540
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:38,150
immersing yourself in it like
that is good. Um, and I do
look back on things that,

541
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:41,000
um,
I took it all so seriously,

542
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,390
even though it was nonsense
kind of business. Um,

543
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,340
I took it all very seriously.

544
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:50,840
I remember my boyfriend at the time
who's now my husband, he was, um,

545
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,600
he was the piano player at the theater.
And I was like,

546
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:56,510
I think we should keep it a secret that
we're dating because I think it'll look

547
00:32:56,511 --> 00:33:00,650
affect the team and people will feel
it. And that's like an impromptu, like,

548
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,730
we're now married for 10 years.
I think we should tell them, no.

549
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:07,843
MMM.

550
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:14,270
But just find people who are as intuit
as you are and just do it as much as

551
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:17,910
possible. Um, things that were,

552
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:21,690
it did seem like a big deal at the time.
Ah, now I can barely remember, you know,

553
00:33:21,691 --> 00:33:23,400
sort of the politics within the,

554
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,760
the touring company of whose
piece is going to get in. I mean,

555
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:30,720
all that stuff that seems super serious
now. It is serious in the moment,

556
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:34,770
but we'll also get easier
as you go. Um, but yeah,

557
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:36,210
anything with comedy I think just have to,

558
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:39,480
you have to get in front of an audience
as often as you can because it's the

559
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:41,580
only way to know if you're doing it right.

560
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,860
We would prefer you stay
as a Google employee.

561
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,730
We have an office in
Chicago, so very good.

562
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:55,050
Yes ma'am. Um, so my friend
Robin, she's like moved out to la.

563
00:33:55,051 --> 00:33:59,430
She's an aspiring TV slash movie
screen writer, so it's not me. Okay.

564
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:06,870
But basically I was just curious what
differences there are in the process for

565
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:11,400
writing for Tds, like say 30 rock
versus writing for movies? Like I say,

566
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:12,300
like mean girls.

567
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:17,320
Um, well, uh, let's see. I've only
written the one movie of my own,

568
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,280
so I have sort of limited experience.
But um, with TV the differences,

569
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:24,880
I think you could come into it and try
to get a job as a staff writer and learn

570
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:25,840
that way with movies.

571
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:30,550
You're gonna maybe be writing scripts
on Spec. You're going to be try to,

572
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,600
you know, be a load a lot more. I think
it's a TV is a great training ground.

573
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:39,601
If you can even even break
in as a writer's assistant
as a great job to have as

574
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:42,700
the person in the room who is taking
all the notes constantly all day,

575
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:45,550
you really can learn a lot
doing that. We have some, uh,

576
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,420
we have had two writer's assistants who
now our staff writer, one at 30 rock,

577
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,330
Tracey Wigfield and uh,
uh,

578
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,700
another guy who's Andrew guests
who writes for the Shul community.

579
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,540
And so that is a really great way to,

580
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,990
to learn TV writing and movies.
It's,

581
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,490
I think it's so tricky to break in.
Um,

582
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,570
cause I, I don't even know
screenwriting. I don't know.

583
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,860
I was only able to get into it because
of Lorne Michaels and having come from

584
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:17,980
Saranac live, I get into it
through television. I don't,

585
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,210
I guess you could write and try to make
your own short films and build up that

586
00:35:22,211 --> 00:35:24,610
way would be the way to to,
but that's going to,

587
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:27,580
you're not that you're gonna have to
give your friends money and stuff.

588
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,063
Go ahead.

589
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,060
Thank you for being the Gilda
Radner of our generation.

590
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,070
Oh my gosh.
Thank you.

591
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,650
The world to us.
I agree.

592
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,230
So I have a couple of quick questions
for you. One is what's your best joke?

593
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,810
Cause I want to steal it. Um, number two,

594
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,980
what nickname does Tracy Morgan
use for you? And number three,

595
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:56,370
I'm a fortune teller told me that John
Stewart was going to retire from the

596
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,950
daily show in 2020 and that
you were going to take over.

597
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,660
So what are your thoughts on that?

598
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,070
Okay.

599
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,810
Fortune Teller told you that? Yes. Yes.

600
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:07,740
Okay.

601
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,720
Um, in 2012, uh, I think
nine years. Nine years.

602
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,010
Thank you.
Um,

603
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,550
I think I'll be in nine years.
It will,

604
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:23,880
I think it should be illegal for a
woman my age to be on television.

605
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,213
MMM.

606
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,640
Uh,
what was the second question?

607
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,920
Um,
Tracy Morgan.

608
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,680
Oh, Jason Morgan. He calls me
Tfa. Most of the TFA. Yeah.

609
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,730
He doesn't have as many nicknames
for me as he has for a, Oh, he's,

610
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,610
sometimes he calls me, this is one
here. You'll see fair. You know,

611
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:44,350
you're the isis in the hood.

612
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,570
I don't know what that means.

613
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,250
I know, I know, I know. Thank you.

614
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:54,950
Okay.

615
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,360
And the, and you asked him, he lived,

616
00:36:57,361 --> 00:37:01,820
it was my best joke in terms of something
that was actually on TV or something

617
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:03,000
or something I use.

618
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,830
Is that something I could
use to make people laugh?

619
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,120
Um, my honestly, uh, my favorite
Joe, just a handy everyday jokes.

620
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,340
Just put a little chocolate on your teeth
and act like you don't know. Is there

621
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,273
good.

622
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,210
Hi there, Tina. Um, I know this,

623
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:26,540
this season in 30 rock was the first time
where you've actually been able to do

624
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:27,374
a live show.

625
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,800
And from my understanding that was a
huge accomplishment and a real challenge

626
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:32,990
for the show to be able to do.
Um,

627
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,740
my question is what other barriers are
you hoping to break with 30 rock or what

628
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:37,060
are your,

629
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,670
like some of your upcoming on dreams that
you're hoping to achieve with the show?

630
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,440
Um, uh, that's a good question. Yeah,
we did the live show this year was,

631
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,800
was a very exciting and challenging. We
did it, it was to, it was too, right.

632
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,700
We did two, we did one for the east
coast and one for the west coast and um,

633
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,790
and it was really,
really fun to do because it was a,

634
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,910
we did it in studio h where
Saturday night live has done it.

635
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:03,910
So it was a blending of the 30 rock
crew at the SNL crew and it was, um, uh,

636
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,190
and it was really challenging technically
because with SNL you have 90 minutes

637
00:38:09,191 --> 00:38:10,400
and all these,
um,

638
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:14,920
kind of built in structures to the show
to get for the show to come in at the

639
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:16,090
right time. They have, you know,

640
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:19,990
when you see the band playing does
pop band bumpers, different things,

641
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:23,470
commercial parodies, things they can can
use to control the timing of the show.

642
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:28,740
And we had about 22 minutes cause they
gave us a little extra time and um,

643
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,520
it was much,

644
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:35,510
that was the biggest challenge was like
would we get through the show before the,

645
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,420
before the office just started,
right.

646
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,313
Middle of the shot.

647
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,650
That was kind of thrilling. Um, we,

648
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:45,480
and we did another thing we did
this year that was a format changes.

649
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,370
We did one episode, um,
called the queen of Jordan,

650
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:50,490
which was set entirely in a reality show.
Yes.

651
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,300
You went to that,
that can not get it.

652
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,410
That was Tracy. We filled it used to
be right into the system. See, um,

653
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,290
brought that up and uh, I'm trying to
think what else would I think, you know,

654
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,510
people sometimes ask if we ever
would do like a musical episode,

655
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:08,200
which I think we certainly,
uh, would be fun to do.

656
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:12,960
But other people have done that. I don't
know. Uh, yeah. Claymation I don't know.

657
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,440
The queer community did claymation
and co I would like to do a,

658
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:23,820
what I keep referring to it as a Bugsy
Malone episode, which is, um, uh,

659
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:28,910
has all movie before everyone here was
born where it was a gang gangster movie.

660
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,640
You remember this movie? Oh, the young
Jodie foster it and it was all children.

661
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,580
I would like to maybe do an episode
where all our character just played by

662
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,414
children.

663
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,890
Well, my suggestion, my suggestion
is have a, have a real Christmas

664
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,290
party and invite all of us join your
real Christmas party. I tell him is yeah.

665
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,880
Okay, go ahead. First of
all, thanks for coming in.

666
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,670
30 rock is one of my favorite
shows on television. I think. Uh,

667
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,730
there was an episode last season where
I just laugh for 15 minutes after the

668
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,430
show was over and I literally had,
couldn't stop to breathe.

669
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,660
I think that was when Tracey was going,

670
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:05,700
it's going on about the dogs
running the Wendy's. But uh, but uh,

671
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,900
but actual question was,
uh,

672
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:10,480
you also had an episode where you
provided some much needed closure to night

673
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:12,220
court.
And as somebody who's an,

674
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,490
and I was wondering if there are any
other sitcoms that you've picked for the

675
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,730
80s to, to sort of provide
that sort of culture for,

676
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,040
I know it's difficult to plug it
in, but, uh, and uh, if you, uh,

677
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,450
obviously that might
have been one shot thing,

678
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:27,480
but if you couldn't answer that
then sort of like growing up,

679
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:29,680
did you watch a lot of television
and you know, does that,

680
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,820
it seems like that you're
reading the writing on 30 rock.

681
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:34,650
It seems like you were also a TV fan.
Maybe that's not true,

682
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:36,100
but I was wondering if you
could have it on how that is.

683
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,440
No, I'm speaking to you think TV
fan growing up. Um, no court chairs.

684
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,970
I mean Mary Tyler Moore and Calvin, all
those things when I was younger. Um, yeah,

685
00:40:44,971 --> 00:40:46,670
I mean I think we are,

686
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:51,210
our staff has a generation of people
who really grew up on half hour comedy.

687
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,570
Um, good and bad. You
know, there's the, uh,

688
00:40:55,350 --> 00:41:00,060
cause there's this sort of who's the boss
saved by the bell era that I had full

689
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:03,720
house. I've seen, I've seen a
lot of full house and never,

690
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,390
never on purpose.

691
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,460
I had a, um, had a summer job

692
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,870
once it, a summer theater where we would
go work in the costume shop all day.

693
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:17,410
And then my roommate and I had like 45
minutes to go home before going back to

694
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:18,460
be dressers in the show.

695
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,180
And we would go home every day from one
of the only thing, almost full house.

696
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:26,100
We wash it and we watched it every day.
Um,

697
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,380
uh, but yeah. Uh, is there any TV show
or other show that you would like us to,

698
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:33,620
to, uh, try to have on?

699
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,490
Ooh, that's tough. I mean, a

700
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,860
teen teen, which was also a thing to
think of one that really raw, satisfying,

701
00:41:43,861 --> 00:41:44,694
ending. Like, you know,

702
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,420
I always felt that the new heart people
thought it was more funny. I Dunno. Like,

703
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:49,254
uh,
no.

704
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,160
Uh, well let's go to our
next question. Thank you.

705
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,823
Thank you.

706
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,880
Hi Tina. My name is Kevin
and uh, my question is,

707
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,230
I recently watched Panio and I noticed
that you were one of the voice actors in

708
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,070
that movie. Yeah. How did
you get into voice acting?

709
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,080
Um, well I was asked to,
to we voice Ponyo um,

710
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,570
cause I would say it was in
Japanese at first and um,

711
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,700
I was really excited to do it because I
think that kind of stuff is really cool

712
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:21,590
and fun to do. And it was,
uh, I've since, uh, done, uh,

713
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,150
just one other one that was from, from
scratch. It's very different. This mega,

714
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:29,110
my movie did it from scratch. Do you go
into your kind of improvising and j dog?

715
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,210
But the funny and sort of challenging
thing with Panio was that the animation is

716
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:38,080
done and use. You have to, and they've,
they think too, it would just sink to the,

717
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:41,720
to the lip flap as they call it. And
also there were a lot of, um, fun, uh,

718
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,160
this sort of nonverbal things
in Japanese where we, you know,

719
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:50,110
in English with something of us,
we wake, we'll mix. Huh. Huh.

720
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,020
Or just, you know, just weird
little nonverbals in Japanese.

721
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,243
Wow.

722
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,900
What kind of a, um, an
English language nonverbal.

723
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:05,400
Excellent.
Next question.

724
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,170
Hey Tina, we're also excited you're
here. Um, my question is in your book,

725
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,170
you get through your list of different
writers for 30 rock and your kind of

726
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:15,210
favorite singers from each one of them.

727
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:20,220
So what's your favorite one you were
and was it or not the Subar line?

728
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,540
Cause that's my favorite.
Which,

729
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:26,100
which was the smile when Alec Baldwin is
talking about all the New York royalty,

730
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,930
the Rockefeller's,
Carnegie's,

731
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,030
all the, all the important New
York families will be there.

732
00:43:31,031 --> 00:43:32,460
The Rockefellers were the Subar.
Okay.

733
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,440
Yeah,
that's not mine.

734
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,120
The one I actually meant to, I forgot
to give myself one in the, in the book.

735
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:39,900
And I was,
I had,

736
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,580
I had checked on the one that I was
going to give myself and confirmed with,

737
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:43,860
you know,

738
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,290
cause sometimes you wouldn't make you
very much make sure that it was a joke

739
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,110
that you wrote. And um, uh,

740
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,580
the one I was going to give myself
what I forgot was in season one when I,

741
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,290
I asked you Alec, um, why
are you wearing a Tuxedo?

742
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,750
And he says it's after six.
What am I a farmer?

743
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,310
That's my favorite one.

744
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,100
Love the caricature of senior executives.

745
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,980
Yes.
Hi.

746
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,960
Um, I'm actually really curious
about your life as a parent, um,

747
00:44:14,961 --> 00:44:17,910
especially because you're a mother of a
daughter and I'm wondering with all the

748
00:44:17,911 --> 00:44:22,680
messages of princesses and, yeah. Um,
damsels in distress and whatnot, um,

749
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,750
you know,
you would think having Tina Fey is,

750
00:44:24,751 --> 00:44:28,260
her mom might make being
intelligent and funny. Cool.

751
00:44:28,261 --> 00:44:32,340
But you know what I know about kids
that isn't always the case, can still

752
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:37,050
be, you know, pressured and, and just
soak it all up. So being five and a half,

753
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:41,630
you know, looking at your
daughter and how that's going. Um,

754
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,340
what are your thoughts
on parenting daughters?

755
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,170
Well, a silver, my, my, my, my
take on the princess thing was, um,

756
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,543
uh,

757
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,420
and I wonder if I would be the same way
if I had a son and he just really wanted

758
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:57,090
guns cause my ticket, the princess is
like, you know, I'm not going to fight it.

759
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,310
I'm going to, let's, we can have these
princess toys we can talk about and, uh,

760
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,860
and then it'll,
it'll kind of,

761
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:06,630
but if I get my son and I gave him as
many guns as my daughter has a princess

762
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:08,160
dolls,
I would be arrested,

763
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,160
not in Arizona. Um, but I
do try to quite a question.

764
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,590
We play with all the printers and then
we got into this when she was smaller,

765
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,770
this real rhythm of she would always
want to play barbies and say, and this,

766
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:24,360
we're going to play barbies.
And it's too,

767
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:28,470
and the game that she coined was two
girls fighting over the prince and they

768
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:30,120
both want to marry the prince.
And they,

769
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,020
and they said it was this game with
these two barbies, sabotage each other.

770
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,230
Allison was this natural.
And I would try to question it as we play.

771
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,330
I would say like, well, why did
they want to marry the prince?

772
00:45:40,331 --> 00:45:45,250
They don't have to Meredith. And
she'd be like, you're wrecking it.

773
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:49,960
You know? So I'm just hoping if I don't
force it to stop, it'll go away on its own

774
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,600
18 and thanks for coming today.
Um,

775
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,640
everything's been very
thought provoking for me.

776
00:45:56,641 --> 00:46:00,450
I went to Harvard but grew up in Chicago.
So having a little bit,

777
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,120
right. You're pulling
identities. I'm wearing flannel,
but gophers, so something,

778
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,720
something, something. Think
about a question for you though,

779
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:12,450
is what's inspiring you now?
Like what are you reading?

780
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,750
Um, what am I reading now?
I just, uh, I finished, um,

781
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,940
I don't get to read for
pleasure very often.

782
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,990
So I finished a seed Martins
novel about the art world,

783
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,800
which I enjoyed very much an object of
beauty and I just bought at the airport,

784
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:30,600
but I haven't started yet. Um,
Anne Lamott's latest novel. Um,

785
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,940
and I'm reading a lot of baby name books.

786
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,480
Google has an name suggested you.
You do?

787
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,840
I mean in baby girl baby names.
Oh, I've done that. Yeah,

788
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,820
I've typed, yeah, there's a lot of traces.

789
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,113
Yes.

790
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,320
Hi Tina. Um, I represent the human
side of the employees that work here,

791
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:54,460
so maybe not the Harvard side.
Um,

792
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,970
I went to a university called Salisbury
and people confuse it with, um,

793
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,190
chicken fried steak university. So, um,

794
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,530
I have this run Robin and,
uh, the same friend. Yeah,

795
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,870
she works in La and she, it's a, she
works at a tech company. Okay. Um,

796
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,160
and she, uh, Eh,

797
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:18,350
it's probably more of like
self deprecating in terms
of like her personality and

798
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,750
Robin,
uh,

799
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:24,030
is concerned with how that's perceived
in the workplace and how to balance that

800
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:27,330
and actually getting respect from her,
from her coworkers.

801
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,120
So I know that that's a,
a personality trait that you have as well,

802
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:34,690
but you are so successful.
So did you have any advice for Robin?

803
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,170
Um, for Robin? Robin is a mess by the way

804
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,900
to problems

805
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,740
is that Robin has, um, uh, um,

806
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,370
but she's asked for help. Yeah, that's
good. That's the first step. I think it's,

807
00:47:50,371 --> 00:47:52,620
you know, willing to have a
self deprecating personality,

808
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:57,360
but you don't want to be self deprecating
about your work abilities, you know,

809
00:47:57,361 --> 00:47:59,010
and I,
in the book I talk a little bit about,

810
00:47:59,011 --> 00:48:03,810
one of the rules of Improv that we is,
uh, is to make statements as opposed to,

811
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,400
uh, ask questions, which an
Improv is just, you know,
if I say like, who are you,

812
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:10,050
why are you here?
What should we do?

813
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:12,930
Now that I'm putting all the
burden on on you, my partner,

814
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,640
and I say that sometimes also
applies to two women, even just with,

815
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,710
with our voices in the workplace to speak
confidently and to try to avoid that

816
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:27,540
kind of like, I have an idea and I
think for like we were, I'm just like,

817
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,310
I don't know if it's a good idea just to,

818
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,910
just to make statements as much as
you can, but I think it's, um, yeah,

819
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,110
two too

820
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,400
to try to prevent yourself from prefacing,

821
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,820
we work with any kind of apology.
You know, I'm, I have friends,

822
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:46,910
like I have a friend who's writing a
pilot right now and I have another friend

823
00:48:46,911 --> 00:48:50,360
who was going to be working with her
and I said, well here's a, her deal.

824
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,750
She is going to s this is her routine.
She'll say for 30 seconds. Like,

825
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,780
I don't know. I don't think,
I think it's really stinks.

826
00:48:56,781 --> 00:49:00,950
And then you said you just have to let
her say that and then she does know and

827
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:04,550
shit doesn't stink. And it's getting, so
you know, if you can, if you can see that,

828
00:49:04,551 --> 00:49:06,990
if you have that behavior in
yourself and you can just kind of,

829
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,433
okay,

830
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:11,340
skip that part. You know, if you can
just kind of fast forward the, uh,

831
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,610
the pre apology part.
Sometimes I think,

832
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,900
I do think like sometimes what would a
man do in any given situation and they

833
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:20,970
don't,
they don't apologize so much.

834
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,000
Sorry. Apologize. Yes ma'am. Hey,

835
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,300
we have this group be the last
question. So go ahead. I'm stealing it.

836
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:32,230
The mic here. I'm feeling shorter
than usual, which is awesome. Um,

837
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,670
so I'm a young mother myself
and uh, for me, you know,

838
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:40,570
the work life balance struggle hit
me a lot harder than I anticipated.

839
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:44,080
And I think that's a common experience
across parenthood in general.

840
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:48,620
And would love to hear your experience
from the, from the comedy world and, uh,

841
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,530
the Hollywood world about how your life
changed after having kids and how you've

842
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:56,370
structured your time to find that balance,
if that's okay.

843
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,840
Oh, possible. Um, well I think the,
the biggest change is that your,

844
00:50:00,841 --> 00:50:04,660
your priorities just shifted in that you,
you want to go home.

845
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,490
And in some ways I think it makes you
a better employee because I was more

846
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,410
efficient. You're more efficient and you,
I would have spent a lot of time at SNL,

847
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,530
you know, before I was married just to
have hanging out in people's offices and,

848
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,860
and some of that is valuable
to the creative process,

849
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:22,610
but you don't need nearly as much
as you think. Um, and so that's the,

850
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,830
the thing is you just, you're just
managing your time better. You,

851
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,770
you're going home as soon as
you can, as soon as you can. Um,

852
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,310
and I think, uh, someone was asking me
about this recently, I was saying there,

853
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:35,810
do you,
I don't know if he find this to be true,

854
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:38,940
but there's sometimes there's a um,
oh,

855
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:44,020
we have a reluctance to really admit the
specific details that you may not even

856
00:50:44,361 --> 00:50:46,100
be like, it's hard. But
when people say like, wait,

857
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:48,260
but what time where you really like,

858
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:50,330
what time do you leave and what time
did you get back? And you're like,

859
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,430
don't worry about it. It's because you
feel like people are gonna judge you.

860
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,140
Um, and I, I don't,

861
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:02,480
I think it's probably better if you know,
for us to be honest with each other.

862
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:07,480
But it is tricky sometimes
to, to say like, yeah, these
weren't very long hours. Um,

863
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,470
and I just, you don't do much else. Right.
You just kind of do your work and, and,

864
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:17,450
and, and go home to see your kid. That's
kind of it. Then you realize like, well,

865
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:23,030
I haven't seen a movie and like four years
except your own,

866
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:27,230
right. Since I've been made to go
to a premiere of one that I, yeah.

867
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,600
Then I worked on. Um, but it's, it,

868
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,770
and also the thing that I find that people
don't tell you is that the amount of

869
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:37,910
kind of energy that goes into the
relationship you have with your child's

870
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:40,760
caregiver, whoever that is. That
was one where I was like, oh yeah,

871
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:44,810
this is a person. This, this is a
relationship. It's approximately,

872
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:48,240
you get it right then. And that
needs this relationship, uh,

873
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,480
takes a lot of kind of time and energy.

874
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:52,940
And that was one thing that now I
feel like I've gotten better at it.

875
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:57,590
When you're first doing it,
you feel kind of trapped by that.

876
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,600
Um, so that will, I don't
know how old your child is,

877
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:01,520
but that does get a little better.
Go ahead.

878
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,450
Hi, I'm, Hi Tina. Thank you so much for
coming. It's hard not to talk to screen.

879
00:52:06,451 --> 00:52:07,250
Tina.

880
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,190
You're so big,
Huh?

881
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,900
All right. Um, so as a person who is
such a big fan of TV all your life,

882
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:18,230
you've probably seen shows that have
wonderful actors and great concept,

883
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:21,150
but horrible writing, like bleeding. Um,

884
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,780
and said that not me. I said
that. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

885
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,180
And so as a writer,

886
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:31,181
I was wondering if there's a TV show in
either recent history or that's going on

887
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:35,940
right now that you feel like maybe if
I took this on, this would be, Huh?

888
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,470
Oh, did, I would, could
fix it if you could.

889
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:46,030
Um, I, uh, no, I think, um,

890
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,120
no. I thought you were going
to ask me what TV shows.

891
00:52:51,121 --> 00:52:55,440
I thought were well written cause I
was getting ready to answer that it was

892
00:52:55,441 --> 00:52:58,050
going to say the Larry Sanders show.
And um,

893
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,960
I think mad men is really well written.
Um, I hear, I don't get to watch it.

894
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:06,170
I hear breaking bad is unbelievably
grab is phenomenal. Yeah.

895
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:10,530
I haven't actually seen
it. Yes. Yes ma'am. Hi.

896
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:15,240
I just wanted to see if you
have any similarities to
Liz lemon cause I love her.

897
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:18,090
Oh, I do, I do it. What do you think?

898
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:24,150
I do have a lot of similar as I feel
like Liz Lemon is, if I sort of, uh,

899
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:28,620
I would say it's a sliding kind of version
of me. If I had stayed kind of, um,

900
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,300
in the way I was when I first was head
writer at SNL and was throwing myself

901
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:37,760
entirely into that job.
Um, but I have a, uh,

902
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,410
a different home life than she does,
which is very different.

903
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:42,780
And sad thing is people always
say like, you know, she justice,

904
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,500
why is she so suddenly and you,
you let us be so ugly or they have kid.

905
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:46,801
And I was like,

906
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:51,801
she dresses so much better than I would
go if I were going to to 30 rock to

907
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:53,280
actually write for a day.

908
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:56,190
Like was the wait Liz lemon
is dressed as how I would be,

909
00:53:56,191 --> 00:54:00,570
like if I was like trying to pull it
together to go to a friend's house for

910
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,330
dinner.
So we're pretty similar.

911
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:11,500
Hi, you mentioned a Tim Conway who I'm
old enough to remember seeing in the Carol

912
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,430
Burnett show and I was a kid and it made
me think that one of the funniest bits

913
00:54:15,431 --> 00:54:20,350
that I remember seeing in comedy in
general was when he interacted with Harvey

914
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,260
Korman and they would crack in the
middle and they would start laughing.

915
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:25,990
And it was, it was an in
the moment amount of, uh,

916
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:30,370
type of comedy that is
obviously lacking from TV. Uh,

917
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,300
I suppose you experienced that in
Improv and SNL was sketch comedy.

918
00:54:34,301 --> 00:54:37,960
How is it making the transition
to television where you
edit those scenes out?

919
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,630
Yeah, well those were,
I mean those things,

920
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,360
the Carol Burnett show was in
front of a live studio audience.

921
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,210
And so there is a kind of immediacy and
that does happen every now and then, uh,

922
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,800
it will happen on Saturday
night live. Um, and it is,

923
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,130
there's nothing more satisfying if you,

924
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:58,690
there was a sketch when I was there called
Debbie Downer that if I didn't write,

925
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,900
I love it. I did write it, but it was
really funny. Right. And they, um,

926
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:07,270
they all genuinely truly broke,
uh,

927
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,460
and laughed in it. And it's one of the
most joyful things you could ever watch.

928
00:55:10,461 --> 00:55:12,890
And the thing for comedy
people as you've just,

929
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,970
if it happens once in a while
and it's real, it's okay,

930
00:55:16,971 --> 00:55:21,350
but you never want to be that person
who's kind of like faking it a little bit.

931
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:22,670
Um,
and we had,

932
00:55:22,671 --> 00:55:25,280
so that's what you don't see it on
shows like 30 rock because there's no

933
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:26,300
audience there.
So it would,

934
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:30,390
I think it would seem pretty self
indulgent if we left it just like us.

935
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,780
Thank you. What I, what I
like about Tina is you see,

936
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:38,790
and the arc of her life so far,
someone,

937
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:43,510
someone who really has started
off with an exceptional talent,

938
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:44,500
which she won't admit,

939
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,480
but used it and used it and
was disciplined in the way
she approached everything.

940
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:50,770
And she had her book.

941
00:55:50,771 --> 00:55:54,280
She talks about the confusion
of where to go and what to do,

942
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,630
but ultimately she found a path that
has resulted now in the second week of

943
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:03,010
number one book in the United States,
which is pretty amazing for,

944
00:56:03,011 --> 00:56:03,940
I think at first, uh, first

945
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:08,870
[inaudible].
If you think about

946
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:13,430
writer, comedy writer,
creator, producer, actress,

947
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:15,350
now movie star mother,

948
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:19,220
and she's managed to merge it all
together and produce just an extraordinary

949
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:22,730
outcome. I can only imagine
what your next decade will be,

950
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:26,060
and I'm looking forward to watching it
to thank you. And thank you so much for

951
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:31,610
[inaudible].
