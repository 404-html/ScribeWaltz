1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,090
Today. We are so excited to have Dr
Francesca Gino here joining us. She is,

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,890
I'm a behavioral scientist and the
Tandon family professor of business

3
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,650
administration at Hbs,
Harvard Business School.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,220
And she will be talking to us
about some of her recent research,

5
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:26,120
which is also represented in her
new book called rebel talent.

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,710
And I am told that one of the rebels,

7
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:32,930
so they'll be talking about is a
fabulous Italian chef. So among others.

8
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:37,550
So we have lots of good stuff in
store. So Francesca, come on up. Um,

14
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,050
Perfect. Thank you so much. Welcome.

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,180
Thank you so much for having me and thank
you so much for all of you to show up

16
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:06,280
and come to the talk.
As you heard,

17
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:09,430
we're going to talk about some of the
ideas in the book and I want to share some

18
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:09,911
stories,

19
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:13,660
a little bit of the research behind the
scenes and all fully you're going to

20
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:18,040
feel as inspired as I felt when I
was working on this book project.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,520
And I want to start with a story that I
heard and I was told by going went back

22
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:28,450
to the restaurant by the person who
works at this a three Michelin Star

23
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:32,910
restaurant in needle is called Osteria
Francescana there in modern, um,

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,880
and his name is [inaudible].

25
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,950
And this is actually the story of a family
of four who visited the restaurant on

26
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:41,974
a Friday night.

27
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,180
So imagine your father and mother and
eight year old boy and a 14 year old boy

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,660
and Palmieri helps them find their table
and then shows up to take the order.

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,980
And the father are incredibly happy,

30
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:58,981
makes an order for each one of the four
of them for a tasting menu that has a 13

31
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:04,870
dishes and he's called sensations
and it's almost lunch time.

32
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:08,500
So I want to give you a sense of the
type of dishes that are part of them is

33
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:12,100
menu, so quite creative in
the way they were assembled.

34
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:16,670
That's a Yo and other dish
that is part of these 13 um,

35
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,010
tasting menu course.
Tasting menu is the one that you see here.

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,070
It looks like a funny ice
cream but that's a four gras,

37
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,840
so not the type of dishes the
growing boys would hunger for.

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,380
Now the fiber was so eager to eat
at the restaurant and not only me,

39
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:34,090
the reservations for Friday night.

40
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,730
You also made the reservations
for Saturday night.

41
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,150
So there's now 24 hours later the same
families back at the restaurant and we're

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,750
again welcomes them in a,

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,130
brings them to their table and
then shows up to take the order.

44
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,980
This time again very happily,

45
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:54,070
the father goes a four at 10 cores,

46
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,830
a tasting menu called the
tradition in evolution.

47
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,590
And again I want to give you a sense of
the type of that are part of the manual.

48
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,610
One of them is called his nails and
under the earth he served as a soup,

49
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,210
but there actually is nails at the bottom
of the plate and they're hidden under

50
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,990
a form of raw garlic and
potato and the earth.

51
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:17,650
Part of the dish is stands for
black truffle coffee and nuts.

52
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,470
Now I'm Permian was taking the ordered,

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,800
you notice that the boys over most had
a face of disappearing as if they were

54
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:32,150
not sharing the eagerness and excitement
of their father to have another gourmet

55
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:34,870
meal and the boys were keeping quiet.

56
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,350
But Palmieri turn to the eight
year old at the table and said,

57
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,770
what would you like to have pizza
that the year old boy now is we,

58
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,810
everyone just going is no pizzeria.

59
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,040
There is no way you could find pizza
on their menu and it's a rather serious

60
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,670
place. Fresh flowers are brought
into the restaurant every day.

61
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,960
The tables are put together
with surgical precision.

62
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:03,961
The dishes are arranged with a lot
of attention to detail and this is a

63
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:08,620
restaurant. The back in 2016 became the
best restaurant in the world. And in fact,

64
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,670
also this year in 2018 they were
back at the top of the list.

65
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,560
But despite all of that,

66
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:19,561
when premire heard pizza is skills
themselves ran to the phone,

67
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,980
called up the best pizzeria
moderner and order the pizza.

68
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,820
And sure enough about 1520 minutes later,

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,280
a pizza showed up and the door in a taxi
and pizza was served that to the boys.

70
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,840
Now I'm telling you this story
because it's a perfect example of war.

71
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,090
Rebel talent is all about even in
situations where there are lots of rules,

72
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:47,500
as in the case of fancy restaurant,
permia was able to keep his mind open,

73
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,220
look at the problem from a different
perspectives and come up with a rather

74
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,330
creative solution.

75
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,120
So what I want to suggest is that we all
probably want to be people like Palmyra.

76
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,730
If we think about our
leadership broadly defined,

77
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:04,510
the people that we influence in
our different spheres of life,

78
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:06,880
whether at work or in our personal life,

79
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,450
I would say that we want to have people
would order the pizza like Palmieri dead

80
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:15,970
in that particular instance.
Now,

81
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:20,320
what's interesting is that I will call
[inaudible] area rabble for this behavior

82
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:25,321
for many other behaviors that you engage
in on a regular basis in his work,

83
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,240
but rebels usually have a bad reputation.

84
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,680
I spend a lot of time in organizations
and I've collected all sorts of words for

85
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:36,050
them.
They're called the show offs.

86
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,570
Sometimes they're called the jerks or
the annoying people who slow you down in

87
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:44,860
your decision making processes.
The trouble makers, the outcasts.

88
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,761
In fact,

89
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:50,761
I think that we often have a very precise
idea of the rebels in the business.

90
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,840
We think about people like
apple, visionary, Steve Jobs,

91
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,680
so people are incredibly innovative and
creative, but at least the stories go,

92
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,580
not the type of people
you want to work with,

93
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:04,730
the or AV as a boss or as an employee.

94
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,040
And what I want to do in the
time that we have together,

95
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,400
and it was a big motivation for writing
this book is trying to shift that

96
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:15,320
thinking and suggest that people who I
call a rabbles are not people to break

97
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:19,760
rules just for the sake of breaking rules.
They are not people who are arrogant.

98
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,410
There are people who break rules,

99
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,580
hold them and others back and they
break rules in a way that is very

100
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:29,630
constructive and productive and
positive for their organizations.

101
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:30,981
So that said,

102
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:35,000
let me share a few stories that are going
to allow us to talk about what are the

103
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:39,410
ingredients of their success and the
first story that they want to share comes

104
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:41,030
up from the domain of sport.

105
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,570
Now some of you might know this
guy is a rather well known coach.

106
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,760
His name is Marisa cheeks and I want to
tell him particular about the evening of

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,060
April 23rd the 2003 this
was a big night for him.

108
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,650
It was game three of the first
round of the 2003 NBA championships.

109
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,330
And I like you to imagine being there.
You're in a very big arena,

110
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,310
20,000 fans ready to watch the game.
You're there with them,

111
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,470
ready to cheer up your team to success.

112
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Millions of viewers are from home
and before the game started at girl,

113
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,730
Ooh, as about 14 years in
age, stepped into the arena,

114
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,050
ready to sing the national anthem.

115
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,730
And what I like you to do is watch a
video clip that I brought with me of that

116
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:36,610
moment and I like you to pay
attention to what this coach does. Oh,

117
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,420
why don't we do the following.

118
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,250
We'll come back to add that and I'm
gonna talk about a different ingredients

119
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:47,840
first a where we don't need to
look at the video quite yet.

120
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,200
The second ingredient that seems to be
something to rebels do quite well is

121
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,340
having a great desire for
challenge and for novelty.

122
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,790
And I want to introduce this ingredient
by telling you about a personal story.

123
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,240
It is Christmas time, a few
years back and our house, and

124
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,150
this is not what happened there.

125
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,210
I had what I thought was the
perfect gift for my husband.

126
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,420
And the only thing that you need to know
about him is that is the type of person

127
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:26,220
who would be super happy to work here.
So it's a complete geek,

128
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,170
so always loves the new piece of
technology. Uh, the lead is gadget.

129
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,760
Everything that is a interesting and
playful when it comes to technology is the

130
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:39,840
perfect gift for him. And so on
Christmas Day, he runs downstairs.

131
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:44,841
There is a big tree in the living room
and under the tree finds a big box that I

132
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:50,121
prepare the for him and it takes the
top off and then he start taking some

133
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,350
pieces of paper out of the box.

134
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,250
There was this card at the bottom of the
box letting you know that they signed

135
00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:00,990
us up for a 10 week,
two hour weeks course in Improv comedy.

136
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,820
Now,

137
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,420
as it turns out in pro carbonate taught
me all sorts of interesting things that

138
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:10,650
are really good lessons for life in
thinking about the work that we do,

139
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:15,020
in thinking about the relationship
that we have and in the spirit of, uh,

140
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,950
bringing to bear something that
I've learned by taking this class,

141
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,380
I thought that we could
do an exercise together.

142
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,210
That is one of the exercises that we did
quite a few times throughout, uh, Improv.

143
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,940
Now. Um, just to close the story, my,

144
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,210
my husband was too happy when
I signed him up for this class.

145
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:38,160
He really wanted the latest gadget in
his hands, but I thought it was wrong.

146
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,140
And by the end of the first
two hour class, he actually
told me that he hated it.

147
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,520
But things started to change as we
went on and on for our weekly classes.

148
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:53,390
And he started really enjoying having
this a date with the anesp acted.

149
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,060
So I'm going to ask each of you, if you
don't mind to stand up for this exercise.

150
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,680
I'm going to ask each of
you to find the partners.

151
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:03,900
So a person who is a
standing close to you,

152
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,640
that would work well. Perfect. And

153
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,690
I'm gonna put myself up here so
that you can see the direction.

154
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:18,480
So this is not too difficult.
Okay.

155
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:23,310
I'm going to ask you to stand about
this distance from your partner.

156
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,931
That is a,

157
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:32,931
somebody over here needs a partner since
you're working in pair and if you don't

158
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,400
have a partner you can also work
with me. I'm fine with that. Okay,

159
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,640
so here's what I'm going to ask you to do.
From that position,

160
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,860
you're going to standing
in front of your partner.

161
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,790
I'm going to ask you to spend the next
20 seconds and I'm going to keep the time

162
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,930
for you staring in the
eyes of your partner. Okay?

163
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:57,150
And there are a few more rules
before you get started. No laughing,

164
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,570
no talking,
no anything.

165
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:04,440
No really expression of any
emotions on your face. Okay,

166
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,100
so that's the agro sizes.
I said I'm going to keep the time for you.

167
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,040
And when there is silence you can start.

168
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,843
Okay.

169
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,980
And time.
How did that feel?

170
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,680
It was great.

171
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,240
Okay. For some of you,
maybe slightly awkward,

172
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,510
a little bit weird,
uncomfortable.

173
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,570
As it turns out, if you felt a little
bit awkward, slightly uncomfortable,

174
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,091
that's okay.

175
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:05,260
It means that you're human because our
brain knows that if we stand that close

176
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:09,070
to a person looking in their
eyes for that amount of time,

177
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,720
one or two things usually happen.
One, we're going to kiss the person.

178
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,990
Two, we're going to punch
them in the face and I,

179
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,120
I don't want any of that
to happen on Google.

180
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,490
So you can go to your partner
and shake their hands and say,

181
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,490
I'm not going to punch you. I'm
not going to kiss you. Okay,

182
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,950
now that that is out of the
way, no, no, no. Standing up,

183
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,120
not sitting yet. There is a
second part of the exercise. Now,

184
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:38,440
a beautiful principle of Improv is the
idea of who is working on scenes with a

185
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:42,130
partner and shifting your
attention from us to them.

186
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,300
Our goal in scenes is always trying
our best to make our partner feels good

187
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,830
about what they're doing or feeling as
confident as they can feel about what

188
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:55,120
they're doing. And again, what a beautiful
lesson about life more generally.

189
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:59,080
And so to practice that, we're going
to go back to the same position again.

190
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:04,081
I'm going to ask you to engage in
this 22nd of a period of steering,

191
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,600
but this time you're also
trying to pay attention.

192
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,030
So what is their eye color?

193
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,540
Is their haircut an interesting one
or are their ears shaped in a slightly

194
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,750
different way? Whatever you want
to do, you're trying to stare,

195
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:23,290
but pay attention to what they're doing.
Okay. Same rules, same rules as before.

196
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,910
So no talking, no laughing, no
facial expression of any kind.

197
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,470
Okay, perfect. If you're ready, let's go

198
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,530
and time.
Okay,

199
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,590
we're going to test what are you
going or paying attention or not?

200
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,960
Seems like that you were, I know. Oh,
that sounds like a common from my husband.

201
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,370
As we were going to classes,

202
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,620
you're going to turn around 180
degrees and so each one of you,

203
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:07,920
so this time is not your
face looking at their face,

204
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:10,800
but it's your back looking at their back.
Perfect.

205
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,450
And what I'm going to ask you to do is
each one of you to think about two big

206
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,030
changes.
So I don't know if you have glasses,

207
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:20,790
you might want to take your
glasses off or rough up your hair,

208
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,030
be as creative as you want to be,

209
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,230
and then make those two
changes on yourself. Okay.

210
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,350
No taking off clothes,
just

211
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,870
perfect. Okay. If you
have your two changes,

212
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,131
when you're ready,

213
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:49,131
you can turn around and each of you can
guess the changes that you see in your

214
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,124
partner.

215
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,130
Okay.

216
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,920
Are you able to figure them out?

217
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,143
Yeah.

218
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,840
Again,

219
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,840
it's quite nice to be able to shift the
attention from ourselves to the other

220
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:45,971
partner.

221
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:50,971
So hopefully most of you were able to
see the changes the other person actually

222
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:56,710
made. Now I'm going to do that final part
of this exercise. And do we have music?

223
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,130
Are we good with audio?
Yeah. Perfect. Okay.

224
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:03,040
We're going to do the final
part of the eggs this size.

225
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,060
And this is what I'm going to
ask you to do if you don't mind.

226
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,710
Um, do you like to dance? Yes. Yes. Oh.

227
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:16,320
If I were to find you on a dance floor,
what you would be doing? Dancing. Okay.

228
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,210
Can you show,
can you show me one of your moves?

229
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,730
Yes. I generally have like
you have generally. Okay.

230
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,210
Okay.
Yeah.

231
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,840
This is what I am seeing.
So something else, sorry.

232
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,650
The much better than what I'm doing,
but it's something around that. Okay.

233
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,940
So your role as an, again, each
of you is going to do this,

234
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:40,050
that you end up here,

235
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,190
each of you is going to think
about their favorite dance move.

236
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,150
And I'm going to put on some music and
ask you to actually try it out in front

237
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:51,390
of your partner. And then you're
going to switch when I say switch.

238
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,150
But here's the very important
role of the partner.

239
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,130
Since your task is to make your partner
feel as good as they can feel about

240
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:03,060
their dancing in this case,
or as confident as they can
feel about their dancing,

241
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,410
you're mirroring but exaggerating.
Okay?

242
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,980
So whatever it is,
I don't know what I would do this here,

243
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:14,070
but in a way that really makes them feel
good about the way they are dancing.

244
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,850
Okay. Um, as I said, I'm going to put up
some users since it's easier to dance.

245
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:21,140
That way you can decide
who's gonna go first.

246
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,330
Yeah.

247
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:32,100
And when you're ready,
the first person can start,

248
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,003
Michelle.

249
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,510
Okay.
Hey,

250
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,280
plus do all of you can take it.

251
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,723
[inaudible]

252
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:26,450
I'm

253
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,480
really exceptional dancing in this room.
I have to say I'm very,

254
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:30,590
I'm very impressed.

255
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,040
How did that feel compared to the first
exercise when you were staring the first

256
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:39,110
time you did that much better.
Right?

257
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,760
It's interesting that once we put
ourselves out there in situations where we

258
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:46,520
feel challenged,
where we're always doing something new,

259
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,580
it becomes easier to feel
comfortable with the uncomfortable.

260
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:51,890
That's what rebel often do.
You know,

261
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:56,150
I was obviously very interested
in studying this idea in
the case of businesses.

262
00:18:56,151 --> 00:19:01,151
And so I want to businesses to try to see
how is it that they injected this idea

263
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:04,400
of challenge and novelty
in the work that people do.

264
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:08,420
And one of the businesses I visited
where I expected not to find any

265
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:13,421
rebelliousness is a fast food chain in
the middle of tenancy in West Virginia.

266
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,280
They look like this.
They're drives through bleed blue,

267
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,630
big blue boxes with French fries
and hot dogs on their roof,

268
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,030
but then have quite successful
at what they do. In fact,

269
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:27,590
if you look at any measure of performance,
revenue per square, you name it,

270
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,960
they beat the competition by far.

271
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,100
And we're talking about big brands
like Mcdonald's, Burger King, Wendy's.

272
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,640
Now they also invest in
people quite differently.

273
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,960
So if a police like Mcdonald's,
you receive an hour and a half,

274
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,960
two hours of training
per stations at Paul's,

275
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,130
they give you 135 hours
of training per station.

276
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,870
So they're really all about making you
an expert such that you have the free

277
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,860
space in your mind to think about how
to improve on the work that you do.

278
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:03,320
Now, when I was there, I was in the middle
of the store, actually a rush hours.

279
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:08,040
And so you see people working at their
stations almost like machines and that

280
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,300
sort of thing. And then maybe work
becomes monotonous or even boring.

281
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,390
And yet the general managers
of thought about this,

282
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,300
and so it's more ways
that they inject novelty.

283
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,900
One way in which they do
this is that the idea of, um,

284
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,670
letting people know the order that they're
going fall, look throughout the day,

285
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,160
the stations that they're moving
from to one, they show up for work.

286
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,100
So they created a little
bit of unpredictability,

287
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:37,550
a little bit of novelty that
allows them to stay on their feet.

288
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,210
And what's also interesting is that they
have all sorts of challenges for the

289
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:42,460
people working in the stores.

290
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,210
My favorite to date is a challenge
for the person working at the windows.

291
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,700
So the person who takes the order,

292
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,120
an interesting statistic about pals is
that they have a lot of repeat customers.

293
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:59,161
So people who eat there five to six
times a week and they have a simple menu.

294
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,140
And so people are creatures of habit,

295
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,510
tend to make the same order
whenever they show up.

296
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,600
And so the challenge for the
person at the window wounds,

297
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,550
if you can remember a hundred orders
in a row, then there is this reward.

298
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,450
And it was really interesting to see
how the person really experienced it as

299
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,490
being pushed in the work that she did.

300
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,810
And she was very happy when she actually
completed the challenge successfully.

301
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,920
So what is very true about Rabil is,

302
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:28,630
is that they have this desire for novelty.

303
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:32,440
They're not afraid of putting
themselves in situations that makes them

304
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:33,370
uncomfortable.

305
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,030
Now let's go back to the first ingredient
with the video that I want to do,

306
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,780
show you earlier. So you know
the setup. And as I said,

307
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:45,781
the idea is for you to think about how
you'd feel if you were in the shoes of

308
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:50,890
this coach. When went to watch
the video, maybe, maybe not.

309
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,180
Who knows a little bit of
novelty, um, and see what he does.

310
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,680
Pay attention to his behavior

311
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,250
and Alex, your water America. Absolute,

312
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,770
the men and women serving our
country with our national anthem.

313
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,850
Please welcome as voted by you.
The fans are a winner of the Toyota.

314
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,570
Get the feeling of a star promotion.
Natalie Gilbert.

315
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,910
Oh, say, can you see

316
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,660
the
what?

317
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,590
Hey. Ah, the stars law.

318
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,230
Stop Stars.

319
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,390
Ooh,
Scott's trial.

320
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,463
Bye.

321
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,740
Oh, the whoa.

322
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,893
Yay.

323
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,080
Eh.
Well the,

324
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,570
Eh,

325
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,620
now let me ask you a question.
Does this guy have a good voice?

326
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,010
Absolutely not.

327
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,340
And yet it took him no time to stop
in the middle of the arena and start

328
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:19,900
singing,
helping the girl who needed help.

329
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,010
What is impressive about him is that
he has no problem making themselves

330
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:24,730
vulnerable.

331
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,730
Even one that means showing everybody
that clearly singing is not one of his

332
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:34,630
strengths but rather it's a weakness and
that's what rebel's seems to be doing

333
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:35,321
quite naturally.

334
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:40,321
They make themselves vulnerable in a
way that is not back firing as we often

335
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:45,550
think you will but rather buys
them a lot of respect. In fact,

336
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,420
if you didn't feel moved in a little way,

337
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:53,800
at least the watching that I think you
have no heart because it really creates

338
00:24:53,801 --> 00:24:57,700
an emotional connections by doing
what he does it. So as I said,

339
00:24:57,701 --> 00:25:02,701
rebels that are people who seems to be
quite a happy to jump in and to help.

340
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,060
Now, they also are people, as I said,

341
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:10,870
that they have this
interesting desire for novelty.

342
00:25:10,871 --> 00:25:14,340
But I want to share a couple of more
of their ingredients. And again,

343
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,250
we're going to go back to the domain
of sport and we're not going to look at

344
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:21,940
this guy bleeding.
We're going to see a little boy,

345
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:24,630
younger boy getting
into the bees will feel.

346
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,440
And I'd like you to pay attention to the
reframing. Daddy does quite naturally

347
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,183
strike one

348
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,683
strike two.

349
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,970
Why is the greatest hitter

350
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,533
strike three?

351
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,993
Wow.

352
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,100
Now this little guy is very impressive.

353
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,010
We all tend to dwell on our weaknesses.

354
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:35,780
We often over invest in our weaknesses
and instead he shifts his attention to

355
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:39,110
his strengths. And as it turns
out, that's what rebels do.

356
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:42,920
They play to their strengths on a regular
basis and that's something that makes

357
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,030
them feel authentic in
the work that they do.

358
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,470
I was very curious about this
idea of authenticity. There
is a lot of talking, uh,

359
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,370
in the world about the
power of authenticity.

360
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:57,660
And I was interested in looking at whether
a lot of the things that we say about

361
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,530
authenticity or true and so
with my colleagues we went
to all sorts of contexts

362
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,800
to look at whether authenticity is in
fact a powerful driver in the work that we

363
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:11,820
do. So one of the contexts that we
explored is entrepreneurial competitions.

364
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,350
So imagine entrepreneurs
showing up, pitching their
ideas to venture capitalists.

365
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,880
And what we found is that
when entrepreneurs are
authentic and genuine in their

366
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:25,650
pitching, they're three times more
likely to get money for their ideas.

367
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,161
Now as in these,

368
00:27:27,161 --> 00:27:31,920
there is also an interesting part of
this story of the chef and owner of the

369
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:35,850
restaurant that I mentioned earlier,
Osteria Francescana, you can see him here.

370
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,410
His name is Massimo Bottura.

371
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,730
Really interesting person and leader.

372
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,400
In fact, it is a person
and went to a context that
traditional Italian dishes and

373
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:51,150
reinvented them. Now I don't know
how much you know about Italians,

374
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,640
but there are two things
that are very true.

375
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,480
One is that there are lots of
rules when it comes to cooking.

376
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,970
And we cherish our old ways.

377
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,510
And he went to a context where
there are lots of traditions.

378
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:08,511
So were recipes have been passed on for
centuries from generation to generation.

379
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,140
And he basically messed up the tradition
and came up with something new.

380
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,090
So we studied traditions very carefully
and then started asking question,

381
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:22,980
well maybe made sense. Um, cooking this
dish this way 20 years ago, but not today.

382
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:27,150
Let's do something different.
So if you have ever had Lasagna,

383
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:31,440
this is his version of the Lasagna is
called the crunchy part of the Lasagna.

384
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,730
It looks nothing like the
type of dishes I grew up with.

385
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,350
Now what is interesting is that when you
open the restaurant traditional moment,

386
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,050
Italians weren't too happy.
In fact,

387
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:46,650
he talks about it as actively
fighting against him.

388
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,400
And when I asked him what
allowed him to stay persistent,

389
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,830
you told me about the
power of authenticity.

390
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,260
And in fact you told me about the story
of the summer that he spent at the bully

391
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,520
at the time,
quite a famous restaurant in Spain.

392
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,520
And what he learned from the chef there.

393
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,870
And it was really a message of feeling
the freedom and expressing the freedom of

394
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,410
playing to your strength
and staying authentic.

395
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,440
And so this is the quote is that what
changed me was the message of freedom.

396
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,290
The foreign gave me the
freedom to feel my own fire,

397
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,750
to look inside myself and
make my thoughts. I dibble.

398
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,750
And sure enough after the
summary went back to Moderna,

399
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,760
he sold everything that he had.

400
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,650
You borrow money from his wife's family
and then invested the money and the time

401
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:32,820
in the restaurants came up with the
recipes and a few months later the first

402
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:35,520
Michelin Star arrive and the
second one and the third.

403
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:39,060
And as I told you in 2016 the
restaurant became the restaurant.

404
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:43,330
The best restaurant in the world and of
Italian pride is since it was the first

405
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:47,500
time when you tell your restaurant
reached the top of the list. Now again,

406
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,870
his interest,
his story's interesting,

407
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,550
but as a scientist I was curious
to know whether he's stories more

408
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:55,420
generalizable.

409
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,230
The idea that authenticity is really
powerful to help us persistence through

410
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,064
challenges.

411
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,460
So one of the studies that we conducted
to look at this is by bringing red sox

412
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:10,750
facts into HBS campus.
And what we did,

413
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:13,510
we gave them, um, one type,

414
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,190
one or two types of wristbands to where
either the wristband of their favorite

415
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:22,450
team, the red sox, or the
wristbands of the New York Yankees.

416
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,500
And then we put them through all sorts
of challenges in the hour that we had

417
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:28,630
with them.
And at the very end,

418
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,920
one of the challenges was to ask them to
put their dominant hand in a bucket of

419
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:33,754
ice.

420
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,020
And so we were paying them the longer
they kept their hand in a bucket of ice.

421
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:41,890
We were interested in seeing
whether a UC persistence,

422
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:44,410
more persistent when people
experience authenticity,

423
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,830
even in the case of tolerance
to pain and physical persistent.

424
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,110
And sure enough across all the different
challenges we put them through people

425
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:57,490
who felt authentic just for wearing the
wristband of their favorite team or much

426
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:02,140
more likely to persist through challenges
even when he came to keeping their

427
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:06,460
hands in the bucket of ice
at the end of this study.

428
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:11,461
So just in their authenticity is really
quite powerful in helping us resist the

429
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:15,070
through challenges.
Now what this tells us,

430
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:19,150
and the reason why I'm telling you
these stories is that they are quite

431
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:23,710
interesting in showing one of the
talents the rebels seem to have.

432
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,400
There are people who play to
their strength quite often,

433
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,630
but they also help others do the same.
A few years back,

434
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:35,680
I came across a quote of an
Italian sculptor, an artist.

435
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:39,210
They're really stayed with me. You
probably know some of his work. Um,

436
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,230
his name is Michela Angelo Buena Bonati.

437
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,720
Heres what you wrote about
the sculpting processes.

438
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:49,721
Sad sculpting is a process whereby the
artist releases and ideal figure from the

439
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:52,690
block of stone in which is lumbers.

440
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,440
To me that's very powerful because it
raises the question of what if we were to

441
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:03,991
look around in our professional lives
at work or in our personal lives and

442
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:10,201
starting with the assumptions
that fundamentally everybody
has talent and that

443
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:14,560
our role as colleagues,
as leaders,

444
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,820
as parents, as friends, is
to help them bring those out.

445
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:23,710
So I bought into this idea and then I
started the questions asking question of

446
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:25,120
how do we do that concretely.

447
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,130
And so I'm going to leave you with a
couple of examples that maybe my trigger,

448
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:30,910
some suggestions or ideas in your head.

449
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,940
The first story comes
from Ariel investment.

450
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:38,890
This is a Chicago based money management
firm and the president of Ariel

451
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,400
investment is the woman that you see in
the picture. Her name is Mellody Hobson,

452
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,060
remarkable woman,
really successful,

453
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,810
really interesting what she does to
bring a lot of these talent into your

454
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:55,580
organization. And when I asked her to tell
me a little bit more about her career,

455
00:32:55,581 --> 00:33:00,050
she told me that she started working
at Ariel at the age of 22 right after

456
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:03,170
graduating from college,
no working experience.

457
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:08,990
And she's been quite successful.
So what was the secret to her success?

458
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,260
She referred to the advice that she
received directly from the CEO at the time

459
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,710
on the first day of work, and
this is what this, you told her,

460
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,970
you're going to be in rooms with people
who have a lot of money and have big

461
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:26,630
titles, but it doesn't mean that your
ideas are not as good or even better.

462
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,070
I want to hear your ideas.
It's incumbent on you to speak up.

463
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,870
So from the very first day she had the
license of bringing our contributions

464
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:40,160
forward and this is advice that she
shares with everybody at the firm or

465
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:42,650
everybody that she brings into the firm.

466
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,700
Now back in 2011 I had an opportunity
to think about how to apply these ideas.

467
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:53,420
I was working with a company
called the Wipro technologies.

468
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:57,230
They're based in India and in particular
my colleagues and I were working with

469
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:59,840
their business process outsource
inside of the business.

470
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:03,770
So imagine people working
in call centers now,

471
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:06,590
as you might imagine,
it's a tough job.

472
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,650
And in fact what we were was experiencing
was investing a lot in people,

473
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:16,070
bringing them in and then
45 to 60 days into the job,

474
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:20,180
most people were leaving the organization,
so not the greatest investment.

475
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:25,181
And so we did an intervention with them
where we gave people who joined half

476
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,060
hour of reflection. We ask them
to think about their strengths,

477
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,500
to think about what's unique about
them and how they could play to their

478
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,690
strengths more often at work.
And the,

479
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:40,370
since we wanted to test the ideas and
some of the people actually went through

480
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,920
this revise the welcoming process,

481
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:47,000
some of them went through the regular
welcoming process and we print them.

482
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,600
We looked at turnover rates seven
months after the intervention.

483
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,400
And what we found is that this moment of
reflections where people had the chance

484
00:34:55,401 --> 00:35:00,401
to think about what makes them authentic
and how they could bring that out into

485
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:02,390
work was quite powerful.

486
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,230
So people were more likely to be with
the organization seven months later.

487
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,630
There were also much happier in their
jobs and they perform better as we know

488
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:16,220
from the railings on customers' calls.
And what is interesting,

489
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:19,220
I think about this study is that it's
in a context where the job is very

490
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:22,640
scripted,
suggesting that even there,

491
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:26,120
there is an opportunity for
us to rely on this talent.

492
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,810
So what these different
studies and stories tell us
is that rebels play to their

493
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:36,230
strengths on a regular basis, but they
also help others do the same. And again,

494
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,590
I felt very inspired by learning about
this in a way that made me think about

495
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:42,840
work a little bit differently.

496
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,590
So let me share a final ingredient
and then we're going to open it up for

497
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:50,470
question. This is a,
I think at the moment,

498
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,490
one that really puzzles me and it's a
talent for curiosity and it puzzles me

499
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:01,830
because we're all born with it.
In fact, if you look at the data,

500
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:07,140
he curiosity peaks at the age of four
and five and then it declines steadily

501
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:11,490
from there. I think that that's a
sad finding and a missed opportunity.

502
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,410
And I don't know if you can still remember
the time you were cared is way too

503
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:17,161
long ago for me.

504
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:22,161
So I think about my children who are at
the age where curiosity is really coming

505
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:27,150
out and it's constant questioning.
Just before I left for this trip,

506
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,640
they were asking questions
about why is the sky blue?

507
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:33,030
Or why is it that we need to wear
clothes when we leave the house?

508
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,630
It's constant exploring and a
sense of wonder and question.

509
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:39,240
And we seem to be losing that.
And in fact,

510
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:42,090
when I looked at this in the
context of organizations,

511
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,320
I looked at people who are starting
new jobs across the different sort of

512
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:50,670
industries. And it seems like
curiosity is pretty high as you start.

513
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,060
But when you go back to the same people,
six to nine months later,

514
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,120
curiosity a dropped across the board by
at least 20% it doesn't have to be that

515
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:02,910
way. And in fact of rebels or people
who keep their curiosity alive and also

516
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:06,390
encourage it in others.
So I'll give you a couple of examples.

517
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,400
One comes from intuit.
Every year they have innovation at words.

518
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,130
And these are for people,

519
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,240
a ransom explorations that led to
new products and new processes,

520
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,420
but they also have failure words and
these go to people lose explorations did

521
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:28,830
not end up in a new product but
led to good learnings for the team.

522
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,000
And what's most exciting about this
example is that the failure of words come

523
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,290
with a failure party.

524
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,420
So you're really creating an atmosphere
where explorations is in fact supported

525
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:40,350
and valued.

526
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,970
Now we started it with a story about
the restaurant Osteria Francescana.

527
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,490
So we are going to end with a
story about this restaurant.

528
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:52,770
This is a very busy night
at Osteria Francescana and
one of their sous chef that

529
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,700
is known internally.

530
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:58,140
A stacker was working on the last dessert
of the night and it was a lemon tart.

531
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,480
Tac has done for being obsessed with
precision and attention to detail.

532
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,930
And so he was working very
carefully arranging the
different pieces on the plate

533
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,500
and all of a sudden the plate drop to
the floor and I yet as mashed a lemon

534
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,840
tart.
Now Taka was starting to panic,

535
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,480
trying to understand and
figure out what to do.

536
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,810
And as it was feeling this way,

537
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,060
chef Massimo Bottura walked into the
kitchen and saw the plate on the floor and

538
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:32,061
rather than yelling as I bet a lot of
leaders would do in fancy restaurant,

539
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,620
he looked at the plate and said,
I think we have a new item for our money.

540
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,000
And sure enough they came up with a new
dessert is not one of their most popular

541
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:46,480
desserts at the restaurant.
And um, it looks like this.

542
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:47,980
I took a picture of when I was there,

543
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,640
it smashed on the play even
in a way that is prepared.

544
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,440
And the name for it is, oops,
I dropped the lemon tart.

545
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,620
And he's just a great example of
how curious people are curious.

546
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:07,621
Leaders like him are able to even look
at accidents or mistakes and turn them

547
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,120
into a source of inspiration.

548
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,990
So it seems as if these rebels do
have a recipe to their success.

549
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,820
And if you look at how
they use their talents,

550
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:25,450
there are all sorts of behaviors that
they engage in on a regular basis.

551
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,810
And there are many of them
I write about in the book.

552
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:33,040
I just captured the fewer of them on the
slides and is not for talking through

553
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:36,610
them. But just to give you the
idea that a lot of these things,

554
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:41,611
a lot of these behaviors are not
requiring a complete restructuring of the

555
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:44,980
organization or rethinking
over what we're doing,

556
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,490
but they require some
thoughtfulness on our part.

557
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,760
Now this rabble shares five talents,

558
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,520
no matter what industry or um,

559
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,200
a job they do. And we talked
about some of them in more detail.

560
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:04,120
They have this talent for authenticity.
They have a talent for novelty.

561
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,910
Rather than going with the
familiar and comfortable,

562
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:11,080
they challenge themselves
have a talent for curiosity.

563
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,760
They have a talent for perspective.
A little bit like what Palmieri did.

564
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:19,840
One looking at the problem rather than
being stuck on the obvious answer,

565
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,670
it looked at it from multiple perspective.

566
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:24,670
And finally they have
a talent for diversity.

567
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,860
So there are people really reject
social rules that are passed onto us by

568
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:34,570
society and they think about surrounding
themselves with people who think

569
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:39,430
differently and can challenge their way
of thinking. And then really leverage,

570
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,680
um, differences. So let me stop here.
I have many more story to tell you,

571
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:49,681
but I'm kinda curious to see
what questions are on your mind.

572
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,240
Yeah. Before we get into that, let
me just remember or remind you,

573
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:57,510
if you're on the live stream,
feel free to Ping Al Rahim Murali.

574
00:40:57,511 --> 00:41:00,660
So He's a l e r a, h. I. M.

575
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,710
That we can start with the room.

576
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,720
So that great talk. Um, I'm just curious.

577
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,170
So the literature on creativity shows
that people are most creative under some

578
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:17,440
level of constraint. Total freedom is
not great for the creative process.

579
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,274
Similarly,

580
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,570
do rebels depend on there
being some shared assumptions
for them to question and

581
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:23,500
break to some extent?

582
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,710
And does that mean not everyone can
be a rebel in an organization? Right?

583
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:31,540
There has to be some kind of
shared culture or structure
or something like that

584
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,660
for them to operate best.
Huh.

585
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,880
So, uh, in one of the chapters in the
book that comes a little bit late,

586
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:42,881
or I talk about the principles the rebels
live by and it was something that was

587
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:48,200
inspired by, uh, going
potentially to a strange place.

588
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,290
So one of the organizations that they
studied this as it was working on this

589
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:54,500
book was pirate ships in the 16th century.

590
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:59,530
They are fascinating and I had all
sorts of wrong ideas about them and the

591
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:00,441
ships,

592
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:05,090
the crews actually had principles that
everybody agreed upon before they left

593
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:09,710
for, uh, uh, for their
journeys. And similarly, uh,

594
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:12,110
rebels,
the Av principles,

595
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:14,720
one of them is finding
freedom in constraint.

596
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,820
So you're right in saying that the fact
that that, um, that our structures,

597
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:24,800
norms, rules allows them to bring
out some of their creativity.

598
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,020
Now to your question of,

599
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,740
does that mean that that affects the
number of rebels that we have in the

600
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:31,574
organization?

601
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:36,350
I usually receive the question in the
form of what's the exact percentage of

602
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:39,740
rebel that I should have
in the organization. And my
answer is always the same.

603
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,740
It makes people feel uncomfortable.
It's 100%.

604
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,010
And the reason is that if
we look at this balance,

605
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:51,370
there is nothing threatening about them
other than requiring a little bit more

606
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,360
openness to people that bring
into work different perspectives.

607
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,430
And one of the things that is true about
rebels is that you get to being more

608
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,770
innovative,
to perform better in your job,

609
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:07,580
to have better relationships at work
and because you're fully engaged in the

610
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:11,570
work that you do.
And so I've been struck by the data that,

611
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,650
um,

612
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:17,650
is very well known about engagement across
the globe and the fact that there are

613
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:25,270
two third of workplaces full of people
were disengaged or actively disengaged.

614
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,970
He's just puzzling and strange.

615
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,210
And I've met some of those people
and really the experiences,

616
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:34,820
the work sucks for many of them.

617
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,910
And so I think that we're
encouraging rebelliousness.

618
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:41,480
You also get the engagement that
leads to all sorts of benefits.

619
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,800
So a hundred percent

620
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:46,663
yeah.

621
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,510
You mentioned that, uh, rebels
play to their strengths.

622
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:56,010
And so I wanted to ask a question related
to growth mindset and fixed mindset.

623
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,230
Um,
so if they're playing to their strengths,

624
00:43:58,231 --> 00:44:00,960
does that mean they're not improving
or building on their weaknesses?

625
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,330
And do you think then,
uh,

626
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,860
wondering if you think it's like not
useful to do that and just like focus on

627
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:08,730
building more strength?

628
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,500
Yeah,

629
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,110
so I actually think that if you look at
the two talents that I talked about a

630
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,730
capture these idea of,
of learning and growing.

631
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:20,660
So novelty means putting
yourself out there in situations,

632
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:23,990
the challenges in a way that
allows you to develop new skills.

633
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,360
And so that's the part
of the growth mindset.

634
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:31,570
But there is also this idea that you
focus a lot of what you do and gives you

635
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:32,514
energy.

636
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,640
That is what I mean by playing to your
strengths as a way that makes you feel

637
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,400
outstanding.
So I don't see the two in contradictions.

638
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,660
It seems like rebels do
both quite, uh, quite well.

639
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,320
And one of the things that
are across the board. Um,

640
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:50,970
I don't use the label
growth mind is as much,

641
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:53,850
but I use a thirst for learning,

642
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,140
which in a sense it's similar and this
a willingness to grow in their job is,

643
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:01,620
it's quite important for rebels.
In fact,

644
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:05,310
some people say what about a organs
where arrogance is not part of their

645
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:08,580
playbook, but the humility is, um,

646
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,380
I'll give you a quick
story if you don't mind.

647
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:13,380
And it's in one of the chapters
where I talk about perspective.

648
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:15,350
The person I mentioned, they're, uh,

649
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,080
they're really surprise me as a captain
that you probably all now and his

650
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:20,400
captain Sully Sullenberger,

651
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,540
this is the captain who ditch the play
when 155 passenger in the Hudson River

652
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,760
back on a call live in, you know, 2009.

653
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,520
And when I found myself
reading the accident report,

654
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,310
I was amazed by what he did.

655
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:35,320
You had 280 seconds to make a decisions.

656
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,940
That's the time that he had when he
discovered that there was no thrust in the

657
00:45:38,941 --> 00:45:41,190
engines and the timing ditch
the plane in the Hudson River,

658
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:46,550
most of us under such time pressure and
stress would narrow our thinking and

659
00:45:48,741 --> 00:45:52,330
options.
He instead was broadening his perspective.

660
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:54,990
He kept considering what it
is that we could be doing.

661
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:59,070
And I reached out to him since I
was curious about his approach.

662
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:01,890
And what I've learned is that by
the time the accident happened,

663
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,840
he had a ton of experience over
30,000 hours of flying under his belt.

664
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,500
He has served in the military,
so he had all sorts of experience flying,

665
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:14,630
all sorts of planes. He had served
as a volunteer in previous accidents,

666
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:16,890
so so in knew a lot
about what can go wrong,

667
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:22,050
but every time he walked into the cockpit
it would ask himself what it is that

668
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:24,750
could be different. In this case,
what it is that I could learn.

669
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,830
And so he kept that intellectually
melody that I seen a lot of rebels that

670
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:33,510
allows them to keep looking
at the experience as a signal.

671
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:37,470
Not that they know it all,
but that there is more to grow and learn.

672
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:40,880
We have a question from the livestream.

673
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,720
Most of the examples you
shared involve men as rebels.

674
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:48,980
How do you think that rebellious
behavior is treated when those rebels are

675
00:46:48,981 --> 00:46:50,900
outside of the gender or ethnic majority?

676
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,970
A very good point. And I tried, um,

677
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:57,870
in the book to actually be
much broader in the sense of,

678
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,183
um,

679
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,640
not only going outside of
the United States but also
having both examples of men

680
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:09,240
and women as well as
different, uh, groups. Now,

681
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,360
what I collected some data on this,

682
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:16,361
this since one of the questions that
I always receive is the can a women or

683
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:20,370
minorities break rules
as much as a white man?

684
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,700
And the answer is that
we perceive they can't.

685
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,600
But actually the benefits of embracing
these talents are equal for men and women

686
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:36,430
and for all sorts of groups, which
I think is quite refreshing. Um,

687
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,580
for gender. More specifically
ended up after the book came out,

688
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:44,581
I ended up writing a blog post for HBR
where it talks specifically drawing on a

689
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:49,270
chapter on the book,
on gender issues.

690
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,800
And sort of giving tips out of the book
of why is it and how is it that women

691
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:57,310
can, uh, break rules. But yeah,
so we have the perception,

692
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:01,990
but it's the wrong perception and
we can all break rules equally.

693
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,440
I think we have time.
The legal line.

694
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:16,040
Thank you for your talk. I'm curious
about the downsides of being a rebel.

695
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:21,440
So all the examples you gave are
about the upsides and the rewards,

696
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:25,430
but obviously there's a lot of
inherent risk as you make yourself

697
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,840
more known,
take bigger risks or decisions.

698
00:48:29,841 --> 00:48:32,090
So what research have
you done in that area?

699
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:37,510
So part of it is the fact that you're
pushing for something different.

700
00:48:37,641 --> 00:48:38,800
And so,
uh,

701
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,310
I think the keys of water is a great
example where you might fights,

702
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,240
have to fight some resistance,
uh, before getting accepted.

703
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:52,810
But in terms of when is it that they could
really go wrong or when the costs are

704
00:48:53,391 --> 00:48:54,350
really high.

705
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:58,640
I think that for that it happens
for rebels that are not effective.

706
00:48:58,641 --> 00:49:02,090
And what I mean by this is that often,
especially new organizations,

707
00:49:02,091 --> 00:49:06,410
what do you feel that maybe
the top leadership is not
supporting this approach?

708
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,440
People get frustrated and that frustration
often turns into the wrong delivery

709
00:49:12,711 --> 00:49:15,890
as you're trying to use this talent.
I'm going to give you a concrete example.

710
00:49:15,891 --> 00:49:19,910
So after the book came up as you
don't mind Rumi and a message and sad,

711
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,600
I saw the book, I bought
the book, I read the book.

712
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,870
I think that you need to change
your subtitle. I was like, okay.

713
00:49:26,871 --> 00:49:31,150
It says why you to break the rules working
going in life. And we're scientists.

714
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,880
So I obviously always want to
learn and I might be wrong. Um,

715
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,710
so I called them up and we
had the conversation for
two hours and I basically,

716
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:43,580
his argument was, I'm the perfect
rebel based on your descriptions,

717
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:47,030
but things are not working out for me.
And from what he was saying,

718
00:49:47,031 --> 00:49:49,400
I couldn't quite figure it out.
And as it turns out,

719
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:51,500
his job is right outside of Boston.
And I said,

720
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:54,920
why don't I come for three
days and follow you at work?

721
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,850
Like a neutral observer in the background.

722
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,710
And I thought you would be a great
experience for me just to learn about is

723
00:50:00,711 --> 00:50:05,690
approved. And after the first half
a day I was like, okay, I get it.

724
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,080
And you was the delivery that was wrong.

725
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:14,081
I think it was really frustrated by
what the top leadership was encouraging.

726
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:18,530
And so it was using a lot of arrogance.
So, so for example, in a meeting,

727
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:20,990
and it was, this was just priceless. Um,

728
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,950
the group was talking about a decision
that the company was considering and

729
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:26,990
everybody talked before him was agree,

730
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,560
the fact that that it was
the right approach of looking
at this decision and he

731
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:33,170
was raising his and it was super angry.

732
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:36,050
And then when he got called on it sad,

733
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,830
I understand what you will sad
and why you might think that way,

734
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,090
but it's actually the wrong way of
approaching the decision. In fact,

735
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:47,810
I cannot even think of an even more
wrong way of looking at the decision,

736
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:51,110
what I suggest we do instead. And then he
blurted out his answer and it was just,

737
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,190
um,

738
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:56,420
in between crying and laughing and seeing
that because the approach was wrong.

739
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:00,350
So I think that that's
often when things get, um,

740
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,650
a little bit difficult for
people and they encounter costs.

741
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:08,180
Great. Thank you. I'm sure
we had a lot more questions,

742
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:12,630
but unfortunately we are out of
time so I'll leave you with that.

743
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:15,350
If you have extra questions,
you should feel free to reach out.

744
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,280
I'll also leave you with the
following thing, some of you my, um,

745
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,880
feel maybe not at ease with the idea.

746
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:27,881
And so to get started on this wonderful
journey you might want to go to the book

747
00:51:28,641 --> 00:51:30,920
website is called rebel talent.org.

748
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,790
And there is a little test that tells
you which type of rebel you are.

749
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,720
So which type of talents come
more easily or less easily to you.

750
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:41,900
And so you're going gonna receive some
tips and if you come out as a pirate,

751
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:45,800
it's a good thing.
It's actually quite a very good thing.

752
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,390
So thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
