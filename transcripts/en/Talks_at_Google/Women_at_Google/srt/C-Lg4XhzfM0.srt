1
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,130
Okay. So Hi everybody and
excited to be here today.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,840
We're here in mountain view with Michelle
gale who's joined us to talk about the

3
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:21,800
mindful parenting life in a messy world
with her latest book that just came out.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,260
So we're very excited to have Michelle,

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,590
a little bit about Michelle before we
get started and then she'll be able to

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,590
tell us all about her messy world.
Um, and also take questions for,

7
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:35,200
for us.
And hello out there on the live stream.

8

Michelle is a mindfulness teacher and
executive coach specializing in working

10
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:45,230

17
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,600
So thank you very much Michelle.
And without further ado,

18
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:16,270
I'll hand it over to you. Yeah. All
right. Do you have enough from Michelle?

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,110
Hi everyone and hello to the
people on the live stream as well.

20
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,360
Um,
the last 24 hours of my life,

21
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:31,880
I've been really messy and I'm assuming
we have a room full of parents are

22
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:36,200
mostly parents. And so you did
it. You're here, you can cry,

23
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,960
congratulate me as well.
It was amazing that I got here and,

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,380
and it, it's a lot as a parent just to
kind of get to where you need to go.

25
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:50,381
So I'm giving you a deep bow just for
being in this room and being that this,

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,880
we're gonna be talking about mindfulness.

27
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:55,610
Why don't we just take just
a moment of pause. I love,

28
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:59,400
we have the g pause sign up here so you
don't have to change anything, you know,

29
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,280
to do anything. Eyes Open, eyes closed.

30
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:03,980
Just kind of following your breath
a couple of times. Breathing in

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,790
and breathing out
and breathing in.

32
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,780
Breathing out.
And one more time.

33
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,580
Breathing in
and breathing out.

34
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,030
Yeah. Now we're here just a
little bit more. I am too.

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,010
So I hear all great presentation. Start
with a story. That's what people tell me.

36
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,210
So that's what I'm going to start with.
So this is a picture.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,780
My son Brody is the one in the Hoodie.
He's 11.

38
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:44,260
This picture wasn't taking
that long ago and um,

39
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,370
he had a few friends at our
house and one of the boys,

40
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:53,371
one of the other boys started talking
about a tragedy that happened in his

41
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:58,090
family many, many years ago. But
it was a pretty intense tragedy.

42
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,830
And the other two boys listened intently,
really listened.

43
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,130
They were asking some questions and there
was a real gravitas to what was going

44
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,980
on in the room. And I was just in
the kitchen kind of hanging back,

45
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,370
just observing and watching and kind
of taking it all in and all at once.

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,490
Brody, my little guy said,
I know what we need to do.

47
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,040
We need to have a compassion circle.

48
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,710
And so he took them and one of the kids
said, well, I've never done this before,

49
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:34,700
but he said, don't worry
about it. I'll, I'll tell you
what to do. You know, Cecile,

50
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,690
I'm feeling very proud
now that every penny,

51
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm going to tell you these two
stories about my kids there.

52
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,320
These are like the best ones.
This isn't like life every day.

53
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:47,810
Let's make that clear, right? I
make that clear right now. Um,

54
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,090
but this was a good one.

55
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,070
So he walked them through
all sharing about, you know,

56
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,130
about what was just said and sending
good wishes to this past place.

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,750
And they were in the circle for a
couple of minutes and then, you know,

58
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,230
they went on their evening,

59
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,940
they kind of unlocked hands and they were
going on a night walk with flashlights

60
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:13,360
and and off they went.
But I was,

61
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,430
I of course as the Mama, I mean I was a
little teary eyed and a little stunned.

62
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,550
I mean he's done things similar
to this but not quite, you know,

63
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,150
he knew what to do right in that moment.

64
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,450
He'd had the practices in him enough
through me and I didn't teach him to go do

65
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:31,930
compassion circles.

66
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,410
He just had had the sense to
pause and to stop and to check in.

67
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,670
So one more story, and this
is my son Tyler, again,

68
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:46,810
not taken that long ago
and he's an athlete.

69
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,000
He is extremely active. He has two
speeds, you know, full speed, no speed.

70
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,930
And he's had a lot of injuries
in his very short life.

71
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,150
And he was subbing and a basketball
game with a friend of his,

72
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,740
he wasn't even supposed
to be playing in the game.

73
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,860
He actually was there just to watch and
they were short a player because it was

74
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:09,700
winter break. And so they asked him to
play, which he did. I wasn't even there.

75
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,230
I had no idea he was playing basketball.

76
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,040
And I get a phone call that he had
gotten pushed and shoved and fell and his

77
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,130
best friend kicked him,
broke his collarbone,

78
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,810
trying to keep the ball in, but you
know, 40 seconds left to the game.

79
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:29,500
So he was in an incredible amount of pain.
The paramedics came and got him.

80
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,210
We ended up in the hospital.

81
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:36,211
Of course on one side of us in the
hospital was a meth addict who's had an

82
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:40,150
infection and was not very present.

83
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,460
And on the other side was a man who'd
been brought in and very rare apparently I

84
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,290
found out later.
And the emergency room,

85
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,500
the trauma unit was there trying to
keep him alive and he did not stay alive

86
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,950
right next to us.

87
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:58,951
So Tyler experienced that and we kind
of paused together when we realized this

88
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,830
man had passed and send them good
wishes and put our hands on his heart.

89
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,480
He was an incredible amount of pain.

90
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:10,430
Apparently the collarbone is only
second to the spine to break.

91
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,560
So we got home very difficult to get
them in the car, to get him home,

92
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:19,910
to get them slowly down on the bed. I had
to help him go to the bathroom. I mean,

93
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:24,530
he couldn't do anything for himself.
And when I finally got him settled,

94
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,640
here's the, here's the
moment. He's like, mom,

95
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm getting to have the experience
of what it's like to be disabled.

96
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,980
You are, you are. And he said,

97
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,830
you're getting to see what
it's like to be a disabled,

98
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,840
to take care of a disabled child.
I said, you're right. I am.

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,210
And then I'm gonna try not to
get weepy. He said, you know,

100
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,590
I'm going to have a lot more compassion
for disabled people moving forward.

101
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,650
And again,
you know,

102
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,710
I'm stunned and I got teary
eyed with him and he said,

103
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:07,700
why are you crying? Of course
he's 14 why are you crying?

104
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,450
And I tried to explain to him
in the best language I could,

105
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,750
how remarkable it was that in
the greatest pain of his life,

106
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,450
for sure,
he's never been in this kind of pain.

107
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,510
The darkest one of the
darkest moments of his life.

108
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,390
He knows he's not going to
play sports for a few months.

109
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,320
That you were able to find the learning
and the beauty in this mess that you're

110
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:39,050
in. And I told them, most adults don't,

111
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,220
don't get there in a lifetime,
in a lifetime. Right?

112
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:48,221
To be in that space and to see the
potential and to see the positivity.

113
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,043
Right?

114
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,730
So I love this image because we
learn the most and we have the most

115
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:04,151
opportunities to awaken and to find our
mindfulness and to find our compassion

116
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,380
in the most difficult parts of our lives.

117
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:11,990
Right in the cracks,
in the darkness.

118
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,280
This is where this is
where the opportunity is,

119
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,720
but we don't like that,
right? When things go wrong,

120
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,180
we want to push it away.
You know,

121
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:27,770
we want to push away the unpleasant and
we want to hang on to the pleasant and

122
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:28,521
that's normal.

123
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:33,080
That's what we do as human beings and
this is where these beautiful practices

124
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:37,490
that I guess I'm assuming I'm preaching
to the choir in this room and on the

125
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:38,420
live stream,

126
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,660
that mindfulness and compassion is
important to you and this is what these

127
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,740
practices offer us,

128
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,790
that we can start to hold the
pleasant and the unpleasant,

129
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,230
but you know the dark and the light,

130
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,770
the beauty and the Yuck in our lives
at the same time and be able to see

131
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,074
clearly.

132
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,200
I love this quote I think goes so
well with what I just shared by Rumi.

133
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,580
Don't turn away,
keep your gaze on the bandage to places.

134
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,980
That's where the light enters you.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,540
And that's really just what
happened to my son Tyler,

136
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,900
and to my son Brody during
the time that there was,

137
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,960
they were sitting in darkness and it
was in this wounded place that the light

138
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,190
and turn both of them,
and we can all have those,

139
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,850
those experiences, and we probably
all have had them. Certainly.

140
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:37,380
When you ask people what is the greatest
learning of your life, you know,

141
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:39,780
tell me about the time that you
learned the most about yourself.

142
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,920
Very few people will point to something
fantastic. They weren't at Disney world,

143
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,130
you know,
they weren't like Dan out dancing.

144
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,440
Usually it's something heavy, right? It's
a sickness. It's an illness, it's a death.

145
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,270
It's one of those things that brings
us to those, those heavier places.

146
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,760
So I'm not trying to be depressing.
We'll lighten up a little bit. Um,

147
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,030
and I love this quote as well. By Rumi,
the cure for the pain is in the pain.

148
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,900
So we want to dive in.
We want to go deep.

149
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,940
We want to be willing to go in and
dive deep in the last 24 hours. I,

150
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,770
my youngest son, Brody, the
compassion, the compassion
man, how to really hard time.

151
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,340
He has a lot of learning differences.
School is a struggle.

152
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:26,370
We've changed schools almost every year.
He's been having a really hard time.

153
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:31,371
And he had the meltdown of meltdowns
yesterday and it took everything in me to

154
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:37,800
sit with him and find compassion.
It was really,

155
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,790
really hard. But I knew the cure
for the pain was in the pain.

156
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,820
And I knew my job was to sit with him
just like I did year after year when he

157
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,930
was very young and we
didn't understand why.

158
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,650
Always having a temper tantrum always
on the floor. We didn't understand.

159
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:56,670
We didn't know at that time what was
going on. And he's a wonderful kid,

160
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,770
super creative, nonlinear, um,
but a lot of barriers to learning.

161
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,230
And,
and when he was younger,

162
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,400
that was my practice to sit with him as
the temper tantrum went on and to sit

163
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,520
with him and to let him know,
I will hold this with you.

164
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,400
And that was what I tried
to offer him yesterday.

165
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:16,350
And that was when my husband
tried to offer him yesterday.

166
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,090
We will hold this with you. We are
willing to sit in this pain with you,

167
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,150
this messiness and hold this with you.

168
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,750
And there's light in here as well
that you can't see right now. Hey,

169
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,000
mindful parenting and a messy world.
That's why I named the book what I did.

170
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,560
So what gets in our way?
You know what gets in our way.

171
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:42,510
This tree is on the ground.
What we want is to be that,

172
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,930
that redwood tree standing tall.
You've probably heard that image,

173
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,550
you know of the Redwood, the wind comes,
the storm comes, it kind of blows over.

174
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,120
But then it comes back up. And I like
to add that, I didn't always know this,

175
00:11:55,121 --> 00:12:00,070
but redwood trees have very deep, not
deep roots, you know, very shallow roots,

176
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,610
but they're connected to
community around each other.

177
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:05,590
They're connected to
family around each other.

178
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,410
And I think that's a beautiful
metaphor for the parenting journey,

179
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,310
is that this is,
this is what we do at home as a family.

180
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:14,110
No matter what that family looks like.

181
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,990
We have shallow roots that were all
hanging on sometimes for dear life,

182
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,530
but we're all hanging on
to those roots together.

183
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,770
And that was what we were trying
to be with my son yesterday.

184
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,250
And this is, this is what I
think is the big Aha for me.

185
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,220
I've been noodling on this
statement for a while.

186
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:39,520
Everything's fine until it isn't.
And then it is again,

187
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,980
and actually wrote a blog post
about it not too long ago. Um,

188
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,440
when I was in traveling
over the holidays and this,

189
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:53,410
this is what gets in our way because
everything's fine and then it isn't.

190
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:56,740
And then it is and we don't like
it when it's not, when it's not,

191
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,350
we believe something's wrong.
Yeah.

192
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,030
And if we're always believing
something's wrong, when it's not okay,

193
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,790
then we're never going to have those
opportunities to find the light in the

194
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:13,210
crack. Right. We need to be okay with our,

195
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:15,010
not okayness because let's face it,

196
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,880
how many parents in here parents raise
your hands? So pretty much everybody,

197
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,540
almost everyone.
Parenting is hard.

198
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,730
It's not easy.
You know,

199
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:29,731
I've been focused on these practices and
working on myself and doing inquiry and

200
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:34,771
sitting on my cushion and going
through trainings and teaching and,

201
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,040
and I still have a hard time. My
parenting is hard. It's not easy.

202
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:43,630
It's not meant to be easy. And we're
meant to fall and then get back up.

203
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,320
So here is what happens.
The movies, right?

204
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:54,610
We all have this movie in our mind
of how things are supposed to be.

205
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,260
We've all had this experience,
right?

206
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,180
We're going to someplace special with
our family and we've been thinking about

207
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:04,330
it and we have it in our mind and the
movie and what it's going to be like.

208
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,630
And then we get there and nothing goes
the way we planned and the movie's not

209
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:15,490
matching reality. And what happens, right?

210
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,070
We go downhill, we, we
kind of Sab it will,

211
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:21,520
self sabotage will
sabotage our experience.

212
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,620
So what mindfulness gives us,
and I'm sure you've had this experience,

213
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,980
is to see the movie,
right?

214
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,090
We see the movie playing yesterday,
all day with my son.

215
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,660
I saw the movie is not supposed
to be this hard, right?

216
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:38,560
That's what I'm telling myself.

217
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,620
I'm seeing the images of him calm and
going to school every day and not calling

218
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:47,680
and the nurse not calling me and you know,

219
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:50,800
I have this movie of what
it's supposed to be like,

220
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,550
but I don't buy it.
I don't buy it.

221
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:58,700
And when we have our mindfulness,
we don't buy it. Right.

222
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:02,510
And I love the image of mindfulness. You
know, this is something that happens,

223
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,370
like something that we assume that we
consider it as not good and in some way,

224
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,050
and then there's our reaction and
we don't have our mindfulness.

225
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,300
These two things are
right next to each other.

226
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,600
There's the bad thing and
then there's a reaction.

227
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,170
And when we have our mindfulness
and we have our compassion, no,

228
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,140
this space opens up and we've
all had that experience of, Oh,

229
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:31,700
this time there was a little bit of
space and I was able to make a different

230
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,890
choice and make a different decision.

231
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,910
And in family life we want
to be watching those movies.

232
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,380
What is the story? What is the story that
you tell yourself about your children?

233
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,480
What's the story that you tell yourself
about your relationship to your children

234
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:51,980
and does it match? It's an
exploration and there's no one answer,

235
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,990
but I encourage you to journal Journal
on those stories. What are they,

236
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,960
what are the stories that you
hold true about your family?

237
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,670
I have one about my two boys that
they're supposed to be super close,

238
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,190
right? Aren't brother's
supposed to be super close.

239
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,500
My husband and I had two
kids to live vicariously

240
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,540
through siblings cause
we're both only children.

241
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,120
So we wanted to see what it was like.
Right?

242
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,990
That was my first mistake that
we had this movie in our mind.

243
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,260
Oh we get to see siblings.
Well they are,

244
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,920
couldn't be any more opposite in the
world and they don't like each other that

245
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:29,220
much is the truth. You
know, they have moments.

246
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,900
And so I've learned to just take those
moments for what they are and, and,

247
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,320
and just keep planting those seeds of
love and connection between the two of

248
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:39,154
them.

249
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,320
But the movie is not working
out the way that I planned and,

250
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,560
and I work on being okay with that
not being okay because it's hard.

251
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,610
It's hard.
So this is,

252
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,580
these are all pictures of my
family and we're happy and worth

253
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,760
Myleene and we're connected.
Right. So what do you think,

254
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,620
what could you imagine all of these
pictures having common? We're on vacation.

255
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,540
And the other thing that all of these
pictures have in common is that there was

256
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:17,760
fighting beforehand,
not long before,

257
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,390
just a little while before there
was arguing and bickering. And Ah,

258
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,590
the day from the beach
photo that you're seeing

259
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,340
that full day was what I wrote this
blog post about, you know, and,

260
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,490
and things happen.
Like in the morning I woke up and I sat,

261
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:35,790
I did my little meditation, we
were on the water. I'm like, oh,

262
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:40,470
this is such a good moment. You know,
I love this moment. And then my,

263
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,610
my older son,

264
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:45,840
who's an adolescent now woke up and kind
of came into the room like, you know,

265
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:49,420
it was kind of a grunt
happened and I was like, mm,

266
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,830
that's not such a good moment. I would, I
had a preferred that had been different.

267
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,480
And then my son, my two kids were sitting
on the couch reading, not engaged,

268
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:01,290
but somewhat close to each
other, both reading very
peacefully. I'm like, oh, see,

269
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,960
this is so nice.
This is a nice moment.

270
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,250
And then it was time to leave and there
was an argument of who is going to sit

271
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:09,001
in the front.

272
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:12,990
And so that big argument happened and
I didn't like that moment and like, oh,

273
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,790
not okay,
this is not okay.

274
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,120
And then we're on the way
there and nineties hip hop
plan and we're all singing

275
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:20,954
in the car.

276
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,020
I'll see you were a nice normal family,

277
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,410
having a good time listening to music.
And then it's time to go

278
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,100
stop somewhere to get some food
before we go to where we're going.

279
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,600
And no one can agree on the food.
And everyone's got food allergies anyway.

280
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:36,570
And my husband's storm.
Yeah,

281
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,570
that's for three cafes to get food.
I'm like,

282
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,150
why does it have to be this hard? Right.
And then there we are on the beach.

283
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,870
Not long after, but that's the
way of that. Right? That is

284
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,230
the way of it. That's just
parenting. That's just family life.

285
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,180
And it's very easy.

286
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,760
And I know you have all thought,
God,

287
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,640
it's a really rough day.
It was a really rough day.

288
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,110
But if we look at the moment,
like the moment by moment by moment,

289
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:14,460
it's kind of like when you're sitting in
meditation and sometimes it's peaceful

290
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:18,960
and you know you can kind of ease into
it and then the mind goes wild and you're

291
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:23,961
just kind of trying to figure out where
you're going and hang on and then you

292
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:28,710
kind of settle again. Right. It's up and
it's down. And that's just the way of it.

293
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,590
So those are the pictures you didn't
see, right? You didn't, didn't

294
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,633
those pictures on?

295
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,250
It's a grammar or anywhere,
you know,

296
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,400
I didn't talk about how we were arguing.
Right.

297
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,490
I might tell my friends, but
we don't see that. Right.

298
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:50,660
We don't see that out in social media
land. We keep that to ourselves.

299
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,770
So you know,
all of these emotions come through.

300
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:00,740
We've got the anger,
right.

301
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,540
Anger comes and we're not happy.
We're not supposed to be angry.

302
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,700
Anger is not okay.
And the fear comes.

303
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,420
And I don't want to be afraid or
we don't even realize we're afraid.

304
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,250
We're just reacting from afraid.

305
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,570
And then shame comes right?

306
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:23,840
That Mack daddy emotion that
disregulates everything else.

307
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,580
And there's the shame that I snapped
and I raised my voice. Right?

308
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,930
And what if you knew that even
after all of these practices,

309
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,520
I still raise my voice.

310
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,780
I've been trying not to yell
for 10 years and I do it less,

311
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,330
but I still do it. And then it happens.
And immediately the shame comes.

312
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,850
But I have to know it's there.
I to be aware of the shame.

313
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,280
This is the gift. There's gotta be
a little space. So I see the shame.

314
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,040
And what if you knew, right? What if,

315
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,570
what if you knew how me and my kids work
to each other and how angry that made

316
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:06,290
me sometime. Yeah. And what
if you knew I was terrified.

317
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,140
I'm terrified that my kids won't
be friends when they grow up,

318
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,050
but they're not going to be close that
they're going to have two separate lives.

319
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,520
That really scares me.

320
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,550
Yeah,

321
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,270
but what we know is that
awareness is like the sun.

322
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,580
When it shines on things, they are
transformed the Wise Tick Nhat Hahn.

323
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,770
And so just even what I did
right here with you, right? The,

324
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,580
the Uber Vulnerability standing in front
of a room of people and sharing is all

325
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,620
those things are true that I shared
with you. I'm not making them up

326
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,380
when we shine a light on
the shame and the fear,

327
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,420
all right,
and the anger something happens.

328
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,600
It's like when we're sitting in meditation
and we're thinking, thinking, thinking,

329
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:56,120
and then we notice the thought,
right? That's our practice.

330
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,470
We noticed the thought like a bubble gone,
right?

331
00:22:00,471 --> 00:22:02,000
We shine the light of awareness on it

332
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,080
and then we feel like this. We're
like, whew. You know, I, I'm aware.

333
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:14,081
I'm awake and we do that moment by moment
by moment and we do it and we teach

334
00:22:14,271 --> 00:22:17,750
our children to do it and we don't teach
them to do it by telling them how to do

335
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:19,400
it.
We,

336
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,010
I teach my children to do that by saying
out loud what's going on for me? Right?

337
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,880
So I'm Sam in the kitchen and everybody's
having a hard time and I'm finding

338
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:32,810
myself really irritated.
I might say I'm really irritated.

339
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,980
Like I'm noticing like my jaw is tight,
my stomach feels a little sick,

340
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,110
my heart feels a little tight. My test
area feels a little tight. I need a break.

341
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,330
I'm about to say something
I don't want to say.

342
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,830
So I'm going to go away and I'm going
to come back. I'm going to go away,

343
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:49,820
I'm going to breathe a little bit,

344
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:52,610
I'm going to get a little space and I'm
going to come back and don't do that

345
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:53,031
every time.

346
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:57,410
Sometimes I blow it all right and I say
something I wished I hadn't said and

347
00:22:57,411 --> 00:23:00,980
then I have to repair.
But the repair is just as good.

348
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,360
The repair is just as good as catching it,
sharing it,

349
00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:07,760
making it explicit. Right? If we are,

350
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:12,761
if we as parents are practicing and
waking up and becoming more conscious and

351
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:18,881
we're saying it out loud where we're
giving them this experience to voice,

352
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,970
then they learn how to do it.
They learn.

353
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,160
Yeah.

354
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,930
So how, how do we do this as parents?
And many of you may already practice,

355
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,250
but I have something to
offer. So here we are, right?

356
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,920
This is the kind of what
our lives often look like.

357
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:41,630
We're falling asleep at our
desk. We're just spent, right?

358
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,471
We're completely spent,

359
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,960
we're trying to get bills paid
and we're trying to get work done.

360
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,510
And it's just hard. It's hard to make
it all happen. So how do we do it?

361
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:52,970
How do we do it in the course of a day?

362
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,240
Cause this is how I often
feel. I'm like, come on,

363
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,180
come on in her piece now
I don't have all day,

364
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,680
but we know that's
impossible, right? Sometimes.

365
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:07,470
Like why couldn't I just be one of those
people that born somewhere and just

366
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:12,060
live in a cave? And it's just what
had happened because that's just not,

367
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,830
it's not the life that we're living,
right?

368
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,610
We,
everyone here in this room,

369
00:24:15,611 --> 00:24:20,500
we're all working parents and we have to
weave it in to what we're already doing.

370
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,190
And this is good news to experience.

371
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:27,280
Peace does not mean that
your life is always blissful.

372
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,500
It means that you are capable of
tapping into a blissful state of mind.

373
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,330
Admit a missed the normal cath,

374
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,980
have a hectic life and Jill Bolte
Taylor wrote the book stroke of genius.

375
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:43,390
If you've never read that, so wonderful
book and I love this quote, I'm like, Oh,

376
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,630
you know, we just have to be
able to tap into it and just
touch, touch, touch. Yeah,

377
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,050
we can have hard days.
We will have hard days.

378
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,810
I don't think you could be a parent and
not have a hard day whether you have one

379
00:24:55,811 --> 00:25:00,340
or two or three.
So we can,

380
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,580
we can play.
I love these images because for me,

381
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:08,350
they all point to things that
I tried to do in my day. I,

382
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,800
I took on a practice not long ago, like
how many times have we heard our kids?

383
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,490
Like, can we play with me? Will you play
with me? And what's often the answer?

384
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,500
I can't on busy or making dinner.
Right. And I was hearing that, right.

385
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,570
My mindfulness practice help
me here. Like, oh my gosh,
I say that so many times.

386
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:30,930
And so I committed to saying Yes for one
week just to see how it would go every

387
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,620
time. Now this was not
when they were three, so

388
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,160
am I be a little different?
So you might have to say like,

389
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,700
I'll give myself 10 times or something.
I don't know.

390
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,900
This happened when they were all older,

391
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,870
so it wasn't happening
like 10 times a day. Um,

392
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,510
but I said yes.

393
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:53,090
I started saying yes and it was the best
little research study I ever did inside

394
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:59,400
of my family. We had the sweetest
week. So I kept it going.

395
00:25:59,401 --> 00:26:01,620
And I can't always say yes.
Sometimes I have to say now,

396
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,760
but I've learned to say yes
more than I say yes. No, yes,

397
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:08,190
I'll jump on the trampoline.
I mean Jeremy on the trampolines,

398
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,230
Super Fun. There was a really fun
games that you play on the trampoline,

399
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,870
you know? Yes to the card game,
you know? Yes to the sword fight.

400
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,333
Yes.

401
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,020
And it might be that we're just
walking down a busy road. Right.

402
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:24,490
That's a great time to practice.

403
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,640
Walking from here to your next
meeting or back to your desk.

404
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,540
What if it was just a mindful walk
would if you were just really paying

405
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:35,260
attention to your feet,
hitting the ground and that was it.

406
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,680
Or just following your breath or just
even like feeling your hands swing from

407
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:43,150
here to wherever you're going next.

408
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,050
And you know when our kids are having
a hard time, can we really just pause?

409
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,980
Can we just stop? Can we
listen? And dinnertime,

410
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,350
such a good one. You
know, dinner times we,

411
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,360
we don't eat dinner together every night
and he's stretching the imagination.

412
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,020
Although I would love to, but it
feels almost impossible at my house.

413
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,590
But when we do,
and we do as often as we can,

414
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,720
we hold hands and we do this little
hand squeeze that goes around and,

415
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,650
and it's the sweet moment of connection
or we can be thankful for how the food

416
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:21,144
got to us.

417
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,193
Thank you.

418
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,410
The farmer that planted it and the person
that tended it and the truck driver

419
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:31,170
that came and picked it up and brought
it to the grocery store and the grocery

420
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:34,290
store person who took it out of the
track and the person who put it so

421
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:38,370
beautifully out in the grocery store or
to the farmer's market and mom or dad

422
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:42,780
who went and got it and brought
it home and cooked it and wow,

423
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:48,300
we can be grateful. We have a
gratitude jar on our, in our kitchen.

424
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,390
It's actually a little too big. I need
to get it a little bit of a smaller one,

425
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:51,960
but it's,

426
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,070
it's a big gratitude jar and it says
gratitude jar on it and I keep paper and

427
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:59,280
pen right next to it and you know,

428
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:03,690
we'll just go through practices of
every morning or at night or if we have

429
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:08,490
friends over just writing a gratitude
and putting it in. Right. That pause.

430
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,000
Just that moment. So we build it
into what we're already doing.

431
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,810
We pause, I just press the
pause button throughout the day.

432
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,840
And so dedicated practice that you're
seeing more in these images are important

433
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,630
and research tells us
that, you know, retreat,

434
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:33,310
practice and regular dedicated practice
is very supportive for our wellbeing and

435
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,610
for our, for our brains. And as parents,

436
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:41,260
we all know that dedicated practice
where we stop for 20 minutes, 30 minutes,

437
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:45,880
go away for a day, go away for a few
days is not always possible. You know,

438
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:49,210
when I started practicing
about 10 years ago, regularly,

439
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:52,390
I was introduced in college when
I was having a really hard time.

440
00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:56,410
I went to a unity church
and sat every Sunday there.

441
00:28:56,411 --> 00:28:59,650
And so that was my introduction
to guided meditation,

442
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:04,651
but I didn't start practicing regularly
until I had a four year old and a six

443
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:08,980
month old.
That was when I entered practice.

444
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,360
So I had to be really
creative of how I practiced.

445
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:16,870
And I remember one of my teachers,
I was complaining to one of my teachers,

446
00:29:16,871 --> 00:29:20,200
I can never get to my meditation
practice and it's just never happens.

447
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,990
And I was all grumpy about
it. And she said, well,

448
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:24,250
tell me a little bit about your day.

449
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,340
So I'm telling her about my day and
I get to the end of the day and like,

450
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,350
and they always made me stay in their
room at night and had to stay there until

451
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:35,340
they fall asleep.
And then I,

452
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:39,000
and then I'm too tired to practice and
you know, you know what's coming next.

453
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,930
She's like, why don't you just sit
in their room? I was like, Huh,

454
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,710
why don't I just sit in their room?

455
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,120
So I put a cushion in their room and
we made this agreement that as they're

456
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,850
falling asleep at night,
I would stay in their room.

457
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,150
I would sit and I would do my meditation
and cuddle with them first and do our

458
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,130
little rituals and then
I would sit and I say,

459
00:29:57,131 --> 00:30:00,730
I'm not leaving until way after you're
asleep. I'm doing my practice in here.

460
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,050
And I did that for years when
they were really little. Right?

461
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,280
So what are the things that
you're already doing that you can,

462
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:13,750
we've integrated practice that we're
talking about walking to the office or

463
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,850
walking down the street or
dedicated practice that you
can even do and in one of

464
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,850
your kids' rooms, if they're super young
and let you in, if they're teenagers,

465
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:25,510
they might not let you in.
I'm no longer allowed in at night.

466
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,750
Um, you know, we start where
we are, wherever we are,

467
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,170
wherever we are,
we can have a moment of practice.

468
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,060
And you all saw as soon as we came
in, we took a few breaths, right?

469
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,600
Everything shifts, everything shifts.
No matter how busy we are busy.

470
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:47,440
Our mind goes. Just a few
breaths. Brings us back

471
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,201
though.

472
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:55,201
I'm just going to run through some of my
favorite ways of weaving it into to my

473
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,100
day or things I like to share.

474
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,620
I mornings are so wonderful and you
don't have to get a bed. You know?

475
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:06,700
I've done a lot of practice with
Jon Kabat Zinn and he always says,

476
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,290
lay there Shavasana pose. Just open
your eyes so you're not too sleepy.

477
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,660
If you can close your eyes and
not fall back asleep, that's fine.

478
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:17,290
When you wake up in the morning,
just lay there and follow your breath.

479
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,380
Do a body scan.
You may that to get out of bed.

480
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,420
I will often also get up and
sit on my pillow, you know,

481
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,480
with my husband there and I'll just sit
and close my eyes until someone comes to

482
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:35,050
bother me and I practice not being
annoyed that I got interrupted in front my

483
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,893
dedication.

484
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,830
My Bell didn't go off yet and
I'm not done. Oh, I'm done.

485
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:47,790
It's over. I'm definitely
done the shower. Right?

486
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,020
I've done a lot of executive coaching.

487
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:54,430
I can't tell you how many times you've
heard this, the best ideas in the shower.

488
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,220
Why do we have the best ideas in the
shower? We've paused, you know, we're,

489
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,710
we're in sensation when we're
in the shower, the mind quiet.

490
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,930
So what if we did that intentionally when
we got in the shower and we just felt

491
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:12,640
the hot water on our body and we just
allowed ourselves to be there in the

492
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:16,110
shower.
One of my favorites,

493
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:18,030
I love my cup of tea in the morning.

494
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,590
I'm a big fan of Earl grey tea and usually
gets pushed off and gets pushed off.

495
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:24,960
I boil the water and my husband's like,
the water's boiling again. I'm like,

496
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,460
I know,
but I still would've made my tea.

497
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,100
I'm dying to make my team and
I keep getting interrupted.

498
00:32:29,101 --> 00:32:31,620
And then there's that moment to me.

499
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:36,060
It's one of the magical moments of my day
that I stopped and I just put my hands

500
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,120
on the cup and I smell it and just give
myself 30 seconds or a minute to just

501
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,580
enjoy the heat of the water.

502
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:51,050
I love this image. I, when I
saw this image, I thought, oh,

503
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,980
what a great practice. So I tried
it and it sounds a little hokey,

504
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,470
but it works every time.

505
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,950
For one day I tried it and then
I continued it every day I,

506
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,850
every time I caught a glimpse of
myself in the mirror or in my computer,

507
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,800
I would say something kind to myself.

508
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,720
I would send myself some kindness like
you're depending on the day, right?

509
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:19,400
It might've been you're doing the
best you can, you know, I love you.

510
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,460
Whatever it might be,
I just send myself some kindness

511
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,700
and mindful listening. You know, kind
of mentioned that a little bit earlier,

512
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:30,220
but if you practice mindful listening,

513
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,350
it's just that stopping and noticing
any thoughts that are in your mind when

514
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:38,290
someone's talking.
Are you trying to respond or you really,

515
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,690
really gifting your presence
and with our children,

516
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,800
particularly any older besides
me, teenagers in here, a few,

517
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,940
few teenagers mindful listening for all
of you that are on your way to teenage

518
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:53,050
hood, it's so critical. And the
car right, they get out of school,

519
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:55,330
they get in the car. When a most of
us do from the time they're little.

520
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,060
How was your day? What happened,
you know, how was your test?

521
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,740
We start pummeling them with all these
questions and they what often they shut

522
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,740
down. Even little ones. Well sometimes,

523
00:34:05,741 --> 00:34:07,450
I mean the little ones still
want to tell you everything,

524
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,960
but certainly as they get older,
that's it.

525
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,360
So I've learned,
you know,

526
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,000
I picked them up and I just nothing
and just say, I'm happy to see you.

527
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,080
I'm so happy to see you.
That's it.

528
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:28,410
And almost always the conversation
will come and it's on his terms,

529
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,730
not my terms. And so it arises
out of the car, use the car.

530
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,010
And by the way,
when they come to be teenagers,

531
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,820
they sit in the back with their friends
and for some reason you're not there.

532
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,433
You get all kinds of

533
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,360
good information.

534
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,930
How do you not know that I'm
sitting right here? Yeah.

535
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,280
So great. And just don't say anything.

536
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,190
I love this image to sitting in the car.
Also dropoffs pickups.

537
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:02,670
Anybody you have to drop the kids off
or pick them up at an activity. Anybody.

538
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:05,160
Yeah,
lots of activities in the car.

539
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,010
Beautiful place for dedicated practice.

540
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,990
And I dropped my kids off to Jujitsu or
baseball or wherever they were going and

541
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:17,991
I'd sit in the car for five 10 15 minutes
or at pickup to sit in the car for

542
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:23,340
five, 10 15 minutes. Use
your insight timer. Simple
habit. By then, simple habit.

543
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:26,610
I did a seven day series for parents.
It is five minutes a day,

544
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,580
so if that supportive,
I'm not sure if it's free or not,

545
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:32,910
but it is on simple habit.
Headspace.

546
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,480
Put your ear buds in, sit in
silence, had a guided meditation.

547
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,500
Just sit in the car.

548
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,823
Oh,

549
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,650
and the smile, the smile. We
can really take in the smiles,

550
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,890
right? The Joy. We can bring
the joy and more fully.

551
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,160
So I really encourage you all to make a
list. It doesn't have to be right now,

552
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:04,270
but remember to make a lift of what
you do from the time you wake up in the

553
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:06,100
morning till the time
you go to bed at night.

554
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:09,880
I'll do this with parents and workshops.
I'm doing a workshop here next week.

555
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,990
Maybe we'll do that.

556
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:16,510
Make that list and look and
see where can you weave.

557
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:20,620
In a moment of mindfulness. I mean,
be really specific, you know, wake up,

558
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,670
walk to the bathroom, you to
take my shower, make my tea,

559
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:26,530
make lunch for my kids.

560
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,363
Right?

561
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,160
Where can you weave in
a moment of mindfulness?

562
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,333
Okay.

563
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,080
Because it really is, it's, you
know, we've heard this, this phrase,

564
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:40,480
it's like exercise. It's like
building a muscle, right?

565
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,010
We have to build that muscle and so we
have to practice over and over and over

566
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:45,820
again.

567
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,470
One of my teachers gave me a centering
practice that I did 50 60 70 80 times a

568
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:54,360
day, depending on what my day was
like. I would do it more. I'm like,

569
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:57,640
kids were very young. I couldn't
get away to a retreat. In fact,

570
00:36:57,641 --> 00:37:01,900
I thought I was the biggest
fraud meditation person
because I'd never been on a

571
00:37:01,901 --> 00:37:06,901
retreat and I was bemoaning this to one
of my teachers and they really stopped

572
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:12,460
me in my tracks and said, no,
Michelle, this is the gift, right?

573
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,050
This is what you're going to get to share
and this is what we all need to learn.

574
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:16,884
His parents.

575
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:22,050
That just those moments again and again
and again cultivates an awakened life

576
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,150
and that's what we all want. We want
to live awake, we want to be mindful

577
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,543
so

578
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,920
we can, we can feel the joy is, it's
not just so, it's not just about,

579
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,620
I like to say it's not just about the
sadness and it's not just about like

580
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,560
dealing with the frustration
and the pain and the anxiety,

581
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:45,920
which sounds so wonderful for,
that's what brought me to practice.

582
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,840
I have a lot of natural anxiety.

583
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,240
I have it right now and it's not
because I'm nervous. I haven't,

584
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:53,600
most of the time my chest is tight,
my belly is a little tight.

585
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,840
I always kind of feel like I
can't breathe in all the way.

586
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,350
I was just born that way and that was
one of the things that brought me to

587
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:00,861
practice,

588
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:05,861
so it's wonderful for those things and
we can experience the joys even more.

589
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,510
Right?

590
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,460
We can really smell the scent of our
baby's hair when they first get out of the

591
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:14,720
bath in the morning.

592
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,240
And we can watch them play and see them
learning new things as they get older.

593
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:23,190
And just being, aw, I,

594
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,780
we want more moments of awe
and practice brings us to our,

595
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,370
and it brings us to a fierce heart.

596
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,020
And here is what I think is one of
the most magical parts of practice for

597
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:38,854
anyone,

598
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,950
but particularly for parents because our
heart is going to get broken over and

599
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:45,820
over and over again.

600
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:50,260
And we're going to find our lives and our
heart on the floor in a million pieces.

601
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:54,070
And you know, from those movies,
movies that weren't working out,

602
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,000
and we're going to pick it up,
I'm going to put it back together.

603
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,210
And each time we put it back together,
it gets stronger.

604
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,800
And the question we all have for
ourselves is, can my heart remain open?

605
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,760
When, when things are
hard, you know, can I,

606
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,430
can I have that fierce open heart?

607
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,453
Okay.

608
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,760
And it's okay that it's cracked and
it's okay that it's not perfect,

609
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,520
right? We're not, we're not
trying to perfect ourselves.

610
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,920
We're trying to perfect our love.
And I have a story I'll read you.

611
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,970
I think we have enough time.

612
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,550
I love this story. I, the
first time I heard it was um,

613
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:44,030
from Tara Brock and it is from,
it's written by Richard Selzer.

614
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,290
It's from stories for the heart compiled
by Alice Gray and it's called the kiss.

615
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,530
I stand by the bed where a young woman
lies her face postoperative her mouth

616
00:39:54,531 --> 00:39:55,790
twisted in Palsy.

617
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,630
Clownish a tiny twig of the facial nerve.

618
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,510
The one to the muscles of
her mouth has been severed.

619
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,970
She will be best from now
on. Nevertheless, to remove
the tumor from her cheek,

620
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,530
I had to cut the little nerve.
Her young husband is in the room.

621
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,050
He stands on the opposite side of the bed
and together they seem to dwell in the

622
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,740
evening.
Lamplight isolated from me private.

623
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,350
Who are they?
I asked myself,

624
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:29,590
he and this rye mouth I have made who
gaze at each other and touch each other.

625
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:31,880
So generalists generously.

626
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,120
Well my mouth always be like this.
She asks. Yes, I say it will be.

627
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,410
It is because the nerve was cut.
She nods and is silent,

628
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,530
but the young man smiles.
I like it.

629
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:49,640
He says it's kind of cute all at once.

630
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,660
I know who he is,
I understand and I lower my gaze.

631
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,560
One is not bold in an encounter with God.

632
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:02,810
Unmindful he bends to kiss her
crooked mouth and I am so close.

633
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,350
I can see how we twists his
own lips to accommodate her,

634
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,050
to show her that their kiss still works.
Okay,

635
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,820
so can we show ourselves and can we show
our children and our families over and

636
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:20,990
over again?
Each time you take a downturn,

637
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,950
can we show them that it all still works?

638
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:30,080
So when the anger appears, can
we do that? You turn right.

639
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,960
Can we notice the anger?
Have that pause?

640
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,860
Can we do the u turn and come in
and explore? Can we get curious?

641
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:41,570
What is this anger? Where is it coming
from? What's it about right? As soon,

642
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:46,490
you know, curiosity kills
anger in a second. The second
we get curious about it.

643
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,420
There's a,

644
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,630
there's some space and then we have the
opportunity to do something a little

645
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:53,390
more creative than we
might've done otherwise.

646
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,170
And when the fear comes, right, we
notice it, it arises. Can we stop,

647
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,650
do the u turn and come in and notice,
ah,

648
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,780
this fear and John is Zinn often says,
and this too,

649
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,870
and miss two,
I can include all of this

650
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,690
and we get curious
and then the shame,

651
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,560
can we do the u turn and see
what is this about this shame?

652
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,110
Can I explore it?
Can I understand it better?

653
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,170
Okay.

654
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,210
And then we give ourselves
in self compassion.

655
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:36,500
I'm a student of Kristen nefs work.
If you haven't studied her,

656
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,330
she was the one of the original,

657
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,780
really the original
researcher on self compassion.

658
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,290
And she shares that what we,

659
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,460
what we need to do when we're
in these states of, you know,

660
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:53,450
really being hard on ourselves is to be
mindful, to bring up our mindfulness,

661
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,790
to realize that common humanity,
right? We all go through this.

662
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:00,470
Everyone in this room,
if you look around,

663
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,750
we were all going through this together,

664
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,460
that it can be hard and
it can be beautiful and it
can be miserable and can be

665
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:12,530
fun, right? We're common humanity.
This is your tribe, right?

666
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:15,350
In this room.
We're all connected by being parents

667
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,970
and them being kind to ourselves and
from the research she says, you know,

668
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:21,620
always put your hand on your heart.

669
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,110
So when I was doing that little
mirror exercise, I tried.

670
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:27,740
If I wasn't into strange of a place
to say something nice with myself,

671
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:31,580
put on my heart or just anywhere you
know, on my body, just to touch myself,

672
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,410
let me know.
Let myself know,

673
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,330
hm. You know, a little bit of kindness.

674
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,060
This is reality for most
people in this room.

675
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:46,440
For most people who are listening on
the live stream, this is the reality.

676
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,170
This is how it's going to be.
It's going to be up, down.

677
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,230
Everything's fine until it
isn't than it is again, right?

678
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,150
Mindful parenting and a messy world.
That's what we're living and we can,

679
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,480
we can respond more skillfully, right?
That's what you hear over and over again.

680
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,860
When you learn about mindfulness, it's
all in the choice of moving from that.

681
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,400
We live this autopilot life to get to
choose what's my response going to be in

682
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:14,754
this moment,

683
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,470
right?
So we can choose

684
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,570
hello to go down those dark places and
sometimes we are going down the dark

685
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:25,940
places. Last night I was kind of
pooped, you know, we'd been to,

686
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:29,820
I'd been kind of with
my son for hours and I,

687
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:34,290
the compassion just wasn't coming and my
husband brought the light for a little

688
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:38,850
while. I didn't have any more
light to give. And that's okay.

689
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,020
That's okay. All right. And we're blessed
if we have a partner, right, that we can,

690
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,780
that we can share that with.
Not everyone does,

691
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,770
but we can go to that side where we
can shine the light of awareness on the

692
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:55,320
fear, on the shame, on
whatever's going on for us.

693
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,530
And I don't always get it right,

694
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,910
but these guys in these
faces keep me very motivated.

695
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:05,010
And I'm sure you have your
own faces in your phone.

696
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,810
I wish I could see all of them. But this
is why we will, this is why we practice.

697
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:11,100
We practice for ourselves.

698
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:15,060
We practice for the world and we
practice for our families. And they are,

699
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,580
you know, they will bring us to our knees
in spiritual practice, our children,

700
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:20,791
right.

701
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:25,791
They will trigger every un UN
dealt with issue from childhood.

702
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,110
We have.

703
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,760
And that's also their gift to us
because they point us to our freedom.

704
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:35,220
They point us to where
the work needs to happen.

705
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,930
And I am very grateful to be on this
path with all of you in this room and

706
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:41,820
everyone listening.
Thank you.

707
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,970
Yeah.
So we'll take questions.

708
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,530
Anyone have a question in the room?

709
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,490
Hi Madison from Brazil.
I'm very glad that I eat.

710
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,620
I'm here just to gather
the yard talk here, uh,

711
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,560
at the same moment. So my,
my point is about emotions.

712
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:10,561
How you call or you teach somehow
about emotions for your children.

713
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:15,880
How do you teach them about
emotions? Yeah. Emotional
intelligence, but not this,

714
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:18,520
this kind of approach and
more like natural approach.

715
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,450
Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, that's um,

716
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,520
well one idea that I share with my
kids is naming the emotion right in,

717
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:28,320
there's some wonderful research on this.

718
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:33,350
Matthew Lieberman I think in 2014
talked about does naming the emotion,

719
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:36,900
how that clears the prefrontal Cortex,
calms the Amygdala.

720
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,490
So we teach them just to
name it, you know, like, and,

721
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,320
and I think that's in a lot
of the parenting literature
now. Oh, you're angry,

722
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,340
right? Oh, you feel sad. And it might
seem a little Hokey, you know, to do that.

723
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,220
We do it more often when they're young.
Um,

724
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:53,250
but we can also inquire with
them when they're older.

725
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:57,060
Like what is the emotion and if you can,
depending on your child,

726
00:46:57,061 --> 00:47:01,650
my kids are kind of used to it now.
Like where is it in your body located?

727
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:05,490
Is there a color? What does
it feel like? Like, so they,

728
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,690
what we want is for them to get to know
their emotions and the body is where

729
00:47:09,691 --> 00:47:10,524
they live.

730
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,790
We experienced them in the body long
before they come into cognition.

731
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:20,690
And another little trick with emotions
that I also like to share his time them.

732
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,950
So when they were really little and
they'd say, I'm so angry and like, wow,

733
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:30,730
you're really angry. Let's see how long
it lasts, how long can you be angry?

734
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:34,780
Right. And put on the timer, let's
see how long it can be angry.

735
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,380
And now it's a game. Right? So now
it'll pass quickly. But you know,

736
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,290
cause now they want to see how
long it can pass. But you know,

737
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:45,700
within 60 seconds or a minute, you
know it's gone. And so they see, oh,

738
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,140
so what, what we're teaching
them is it comes and it goes,

739
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:53,950
it begins and it ends. Have you ever
been angry all day? I'll ask them.

740
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:58,860
Well No, not really. It's usually not
that way. It's usually not that way.

741
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,540
So that helpful. Many
else, hold on one second.

742
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:04,374
One off the mic.

743
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,530
Thank you. Thank you for being here
and sharing your story. So yeah,

744
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,720
quick question.
Like you mentioned there is,

745
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,470
let's say structured practice that
you sit and meditate and there's being

746
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:17,880
mindful drone turn your day.

747
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:20,880
And then you mentioned a lot of different
ways have to teach to the letter one.

748
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,180
Have you ever tried to do
like a structured practice,

749
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:28,050
meaning less sit down together and have
a meditation session with your kid?

750
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,563
Yes.
Well I,

751
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,440
the way I came to teaching meditation
was actually went through the mindful

752
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:35,360
schools program.
I liked,

753
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:39,230
cause I wanted to teach it to my kids
at home and I ended up teaching in their

754
00:48:39,231 --> 00:48:42,890
school. So I taught in their school
as a volunteer for three years.

755
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:45,860
So they got it from me there and I found,

756
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:50,840
at least for me anyway at home to
actually try to explicitly teach it.

757
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,270
Most kids won't, most kids
won't. But I let them see me.

758
00:48:56,271 --> 00:48:58,760
Right. So if they come in my
room and I'm sitting right,

759
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:02,170
I love Jon Kabat Zinn tells this
story of, you know, his son will have,

760
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:06,500
is zen as a mindfulness teacher in his
own right, his spirit rock and all around.

761
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,940
And, um, and he would say he'd be
sitting, John got up very early to sit,

762
00:49:10,941 --> 00:49:14,630
four in the morning all the time, you
know, did his whole yoga and meditation.

763
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,260
And he says he never ever asked
his kids to sit in meditation,

764
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,440
but they'd come in and they'd see him
sitting and he'd have a blanket around and

765
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:23,330
he said he'd opened the blanket,
you know,

766
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:28,220
and they'd come in and he'd
close the blanket and that
image to me, so beautiful.

767
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:33,170
And then they just sit there with him in
meditation. So depending on your child,

768
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:36,620
some kids will eat it up.
Books are a really great way.

769
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,310
There's so many moody cow Meditates,
I think it's called.

770
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,730
And I mean there's a whole bunch
of beautiful children's books.

771
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,470
And so reading I did, we did a lot
of reading, but explicit teaching,

772
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,050
I think it's in the weaving and
I think it's in the pausing.

773
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:53,990
Before my kids used to go to
school, um, when they were younger,

774
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,500
they started walking alone and I was
all freaked out and like so weird.

775
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:02,330
Like they're leaving without me and
I don't like it. And, and so for me,

776
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:05,650
this is a me practice. I'm like, would you
guys be willing to hold hands, you know,

777
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,420
do our little circle like we do at dinner
and do a little hand squeeze and take

778
00:50:08,421 --> 00:50:12,670
one breath. Like okay, you know, they
were willing to do it and then they,

779
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,300
if I forgot,
they would ask for it.

780
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,460
So that probably went on for
three or four months, you know,

781
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:18,970
every morning before they left for school.
One breath.

782
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,020
So my encouragement is to weave it in.

783
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:25,730
And if you have a child that is really
excited to learn, then go for it. Yeah,

784
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,280
I have question. Yeah. So tantrums.
What's the mindful response?

785
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,390
What would be a best practice if you've
just got someone who's tantruming a lot,

786
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,500
big time. Yeah. Well I think, you
know, there's a few layers to that.

787
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,480
There's always like, what's
under the Tantrum, right?

788
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:43,940
So that's always where from a
mindfulness perspective, right?

789
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:47,120
Where it's never the
behavior, right? It's always,

790
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,560
there's some emotional reaction and what
is the emotion and what is, you know,

791
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,210
it nonviolent communication,
very nonviolent communication.

792
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,850
What's the need that's not
being met? You know, and I love,

793
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,290
I think Dan Siegel does
halt, hungry, angry,

794
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:06,380
lonely, tired. You know, you can ask
yourself, hungry, angry, lonely, tired.

795
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,200
So it doesn't know what's under it,
what's causing it.

796
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:12,230
And if you can get them to
share, wonderful. Some in
the middle of a Tantrum,

797
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:14,900
not always, but then it's being
able to, like I was saying earlier,

798
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:18,710
to hold it so they know
I can hold this with you.

799
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:21,650
You're not alone in this.
We can be in this together.

800
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:26,270
And just that alone trying to stop
it is, you know, unless you know,

801
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:29,720
sometimes you're in the middle of a store
and you're like, how about a twizzler?

802
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:33,290
And that works. And that's just,
sometimes it's just survival.

803
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,400
But if you've got space
in time, hold it. Great.

804
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,160
Thank you so much. I think we're
at time. Thank you so much.
