1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,710
Hi Guys. Hi. Nice to be here on the stage.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,500
Happy to share whatever
you want to ask me.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,980
And I actually spent a bit of time up
in the creative labs one day and uh,

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,190
just saw some amazing things.

5
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:20,270
So if there's anyone in here
that I might've met hello again,

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,180
because I saw lots of kinds of music
called music apps. They're making it.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,600
So folks here in the audience
might know you from, uh,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,030
songs that were licensed to voc
or Zach Braff garden state or a,

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,130
your collaborations with Taylor
swift or Ariana Grande Day.

10
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:42,090
Or they might know about your
performative technology, uh,

11
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:45,780
endeavor in the Mimeo gloves. They
might've heard about creative passport.

12
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:50,330
They might also have heard about
you doing the Harry Potter, um,

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,900
curse in child soundtrack. Uh, all of
these things are out there in the world,

14
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,170
but seems breathtaking in their,
their scope.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,150
How do you think about yourself when you
introduce yourself at the allegorical

16
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:05,880
party? W how do you consider
yourself? What's your identity?

17
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,040
I don't know. I just say I'm, I'm,

18
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,070
I like enjoy anything that kind of is
around the intersection of music and tech.

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,910
That's what I said. I don't go to like a
musician. I'm a producer. I'm a performer.

20
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:23,350
I'm an engineer and I want some Grimey's
I just go,

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,030
I mean I'm into music and tech.

22
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,710
I'm into music and tech. Okay.
That's what I said. There's the,

23
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:32,290
the big umbrellas you consider one of
the things I've heard you reference a

24
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:36,670
couple of times and it seems
almost contradictory to my,

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,130
my image of you,
um,

26
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,490
is only do what you can
see in the headlights.

27
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:45,820
Can you talk about what that means to you?

28
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,470
I would love to, um, before the days
of Google search engine, um, uh,

29
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:56,140
we had a thing called Yahoo and, uh,
one day I was in the studio and I think

30
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,830
it's a nice story. Um,
and so I was there, um,

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,300
kind of going round and round in circles
trying to finish this song. Um, I, I'm,

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,900
so I am in my studio,

33
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,430
this is the first time I recorded a
studio and recorded an album on my own.

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,520
So I was in the studio constantly,
all by myself for like a year.

35
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,140
And so it does send you a bit mad.

36
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,710
And because I didn't have an a and r man
or anyone that would come in and go, oh,

37
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,120
that's really good. Oh, you should turn
some more up, or whatever they say. Um,

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,870
I, uh, I was going, man, a man and
so I couldn't finish this song.

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,010
So I went onto the search engine and
I just said, how do you write songs?

40
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,330
Um,

41
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,330
and I found this article about this writer
novelist who had written this little

42
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:44,960
blog and it said in it and do what
you can see and the headlights.

43
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,260
And what she meant was if in the song
you can see that there's a high hat that

44
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:51,920
needs fixing or that you could,

45
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,170
or you're trying to finish
the lyric and you know,

46
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:57,320
you can see the color of his eyes,
then just do that.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,030
Just write that bit and
just keep chipping away.

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,680
And eventually you will see the full
path ahead of you and you'll see the,

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,490
you know, all this, all the
landscape. But it's that kind of, Oh,

50
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:13,870
I've got so much to do, but so much to
do. Um, and it's overwhelming and it's,

51
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,440
you can't breathe. Um, and then
you just remember, we'll do it.

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,870
You can see now just do that.
Don't see,

53
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,960
don't do all this complicated
stuff that's far away. You know,

54
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,600
you have to get to it eventually, but you
can't see it just yet. So just do that.

55
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,250
So that's what I mean. Yeah. And I use
that a lot, um, in everything from like,

56
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,660
how do I look after my child this morning
when I've got to get to this interview

57
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,760
and I've got, you know, I just said
do he just seen the headlights,

58
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:40,440
which is make sure she has breakfast
in it. Um, and that's just, yeah,

59
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,100
it seems to me

60
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,510
how are supposed to feed them.
I hear I do six months.

61
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:48,360
I didn't see it every meal.
You know how to skip even one.

62
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,743
Yeah,
that's true.

63
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,720
It's very strict rules.
Um,

64
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,860
so one of the many things that you've
juggled a is the Harry Potter curse child

65
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,880
a soundtrack. We're going
to see a quick video, um,

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,610
introducing that album,
which has just been released.

67
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,290
[inaudible]

68
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,880
that is a bit of the play,
which is on Broadway here,

69
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,730
which is wonderful. Um, and
yeah, for about four years ago,

70
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:57,731
I got a call from a friend called Steven
Huggett who isn't movement director.

71
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,340
Tony has, he used to have this
group called the frantic assembly.

72
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,720
And when I released a,
well just after I released a song,

73
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,850
an album called speak for yourself,
which is the same album,

74
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:08,990
but I couldn't finish that song.

75
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,470
And I really sat by myself with my own
label and eventually licensed it to Sony

76
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:21,380
because I couldn't deal with all the
main orders. Um, and so, but before that,

77
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,820
um, I got this call from this Guy Steven
Holl get back then like 20 years or 15

78
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:30,680
years ago. And he's like,
are these annoying me by the
way? Should I take them off?

79
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,780
Are they present because
they're really annoying? Um,

80
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,670
anyway, so yeah, he was like, I love
this album. Speak for yourself. Could I,

81
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,900
I want to put it in this
play that I'm working on.

82
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:45,260
And there's going to be like people
dancing around it. And I was like, okay,

83
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,530
that sounds really good. And I didn't
ask him for payment and I was just like,

84
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:50,270
that sounds good. Yeah,
okay, here you go. And I,

85
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,600
I like tweaks and things that made it a
bit longer and, and that kind of stuff.

86
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,960
And then it went into this play and
it was really great. And I loved,

87
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:00,230
it was the first time I'd seen dance
to my music and I really enjoyed it.

88
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,150
Um,
but they didn't ask for payment,

89
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:05,450
but if I had been signed to a major label
at the time, they would have been like,

90
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,200
Oh yes,

91
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,500
I can just spend the whole year discussing
how much she should get for this and

92
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:14,180
then you won't be able
to use it anyway. Um, so,

93
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,350
um, so, so I basically, yeah, it was
really, it was really great. And then we,

94
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,560
we made friends and we kept
in touch. And then, you know,

95
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,040
he did all these amazing things and
then the net in, and not the next call,

96
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,250
but I call,
uh,

97
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,110
four years ago was him saying
hi images or any as he calls me,

98
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,460
I'm working on this play and can't
really tell you what it's about,

99
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,430
but they love your music
and like all this stuff.

100
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,640
Cause I did all this weird orchestral
stuff and I'm like, uh, Acapella,

101
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:44,350
a strange stuff for an, a compliment
for an old silent movie. And,

102
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,490
and nobody ever gets to hear that stuff,

103
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:50,870
but he loves me and he loves all of my
new music and he knows it all really well.

104
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,600
And so he was putting all
these random bits in there,

105
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,170
which hardly anyone's heard, and
it felt really good. And he's like,

106
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,230
I think they really just want you to meet
the music. Um, and I was like, who, who,

107
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:05,150
who is it? Um, and he said, I can't tell
you, but it's about a boy with a scar.

108
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,970
And I was like, okay, it's
a bit of a giveaway. Um,

109
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,180
and so I looked up online,

110
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,330
I saw his name connected to this creative
team who'd already announced they're

111
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:19,160
doing the play, and then I was like,
that's exciting. Um, so then, yeah,

112
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,160
I met up with Sonya who he's,

113
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,730
she's the producer and they
offered me the job and uh, yeah,

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,180
life took a very different turn. Um, yeah.

115
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,000
What was your relationship to the Harry
Potter Universe before that? Yeah,

116
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,180
um, thin, um, quite distant. Um,

117
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,870
I really don't like reading very
much. Um, I mean, that's not true.

118
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,640
I like the information that's in the book.

119
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,580
I just don't like the process
of actually reading it. Um, so,

120
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,930
and I've never enjoyed, I've never
enjoyed that my dad thinks that if he,

121
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,800
if it wasn't down to him kind
of showing me going through,

122
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:02,270
he thinks like dyslexic and maybe
because I really struggle, like,

123
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,880
you know, getting the words in my head.
Um, maybe that's why I like making my own.

124
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,870
Um, so anyway, um, so yeah,

125
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,270
so that's,
that's how I ended up in there and

126
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,870
fascinating. And if I can ask
for those of us who were much,

127
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,550
much deeper into the universe,
um,

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,170
can we fan boy and fan girl
out for a second and ask,

129
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,710
did you hang out with JK Rowling?
Did she invite you to her house,

130
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:33,450
which I assume is a magical castle that
you can only access by a unicorn or

131
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:34,770
magical boat or something?
Yeah,

132
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,670
yeah. Um, I have, I did meet the lady
herself few times. Yeah, she was on,

133
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,390
she was on set, quiet. Um, and yeah,

134
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,070
she's very nice to me.
She says she actually,

135
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:52,880
I think when I first met her she did
this division and I was like, um,

136
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,860
no, she's, she's very happy because she,

137
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,930
I mean I discovered that they really
wanted, um, they really wanted somebody,

138
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,770
British, a composer that's British
and it was a woman. Um, so,

139
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,960
so I was in there really
at all. Um, I would,

140
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,720
I think also with the health of Steven
and the fact that the director and him

141
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,700
are like best buddies,
it all, it all helps.

142
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,760
So can you tell us about the
creative process that cause as,

143
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,870
as I've heard you describe it,

144
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,800
sort of it's a creative process within
a creative process because they're,

145
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,090
they're working on, they're their own
thing. It's really awful, isn't it?

146
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,090
It's that thing, Ben. No names. Dot. Raja.

147
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,500
You can, you can absolutely call
me garages. It's completely fine.

148
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,980
Well now, even now we even, you have
your on and I quote you, I'm like, um,

149
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,690
so then, then often, um,

150
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,700
your question was what would
your, your presence, sorry. Yes.

151
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:59,590
So the creative process was, um, they
really liked a lot of existing material,

152
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,730
um, but they needed it
adapted. Um, but they had it,

153
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,630
it's a five hour play and they wanted a
lot of it to be music underscored. Um,

154
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:10,030
but they also, like, there's kind
of three different types of music.

155
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:12,040
There's music that they interact with,

156
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,260
which is when they're on the stage and
they're like meeting [inaudible] music,

157
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,820
there's the underscore and then
they've seen changes. Like, you know,

158
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,470
a wall goes across and it's like,
hmm, oh, I think it's like that. Yeah.

159
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,450
Um, and so the underscore bit is like
quite a lot of existing material that just

160
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:31,750
kind of fumbling away in the background
that's been adapted and stretched and

161
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,320
added different things and lots of high
frequencies taken out because it kind of

162
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:37,640
gets in the way of the talking.
Um,

163
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,060
so I learned a lot about how to kind of
sculpt around the vocal, like, you know,

164
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,720
human voice area. Um, and then a lot of,

165
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,520
um, yeah, lots of drones. Um, lots
of vocal loads of vocalizations.

166
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:55,120
There's no lyrics actually is any one
bit it hasn't there Rick. Um, and did,

167
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,170
that's from Hiden seat. Of
course. I didn't have to
put my famous song in there.

168
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,150
Um,
so that's the one,

169
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,870
the one song I really wanted
with the lyric and I didn't want,

170
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,230
it didn't feel right to have me sing in
it and they didn't want to have me sing

171
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:08,680
in it anyway.

172
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,680
So I got my friend's choir to sing it
and then I kind of added the vocal layers

173
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:18,760
underneath and made no strains and, and
uh, but most of the time it was just,

174
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,640
it was all about the transitions.
And that was really,

175
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:24,970
really fun and really tested
my theory skills and to like,

176
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:28,450
how do I get from that kid, how do I
modulate in there to them and how do I,

177
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:32,930
you know, do this. Um, so there's a
lot of existing material and I mean,

178
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,570
luckily,
um,

179
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,470
over the years I've been quite
vigilant into kind of making,

180
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,670
making sure that all of the songs have
their stems and they're all documented

181
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:47,050
and kind of filed quite nicely. So all
of the songs from pick for yourself up,

182
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,910
um, or have like John Strings, vocals,
backing vocals, effects, blah, blah, blah,

183
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,110
um, weird sounds arpeggiated
things, et cetera, et cetera. Um,

184
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,960
and then so I was lucky enough to be able
to pull that in and those ones that I

185
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:00,870
hadn't done, I've got this awesome, um,

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,660
assistant called Alexi and he
was in my studio back in, uh,

187
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,020
back in the village
where we live. And, um,

188
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,380
and he would be kind of getting those
together and then dropping them into

189
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,130
Dropbox.

190
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,090
I'm into Ableton sessions where then
I was sitting in the theater for about

191
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:19,320
three months and just with my little,
you know,

192
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,260
computer and my little hard drive
and whatever and had my, uh,

193
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,500
my microphone and sing little toys and
then I was just there the whole time.

194
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,350
And my only regret is that I didn't
really get to talk it to anyone other than

195
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,180
did you like that or could you make that
a bit more like this or could you make

196
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:40,060
it a bit less? Um, and uh, yeah,

197
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,290
so I didn't really get to talk
to the gang very much. Um,

198
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,610
and I was literally there from 10 in
the morning until 11 at night and it was

199
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:51,520
always, well not always, but I was quite
a lot of time. The last one, the last,

200
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,520
the last one in there saying
hi to the security guard. Um,

201
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,790
and you took all of this music,

202
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,430
it's something like a hundred cues and uh,

203
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,830
created an album. Yeah. That
sort of a cohesive album.

204
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,000
What was that process like for you?

205
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,240
Yeah. So the, the, in a theater,

206
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:12,260
it was really great cause there's like
tons of inputs to kind of, you know,

207
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,820
react against and be like, oh that sound
works beautifully with the light. Oh,

208
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:20,270
that sound as peacefully with the sound
effects or ah, the piece of that person.

209
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,600
So all of these are kind of affirmations
that that's working, that's working,

210
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:27,590
keep going, which you don't get in the
studio when you're all by yourself. Um,

211
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,180
and so,
but at the same time,

212
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:33,200
because it's a big theater system and
you don't hear a lot of the detail in the

213
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:37,010
mix, so it's kind of getting away with
murder in terms of what I could mix in the

214
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:37,940
time that I had,

215
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:41,600
which is two and a half hours of music
that like quite a lot of it done also

216
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:46,250
from scratch. Um, and so when I
finally took that back into my studio,

217
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,330
you know, it was like, oh my
goodness, I've got so much work to do.

218
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,140
It's like a gazillion pops and clicks and
all kinds of things I had to draw out.

219
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,270
Um, and then, uh,

220
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,410
and then just making it sound lush and
beautiful and layered and giving it the

221
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:02,330
attention that I do to my own records,

222
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,750
but to like when it's a 78 minute album,

223
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,010
it's like as much as I could fit
on a CD, physically possible. Um,

224
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,100
and it's 42 tracks and it's so it goes
into four acts and then like one long

225
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,590
piece of music for 20 minutes, another
long piece of music for 20 minutes,

226
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,430
but it's the going through 14 or 15 keys.
So that's where the kind of,

227
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,910
how do you get from this key to
that key in three, four from seven,

228
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:28,490
eight to today? Um, there's really fun.

229
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,270
There's a lot of hard work and I
did most of it standing up, um,

230
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,040
because I also had a life at
that time in a flat in London.

231
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,410
And so there's a little
bit just standing up,

232
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,290
but it was quite good from a pollster.
Yeah.

233
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,670
Excellent. Uh, a personal recommendation,

234
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,920
I've been listening to
the album for a while now.

235
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,800
A walking through the city and listening
to that on headphones gives you a very

236
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:52,370
weird,

237
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,370
a magical layer of New York that very
surprising because he did a wonderful job

238
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:00,920
sort of making that,
that feel magical. Yeah.

239
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,330
Which sounds like it was
kind of withdrawal and t um,

240
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,360
kind of the other, um, kind of
secret weapon I had was, uh,

241
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,850
I developed with a company
called sonic chill,

242
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,880
my own set of virtual instruments of
all my favorite sounds in my studio,

243
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,020
so that I could basically
take them on the road with me.

244
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,950
So I could have my Embera, I could
have my cello, like harmonic stuff.

245
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:28,790
I could have my cocktail kit, I could
have my Worley's your, your marks,

246
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:33,320
a phone I read, which is a ball
sort of socialists trumpet. I think

247
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,740
it's a bit like an auto Hartford,
but it has 20 things on it. Um,

248
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,780
and then I what you were thinking
of. Um, so yeah, it looks fine.

249
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,830
I see Mike and it's slow a bit
slow today. Anyway, so, um,

250
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,460
caught that, that out. Um, yeah, so I
have this, we call it the box of tricks.

251
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,550
Um, which is quite funny because it ends
up being a box of checks in a magical

252
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,500
theater piece. And I used all
of those sounds, um, you know,

253
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:06,400
to basically make things sound like me.
Yeah.

254
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,250
So I would always use the Mark's
phone and I'd use the choir of me.

255
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,150
I could play quite as on my,
I had sampled my voice.

256
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,810
So if anyone wants to make sounds
that song, it sounds a bit like me.

257
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,700
Just find the box checks and
just go like Mark's phone,

258
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:23,840
bit string of focal vocal
harmony things and some men.

259
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,680
Speaking of instruments, um, I wanted
to turn to the mimeo gloves. Um,

260
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,050
we've got a quick little
video to introduce you all
to this if you haven't seen

261
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:35,210
him for.
And here she goes,

262
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,240
Huh,
oh,

263
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,830
what do you get me out of bed?

264
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,740
Okay. So it's really not a very good
example because what happened before?

265
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:28,380
It's not your fault,
it's not your fault.

266
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,360
I think it was my team reason gave
you that. But basically, yeah,

267
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,590
well I'd done, previous to that
is I had a lift my voice by going,

268
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,890
catching my voice and then it would create
a leap and then I would catch another

269
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:43,591
leap.
Well,

270
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:47,210
I'd actually put that aside and then I
would catch another loop and then we'll

271
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:49,470
put that aside and then I
catch that, et Cetera, cetera.

272
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,860
And what I'm doing is I'm going,
uh, posture fessed up, um,

273
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,650
his record. And, um, when I'm out
of that zone, it goes to play.

274
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,190
Um, or when it goes to this so that it
plays, and then it continues to play.

275
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,780
And then I can't remember exactly,
cause that was ages ago, but, um,

276
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,090
it's something like when they want to
pull up the volume of the first leap,

277
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,210
then I would use my finger like this
and they would just be like up and down,

278
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,950
up or discuss, beat up. And
it'd be 120 127 in Mitie. Nope.

279
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,720
But like 100% a loudness. Um, and
then if I wanted to add reverb,

280
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:26,570
I just use my secret finger, a posture
which, um, basically activates, uh,

281
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,610
the reverb,
um,

282
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,130
feeder or like the Po in my software.

283
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:36,360
And it just says from naught to 100%.
So if I was like,

284
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,320
just sound like now, but if I was like
over there, it would be like, dude,

285
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,470
it doesn't a massive
cave. Um, and then, yeah,

286
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:50,471
so I play like baselines or he might
play tinkling sounds or it's just things

287
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:55,530
that I do anyway in a,
when I perform previously,

288
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,790
um,
you know,

289
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,400
you kind of have to be kind of a little
bit barricaded by give you want to

290
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:01,090
sample staff or you know,

291
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,130
you're locked in to the physical nature
of whatever books you're using and the

292
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,740
gloves are,
you know,

293
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,600
basically controllers at your
fingertips and you can just, uh, yeah,

294
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:16,470
just be very expressive to something which
is quite boring actually in real life.

295
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,090
It's just like turn off a thing
to 100%. It was like eat. Um,

296
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,170
but you could do that really expressive,
like, yeah, because I feel like that,

297
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,360
but this is much more like, oh, she's
making her voice bigger, you know,

298
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,910
or she's catching her voice and now
she's meeting it left or right. You know,

299
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,300
or maybe even in surround,
which I'm doing on the tour,

300
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,010
kind of moving it around a three d
space. Um, and uh, and then, yeah,

301
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,600
just kind of sampling my voice,

302
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:46,740
bringing in vocoders harmonizers
I can harmonize with my voice. Um,

303
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,580
sometimes I integrated with
like an IRA, a camera, well,

304
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,680
they don't make them
anymore, but a connect, um,

305
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,350
and they would map the stage into
different zones. So I could be like,

306
00:19:55,351 --> 00:20:00,300
when I'm over there, then, um,
you know, make the drums more,

307
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,470
uh, kind of sparse and when I'm back here
and make them more phonetic or when I'm

308
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,560
over there, switch Mohammed Hazard
to minor or when I'm over here,

309
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,960
or when I'm in the middle, take out my
harmonizer. So using the spatial, uh,

310
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,180
this, the stage spatially to
effect the kind of bigger, um,

311
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,990
parameters in change in a system
like Ableton pro tools or whatever.

312
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,460
Um, so it's basically like
a mapping device, but how
it feels is you take on, um,

313
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:33,020
the physicality of something which
doesn't have a physical representation.

314
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,280
It's like a filter or a bunch of effects.
Uh,

315
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,070
it doesn't have a thing that,
it's not like a basic tasks like that.

316
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:45,890
That's the Bass Guitar.
Um, it's like a rebirth a,

317
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,300
so you become the reverb and you become,
you know,

318
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:54,301
the mixing desk and you become
the multiple voices or um,

319
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,530
yeah, the, the thing that only downside
though I discovered from it, um,

320
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:03,470
other than like lots of programming and
to kind of get it so it feels real to

321
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,670
human. So the you'll never,
you'll never even thinking about,

322
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,520
actually I'm going to bring in my reverb
now I'm going to something in my voice.

323
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,840
So just, it's just, it becomes second
nature. I'm going to call my voice,

324
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,810
going to make it bigger. Now I'm going
to add some heart and some delays.

325
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:18,430
You kind of create a gestural language.

326
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,540
The more and more you use the system
because it obviously has a bit of software

327
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,670
in between it called Glover. Um, what'd,

328
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:28,450
you could also add other inputs so you
don't have to use the gloves with Glover.

329
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,490
Uh, you can use, you can use connect,
you can use a myo, you can use an iPhone,

330
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:36,810
you can use your leap motion,
you can use whether you know,

331
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,710
the types of inputs and then use them to,
you know,

332
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,120
move around things in Ableton or whatever.

333
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,510
So the gloves are essentially just trying
to get away from this limited limited

334
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:49,501
space.
I,

335
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:54,501
I felt of trying to add lots more
gear to create a fluidity or a kind of

336
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,670
spontaneity on the stage.

337
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,840
Sure. And, and for you, now that
you've actually developed these, uh,

338
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,950
do you find when you perform that
you're in them most of the time?

339
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:06,260
All the time? Yeah. Yeah.

340
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,400
I wear them all the time. All the time,
the stage because why take them off?

341
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,770
They're quite pretty and they
don't eat anything. Um, the,

342
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,900
they basically have like
eight Ben sensors. They've
got one to two, two and one.

343
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,680
They have lights for feedback and you
can program the lights to do whatever you

344
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:24,530
want. It might be like turn it red
when I'm in record, which, you know,

345
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:27,000
it's been a quarter, but it's nice for the
audience to see it. Oh, it's in record,

346
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,780
it's gone red.
Um,

347
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,990
and then it's a battery has got an imu
so you can get your kind of positional

348
00:22:32,991 --> 00:22:37,370
data and just got exit accelerometer
so you can be like John Peaks.

349
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,050
Um, and I do ag guitars
and it was really fun. Um,

350
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,370
and uh, yeah, so that kind of
combination. Then you've got your axes,

351
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:48,830
so you've got your pitch,
you've got your,

352
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:53,030
and you've got rolled and then you've got
different zones backwards, forwards, up,

353
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:53,750
down.

354
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,070
And the combination of that leads to so
many possibilities because if you have a

355
00:22:58,071 --> 00:23:00,230
keyboard and you're like,
I'm going to play a squeegee bass sound.

356
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,030
So he might be like doing and you want
it to go away now or something. Um,

357
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,560
you could do that for
pressure with pressure.

358
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,420
It can make it slightly harder
if you want it here now.

359
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:14,020
But if you want it to like do that and
change the tone or something around it,

360
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,030
um,
you would have to use your other hand,

361
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,100
which is an entirely
consumed by going well. Um,

362
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,630
and you were like suddenly just playing
a three note baseline with a wow thing,

363
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,270
but you could just be going, we all like
that the same, but just your whole hand,

364
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,460
then you can move around
the stage and do, um, yeah.

365
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,640
So it's all good for everything and it's
not good if you want to pay like some

366
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:37,510
black men in off with
your fingers. Um, but you,

367
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:40,430
you do that on the piano because
that's what the panel is for. Um,

368
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,820
it's really for all of the,
the unseen bits,

369
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,260
the bits that don't have a voice or a
physical nice. But you do get lost in it.

370
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,730
That's anything cause interesting.

371
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,080
You just close my eyes all the time
and I'm like in the zone I'm paying,

372
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,360
I hadn't see kind of layering my voice.

373
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:59,360
I'm drinking in a harmonizer and
I'm like, God, I finished a song.

374
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:03,080
Did I actually look at anyone?
Um, because it's like you're,

375
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,830
you're playing and it's like Phil's.
Yeah. Cause I have in as well.

376
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,470
I like just hear that
sound and I'm just like,

377
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,840
you just get lost because you
don't touch anything, you know, uh,

378
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,640
like a machine or whatever.
It just kind of,

379
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:21,260
if becomes really like a second
skin of visceral experience. Yeah.

380
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,780
Fascinating. Yeah, it's really cold.

381
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,410
And where in the development
process are you right now? Is it,

382
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:28,820
are you,

383
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,000
are you licensing it to someone or you
are you looking for a funding partner or

384
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,140
you,
why?

385
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,950
Well, I was gonna wait
til later, but okay. Uh,

386
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,190
no, it's you, what we've been doing
because it has been quite hard, you know,

387
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,260
I'm not, um, kind of corporate structures
and all that stuff's not my forte.

388
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,810
Um,
so we,

389
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,530
we have a team and they've grown
over the eight years since we started

390
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:58,640
developing it for my own personal
fun time use. Um, which then became,

391
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:03,150
we did some conferences and things like
this and one before and over time we've

392
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:05,860
had loads of interest,
tons and tons of emails that we set.

393
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:09,410
We set up a company eventually cause it's
like, well, maybe we should make them,

394
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,480
um, instead of, you know, just for my
own personal enjoyment or for my, my,

395
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,100
my shows. And so we did start
to development, but that's
a huge curve, you know,

396
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,440
to have to make it something
that everyone can use.

397
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:26,441
Software that's intuitive hardware
that's robust and you know,

398
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,340
cheap enough to, you know, make
enough of them. Um, so we have,

399
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,690
we've made like 50 handmade pairs for
people over the years and now we are

400
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:39,020
getting much closer to releasing
something this year. Um,

401
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,670
which just a hundred pairs,

402
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:44,450
but they will be manufactured and it
will be a lot kind of down and not that

403
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:48,060
much down in cost, but maybe in five years
time. So if enough people buy Teslas,

404
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,260
there'll be like two print next
year. Um, so, you know, it's, uh,

405
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,010
it is that they're, the early
adopters do pay the higher price,

406
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:59,000
but they get the benefit of medicine,
service and whatever. Again. So yeah.

407
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:02,630
This year we're going to release them.
Um, we have released the mini mew.

408
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,490
If you have a small child in your life,
um,

409
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,610
you can make a your own glove. Um,
it's quite basic, but it's still fun.

410
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,290
Um, and you can build it and code it
yourself. Um, and it's called the mini me.

411
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,970
Yeah. I can't wait to see it
that way. You'll go, well, I do,

412
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,050
I do have a younger sister who
might be interested in such,

413
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,590
but I can't wait to see a ballet where
the, where the dancers become musicians.

414
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,730
Yeah.
Uh,

415
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,370
so whoever out there is
doing that shouldn't do that
because it seems built for

416
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,780
a hybrid art.

417
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,410
Yeah. It's, it's you kind of, because
you use your whole body, maybe your hand,

418
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,220
right. You, you know, you
don't just be like, Hey,

419
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,670
even though you might be just getting
like that, it kind of wanted to get like,

420
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,130
you know, it's like I'm catching
was then, um, so for, for
the dancers, the, you know,

421
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:54,690
they use a whole bodies and you could,
um, I mean for fine detailed sounds,

422
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,060
it's great, but you could equally
use an infrared camera, you know, um,

423
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,850
or kind of an array, uh, to, to
have a play space but some dancers,

424
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,770
but combined with the gloves you
could get more detailed and you know,

425
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,300
really amazing timing. Like you
don't notice any latency at all. Um,

426
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,840
yeah,
it's really fun.

427
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,830
Well, speaking of, uh, broad,
uh, shifts in technology,

428
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,410
we wanted to talk about
creative passport and we have a,

429
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,620
a brief snippet of a video.
You can see the longer, um,

430
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,870
full video on the youtube.
Um, but for the moment, uh,

431
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,220
we'll show you this,

432
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,270
the creative passport,

433
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,910
an identity in a searchable database for
music makers to upload and share that

434
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:39,744
information.

435
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,740
Everything you'd like to share about
you as a music maker verified and in one

436
00:27:44,741 --> 00:27:49,741
place mat and empower the global music
maker community as you list and link to

437
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:51,820
your music and sound contributions.

438
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,320
Add unique descriptive data to your
profile and individual works to increase

439
00:27:56,321 --> 00:28:00,550
discoverability for brand partnerships,
playlisting sinks, collaborations,

440
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,210
live or session bookings at the same time,

441
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,710
enabling music services to innovate,
benefiting both us and our audiences.

442
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,140
This is an identity that belongs to and
works for you while also connecting all

443
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:17,200
of your external existing
ideas in one place.

444
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,170
Imagine uploading your
biography only once,

445
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,280
but updating simultaneously
across all services. Sounds good.

446
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,940
Who's going to build it?
You and I, we all are.

447
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,780
Step by step with music makers
and services informs me,

448
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,060
host all over the world on our ongoing
music and tech tall, interested.

449
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,890
Show your support.
Sign up.

450
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,970
Keep up to date with the
latest developments and get
involved at my CLF in music

451
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,480
to or let's bring this
necessary missing layer,

452
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,310
a music maker database to life for the
health of our global music ecosystem

453
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,670
because let's face it,
nobody else can do it for us.

454
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,650
The creative passport by music
makers for everyone. There we go.

455
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,650
That's so join up there. We don't
really have anything at the moment.

456
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,780
This is more like a kind of call to
action for musicians to think about their

457
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:14,540
identity. You think about what that means.
Think about, uh, ownership of data, um,

458
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,720
about getting organized,

459
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:20,721
really about having a place in the world
where you can say that is the digital

460
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:23,424
me.

461
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,250
That's where I as a creative
self exist because, um,

462
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,280
you know, it's great to have all these
different services and they have their own

463
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,500
identities for you. Oh,
you make be, you know,

464
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:36,930
you have a profile on Twitter and
the alarm and all these other things,

465
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,140
but where are you?
I feel very torn apart,

466
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:44,680
feel very like a big massive tentacle in
the oceans. Just, I don't have a center,

467
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,090
like you're speaking to my center as a
physical thing, but I don't have that.

468
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,270
And more and more as we kind
of progressed into, you know,

469
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:56,280
developments in AI and discoverability,
incubation and, and the,

470
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:00,490
I really believe that the future of
work is going to be around our unique

471
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:02,080
selling points,
about how we,

472
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,410
how we express who we are in the digital
space so that our cells are working 24,

473
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:11,970
seven on our behalf, in our words,
perhaps in our, uh, in, in our,

474
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,950
with our ethos, um,
interfacing with the world.

475
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,990
And so when it comes down to music,
um, how do we present ourselves?

476
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,640
Uh, the, the, we have a major problem
in the music industry whereby, uh,

477
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,440
you know, the commercial music
industry didn't adopt, uh,

478
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,660
the technology of MP three. I didn't
see enough to serve as this incredible,

479
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,470
amazing opportunity to like go,
wow,

480
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,490
this is life changing for
musicians and the industry.

481
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,190
Let's get on this and make
it something really great.

482
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,210
And instead they're kind of in its,

483
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:46,030
sweep it under the carpet
and put people in jail. Um,

484
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,090
and really just people wanted
to share music that they loved.

485
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:50,530
And so what happened was the,

486
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,730
you had a huge disassociation from the
music and the people that made it then it

487
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,110
just never managed to catch up.

488
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,220
And the music industry has been trying
to catch up and of basically firefighting

489
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:04,480
every day as people tried to
innovate on this very crooked, um,

490
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,340
kind of heavy, clunky industry. Um,

491
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,220
so there's like thousands of services
and I've spoken to hundreds of them who

492
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:15,940
want to build new services on,
you know, using existing music,

493
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,690
but to get to reach that point where
they have the permission to do that,

494
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:22,630
to license the music,
it's just not viable.

495
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,080
They have to raise so much money with
VC that then only leaves little tiny

496
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:29,610
scraps for the musicians
in the end, if any. Um,

497
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,480
and it's a very lengthy process and
I just feel more than ever we have an

498
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:37,180
opportunity with new technologies,
um,

499
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,210
where we could create an open database
of works that the whole world could come

500
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:45,970
around and create this kind of Alexandria,
this library of,

501
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,040
of content whereby all of the music
services, the labels or publishers,

502
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:54,880
the collection societies who all have
their own databases at the moment,

503
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,300
costing the huge amounts of money,
um,

504
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,280
that they have to keep updated
and very fine, all that stuff. Um,

505
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,770
and they're all incomplete and they
all compete with one another. Um,

506
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,020
but if that was just,
just get rid of that,

507
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,770
we don't need to have multiple versions
of the same thing and all slightly

508
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:13,990
different than all, slightly
bad. Let's just have,

509
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,580
let's share into a space
and contribute to that,

510
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,620
um, that, you know, alive
kind of world of music and,

511
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,650
and data and an augment what's already
there into something that can be tuned

512
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:33,010
into by all the services so they don't
have to have that weight on their back

513
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,080
basically road. So speaking
of that, you say, um, um,

514
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,430
Mycelia you,
you see this as a potential,

515
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,680
a portal for income.

516
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:46,410
Can you talk about how
blockchain a relates to, uh,

517
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,450
creative passport or doesn't? Yeah, sure.

518
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,690
Um, so for me, you know, I've been in
the music industry 23 years, it's very,

519
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:57,230
very hard to know where your
money is at any one time.

520
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,480
We spent about a year trying to
research just the income for one song,

521
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,741
just one song,

522
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:07,040
and it's taken like a team of seven
students on and off for a year just to try

523
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:10,160
to get to the bottom of what,
where, where does it come from?

524
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,140
What does that radio station,
what does that thing over there,

525
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,510
why is that a match up with that?
Um,

526
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,260
and that's for me with a team of people
going into the offices of the Pos and

527
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:20,360
the collection societies get,
could you explain this?

528
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:25,110
I don't really understand that. And
we're still like only 5% there. Um,

529
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,720
so it's, it, it's an insane
amount of complication for,

530
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,640
uh, which, which comes from, you
know, the physical, you know,

531
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,250
the old day a hundred years ago,
you know,

532
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,980
how do we pay a publisher when
something gets paid on the radio?

533
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,910
And it was much simpler.
Um,

534
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,940
so the creative passport is really just
about us putting our flag in the sand

535
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,930
musicians at the moment, verifying each
other through peer to peer verification.

536
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:52,370
Like we haven't a QR code.

537
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:56,210
You just shine your camera on someone
else's Qr Code and you go, okay,

538
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,410
I verify who you are.

539
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,880
And that is a thing that then creates
a trust network around all the music

540
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:05,700
makers across the planet in time. Um,
but we're not ready for that yet. Um,

541
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,640
we're just doing a very kind of,

542
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,330
we may need just going around the world
doing this tour where I did concerts,

543
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:15,500
I do workshops, I show off my gloves,
I give comp, I do conferences,

544
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,080
I do accumulate, I do whatever I can. Um,

545
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,870
and we meet with music makers in
services and we talk about this future

546
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:25,871
ecosystem because essentially if we had
like it's incredibly rich data source,

547
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,040
um, linked to the actual content, um,

548
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,380
linking out to all of the musicians
who contributed to those works,

549
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,190
then you can imagine all these amazing
possibilities of discoveries and

550
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,460
connections and offerings of jobs and new,
you know,

551
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,600
somebody wants to book somebody,

552
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:45,890
a private concert because they saw the
heard something in Spotify or Google or

553
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:49,290
whatever, youtube and they
went, oh, well, um, I really,

554
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:53,060
really liked that person's work. I'm going
to, I'm going to try and book her. Um,

555
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,780
and maybe you do it right from the
song. Um, and you, you leave or you say,

556
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:58,300
I love that trumpet player.
I want to,

557
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,460
I want to put that chunk of plywood
for the trumpeter, make film. Um,

558
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,670
and then they like put the trumpet player.
Um,

559
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,100
but if we don't have a way to kind of go,

560
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:11,660
here I am and here are my songs.
We don't have anything to build from.

561
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,560
We don't have a home.

562
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,450
Imagine you were at a, like a, a
large influential tech company,

563
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,430
um, talking, uh,

564
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,780
to some very handsome and smart employees,

565
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,330
how would you convince them to support
you and how could they support a creative

566
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:31,164
passport?
Yeah,

567
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,730
it's a good question. I think we're not,
we're not ready for like big integration.

568
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,680
Yeah. Um, we need to,

569
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,430
we need to go kind of and create a
ground swell among musicians. So they,

570
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,151
they get,

571
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:46,980
they kind of own this space because this
is a autonomous thing we need to do. Um,

572
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:52,010
we need to convince music makers to take
charge of their data and to really like

573
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,500
take their digital self seriously.

574
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,640
So at the moment we are talking with
tons of services. Um, we're, you know,

575
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,260
might have four or five,

576
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:05,010
a little handful by April or May when we
come in the tour around here and we do

577
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:09,240
more so to being on more music makers.
But, you know, we're not ready for that.

578
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:13,080
Like, it's not like my space or
linkedin. It's not like it's not ready.

579
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,840
It's just imagine if you owned this,

580
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,010
imagine if you owned your
identity. Um, and what could,

581
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,910
what could grow from that because then
if we reach like a thousand or 10,000,

582
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,940
what's going to be the tipping point
for someone, you know, a company,

583
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,320
an organization like Google to go,
we're going to integrate, you know, oh,

584
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,900
youtube service with the creative
passport and that would be mega,

585
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,790
but we're not ready for
that yet because it's not,

586
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,390
you don't have an incentive enough just
yet because we need to have, you know,

587
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,990
we would need to have hundreds of
thousands before it's of interest.

588
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,910
Right. So, so you need musicians,
maybe some in the audience and,

589
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:48,641
and other,

590
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:52,570
other people out there in the youtube
audience to come and sort of be a part of

591
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:56,410
the community and how help shape that
so that you become a large enough

592
00:36:56,411 --> 00:37:01,010
organization that so that you can, uh,
more, yeah. Awesome. Wait. Yeah. Okay.

593
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,953
Fascinating.

594
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,630
Because, um, yeah, we, we know we
have representatives on our behalf,

595
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:07,850
like labels and publishers
and collection societies,

596
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:12,110
but a lot of us don't
like so many musicians.

597
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,750
I don't have any way to get in,

598
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,970
even into any industry because they
might be in Sudan or they might be in,

599
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:20,060
who knows where they might be.
They have no way to get onto the ladder.

600
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,880
And if we can try and,
you know,

601
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,940
reach our handshake across the Mexican
wave across the world or whatever, um,

602
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,020
to these musicians,

603
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:31,250
then we're bringing them in to this truly
global community and music community

604
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,410
that then hopefully all the
services will start to think,

605
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:36,680
oh well that's actually really interesting
cause now made me change to this mark

606
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:40,670
and this mark and this,
you know, and that's their
incentive. Um, but for us it's,

607
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,940
you know, it's how can we create, uh, uh,

608
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:49,020
a beautiful healthy living
kind of ecosystem from which
these services can grow

609
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:55,010
on kind of on our, uh, that makes sense
for us. And then with truly sustainable.

610
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:58,760
And then we can have, you
know, centuries of wonderful,

611
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:02,030
beautiful music cause the
musicians are supported. Um,

612
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,770
I think we have a question for you.

613
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,520
I think my selenium is very
interesting. Um, I'm kind of curious.

614
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,910
Uh,
so it,

615
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,530
you obviously need the three majors
to be involved. You don't think so.

616
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:20,280
And I think we need them know.
How does Merlin feel about it?

617
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,700
Um, the thing is it's like,
it's outside of licensing.

618
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,770
This is about your like personal identity.
It's my skillsets. It's my projects.

619
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,640
It's my interests. It's my
philosophy. It's my biography.

620
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:39,850
It's that aren't actually at
this moment to do with my songs.

621
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,510
They would link into a songs database,
which my Celia isn't.

622
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:46,270
My scene is like the vision,
the blue sky imagination of the future.

623
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,170
But the creative passport is
a thing. It's like an APP, um,

624
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:54,680
trust anchor for other services to be
able to go, oh yeah, that is imaging.

625
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:57,460
He cause she's got a credit passport
and she has been verified by her peers,

626
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:01,670
blah blah blah. Um, so if you
wanted to like go and look at Gig,

627
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:05,230
some promoter could pretty
much trust you because that is,

628
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,650
you'd be verified by your peers and you
have a good track record and that kind

629
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:12,250
of thing. So at the moment, um,
where the record ended, the right,

630
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:17,140
the kind of the majors are going to get
interested is when this database does

631
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:20,470
start to emerge, which is starting
to emerge in places like Sweden.

632
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:21,550
There's one in Malta,
there's one,

633
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,370
and actually here there's
going to be a new one, um,

634
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,790
around the music modernization
act around them, mechanicals,

635
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,350
how they're going to
be paid to the writers.

636
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,020
And that's something that just
passed a few months ago in Congress.

637
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,430
So they have to build that in the
next two years. And I'm going, hello,

638
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,790
IBM and that Cli. Um, how are
you going to do that without, uh,

639
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,591
the music makers?

640
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:45,940
How you're going to build that without
us being able to add and add to the

641
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:48,730
content that you have around
your publishers because
that's how they're going to

642
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:49,031
build it.

643
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:52,510
They're going to combine the big
publishers together and create the another

644
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:57,200
database, um, but it's only going to be
as good as their combined databases. Um,

645
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,030
and it won't. The problem
with that is that, you know,

646
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,980
whether they're guilty of it or not,
um,

647
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,670
is that the money that comes in from the
services will then go to this body. Um,

648
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,050
and then the money that they can't be
distributed because they don't know the

649
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:14,080
writers because they're too small fry and
it's too much effort for them to do it.

650
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,740
Um, we'll just go back to the
writers that they do have. They do,

651
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,840
they do look after after four years or
whatever the deal is that it will be.

652
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,780
It's probably something like that.
Um,

653
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,460
it will get redistributed back to
the original writers that they,

654
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,160
they look after so that the other writers
are all around the world and all the

655
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,740
smaller writers won't get that money.

656
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,740
And that's tiny amounts to
two these other artists.

657
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:40,060
But to them it could be like 50
quid or 100 or thousand kids. Um,

658
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,253
so,

659
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,560
so when they create that we want the
credit passport to be able to enable

660
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,290
individual musicians to be able to
automate into and clean, uh, you know, uh,

661
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:54,490
a weight kind of point to this
is how to pay me or this is,

662
00:40:54,491 --> 00:40:56,440
this is my collection snotty.
Well this is actually me.

663
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:59,920
There's missing that here so that we
can tidy up and do the job for them that

664
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,490
they can't afford to do
because it's tiny amounts. Um,

665
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:07,610
so the majors like the records side of
things because they don't have, you know,

666
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,700
your Isr c and SWC WC two codes
that you have your recording,

667
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:16,930
any publishing. Um, there is no shared
database at that, which is crazy.

668
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,140
Um,
and so if this does start to emerge,

669
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:25,170
that may be where the majors start to
pile in there recorded data and that might

670
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:27,580
start to flourish and
become this big Alexandria.

671
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:30,160
Who knows if we can kind of make,

672
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,070
if we can find a way in for the
musicians and it can, it can further,

673
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,700
otherwise it will just became, become
another kind of claiming house, um,

674
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,310
kind of closed space, which will have all
this money put into it by the, you know,

675
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,760
public money. Um, but it
won't be further reaching.

676
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,700
It will just be another close
database and that there'll be a shame.

677
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,650
So we're, we're running a little low
on time. I'm sorry to interrupt. Um,

678
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,880
I did kind of sort of,
I mean it's such a complicated,

679
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,730
which is why we need to simplify

680
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,930
and that's when they're going to come
on board is when you like when you say

681
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:05,380
look, all that kind of accounting stuff
that you do and all that really annoying

682
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:08,140
paperwork and that he just like, Oh
God, I wish I didn't have to do this.

683
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:12,010
When that disappears because we have smart
contracts and payments. And you know,

684
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:16,270
what I'd say to you though is that that
assymetry of information is basically a

685
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:20,770
competitive advantage for labels to be
able to bargain with people like Spotify.

686
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:25,660
And when you have 70 or 80% of
Spotify as catalog coming from majors,

687
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:30,400
it puts them in this position where
they have to ingest majors data.

688
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,360
Uh, and this is where I'm sort of like,
you don't, you need the majors on board.

689
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,450
Yeah. So that's a good example.
And the thing is, is that you have,

690
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,040
if you look at the longterm,
um, the majors, you know,
they might hold licenses for,

691
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,050
I think there's a maximum of 35 years.
Okay.

692
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,860
70th. I mean at the Beatles stuff
is about to come out of licensing.

693
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:50,850
It was from the 50s.
So yeah.

694
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,600
Yeah. So, but it's like,

695
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,950
if you think of all the new material
and most that the trend is, you know,

696
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,130
big labels hold large amounts of existing
work and younger up and coming artists

697
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:05,331
or people like myself,

698
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:09,740
I own our own works and we have
small holdings around them and works.

699
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,540
So how can we make that really
easy so that people like Spotify,

700
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,480
I can deal with that.
Definitely.

701
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,950
So it's a chicken and egg problem.

702
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,140
It is. Yeah. And we all need to be
the chicken or the egg, whichever way,

703
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,890
but we need to get on with it.
We need to make the first move basically.

704
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,080
Yeah, that's fine. We have
another question over here. Yeah,

705
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,040
I have a completely ever question.

706
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,940
I assume like writing and forming,

707
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:35,720
wearing the gloves kind of causes you to
make different creative decisions than

708
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:38,540
you would if you were just using a
regular midi controller with like standard

709
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,393
coders.

710
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,100
Are there other technologies that you
think should be utilized more or really

711
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:43,460
are like,

712
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,280
aren't kind of getting the attention
that they could that could have that same

713
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:48,820
potential to change the
way that people either uh,

714
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,750
right informed music or experience it?

715
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,450
Hmm. Interesting question. Um,

716
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,530
I mean
how,

717
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:04,531
why and perform music the way I
really enjoy the kind of the unknown.

718
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,020
Like, oh, there's something
over there I haven't tried yet.

719
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,960
Or there's an input there that I've
never had to deal with like audience,

720
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:14,200
heartbeat info or something or like,
um,

721
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,170
I didn't galvanic skin
response or something. Um,

722
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,220
like what would id musically if I knew
the audience that actually I'm trying to

723
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:24,040
develop a thing. Like it may never happen
because lots of things don't happen,

724
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:27,520
but um, it's just a simple, it's,
it's actually got a terrible name.

725
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,110
It's called the love glove.

726
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,360
I know it's going to be
mad at US shiny material.

727
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,450
Is this a way that I
thought it'd be nice to,

728
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:39,900
for the audience member to have
like they could show their love,

729
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:44,340
like I love this bit. Um, instead of
like taking camera pictures or like,

730
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,490
or like clapping at the end
so that I could see, oh,

731
00:44:47,491 --> 00:44:50,520
somebody really likes that bit, you know,
or I'll do, we need, they've got a thing.

732
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,050
And just like that little eye contact.

733
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:56,950
And I think when you get
those kind of bits, you know,
from the audience, um, isn't,

734
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,700
isn't it? Does it a lighter?
Oh, just, yeah, I suppose so.

735
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:04,050
I suppose that's true. It's really only
for the slow songs. I didn't know why.

736
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,690
Yeah, it might be something. I
Dunno, I was thinking about like,

737
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:10,590
could then I could give back the nerve
and I could like kind of pump up the law

738
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,570
and then they could get more love in
their hand and then it would kind of die

739
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:15,450
down if they use too much of it all the
time, so it doesn't get too annoying.

740
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,130
Anyway, I just, I just, yeah, it's
true. They could just use a lighter.

741
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,560
You just saved me like 10,000 pounds.

742
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,230
I should bring it into my team.

743
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,110
Take a, a check or a cash. Uh,

744
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,200
thank you so much for spending time
with us. Thank you all for, uh,

745
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,640
hanging out with us here, uh, at the
talks at Google and thanks for the team,

746
00:45:36,641 --> 00:45:40,030
for getting all this done. Uh, ladies
and gentlemen, you mentioned needs.

747
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:44,490
Okay.
