1
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,890
Thank you everyone so much for coming
to today's food talks with undelete.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,690
And we also have a professor of
gastronomy with us today here.

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,210
Um,
Angelique,

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,580
do you want to tell us a little bit about
yourself and why you're here and what

5
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:22,414
you'll be doing?

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,630
Well, um, and hold on. So we are
coming both from Hollins. Uh,

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,200
we work often together and
gastronomy and all kinds of flavors.

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,800
Uh, uh, I learned, uh,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,670
in the beginning from a Peter
because he has, uh, restaurants, uh,

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,110
name.

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,110
So the Elbert's it's difficult
for you to that's true.

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,510
Yes, yes, yes. Uh, so it
started with the older, the,

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,600
the be aware of all kinds of flavors and
that's why we work or running long time

14
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,590
ago together. Uh, and now and all of the,

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,660
I'm one of the two female master chefs,
uh,

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,000
from about 150 miles of chefs.

17
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,680
I think I go a little bit here
because the sounds is a not so good.

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,800
Can you hear me good like this?
Okay, great. So in Hong Kong,

19
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:20,440
one of the two female master chefs
about, that's quite unique. Uh,

20
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:25,120
I hope in the, in the United States
where a lot of more female shifts,

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,830
well, what I'm doing is, uh, uh,

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,100
the art of creative thinking in slavery
and slave or mentioning and flavor

23
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:34,000
combinations.

24
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,490
So I tell you a little bit of story
about culinary creativity and then we're

25
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:44,491
going to make a flavor painting with
about 20 components so you can experience

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,960
all kinds of flavor
bearing play for matches.

27
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,450
We should maybe think,
oh,

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,840
I couldn't imagine that combination
has a whatever made in heaven.

29
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,210
So that's what I'm doing together with
Peter will explain why some combinations

30
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:11,080
have a special effects in your
mouth. And so, but before, uh,

31
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,340
we are doing that,

32
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,550
maybe Peter wants to tell a little bits
about himself and then we start with the

33
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:20,330
presentation afterwards.
Yeah.

34
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,260
Okay. Thank you. She already mentioned a
lot. I have my own hotel and restaurant.

35
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,700
I developed a whole suite
of flavors. Siri, I think
flavor is something that you,

36
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:33,470
it's really tangible that we can measure.
And I've got a phd.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,260
I applied a PG and flavor classification.

38
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,270
So it's the only classification
model off flavor in the world. Um,

39
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,800
and where do you work? So, um, we
have, we've found a way to really, uh,

40
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,000
describe flavor in objective terms.

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,680
So what I should dig is doing with
creativity actually is based on a very

42
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:55,780
factual thing. So thinks that
Google's much like, because a,

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,040
there is real algorithm,
there was a real model,

44
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,670
there's real thinking
objective thinking behind it.

45
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,810
So what she is doing is
showing beautiful penny.

46
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,910
She's going to create a beautiful
painting right here. Um,

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,490
and then the new may time I will
discuss a little bit on the objectives,

48
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,560
objective side of it. So, um, these are
the ground rules with flavor composition.

49
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,300
So that's what we want to show.

50
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,403
Okay.

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,490
So first I'm going to start with a
little bit of presentation about creative

52
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:28,820
thinking and about not
about dream storming.

53
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:32,210
That's about a note about brainstorming.
What about dream storming?

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,720
And then I'm going to make the painting
and afterwards we do a little bit of

55
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,850
culinary mindmapping so you'll be able to,
uh,

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,520
can make your own size of combination
in a very, in a couple of minutes.

57
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,690
So who loves to cook? Okay, well,

58
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:55,490
I'm so happy. That's the reason
why you're here. I say, okay,

59
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,990
okay, that's fine. Um, for
me the sky is the limit.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,720
And uh,
the,

61
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,730
the story about creative thinking is very
important before you go in the flavor

62
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,930
matching because a lot of times we say,
okay,

63
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:16,931
maybe it's not possible or we
see a lot of issues on the roads,

64
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,260
maybe it's too expensive and I think
it takes too long time and we have all

65
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,340
kinds of reasons to do something.
No nothing,

66
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,030
don't let do that. So for
me, the sky's the limit and

67
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,590
uh,
in thinking is to creation in doing this,

68
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:35,300
the feeling and the
making is the learning.

69
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,400
And I want to tell you a little bit of
story, uh, what temps it happens to be.

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,510
Uh,

71
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,510
already 14 years ago I saw a hot air
balloon and that was in my car and I was

72
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:51,230
dreaming a little bit and a jazz music
on the background and I think, hey,

73
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,640
Eureka,
the balloon is actually a hot air,

74
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:58,880
often very big hot air often do.
We

75
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,580
had a experience in a hot
air balloon? Yes. Okay.

76
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,390
You have once been in a hot air
balloon. Yeah. Everybody almost. Oh,

77
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,280
that sounds great.
So,

78
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,790
so imagine the balloon
is a hot air often oven.

79
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,850
So what will happen when you put slumps
again at like a sea bass or a particular

80
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,110
or some muscles or Zoma
Paprika. Would it, will it,

81
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,660
will it be kooks well,

82
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,320
I can say so myself at the
same moment now at the,

83
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,100
because too dangerous or uh, maybe
somebody else did. It's already,

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,630
but I stay in my dream and my
fantasy fantasy setting. Oh,

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,980
when it's possible,

86
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,250
then we can make a restaurant with the
most wonderful view you can imagine

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,570
around smaller villages
and a small rivers.

88
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,460
You go low and you go high.
So you have the restaurant with rich.

89
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,080
Wonderful.
And uh,

90
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,360
I keep on dreaming and then I called
the a guy from a company, I said, Hey,

91
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,370
can I ask you something?

92
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,660
Is it possible to boots
to go once with you?

93
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:09,650
It's a balloon and put something in.

94
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:14,150
It's the shame was a little bit
quiet at the moment. You say, yes,

95
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,340
come to my company and we go
together in the air. And we,

96
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,663
let's try it.

97
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,850
So I had the all small bags with
a small chickens and the sea bass,

98
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,670
and then they fill the
balloon with the cold air.

99
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:33,671
And then we walked in the balloon and
it puts all the older small bags in the,

100
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,940
yeah, in the side of the balloon.
And then we go up and then we say,

101
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,640
all right here,
do you smell already?

102
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,710
Something that's too big to
smell something. And then, um,

103
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,150
after it's, uh, the idea grows,
that's what happened. Yeah.

104
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:55,151
You get used to the idea and then the
idea of getting normal and then you want

105
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:58,460
more.
So I say we can go with one blue,

106
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,270
but what will happen when we put three
balloons together and we have 50 persons

107
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,910
in three balloons and we go up
about one and a half kilometers,

108
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,880
I don't know how many feet
it is, but it's high. And um,

109
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,020
uh, and we do a three
course menu, uh, in the air.

110
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,210
They say, well, it sounds wonderful.
And then we get more used to the rd or,

111
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,710
and then we say what we do,

112
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,740
we put two chefs on the top of the blue
and they go up sending only outside and

113
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,850
give me the main course.
Yes, that would be wonderful.

114
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:42,110
So we are all so exciting. We
all really exciting saying, Whoa,

115
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:43,220
that would be wonderful.

116
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,460
And that we jumped out of the balloon
to make the dessert in the metal before

117
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:53,990
the balloons are lenders.
Sounds wonderful. Do you think,

118
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,620
do you think this is real?
Do you think has happened?

119
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,920
That was a good attitudes.
That's great. Yeah.

120
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,910
It's Google. So, uh,

121
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,140
for me, uh, brainstorm, it's not anymore
a brainstorm for me. It's a dream storm.

122
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,760
It's like a hyper creativity.

123
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,240
And then you have to be sometimes high
creative too to be different or to reach

124
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:24,490
some things you will never
talk to you could reach and um,

125
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,880
no, Lucas is going to, uh, show the movie.

126
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,683
Yeah.

127
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,190
Of the three blues
connected with 50 persons,

128
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,830
one and a half kilometers,
high,

129
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,710
three course menu on
one and a half a hour.

130
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,290
So it's a, that's me. It's
a little bit young garbage.

131
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,240
Okay. So these are two chefs who
are going on the top of the balloon.

132
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,750
That was the biggest balloon
of that sign for 24 persons.

133
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,420
Okay.

134
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,740
Three balloons connected.

135
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,660
Okay.

136
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,560
And we go up,

137
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:09,270
this is very short movie and this is
about one of the asking me these high.

138
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,500
He's on top of the balloon

139
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,590
and the temperature and the balloon
is about a 90 degrees Celsius.

140
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,200
So you have to need to convert her to uh,
to put it in the,

141
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,960
okay. So he's um, you can imagine

142
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,930
two shafts on the top of the balloon.
When the balloon is a already hall filled,

143
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:38,550
they go up and there is uh, uh, on
the top of, there's a small opening,

144
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,360
they can check how my, uh, food is

145
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,400
and this is the system from
one bloom to the other balloon.

146
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,070
So we had one kitchen balloon at two
restaurant balloons in one kitchen,

147
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:56,160
balloon efforting was
cooped and then it go,

148
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,570
it's go down with a police system and
then it goes through the other balloons

149
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:04,020
where it was a chef to
prepare it for the guests.

150
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,910
So here is far three
course menu for 50 persons.

151
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,450
Then, um, he had, uh,

152
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,600
had to move on the top of the balloon
because it was very hot, you know,

153
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,500
cause when he was standing still,
it was a, so he had to move around.

154
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,550
So this is the first day CDs is a Dorado,

155
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,780
which a few undergrads and cucumber.

156
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,543
Okay.

157
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,700
It's wonderful.
That's was so high.

158
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,930
And now he's going upstate me
with the main course only outsides

159
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,260
and the he say, oh my God, it was so
hot upstairs. There it was so worth.

160
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,970
It was the second guy.

161
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,763
And then

162
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,430
after, uh, the main course,

163
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,300
it was a chicken stuff
where it's a duck and um,

164
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,740
we serve with some mushrooms
and some green asparagus salad.

165
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,130
Then they disconnect the three blues and
you see each balloon is going and then

166
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:32,630
they jump outs, the gym park to
prepare to prepare to desserts.

167
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,590
Yeah.
Okay.

168
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,133
Okay.

169
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,860
Thank you Lucas. Okay. For me,

170
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,950
this is the example of believing in every
rd or you do you have in every dream

171
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
and uh, go on, take action.

172
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,310
Because when I did say to that's RDA
from this might be too dangerous,

173
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,900
or I call an insurance
company and they say, Oh,

174
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:14,230
you have to insure yourself. Well, uh,

175
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,420
what will happen when
the balloon will crash.

176
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,370
So it's not necessarily not necessarily
to insure yourself, you know?

177
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,643
Huh.

178
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,250
But for the other guests also notes.
Okay. So this is me and my kitchen.

179
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,380
This is my view from the
kitchen with a lobster salads.

180
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,780
Nice view. I, this is the kitchen. It
looks if the balloon is putting their, uh,

181
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,810
in the Alps, but this is actually a
picture made from another balloon. Uh,

182
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,820
it was in Austria and we made a triple
four hours and I could make a about,

183
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,900
uh, uh, I made it 12 dishes, uh,

184
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:01,320
above the offs was very exciting.

185
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,450
This is above the clouds. So you know, uh,

186
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,480
the sun is shining above the clouds and
then you go to the clouds and then she's

187
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:15,660
very quiet and then you
eat your lobster there.

188
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,180
So, um, for me,

189
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,610
everything I do is coming route
of my hearts and I believe in,

190
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:31,320
that's already a long time ago.
I was a chef with a Michelin Star,

191
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,880
uh, in the restaurants.
And then I felt, okay, uh,

192
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,590
do I want to do this my whole
life? Oh, yes, maybe, but
not owning the restaurants.

193
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,070
So,
uh,

194
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,150
my dream was to tell more about flavors
and to travel and to do crazy things and

195
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:50,940
to give experience to people,

196
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,990
but not an experience because it's
like a marketing, but experience,

197
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,530
which is real and authentic experience.

198
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,210
And for me it's that experience,
economy experience is economy,

199
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,080
but only when it's a
meaningful experience.

200
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,530
Uh, so this, these are the
most mentions idea killers,

201
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,810
uh, like, uh, uh, it might
work in other places,

202
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:24,760
but not here. And since this is the,
the, the diverse one, uh, since,

203
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,120
since I would say, since man,
you are the experts, you know,

204
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,910
when you say that to someone,
they say, oh, next time,

205
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,970
I don't want to mention my idea.
So

206
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:38,890
okay,

207
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,150
you aren't familiar with this,

208
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,860
but the idea chemist and the opposite
of the old, the idea can, it's rd,

209
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:48,820
id of boosters stuff,
just, just do it and uh,

210
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,560
go experiments.
So don't shoot.

211
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,500
You don't have a license
to kill odd years.

212
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,620
This is my message always in the kitchen.

213
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,960
So you have to try a lot
of things also to, uh,

214
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,990
everybody has a flavor reference and
a flavor memory from your childhood,

215
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:14,790
from the soup your grandma made orders to.
Uh,

216
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,670
and when you love food,
uh, is your memory. And uh,

217
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,490
therefore it's important to,
uh,

218
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,620
trying a lot of things so
you can make it even bigger.

219
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,680
Well, no. Um, it's about temptation. Um,

220
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,790
and I want to tell you about a carrots.

221
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:38,830
Okay.

222
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:43,090
Just a simple carrots. And if
I look to the carrot think, oh,

223
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:46,120
you're just a carrot.
You see the, the rabbits,

224
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,180
he's laughing to the carrots because we
are only using the carrot as a senate or

225
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,250
in the soup or made us to
actually do in Hollins. But,

226
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,860
um,
uh,

227
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,530
the challenge is to make a
carrot like golden carrots.

228
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,270
Yeah. You know, like, like gold.
More to give much more value.

229
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,570
And when

230
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,620
I'm also chefs and the restaurants and
I have tomato bake a new menu cards.

231
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,050
Ah,

232
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,050
it was until three o'clock in
the night and I was thinking,

233
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,020
oh,
I had the dish.

234
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,760
But I sometimes I missed
that one little accents

235
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,850
which make a dish can make very
special, timeless, you know?

236
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:40,300
So sometimes you want a restaurant
and say, ah, this is very nice.

237
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,410
And another time you say,
this is wonderful, you will
never forget the flavor.

238
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:49,450
Do we have to experience sometimes
it okay any other time or say, Oh,

239
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,370
I wish I could go back to that, to that
restaurant and, and experiences again.

240
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,540
That's what I need. I mean, as a chef, uh,

241
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,810
I think it's important
that you create dishes.

242
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,440
That's a guests will come most
remember and they will come back for.

243
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,590
So I was always thinking,
thinking, thinking all,

244
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,260
sometimes you have it at a
split seconds. You say, okay,

245
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:18,830
I miss a baby.

246
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,560
A little bit of lemon or maybe
a little star on his or some,

247
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,910
uh, maybe some seaweed, whatever. Um,

248
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,160
but when you make a France,
France,

249
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,900
oh, sorry, go back.

250
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,780
When you make a, uh, let me see. I'm
missing some. So can you make inspiration?

251
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:46,650
French spoons. Oh, world of
possibilities of flavors.

252
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,463
It's open.

253
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,280
It's one logical thing is most people
can only remember certain things from the

254
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,500
short memory. So when I
show it to you, carrots,

255
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,390
just
think of carrots,

256
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,990
which are the best snake of
French over carrots. Yes.

257
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,450
Name Sir. What do you eat? Ginger.

258
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:17,860
Thank you. Come on lemon. Thank you.

259
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,120
Cinnamon. Yeah, it's great. It's a
great match. Cinnamon and the carrots.

260
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,200
Garlic. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We already here.

261
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:33,650
What's about to 30 people
with Fort Things? Okay.

262
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,450
Cumin. Oh, but what did
you say? Elements. Yeah,

263
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,170
Laurel. Great. Sweep the ferrets. Okay,

264
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,020
Miss. Yes. So you know what is
happening now you'll have to think,

265
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,320
oh, oh. And just the, the, the, the,

266
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,960
the things we know where it matches with
the carrots are in the front because

267
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,820
maybe you've just tasted or
you had just a Senate bits.

268
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:13,100
Then you have to search for more.
And that's the good thing to know.

269
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:16,190
And creativity.
That's when you have that.

270
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:18,590
You can just remember seven things.

271
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,170
So when you say,
um,

272
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,530
burst of inspiration coming home
is four chefs sells time memories,

273
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,240
uh, from dishes. Uh,

274
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,130
you already eat or from your
family or our restaurants.

275
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:39,560
So mark has cookbooks,
magazines, internet, television.

276
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,230
But it's for a chef. It's very important
to let you get inspired by the season.

277
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,310
We'll take the best care,
Doris, a wonderful carrots.

278
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,000
I go and my mind, uh,
traveling to see, I think, oh,

279
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,670
what's,
can the see offer me in this season?

280
00:19:58,671 --> 00:20:03,671
Maybe a nicer squids or maybe so
anchovies or so I'm looking for flavored

281
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,700
switching. Oh, the carrots will be
happy from that. So if you are a carrot,

282
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,450
what makes you happy? Yeah,
that's the way chef thinks.

283
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,500
I'm traveling in my mind to a lab or to

284
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,540
fashion. Fashion is a big inspiration, uh,

285
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,920
for a matching flavors and colors.

286
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,310
So later on I will make the carrot
with a very concentrated tomato puree.

287
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,670
Then you see that the
colors can be inspired. Um,

288
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,880
just to look around you
to the section or arts.

289
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,530
It's not only the colors art,

290
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,950
but it's also when you look at
this painting, Oh, what's real?

291
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,270
This painting tell you, uh,
you see a lot of, uh, deep,

292
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,880
you'll see a lot of colors,

293
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,970
warm colors and cold callers.

294
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,860
And then if you take a look
for a couple of minutes,

295
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:10,570
then you get some emotion.
And where you trust on that emotion,

296
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:15,100
you can use it in your
flavor combinations. Well,

297
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:18,460
so now again,
you love to cook

298
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,820
and then we think again of the carrots,
what can I do with the carrots?

299
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,680
These are preparations,

300
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,620
these are all kinds of things
I cannot remember. I says yes,

301
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,430
I can also remember seven, maybe 10. Uh,

302
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,560
when I say, oh, okay,

303
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:43,430
it's a good idea to graze or carrots
or two fermented or to put it on the

304
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:45,830
barbecue or um,

305
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,250
I marinaded or deep fry it or make
it in a proper yachts, you know,

306
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:54,251
in the foil with some garlic and
oil and rosemary or I injected,

307
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,240
oh yeah, of course. You know, you can
inject a carrots. Ah, so when I have a,

308
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,200
uh, like a, um, a needle,

309
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,940
I could put it in and
I know, or a bit, uh,

310
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,330
sorry. Yeah. And then,

311
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,600
then good old flavors to inject
it and then put it any often.

312
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,610
And then all the aromas are going
between the carrots or I can smoke it.

313
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,390
Okay.

314
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,290
So there's a lot more possible when
you make the inspirations visible.

315
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,210
And these are just a word
cloud sell. So, uh, you know,

316
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,630
word clouds, word clouds
on the Internet. For me,

317
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:37,920
your word clouds is, um,
a lot of inspiration.

318
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,540
Um, four techniques.
These are preparations.

319
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:47,541
Techniques can make a buffalo out froma
or a cream from a carrot or could make

320
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,490
an ice cream or a soup or sorry,
rock.

321
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,590
I can make a spring roll
and there's Puma Flan.

322
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,270
It's so much I can do
to make this carrots,

323
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,170
to give this carrots so much more value.
Um,

324
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,640
now the thing is I can travel
in my minds to another culture.

325
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,480
So this is my loco.
And uh,

326
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,000
while you travel and you
go to the markets, you was
going through the markets,

327
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,380
everybody,
okay?

328
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,040
And then you see all the flavors and the
spices and herbs and the fruits and the

329
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:31,280
veggies. And then when you close
your eyes and you go with your,

330
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,060
with the carrots, you go to the
markets in Marrakesh, we say, oh,

331
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:38,200
okay, a sort of star. I
knew it was an assault,

332
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,390
the lemon and the sort of
grapefruits and oranges.

333
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,340
She's so many things. That's what
you can do, your imagination.

334
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,070
But sometimes we say, oh, on a
little bit crazy, we laugh about it,

335
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,940
but it's really, uh, it's brings
you a lot of our dealers to, uh,

336
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,550
to travel in your mind to conflicts
where you've been a concrete Smith's you

337
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,490
with inspires like,
uh,

338
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,570
when we think of a carrot and we want
to combine it with Chinese ingredients,

339
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,520
where do you think of
Chinese kitchen?

340
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,653
Yeah.

341
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:23,830
Soy Sauce. Oyster sauce,
rice, wine, rice, vinegar.

342
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,060
More Chinese, Chinese. Your
child from China. Oh, sorry.

343
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,980
Okay. Garlic. Yeah.
Yeah. Johnny's kitchen.

344
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,300
Come on Johnny.
Johnny fix you.

345
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,053
Yeah.

346
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,940
Cinnamon also.
Yeah.

347
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,430
Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Well

348
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,000
we go along now we go to Eataly

349
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:04,290
who has been in Italy. Okay, great.

350
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,330
So when we think on a carrot and Italian
kitchen, where do we obtain golf?

351
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,330
You tell me kiss.
She may be close by in your flavor memory.

352
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:18,360
You're telling me kitchen
come home, red wine, red,

353
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:22,710
red wine, red wine, basil,

354
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,080
tomatoes, this olive oil. Come on, go on.

355
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:32,850
You can do it. Parmesan
cheese, prosciutto.

356
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,030
Porcini sync of what?
Fish.

357
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:38,730
You know from the Italian
kitchen you have often on a pizza

358
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,290
or Oregano and Chavez.

359
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,120
So Parmison, prosciutto,
anchovies, sardines.

360
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,170
It's all Italian kitchen,
Italian cuisine.

361
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,210
What will happen when you
templates for Jews, the carrots,

362
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:02,300
which all of these ingredients
get a different carrots. Yeah,

363
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,440
so that's a little bit my message.
And uh,

364
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,310
for the painting,

365
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,260
this is the painting in my head from
all the traveling I did from all the

366
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:20,850
countries think, oh, I have the
character to tomato and I have to ginger.

367
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,830
And she reads, I have to Vodafone
scars and saffron, a fennel seeds.

368
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,200
I have the deal and I have even the coffee
beans. When you crunch coffee beans,

369
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:33,150
you have a lot of flavor.
Well,

370
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:37,350
what will happen when you make a carrot
cake and put some coffee flavors.

371
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,790
Okay,
so this has happened in my head as a chef

372
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,910
and these are the dishes.

373
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:49,830
Then I just made this a
yogurt ice cream with a roast.

374
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:54,640
It's a orange shirt, Publicar
with mango and the chips of, uh,

375
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,580
carrots, tips of carrot,
but not in deep fried,

376
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:02,700
but to draw heights.
And you often buy 70 degrees.

377
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,460
This is the inspiration from
Marrakesh with, uh, with,

378
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,940
uh,
the carrot salad with lentils,

379
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,950
with a reduction of orange juice
and some also her nudes. You know,

380
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:21,810
Russell nudes, the best spice
mix from a despise men there.

381
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,300
Um, and so, uh, take care to piece

382
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,880
to piece these cream.
And so mint.

383
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,350
So this is just a combination in
my inspiration from Marrakesh.

384
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,760
Okay. This is a severe
issue with Kima, uh,

385
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,460
with, uh, Korean or

386
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,650
this is the Chinese inspiration.

387
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,680
This is with tuna and a
role with a Ferris thin,

388
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,920
a carrot with buys,

389
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,440
seaweeds and the major
addressing, uh, from, uh,

390
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,270
reduction of orange juice,
Tempura of carrots.

391
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,210
This is very important in this
dish you have from one carats,

392
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,150
you have, uh, for preparations.

393
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,680
So the whole carrots wasn't the often.
And then all the,

394
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,440
uh, uh, uh, all the juices and
the carrot are caramelizing.

395
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,910
And then I could it's and it's,
um,

396
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,390
it didn't touch any water.
So it's full of flavor.

397
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,040
Then I made around the carrots.
It's a marinated carrots julienned.

398
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,500
Then I made a mousseline
of the rest of the carrots,

399
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,700
which some olive oil and some lemon
juice because lemon is bringing all the

400
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:49,820
flavor more intensified,

401
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,190
more alive and then a crunch.

402
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,460
So when you think of these flavors
and you have a speech of the carrots,

403
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,440
you have a smooth mouth feel of the cream.

404
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,630
You have a balance of the sweet and
sour from the American Mary Nation. No,

405
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:09,720
the marinated carrots.
And you have a crunch.

406
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,180
So this is what you can
do with one ingredients,

407
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,840
one veggie to should use it.

408
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,240
These are all veggies,
marinade it and rolled up.

409
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,210
And this is the same.
Okay.

410
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,810
Well before I'm going to make the
painting. Um, this is a flavor graphic.

411
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,660
Uh, you can make a flavor
graphic graphica yourself. Uh,

412
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,720
think, oh, okay. I using
aren't even in this case. Oh,

413
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,410
which spice I do like which
spices I can make a match with,

414
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,890
uh, uh, with an NDA.

415
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,360
And what can I do with the men?
We cannot remember this.

416
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:01,960
So when you draw it and make your
own word cloud or a minus, oh,

417
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:06,820
worlds is going open. Yep. Okay.

418
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,530
Sorry. Next one. Excellent. Yup. Okay.

419
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,023
Um,

420
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,730
this is the last heat before
I'm going to make the painting.

421
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,460
Okay. Let me talk about the
success factors in Alaska. Peter,

422
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:25,020
here you go. Stand here. It's
a little bit better. I have,

423
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,920
uh,

424
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,450
Peters will tell more about the success
factors because it will help you every

425
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:34,380
time when you go,

426
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:39,550
this is the restaurant eat a dish or you
make your own dish because there are a

427
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:43,310
couple of, uh, it's not
rules, but a couple of, uh,

428
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:49,590
ah, some position Brussels compensation
rules accomplishes. And why you,

429
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,060
why you will hear this,

430
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:56,210
you will never forget it because it will
make every visit to a restaurant and

431
00:30:56,491 --> 00:31:01,310
every dish you mate, it's still
be made difference. Nope. Okay.

432
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,220
So the thing is I want you to,

433
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:06,410
you're saying you need imagination
with them and imagination.

434
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:10,520
You've got all these wonderful combination
of things and then there is also kind

435
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:13,850
of a theory. So you need to kind of
a theory to bring it all together.

436
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,790
And that's what, uh, what, um,

437
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:20,450
there's this slide shows is for one those
because it's very special. Umami is a,

438
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:24,590
of course one of the, it's called
one of the basic flavors. Um,

439
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,310
your mommy is a very rich
family or four flavors.

440
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,570
What is one of the,
um,

441
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,550
culinary success factors is
that your mom should be there.

442
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,970
So if a dish Mille lacs your mommy,

443
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,720
there's something missing. This
what, what, what Lashley could sing.

444
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:44,060
So knowing about your
mommy is very important.

445
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,850
This is the other important side of it.
Uh,

446
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:50,000
knowing about what every
component does in the Tisch.

447
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:55,180
So we think that flavor is basically
about my field and in mouth feel they're

448
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:00,220
ours. Those three different
forces. One force, it's one forest.

449
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:04,070
We call contracting a Mattel. We receive
it has everything to do with salt,

450
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:08,360
with the ascendancy, with sour. Um,
thanks a contract to your mouth.

451
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,420
That's why we chose the word contracted.

452
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,970
Another substance is called
another direction or the
force is called a coating.

453
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,710
And this is about all the
fats and all the shivers.

454
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:21,770
And everything that really
leaves a layer behind your mouth.

455
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,200
And then there is another vector,

456
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:27,590
another force that's
called drag or drop a,

457
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:31,330
which is basically the crunch or
everything that has a texture,

458
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,160
things that you can chew on, things
as you can bite off, things like that.

459
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,980
So these are different forces.
And the,

460
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:42,080
this is basically the basic of
every flavor throughout the world.

461
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,490
When I was in Beijing,

462
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:48,491
I gave a master class and BG and
then all these Chinese people exactly

463
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:53,870
understood more what I was talking
about within their cultural frame,

464
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,990
within their cultural frame of flavor.
So it's very important,

465
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,730
I think to realize the flavors.

466
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,210
It has a real structure
and I call them vectors.

467
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:05,540
And these are real vectors with
forces behind them. Of course,

468
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:09,110
we don't have a measure for these forces.
That's what we need to develop,

469
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,470
will be wonderful to have a scale
where we don't have the skills yet,

470
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,770
but I think these skills
will be developed. Um,

471
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,060
smart people at Google should
be able to do that for sure.

472
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,940
But this could be the base of,
of any algorithm or flavor.

473
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:28,310
So now we're going to go back to
practice, um, in building the painting.

474
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,550
Yup. So actually, okay. Um,

475
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,920
so I will tell every time if it's
coaching or worth trying or, Yep.

476
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,950
So this is the carrot, a carrot, sorry.

477
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,980
This is the pumpkin and a sweet potato
in the often lot of Bailey's and garlic

478
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,210
roasting, roasting, roasting,
then are pureed foods.

479
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,640
And that's a little bits.
It's not sweet, but it's,

480
00:33:57,641 --> 00:33:59,740
um, yeah, it's, it's, it's coating,

481
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:04,770
but it says flavor with a little
white wine vinegar to lift it up.

482
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,890
Excuse me. And this will be
kind of the basic for the paint.

483
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,070
Oops. Oops. Okay. So coaching,
right. I'm gonna ask some witness.

484
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,140
They want to help me.

485
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,730
You're going to have to go, you're
going to be able to taste everything.

486
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,970
So you will see that there is this a
bit of acidity in it because otherwise

487
00:34:36,971 --> 00:34:39,090
you'd would be to coating.
So the acidity,

488
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:44,100
it works as a countervailing power
within the coaching within the door,

489
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,000
right?

490
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,920
Yeah. That's perfect. That's
what competition is about.

491
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,140
Yeah. Okay. Yeah,

492
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,140
it's a little bit sooner because I did
made it this morning. So, uh, okay.

493
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,480
I do it a little bit different
now. If you stay here, we,

494
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,330
we'd give you some other,
uh, so you put big dots.

495
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,200
Take your time,
take a nice job like this.

496
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,130
Oh yes.
Okay.

497
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,760
Just on every plate.
Some.

498
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:26,803
Okay.

499
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,870
Okay. No, I have, um, this is a occurred.

500
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,190
Cool. What's, um,

501
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,960
for your a yogurt I might occur trough
with some Miso and missiles from uh,

502
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,540
and soybean paste and
fermented soybean paste.

503
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,610
And it's,
every Japanese from a family has its own,

504
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,290
uh,
Michelle,

505
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:00,350
so it's a little bit salty and it's a
very nice combination together with the

506
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,260
Kurds.
[inaudible]

507
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,723
great.

508
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,960
Again, a coating substance. All right.

509
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:36,170
Taste it. You will find the
acidity. So that balance of way,

510
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,360
a bit of the richness of the coating.

511
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:41,860
Yup.

512
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,260
That's the balance you
find within the substance.

513
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,020
So just this nice dose

514
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,200
and line.

515
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,560
And this is some Kurtz, uh, to, uh,

516
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,390
but it's mixed with saffron
to make it some more, uh,

517
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,100
mystics see

518
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,690
[inaudible] success factors.
For instance, at Google,

519
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,920
I'm the London and Paris and Zurich.
And Dublin. We work with Google chefs,

520
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,760
we develop dishes, but based on
the color and her success factors,

521
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,940
then they were served.

522
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,200
And then we asked just which one,
three alternative do you like best.

523
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,080
And then every time you find that
the ones that have the culinary,

524
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:44,110
our success factors are
found to be without any
inflammation naturally the best.

525
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,780
It's very interesting to revalidate and
reevaluation of these connect success

526
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:53,020
factors and presentations
is a very important one.

527
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:58,120
So the way things look, the presentation
of a dish to name you give it,

528
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:00,550
they should test try it
was all a part of flavor.

529
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,600
It's often forgotten when people think
that flavor is sweet, sour, bitter,

530
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:06,850
et cetera. But this is
much, much, much more.

531
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,350
And you need to take everything
into account to really
understand what flavor is

532
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:15,790
about. So the name presentation,
color is an important aspect of it.

533
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,230
Balances and important aspect.
Uh,

534
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,910
smell is an important aspect and your
mommy is one and a very identifiable,

535
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,370
identifiable flavors. There's more so,
and then you need a balance in my field.

536
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,970
Differences in that. These are all,

537
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:36,450
let's say the coating substances of you
will find that we need more to make a

538
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:42,961
nice balance and a nice dish
or a canvas or a painting.

539
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,390
Yup.
Then we have the tomato,

540
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,960
a tomato with a,

541
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:52,830
yeah.

542
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,710
Mixed together with the sweetness of the,

543
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:57,750
yeah.

544
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,270
Oh,
sweet potato and the pumpkin

545
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,990
tomato is a very special ingredient
because there are many flavors within the

546
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:11,460
tomato is you have a, let's see, already
harvested tomato or a, an unripe type,

547
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:14,190
then the acidity and the
darkness will be there.

548
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:18,330
But when you have a very rich
tomato, which is a, a harvested late,

549
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,700
then of course it will be
much sweeter and much Richard.

550
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:23,180
So it's very important to
look at what type of tomato,

551
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:26,640
half for the effect that you want to use.
Do you want to have something sweet?

552
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:30,590
Do you need it? Riper type of tomato
in their suite. Sweeter one. Then, um,

553
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,160
if you're just wanting to talk
to us with their, yes, it is.

554
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,550
Okay.

555
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:42,230
Okay. Then we have a very wonderful
ingredients. He was, you will smell.

556
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,070
It's so volatile hall.
It's a fermented, uh,

557
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,520
spices and veggies from
the Indian kitchen,

558
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,590
like a,
like a onion,

559
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,560
garlic curry leaves and
is very strong. So, uh,

560
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,580
I, I'm, he gets until
a 40 degrees Celsius,

561
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:06,790
mixed it with skin flora since flour and
olive oil and it's still be connected

562
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,020
connecting cause it's not
spicy but it's full of flavor.

563
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,940
You say part of the second
factor factor that I mentioned,

564
00:40:17,941 --> 00:40:21,300
the smell of our dish is very important.
Or using an oil like this,

565
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:26,301
you have a very rich flavor components
and you will notice that within seconds

566
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,820
everything will smell like the of here.

567
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,960
So it's an important aspect is fine.

568
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,740
Split shot already have it in my nose.
Your House.

569
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,013
Okay.

570
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,173
Okay.

571
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,650
Okay. Then for the crunch, a juicy crunch,

572
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,850
we use the leaves of the
Andes and you can use a later.

573
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,590
I like a kind of a spoon.

574
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,990
And then with the Endif if you
pick up the creams, like a crutch,

575
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,510
we need a crunch.
Piedra

576
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,440
okay.

577
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,460
So also this is about it all, all uh,
must build. It should be interesting.

578
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,330
So you need crunch bites,

579
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,510
you need to do to fix that practice
and thinks that break every cargo was

580
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,680
crunching your mouth to make,
to have the lead,

581
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,160
the creamy substances. It
will be a kind of boring. Um,

582
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,330
so I'll now we're going to have different
lectures, Matthew. So here you have,

583
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,360
I get the leaf rakes and
makes a high pitched sound,

584
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:29,820
which is much more like
crispy. Um, they're all,

585
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,160
they're going to be nuts. They're
going to be Christmas. Um,

586
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,790
they are all different mounts fields.

587
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:39,110
That really helped to
make a flavor imbalance.

588
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:48,050
Okay. Do you already a smell? Yeah.

589
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,550
Yeah.
Okay.

590
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:58,560
Say the officer's juniors coming a
little bit to the, to the flavors and,

591
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,250
okay.

592
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:05,190
Imagine that the oil wouldn't be there.
The dish would be less interested. Right.

593
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,860
It's a smell that test.

594
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:15,490
Okay. Now we have a green
oil. No, just agreeing oil.

595
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,650
It is, um, uh, make from a
slack, Parsley and Tarragon.

596
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,680
Target has a lot of a slaver
and often when you make a,

597
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,370
an oil herb oil,
it's,

598
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,350
it's gonna Cause in some Brown Greens,

599
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,100
a color.

600
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:41,220
And then we blanch it first just in
water without salt and put it in,

601
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,400
put it out at the same time,
make it cold, very quickly,

602
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:50,200
squeeze out all the water. And then
we mixed it with 40 degrees Celsius,

603
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,360
uh, oil, uh, until it
was like this. And um,

604
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,290
uh,
it's a glorified which makes the,

605
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:02,050
the oil much more intensive than uh,
than you do.

606
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:03,940
It's a which is when it's wrong.

607
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,250
No.
Okay.

608
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,680
Look at what the color
does on the painting.

609
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:13,803
Oops.

610
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,670
Part of presentation.

611
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:28,110
So Am I, you are going
to eat this led well, uh,

612
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,690
you have to mix a lot of
things but it will happen.

613
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:33,983
Okay.

614
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,610
At the same time when
you ever taken is going

615
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,513
to connect

616
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,720
the terror gun,

617
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,780
the partially our fresh flavors and
they are often confounded with a,

618
00:43:58,781 --> 00:43:59,860
with a sour,

619
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,540
that's the very important to distinguish
is freshness from Saudis fresh is

620
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,930
intolerance do go together once in a
while because then the oil like this,

621
00:44:07,931 --> 00:44:10,630
it's just a freshman chief
job without the soundness.

622
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:14,680
So there's the reason it doesn't influence
these mafia on the contracting side,

623
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,680
that's two coat coating
but also gives fresh news.

624
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,863
Okay.

625
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:23,400
So now we will talking
about the carrots and um,

626
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,280
this is the purple carrots for me is
this, is, this is the example how to,

627
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,820
how to it seduce or 10
tastes. So juice, juice,

628
00:44:34,821 --> 00:44:38,850
a carrot,
well it's not that difficult.

629
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,111
You just put it in.

630
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:44,910
He often for a long time
with a lot of a bay leaf,

631
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,690
I think this carrot had
about six Bailey's crushed.

632
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,380
So a lot of flavor can come out
of the babies, a lot of garlic.

633
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,360
Then we first blanches sewed up.
The plant cells can uh, can uh,

634
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,480
open open and then all the sweet juices
can caramelize and it's in the open on

635
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,870
160 degrees Celsius.
Uh,

636
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:11,191
sorry.

637
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:15,840
Next time I will have it would found
hearts in my head and then roast gross

638
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:20,610
gross. And it's going
to flavor like um, dope.

639
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,090
Yeah, licorice, licorice,
you know, liquors.

640
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,170
In Holland we are fond of liquids.

641
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:31,171
So this carrot is like licorice just
to carrots with three ingredients.

642
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:37,210
And I did it with, uh,

643
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,830
just the normal orange carrots and it's,

644
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:43,140
it's quite different.

645
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,500
It's more caramelized and it's
less intensive than the purple one.

646
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,790
So I have for everyone,
I have one piece yet,

647
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,310
so if you like it, just please
take one piece. Otherwise I don't,

648
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,310
we'll have enough.
Um,

649
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,350
and we have a whole carrots to combine
it with all the other flavors on the dish

650
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,570
show.
What is nice to uh,

651
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,780
yeah,
puts the,

652
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,760
I think one of the things in the astronomy
that people forget a lot is to cook

653
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,140
vegetables. Vegetables are a lot
of times and if you read them raw,

654
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:36,141
they are and their love more flavor to
find and carrots or in whatever vegetable

655
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:41,580
when you add temperature. And the
often here as well, when I'm here,

656
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:46,850
I'm often surprised all the things
that are even involved here,

657
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:51,090
Kale and sprouts and,
and much of these things,

658
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:53,940
I'm actually my turn for the better when
they've been cooked and then you can

659
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:56,820
eat them. Of course, uh,
uh, coal if you want.

660
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,890
But I'm cooking vegetables and the
lower temperatures, getting these,

661
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,190
getting these flavors out is a
very important side of the uh,

662
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,220
flavor story of Chicago for vegetables.

663
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:15,550
This is a freshly made tomato
puree from uh, tomatoes,

664
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,800
onions and cooks,

665
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:22,390
reduced all the water LRN until it stick.

666
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,490
And then we put it in the blender.

667
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:29,110
And then you have your own
fresh puree from goods ripen.

668
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,093
Yeah.

669
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,490
And uh,
this is the,

670
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:41,260
the color blocking how you see in the
fashion when you have an orange shirt,

671
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,420
uh, within the, uh, rec
trouser and you know,

672
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,150
so well and flavor is the same.

673
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,960
The characters very sweet and the
tomato is a little bit of acid.

674
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,750
So it will give much more life to a,

675
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,280
to old things.
Yup.

676
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:11,210
It's often when you miss something and
this then start with adding a little bit,

677
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,750
maybe some capable, all
little bits, a sour,

678
00:48:15,751 --> 00:48:17,910
a tomato puree or a,

679
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,940
I soon as he is often forgotten

680
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,940
parts of the dish,
including better bitter in acidity.

681
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,150
Our thought that the people
don't like those things and uh,

682
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,710
they're kept away with,
for depth and for, um,

683
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,750
having great dishes.

684
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:42,190
You need a good addition of
some acidity in some bitterness.

685
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:46,810
Not too much, but a bit
slack. Salt. It's good to add.

686
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,550
Let's do all US fresh olives tried on us.

687
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:58,360
Okay. We have the, the fresh ones,

688
00:48:59,050 --> 00:48:59,883
you know them,

689
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,180
it more flavors will come to you
when you are aware.

690
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,450
I would like to eating
but then see difference,

691
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,070
it's flavor,
the difference.

692
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,480
All the dried Kalamata olives and we
put in boats on the painting so we can

693
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:28,080
experiments. And what is happening
when you put out all the liquids?

694
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,280
It's,
it's very strange flavor.

695
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:36,870
I don't think you've ever flavored
like this and all it so intense.

696
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,490
It's a little bit better. Just a
little bit and a little bit more salty.

697
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,850
Okay.
What do maybe we'll do.

698
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:49,923
Okay.

699
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:54,600
You could just a little bit.
So here and there. Yeah.

700
00:49:55,590 --> 00:50:00,520
And uh, these ones we put liver togetherso

701
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,780
it's in the same area. So you
can taste boats. Yup. Okay.

702
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,080
Um,
let me see what I have the,

703
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:19,660
we do the same with the capers. We have
the fresh caper fuel note him. Yeah.

704
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,440
And when you dry the fresh capers
any often at 70 degrees Celsius,

705
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,560
so don't be in a hurry.
Uh,

706
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,120
the often is doing the job and you dry it.

707
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,740
You got to crunchy s it's ingredients.

708
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:44,570
It's very nice. It's very nice flavor.
We put us next to each other again.

709
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:46,610
So you can flavor the difference.

710
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,610
Yup.
Okay.

711
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:59,340
Of course you understand what you're
doing with um, can drying things in your,

712
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,330
your intensify flavors in it.
That's fine.

713
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:05,380
If for your flavors you're also
changing things. So you're,

714
00:51:05,381 --> 00:51:10,381
you're reducing the sharpness of the
raw and the rock paper is a very sharp

715
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:15,380
facilities. Tasty tried one.
It's much more on the salty salt.

716
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:20,110
So you, the whole profile of
the Cape is changing by, again,

717
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:20,944
adding temperature

718
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,670
I think through, think of that's a
lot of work left the oven due to work.

719
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,250
You can do your own thing
while the oven is working.

720
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:34,440
You don't have to stand next to it.
You don't have to help it.

721
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,730
You don't have to look at it,
it just works by itself.

722
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:39,620
Okay.

723
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,410
Okay.
Yeah,

724
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,540
it's from the Japanese kitchen,

725
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:54,740
a topping, uh, usually use for rice.

726
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,630
And I made it myself.

727
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:00,950
It's from a seaweed roasted sesame seeds,

728
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,860
white ones, the black ones
and Wasabi flavored ones, uh,

729
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:09,420
which, uh, you know, I need it in the, uh,

730
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,920
Tufts in the pen.
Um,

731
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:17,870
dried capers are also in it and
it's a really nice crunchy mix.

732
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,990
I'm going to put it on the,

733
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,430
on the side of the curve with the,

734
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,580
okay.

735
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,700
Where did Nisho because they're
a little bit French. Yeah.

736
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,190
And then,
uh,

737
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:39,250
you take a little bit and what's the
measle Kurtz and then with free Kaka and

738
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:43,040
you have a wonderful combination.

739
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,983
Okay.

740
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:21,190
Yup. Okay. So we are almost there

741
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,680
nuts.
Yeah.

742
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:31,380
And that's some things I will leave here
because it's getting a little bit too

743
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:33,760
busy on the,
we do

744
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,420
first we do the crunch,
we have a cracker.

745
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,410
I make prom,

746
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,480
a tapioca flour with saffron
and what are spread out,

747
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,560
dry it,
and then I deep fry it.

748
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,690
And the current is importance in a dish,
uh,

749
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,210
without, without a crunch.
This can be very, uh,

750
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,750
sometimes boring.
Even

751
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,820
the crunch we put on the saffron cream.

752
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:10,603
Okay.

753
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,080
Yeah. Just put it down. Put it in.

754
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:22,140
Okay. And we have to,
same with the seaweed.

755
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,080
Seaweed cracker also made from Tacos,

756
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:31,140
Tapioca and with crunchy
seaweeds we put on the,

757
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,000
we put it on the,

758
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,853
yeah,

759
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:41,270
on the missile,
not everywhere you're in there.

760
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,100
Then we have more,

761
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,180
we have the walnuts,

762
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:54,590
just plain bullets,
x different crunch,

763
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,790
then Endif or Dan,
uh,

764
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,690
the saffron crackers

765
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,180
and I put it crunch also.
What does the Kurds,

766
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:22,923
oh,

767
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:32,830
these are all elements that belong to
the drying components on the plate,

768
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,960
but evidently the nuts are
different in math field.

769
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:42,530
Gender crispness of the saffron and the,

770
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,270
um,
seaweed that'd be half of that one.

771
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:52,250
This is a very important one.
You know,

772
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,700
that the breath,

773
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:00,130
what's the cheese and the ham and then
the cheese is coming on the outside of

774
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:02,940
the breads, you know, that's,

775
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,780
and then you get that smell from
the caramelized cheese. Well,

776
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:11,980
this is the, the, the crunchy part of the,

777
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:16,960
of the [inaudible]. Sorry. It's
only gonna be sites of the toasty.

778
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,960
Yes.
This is wonderful.

779
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:25,620
You only need this when you flavor it
with the sweet potato and the tomato,

780
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:31,600
and then you have old Italian
Umami flavors. You can imagine.

781
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,640
I play dumb. You didn't
mention it's Parmesan, but, um,

782
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:41,140
most folks probably everybody knows since.
Why was it together with the motto?

783
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:45,940
Of course. It's a wonderful book. Oh yeah.

784
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:49,520
Pharmacy.
Yeah.

785
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:55,620
Just a couple. And then the rest
we do supports just a couple of,

786
00:56:56,870 --> 00:57:00,270
yeah, hold on. Yeah.
Okay. We're almost there.

787
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,630
Uh, let me see. We have,
uh, this is very rich.

788
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:11,370
These are LG crackers,
not to LG from the television.

789
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,980
What's Lg from the
scene? Very, very strong.

790
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,880
Don't eat it. That's the first.
It's a beginning. Of course.

791
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:26,190
It stays very low in your mouth.

792
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,170
Okay.
Can you put some?

793
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:52,090
Yep. Okay. Let's see. One thing.

794
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:59,120
Yeah. The chef, because there is a
camera and I have a very awful.here.

795
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,213
Yes.
You see?

796
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,540
Okay. Then, uh, we leave just
a little bit separate. Um,

797
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,930
I started with the carrots and I

798
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,530
almost ends with the
carrots. But first, uh,

799
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,410
when we talk about no waste,
um,

800
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:25,580
you can make a powder from every
ingredients you can imagine.

801
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,830
So when you have a left
overs from veggies,

802
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:34,210
just dry them any often and then put
it in the like a coffee bean machine.

803
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:38,690
The small thing, you know what I'm here
like, right. Very quick one grinder.

804
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:43,600
Grinder. Yes. And then you can
make a wonderful power. So,

805
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,030
um,
I put some powder

806
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,520
sees that's taking place,
right?

807
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,810
Just to finish

808
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,200
up with green hair.

809
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,840
Yeah. It's awesome. Okay,

810
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:19,590
good. No, ours do a hell key hints.

811
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:23,160
Yeah.
Course.

812
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,520
So then we ends where we
started with the currents.

813
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:34,640
Uh, you see what's happening,
just a, the LGG powder.

814
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:38,840
It's a mixing, but two carrots,
nicer. Yup. That's what's happening.

815
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:46,330
The carrots a or I mates from when
you juice the carriage to the juicer,

816
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,800
then in the container,
your rudder, the pelvis,

817
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:56,540
we meaning just try to pull up and you
have a wonderful, uh, carrot powder,

818
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:01,440
which you can use in a
patisserie or in, uh, in,

819
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:03,760
in the Doh or dressings.

820
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,120
Okay.
All the sites.

821
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,573
Yeah.

822
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,460
Well,
that's actually has a lot of flavor.

823
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:27,750
Okay. Off of reading. Hers
are you have one. Okay.

824
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,290
Okay. I forgot one thing I
have to sign. Go to. Sorry.

825
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:38,450

painting. Yes. So I say,

01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:50,380

I would like to invite you to come around
to painting and just experience all

830
01:00:57,981 --> 01:01:00,410
