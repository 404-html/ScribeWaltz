1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,580
Hi everybody. Um, and everybody
local and on live stream.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,370
I want to welcome Tara
Richardson whitely here.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,170
Her work as a plus size adventure
has been featured in New York Times,

4
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,480
self,
backpacker,

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,980
weightwatchers red book and also on
Oprah's life class. And Good Morning.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,120
Good Morning America.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,510
We're a very happy that she was able to
take time out of her schedule to come

8
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:30,500
visit us at Google and share her
story with us. Thank you. Oh,

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,473
thanks.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,330
Yeah.
Hello.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,610
Hi everybody. Um, I just want
to get the lay of the land here.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,410
How many of you have climbed
Kilimanjaro? Anybody? Okay.

13
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:50,210
So nobody in the room has anybody here
once a climb? Kilimanjaro. Okay. One, two,

14
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:54,650
three, four, five, six. Does anybody want
to be convinced not to climb Kilimanjaro?

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,780
Okay. Three or four. Okay, got it. So, um,

16
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,560
I'll talk to you a little bit
about, um, you know, my story.

17
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:05,910
I speak all over the country
about my journey, um,

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,070
up mountains and sometimes
up the scale too. So I'll,

19
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,390
I'll share a little bit of both.

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,420
And since there are people in the
room who have the interest of climbing

21
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,880
Kilimanjaro, if you still at
the end of the presentation,

22
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:24,170
still have that interest, I'll go
over some tips and um, you know,

23
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:27,460
you can also contact me afterwards
also if you had any followup questions.

24
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,790
So my journey,
um,

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,150
up Kilimanjaro began when
I was more than 360 pounds,

26
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,120
and at that time I could
barely Hika staircase.

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,313
Um,

28
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,570
I couldn't even walk around the block
without being completely out of breath,

29
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,310
totally uninterested in continuing.

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,760
And I started to think to myself because
there was about to turn 30 years old

31
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,840
that I wasn't living life anymore.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,120
And you know,
you might think to yourself,

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,660
maybe you'll meet somebody who's really
heavy or somebody who struggles with

34
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:07,940
weight and you just don't get it.
Like,

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,320
why did they get so big
so fast? Or, you know,

36
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:15,740
why can't they never get, get
it right? It's just food, right?

37
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:20,660
And it's not heroin or it's not,
um, you know, it's not alcohol.

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,400
But for me,
um,

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,260
my struggle with weight started when
I was nine years old and my parents

40
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:30,800
divorced and my father pretty
much up and left my life.

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,970
And then when I was 12, I was
sexually assaulted. So, you know,

42
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:38,570
it started with these
really big traumatic things.

43
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,460
That's when I started to
use food for comfort and um,

44
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,370
you know,
it started with these huge things.

45
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:51,371
But then little by little I used food
for everything and I really truly

46
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:56,660
sugarcoated my life where I wasn't
feeling happy, I wasn't feeling sad,

47
00:02:56,661 --> 00:03:00,330
I was just feeling pretty comfortably
numb because even when, you know,

48
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,870
my parents were on the brink of divorce,
I literally would hide in the Pantry,

49
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,610
like to hear, to just drown out
their screamings by chewing food.

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,910
And when I was in the midst
of being sexually assaulted,

51
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:17,590
the only thing I could think of to make
it stop and to get out of this situation

52
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,680
was to get up and go to the kitchen
and offer the guy something to eat.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,220
And it threw him through such a loop
that it kind of ended right there at that

54
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:28,240
moment.
So in many ways food saved me,

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,570
but as I was approaching my 30th birthday,

56
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:35,320
because at the time I thought that
was getting pretty old now 40.

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,710
Um, I started to think like, well,

58
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:43,090
I'm not getting any younger and I have
so many things that I want to do with my

59
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,700
life and I knew that I really,

60
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,790
I really wanted it to be a hiker girl
because even though I wasn't active at all

61
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,000
and I wasn't exercising and I wasn't
really a member of a gym or anything like

62
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,250
that,
my life would light up.

63
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:02,251
My mind would just come into that dream
phase anytime I would get one of those

64
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,980
adventure travel catalogs in the mail.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

65
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:10,981
Those glossy pictures of the Alps
and Machu Picchu and Kilimanjaro.

66
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,580
But at that time I used to do what a
lot of people who struggle with their

67
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:19,330
weight. Do I say to myself, well, I'm
going to do that when I lose weight.

68
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,560
And like, like I would say to myself,
I'll go to the doctors when I lose weight,

69
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,180
I'll buy that dress or I'll buy something
fancy to where when I lose weight.

70
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,930
So as I approached this birthday,
I realized that, you know,

71
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,970
it was time to just get
moving no matter what.

72
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,390
And I decided that I
would just start to hike.

73
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,320
I would start to just be a hiker girl.

74
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:45,100
And even though I'm not,
um, a Patagonia model,

75
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:48,640
of course I could start with
things like a water bottle.

76
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,990
I could carry a water bottle,

77
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:54,370
I could take flat hikes as I live in
New Jersey and there's lots of those.

78
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,590
Um, and the more I hiked, the more
I enjoyed it. My husband, he's,

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,360
he's actually a marathon or
he's done seven so far. Um,

80
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,310
so he would hike with me and he would
just go up on the trail and he would be

81
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:13,060
far, far ahead of me and then he'd
tap his leg like it was calling a dog.

82
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,740
And instead of yelling at him,

83
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:17,800
I would muster my energy to
go faster and hike harder.

84
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,030
And suddenly I was the one who
is picking the harder trails.

85
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,850
I was the one who was,
um,

86
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,760
I was the one picking more
strenuous things to do.

87
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,790
And so as I got moving with this journey,

88
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,400
I started to think about
like I need a goal. Right?

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,520
And so I pick this particular
mountain as a goal.

90
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,360
Does anybody happen to know where it is?
No,

91
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,980
it's called camel's Hump and it's Vermont
second highest fake because it looks

92
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:49,180
like the back of the
camel. And so, um, anyway,

93
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:53,110
I chose this mountain in particular
because when I was in college at the

94
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,220
University of Vermont,

95
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,160
that's when my weight went
over the 300 pound mark.

96
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,100
And obviously I wasn't doing
any hiking at the time.

97
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:05,510
The only walking that I did was to the
bars because they had 25 cent draft night.

98
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:09,110
And that seems to make a lot of
financial sense to me and to class.

99
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,620
And so even though I grew up in Vermont
and I did hike camel's hump and during a

100
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,290
fourth grade field trip, cause that's
what they do on field trips in Vermont,

101
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,970
they hike mountains. Um, when I was
in college, my friends said, hey,

102
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:27,410
it's a beautiful day. A lot like it
is today. Great Sunshine. It's June,

103
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,240
let's go hike camel's hump. So I thought,
hey, okay, sure, I'll go along with you.

104
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,540
And 20 minutes into this five hour hike
I was just completely sucking wind.

105
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,770
I mean, absolutely out of
shape, unable to continue.

106
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,980
I had that feeling that many marathoners
do at like mile 20 where you know you

107
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,460
have lead leg and you
can't move another inch.

108
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,380
And so I told them everything like,
oh,

109
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,690
I haven't been feeling well
and I think my stomach hurts.

110
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:58,190
I must have eaten something funny.

111
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,010
But the truth of the matter
is I wasn't moving at all.

112
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,390
And instead of having it being
one of those Oprah Aha moments,

113
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,000
that moment where you know,
everything changes.

114
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,950
I went to the bottom of the mountain that
day and I ate the two things that were

115
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:17,180
in my backpack, a half pound
bag of m and m's and a leader,

116
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,410
a half liter bottle of diet coke. Because
I mentioned I'm not so good at math,

117
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:26,180
so I thought they equal each other out.
But for years and years, I live that way.

118
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,440
And I decided that if I was going to hike
and I was going to be a hiker girl and

119
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:33,680
I was going to move more,
I needed to conquer camel's hump.

120
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,750
And so I hiked and I hiked.
And on the eve of my 31st birthday,

121
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,480
I, you know, I conquered camel's hump.

122
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,620
And the funny story about that
is that I trained and I trained,

123
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:48,350
I trained on one of those
moving staircases, you know,

124
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,100
the staircase that never ends and you
have one of those at your gym. Um,

125
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,720
that was like my best friend
while training for this. And um,

126
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,380
I thought about it every day, how I'm
going to go to the top of camel's hump.

127
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,770
And I decided I was going to do a sunrise
hike because I thought that sounded

128
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:07,880
glorious and amazing and like one of
those once in a lifetime kind of hikes.

129
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,300
So I get up to the top of the
mountain and I'm hiking by myself,

130
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:14,150
and then I'm like, Geez, I don't
have anybody to take my picture.

131
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,040
And so suddenly this woman
and her daughter start
walking up with a dog and I'm

132
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,280
like, oh, this is such an
incredible hike. You know, how many,

133
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,020
how long have you been training
for this? And they're like, oh,

134
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:26,650
we do this every morning mountain.

135
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,640
So I was joining a different
kind of lifestyle, you know,

136
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,960
even though it was exciting
and new for me, um,

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,010
this is something that
other people did every day.

138
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:41,450
And so I was really kind of joining the
club when it came to hiking. I also,

139
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,110
you know, once I conquered
Campbell's hump, well then
the sky's the limit. Right.

140
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,650
Um,

141
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,580
then I went down to the bottom of the
Grand Canyon and thankfully back up again

142
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,970
because that is 10 miles of brutal up.

143
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,250
Has Anybody done the Grand
Canyon here? Yeah, it's rough.

144
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,700
I mean you really have
to time your arrest,

145
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,680
how much food you're eating and how much
water you can bring. It's a real, um,

146
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,630
endurance test. And then, um,

147
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,640
then we took on Vermont's highest,
um, peak, which is Mount Mansfield,

148
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:15,900
which to this day is the hardest
mountain that I ever hiked because,

149
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,120
well the truth is,

150
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:21,180
is that we ended up hiking down
the wrong side of the mountain.

151
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,230
So thank goodness the Vermont
brewer's fest was the same day.

152
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,170
So,
so as I was doing all this hiking,

153
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,580
all this amazing hiking, taking care
of my body, this great thing happened.

154
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:37,950
I started to lose a lot of weight,

155
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,790
so much weight that I had
lost almost a hundred pounds.

156
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,590
And this is very strange.

157
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:47,400
Things started happening
to me whenever I'd go,

158
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,750
especially to the bathroom at work. Women
would follow me in there and say like,

159
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,140
so what are you doing?
Why are you losing all this weight?

160
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:59,280
Did you get the surgery? Are you on weight
watchers? Are you doing South Beach?

161
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:03,950
Cause that was really hot at the
time. And so, um, and then I,

162
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,200
they'd be really interested in how long
did it take you and what did you eat and

163
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,750
what are you eating for
breakfast, you know, tomorrow,

164
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:12,240
and what are you gonna have for
dinner and can I join you for lunch?

165
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,720
And people would like turn and look
every time I got something to eat.

166
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,670
And it's all they cared about.

167
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,470
And these people who never once gave an
inkling about anything in my life wanted

168
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,450
to know everything that
was going in my mouth.

169
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,730
And for someone who had used food for so
long to kind of cover emotions and kind

170
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:33,510
of cover myself, it was
incredibly intimidating. Um,

171
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,890
so I decided that I wanted
to have another big goal,

172
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,730
but I also wanted to deflect
this attention I was getting.

173
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,630
So I started to set my
sights on Kilimanjaro.

174
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,870
Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain
that you can hike to the top of.

175
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,320
In other words,
no ice axe is no ropes,

176
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:56,370
no supplemental oxygen. Have
you seen into thin air, right?

177
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,580
It's not that it's a long drudgery kind
of journey where you're like five and a

178
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:06,810
half days up the mountain,
one and a half days down.

179
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,260
But you can do it on your own two
feet if you train really well.

180
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,240
So I figured that's going to be the
huge goal that I'm going to focus on.

181
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,280
And because it's such an iconic mountain,
I mean even in this room,

182
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:25,060
there's like five people who really
actually do want to do this. There's,

183
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,710
you can really do it to raise
money for almost any charity.

184
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,520
And so I thought since I'm going to
be doing it in Africa that I would do

185
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:36,030
something that would give
back to Africa. Um, and so I,

186
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,550
I did a little Google search
and I looked up, you know,

187
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,570
Kilimanjaro Climbs, AIDS, orphans.

188
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:47,010
Cause that's what I really wanted to
raise money for. And Lo and behold,

189
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:50,970
I found global alliance for Africa,
which is a Chicago based charity.

190
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:55,480
And the thing that they do to raise
money for their is Kilimanjaro hikes.

191
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,090
And so I signed up right away.

192
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,600
And then anytime that those women who
asked me about my weight asked me what I

193
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,220
was doing, I'm like, well,

194
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:10,420
I'm training for Kilimanjaro and here's
how you can donate to AIDS orphans that

195
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:14,920
I raised $12,000. So it's talk
about deflecting attention there.

196
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,990
Um, so to train for Kilimanjaro, you know,

197
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:24,520
there's a couple of things you should
know. One is that it is 19,000, 343 feet.

198
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,100
That's really high. It's in
Tanzania, Africa. The keys
to success are to go pull.

199
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,750
They pull a, does anybody know Swahili
in the room? Yes. Slowly. Slowly.

200
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:37,030
That's right.
That's the key to success.

201
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,340
And so if I was going to
sign up for a mountain,

202
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,310
then they said go as slow as you
possibly can. And I'm like, yeah, this,

203
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,600
this is Mike on a mountain.
Um,

204
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,600
the other keys are drink a lot
of water up to five liters a day,

205
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,520
and it's a lot. Um, and the other thing
is have a positive attitude. In fact,

206
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,440
the only way that you can tell if somebody
is not going to make it to the top,

207
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:01,900
if for those of you who actually
do want to hike the mountain,

208
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,030
if you're in your pre climb briefing and
somebody is complaining about how they

209
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,880
hate camping and they hate the outdoors,

210
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,300
they're pretty much like the Garner
by like day two to just so you know.

211
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,650
But otherwise you don't know who's
going to make it and who's not.

212
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,360
You Know Martha Stewart,

213
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,170
Martha Stewart made it
to the top and curry,

214
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:26,830
the newscaster for NBC,
didn't.

215
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,500
Martina Navratilova didn't.

216
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,120
So you just don't know by looking at
someone whether or not they're going to be

217
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:37,930
able to do it.
So I like those odds.

218
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,540
So to, to train, I focused on three
things. Strength, stamina, and spirit.

219
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,780
Strength is pretty obvious. You
know, you're doing a lot of hiking,

220
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:51,160
but you want to also strengthen your
quads and your back because you're holding

221
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,650
a backpack for so long and a strength.

222
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:56,170
Strengthen the muscles around your knees
so you support your body and all the

223
00:13:56,171 --> 00:14:00,010
giants that need to get you there.
Stamina. Look, I live in New Jersey,

224
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:02,350
there were some mountains.
I actually had to hike twice,

225
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,130
two to get up to the level of
being able to climb Kilimanjaro.

226
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,260
But spirit I think was one of the most
important things where I took yoga

227
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:12,094
classes.

228
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,110
One because they do a lot of breath work
and I thought it was going to be really

229
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:21,490
important for me to feel like
I was in control of my breath.

230
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,650
My breath wasn't going
to be in control of me.

231
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,190
And so even though there were
breath exercises that I did,

232
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:31,270
it started to like really kind of get me
in the rhythm of really being conscious

233
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,930
of area in air out and
conserving error where I could.

234
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,480
But what I really loved about Yoga as
part of the training, yes, flexibility,

235
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:44,440
strength, all that stuff is great, but
every time I went down into Savasana,

236
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,290
you know the part where it looks like
everybody's sleeping and they did nothing

237
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,970
for like 45 minute class.
Um,

238
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,560
that was when I to imagine myself at the
top of the mountain before I got there

239
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:59,140
because they had to believe that I
could do this goal before I did it.

240
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,770
So you can do a lot of
roots up Kilimanjaro. I, um,

241
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,400
in my three climbs have climbed
the wrong guy route each time.

242
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,520
It's the root on the side of
the Kenya side of the mountain.

243
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,830
It's a little more remote.
Um,

244
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,210
maybe when we camped we saw two or
three other groups and that's it.

245
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,870
On the way down the mountain we went
the Coca Cola route, which is much more,

246
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,250
there's much more traffic. And so you
really did see a lot more people. Um,

247
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,770
a lot of people look at this middle
photo and they say, oh, how wonderful.

248
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:36,350
They're just starting
their, um, it's okay.

249
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,760
But a lot of people look at this
photo and they say like, oh, how cute.

250
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:42,710
They're just starting their
journey up Kilimanjaro.

251
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:46,190
And I have to explain to them like, no,
no, no, that's, that's four days in.

252
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,530
And you still have to do,

253
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,040
you have to like summit night is from
here up to the top and then halfway down

254
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,250
the mountain in one day it's 15
hours of hiking. So and, and,

255
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,630
and things like altitude headaches
are real. They're real concern.

256
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:06,650
And this is Lisa who actually did make
it to the top, but it was, you know,

257
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,520
50 50 whether or not she was actually
going to continue or not at that point.

258
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,460
So Hiking Kilimanjaro is an amazing thing.
You dream about it for months.

259
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:18,281
Do you prepare,

260
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:22,600
you visit rei more times than you
probably have in your entire life, right?

261
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:27,280
You spend more money on gear probably as
much as you paid for your plane tickets

262
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,670
but then comes some at night and when
you're at some at night and I mentioned

263
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:36,700
that you're a camping kind of high up
on that slope that I disappointed too.

264
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,370
When you start your summit attempt it,
it's 15 hours of hiking.

265
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,700
So why not start at midnight, right?
Cause you just get it started,

266
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:50,020
get it started and get it over with.
Um, when you open your tent door,

267
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,510
you were so high up that their stars
above you, there's stars beside you,

268
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,070
they're stars below you.

269
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,770
When you are so proud of yourself that
you've put on every possible layer of

270
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,000
gear, everything you look like,
that kid in a Christmas story,

271
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:09,700
and I can't put my arms down or you know,
um,

272
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,930
and you've managed to tie your shoe
laces it at about 15 or 16,000 feet.

273
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,400
That alone is like, you're so proud of
yourself that you can't even imagine.

274
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,710
Um, so then you walk out your
tent door and you join your group.

275
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,200
You try to stomach a
little bit of breakfast,

276
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,460
and then you start walking
in this formation with your,

277
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,420
with your guide,

278
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,900
and they're singing you Swahili loves
songs and lullabies as you're walking in

279
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:41,140
this beautiful formation lockstep.
Everybody's in this together.

280
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,740
And that's really wonderful.
For the first hour,

281
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,520
maybe the second,
but by the hour you're thinking,

282
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,280
I think this guide is lost because
unlike in the states where these,

283
00:17:56,281 --> 00:18:00,780
these big trailblazers where you
know exactly where you're going,

284
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,621
there's,
you know,

285
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,710
I'm going to follow the red dot
trail all the way up the mountain.

286
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,500
There isn't that on Kilimanjaro,

287
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,390
there's just these gravelly trails of
screen near the top where you take one

288
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:17,391
step up and you slide halfway back and
you take another step up and you slide

289
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:21,240
halfway back.
And it is so incredibly frustrating.

290
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,500
So, um, then you're, you know,

291
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,940
you're really irritated at this point.
And by our four you're pretty much,

292
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,920
um, you've pretty much got your,
I quit speech down, like, listen,

293
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,680
I really want a fresh shower and a cold
beer or a cold water that comes from a

294
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:45,330
bottle, not from whatever water source
you've got this stuff from. Um, I,

295
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,140
you guys are like sisters or brothers
to me. You've lent me toilet paper.

296
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:51,540
I feel like we're family,
but I'm going to leave now.

297
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,790
I'm going down the
mountain the way I came.

298
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,360
So right when you feel like you just
cannot take this journey anymore.

299
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,410
That's when the sun comes up.
So on Kilimanjaro,

300
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,190
especially on summit night,
it is truly darkest before dawn.

301
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,420
That's when you really have to dig
in and just keep pushing forward.

302
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,280
When you feel like you just can't,

303
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,030
unless of course you're suffering from
something really like altitude sickness.

304
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,960
But if usually your mind gives
out before your body does,

305
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,543
um,

306
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,230
and if you're climbing Kilimanjaro usually
stop at Gilman's point where you can

307
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,360
have tea.

308
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,330
A lot of times the porters and guides
have tea for you there and you're so high

309
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:38,331
at this point that you watched the
sunrise over Africa and the horizon is

310
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:41,490
curved. And I, when I first noticed this,

311
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:46,140
I thought maybe I was tripping because
of the lack of oxygen, but another fee.

312
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:48,030
A lot of other people
confirm that it actually,

313
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,960
the horizon does look completely curved
because you are so high up on in the

314
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:54,780
world.
But maybe they had lack of oxygen to.

315
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,590
So from there you can go
onto [inaudible] peak,

316
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,160
which is the true summit of Kilimanjaro.
And the first time I did it, um,

317
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,030
I hiked with my husband
and for the record,

318
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:07,740
he's only done one of my three clients.

319
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,620
So with all my training, I kept thinking
about the way up, the way up, the way up.

320
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,630
But what goes up must
come down, right? And so,

321
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,890
um, it can be kind of fun. I mean
you, you're doing this scree running.

322
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:27,060
So now that scree that was so
devastating to you on some at nights,

323
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:32,061
so difficult to manage is kind of fun
because now you're doing this almost like

324
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,870
a vertical run down a beach.
Does that make sense?

325
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,780
So you're trying to,

326
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,710
Hank have fun with it where you're just
kind of running and running and running

327
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,940
and it really actually helps rinse out
the lactic acid that's kind of built out

328
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,830
in your,
in your body.

329
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,760
But you just try to enjoy the journey
down even though your legs kind of feel

330
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,310
like Jello for all the,
that you've put it through.

331
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,000
So as we're doing this,
as we're making our way down the mountain,

332
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:04,001
and that first time all we could think
about was getting to a hotel shelter,

333
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,800
anything over our heads, a warm meal
at a table on a plate, you know,

334
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,880
something that we could really
enjoy. And of course the shower, um,

335
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,720
our leader at the time, she said
to us, she's like, hey guys,

336
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:19,150
don't forget to look up
every once in awhile.

337
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,570
And so on this particular
trip and where are we?

338
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:23,710
We're at that moment on the mountain.

339
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:27,310
I looked up and their horizon and I
saw a mountain that looked a lot like

340
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,150
camel's hump. And I thought
to myself, you know, Gosh,

341
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:33,620
if I had never done Campbell swamp,

342
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,020
if I had never made that my giant goal,
I could never be here.

343
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,350
And so it really does make
a difference as small steps,

344
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:45,070
those intro interim goals.
So even if it's like a five k for you,

345
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:49,060
like something you've never done before,
you never know where that may lead.

346
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,650
And it might just lead to the five k and
that alone is a huge accomplishment and

347
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:57,670
camel's hump. At the time was a
huge accomplishment. But you know,

348
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:01,630
that interim goal led me
to the roof of Africa. So,

349
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,003
you know,

350
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,590
in the end I did lose a 120 pounds and um,

351
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,440
the women were very excited about that.
Who would follow me to the bathroom?

352
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,310
And after I came back from Kilimanjaro,
the next thing they wanted to know,

353
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:20,290
so what's your next adventure? What are
you doing? Are you going to do Everest?

354
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,860
I going to do much, you feed to a,
are you going to do, you know, if,

355
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:27,520
if wild were out at the time, they
would have been like, oh my God,

356
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:30,880
you totally got to do the
Pacific coast trail. Right. Um,

357
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,490
but I had a whole other adventure in mind.

358
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:38,491
It required another language and a lot
of new gear and that was to have a baby.

359
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,790
So, um, like a lot of women
who struggle with their weight,

360
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,110
I put on a ton of it back on
when I was pregnant. In fact,

361
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:54,220
I put on 70 pounds during my nine
months of pregnant pregnancy.

362
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,473
Um,

363
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,480
and I went from someone that had been to
the roof of Africa to someone who could

364
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:05,590
barely hike across my living
room cause I had Sciatica so bad,

365
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:09,790
which is like this lightening bolt
down your leg. And it was embarrassing.

366
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,290
It was embarrassing that I had done so
much in one year I lost all this weight

367
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,420
and then in months I put
half of it back on again. Um,

368
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,880
and so now those women wouldn't
even look me in the eye anymore.

369
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,770
They wouldn't hold the
door for me anymore.

370
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,860
Nobody really wanted to talk
about weight anymore with me.

371
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,170
And so I was really feeling stuck and
isolated and I started to do those things

372
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:35,320
that I did when I struggled
with my weight before,

373
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:38,530
like I bow out of events because
I felt like, oh, I'm too fat.

374
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,890
I don't want to go to that reunion.
I don't want to go that party. The,

375
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:44,830
I haven't seen this personal long time.
I wouldn't be in family photos. In fact,

376
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:47,870
there's almost no pictures
of me when I was pregnant.

377
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,710
And I think it's because I didn't
want people to take my picture.

378
00:23:51,711 --> 00:23:55,520
I was embarrassed of how
I felt about myself. Um,

379
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,880
and I was really stuck and I
started to think about, you know,

380
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:02,360
what was it about that
first Kilimanjaro Climb?

381
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:07,361
How come I was able to really
rise above and just go do it?

382
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,070
And I thought to myself,
well,

383
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,900
it was because I was working for a cause
that was bigger than myself. You know,

384
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,090
whenever I didn't want to work out,

385
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,740
I thought about I'm climbing this
mountain for AIDS orphans in Africa.

386
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,910
I'm raising money for them.
Who am I to not eat well?

387
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,200
Who am I to not train today?
They're depending on me. Um,

388
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,730
and even though if I didn't make them
out the, the top of the mountain,

389
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,360
I still would have the donations,
still would have gone to the charity.

390
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:41,780
But I felt like I had a
responsibility to do my best.

391
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,980
And so in my post pregnancy
mind, I thought, well,

392
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,480
I've got a great plan.

393
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,720
I'm going to do something called the
save the world workout where I'm going to

394
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:57,110
do a different event for
charity every month of the year.

395
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,590
And that way I would force
myself to get out and you know,

396
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,920
be a part of an event where they
were raising money for charity,

397
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,860
where I have to sign up for it show up.

398
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,280
And it really did a great job of just
at least getting me moving again because

399
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,110
that's something I wasn't doing at all.

400
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,030
So even though some of the events
burns more calories than others, like,

401
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,120
um, you know, the, the
flying pig marathon,

402
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:28,820
I actually walked the
whole marathon course,

403
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,030
but the penguin plunge in Vermont,

404
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,700
which is jumping in lake
Champlain in Burlington,

405
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,190
Vermont in February,

406
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,460
where they actually have to cut out a
minivan size chunk of ice and you jump in

407
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:47,450
the water. That was more about,
you know, that was more about me,

408
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:50,840
like kind of getting out of my shell
again than it was about burning calories.

409
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,800
And I'm a little embarrassed about the,
um,

410
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,800
the profanity I used in
front of the former mayor of
Vermont, not Bernie Sanders,

411
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,370
but Peter, Peter Corvelle. Um,

412
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,900
but I think he might've
matched it a little bit,

413
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:07,390
but I'm not saying you did. So anyway. Um,

414
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,550
so it was this great year of just
kind of getting out, raising money,

415
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:13,910
doing fun things that I enjoy
it again and I thought, okay,

416
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:18,230
the best thing that I can do is to end
the year with the Kilimanjaro Climb and

417
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:22,250
that will finally get
me back in that space.

418
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:26,900
That same place where I was successful
with weight. I mean, because you know,

419
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:30,920
you see all the advertisements for weight
loss products, weight loss, surgery,

420
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:32,930
weight loss, this weight
loss pills, weight loss,

421
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,450
all of these programs that you can do.

422
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,090
People really want to
be in that place again.

423
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:41,930
And I desperately wanted to hang onto
something and I thought Kilimanjaro is

424
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:43,130
going to be the key to that.

425
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,360
And so I thought if I just ended
with the Kilimanjaro hike, um,

426
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,690
I was going to be able to do that.
So

427
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,330
I did all the events,

428
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:59,331
but the problem was I convinced myself
that I was just really good in altitude

429
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,080
and it's just a slow hike to the top.

430
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,260
It's all you have to do to get
to the top of this mountain.

431
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,580
Unfortunately it isn't. If you're
planning on climbing Kilimanjaro,

432
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:15,870
you want to give yourself four months
of training in that direction and that's

433
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,060
it.
You know,

434
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:21,090
you want to make sure you have time to
prepare your body and your mind for this.

435
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,420
But the most important thing that I did
not conquer was my challenge with food

436
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,680
because I didn't put 70 pounds back
on because I was just eating extra ice

437
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:38,244
cream.

438
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,540
I was doing the same things that got
me into trouble the first time I was

439
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:46,470
bingeing and my real red
flag with food is when

440
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,290
I can't admit what I ate.
In fact,

441
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,430
my real trouble point with food
is when I'm hiding what I've done.

442
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,750
So for those of you who don't struggle
with food, I'll just lay it out for you.

443
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:04,590
This is what it looks like.
I'm the mom in our family,

444
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:05,910
so I do the grocery shop right?

445
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:11,180
I come home with some ice cream for my
kids and for my daughter at the time and

446
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:12,324
my husband

447
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,250
and we have dessert and we have a nice
healthy portion of ice cream and that's

448
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:23,850
that. Everybody's happy. We go to bed
the next day while I'm working from home.

449
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,410
I think after lunch,
oh,

450
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,370
I could give some ice cream or sometimes
after breakfast I could use some ice

451
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:32,460
cream. I have a little bit,
I want to be done with it.

452
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,410
Then I returned to the fridge or
the freezer or a few minutes later,

453
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:41,040
maybe an hour later I want a little
bit more and then a little bit more.

454
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:43,080
And suddenly I'm like
eating the entire container,

455
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:47,280
like with a spoon in the freezer are
still open and suddenly I'm like,

456
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:50,340
oh my gosh,
this thing is almost gone now.

457
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:55,080
How am I a professional mom? Uh,
you know, a professional writer,

458
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,790
um, you know, a good mom, successful
and lots of other things. I mean,

459
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,830
I've raised money.
I'm a good person.

460
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,220
How is it that I can be
conquered by a cupcake?

461
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,540
And so then I do what I think
is the most logical thing.

462
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:14,280
I go back and I have to buy another thing
of ice cream to hide the fact that I

463
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:16,590
didn't eat the ice cream the first place.
Now,

464
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:21,570
this is when I'm really in trouble with
food and this is where I was on the eve

465
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,970
of this second Kilimanjaro Climb.

466
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,930
I hadn't dealt with how I was
feeling with food. In fact,

467
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:33,410
the hardest thing that I had to write
about and gorge was the scene right before

468
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:36,420
the second climb.
Um,

469
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,740
because I had purchased some candy in
the Amsterdam airport for my daughter and

470
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:48,601
my niece and nephew who are coming to
visit for Christmas and I eat it all,

471
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:53,290
every single bit of it on the
eve of a Kilimanjaro Climb.

472
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,610
So spoiler alert, I didn't make
it up the mountain that time.

473
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:04,000
In fact, it was, it was a pretty
devastating fail. And after that point,

474
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,110
if I was in the red flag territory before,
I was seriously,

475
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:10,750
seriously in trouble with food.
Um,

476
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:15,310
I did that kind of thing with the ice
cream like almost every single day.

477
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,700
So I didn't want to hike again.

478
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,130
I didn't want to hear
about Kilimanjaro again.

479
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,160
I didn't want anything to do with
mountains until a friend of mine said,

480
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,160
hey, remember that trip up Kilimanjaro
ever since you talked about it with me.

481
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,190
I've always wanted to go and I'd like
to do it to train for an iron man.

482
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:43,441
So my friend would also like to come with
me and together we will raise a dollar

483
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:48,580
per foot of the mountain for
the charity that you love.

484
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,480
So $19,343 was on the line for
Kilimanjaro if you come with us.

485
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,490
And then I had my husband's cousin
who is on the cover of gorge with me,

486
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,250
say to me, you know, I'm in a Rut.

487
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,640
I really need to get out of it.

488
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:11,790
Her mom died of cancer and then her father
was murdered on the roadside in Moab,

489
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:15,100
Utah, all within a couple
of years of each other.

490
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,400
And she was eating and she was shopping,
um,

491
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,650
to kind of get through those feelings.

492
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,840
And so she was putting on a
ton of weight and she's like,

493
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:26,800
I just need something to keep me going.
So all climb Kilimanjaro,

494
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,470
and I'll raise $5,000 for
global lands for Africa.

495
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:33,610
If you come with me and like talk about
like backwards peer pressure, right?

496
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:34,444
This is,

497
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,720
so now if I knew if I climbs that I could
raise an additional $5,000 for global

498
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:40,871
lines for Africa.

499
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:45,871
So now we're talking about $30,000 for
this organization that I really loved.

500
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:46,931
I mean,

501
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:51,450
that's more than enough money to actually
build a library in one of the slums in

502
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,050
Kenya or anything like that.
I mean,

503
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:56,480
there's so much that can be done
with bad amount of money, um,

504
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,600
for the programs that they use. So I
thought, okay, I'll do it. However,

505
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:06,640
if I do it, and this is the
story that's in gorge, um,

506
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,400
that I would need to do the work,

507
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,090
I would have to do the training again,

508
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:16,270
that kind of four to six months,
I've really, really training,

509
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,550
however I needed,

510
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:22,300
the most important thing that I needed
to do was to love myself where I was and

511
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:26,980
go from there. Because initially I
started to do that thinking like, okay,

512
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,420
well I'm going to lose 20 pounds this
month and 10 pounds every month until the

513
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:34,870
hike and that'll be
perfect. And I thought, no,

514
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,590
if I set myself up like that,
it's going to be a complete failure.

515
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,110
What I needed to do was to find a
trainer who would train me as I was,

516
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,560
that I could be able to climb the
mountain at the weight I was at.

517
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,241
I did things like,

518
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:55,160
I signed up for a half marathon in
Vermont called the mad marathon, um,

519
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:58,490
which is the most mountainous marathon,
half marathon I've ever walked.

520
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:01,820
It's incredible. And my husband
did that with me to help me train,

521
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,420
but more importantly I needed
to understand like what
is it about food that has

522
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:10,580
so captured me?
How come I eat?

523
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:15,610
How come I have this like pattern of
existing that is so dangerous to myself?

524
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,960
So if I was going to climb the mountain,

525
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:21,650
not only was I going to do it upon
my own strength and my own body,

526
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,870
I was also going to do the work to
understand the journey that I had been on.

527
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,600
And this of course was
no walk in the park.

528
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,070
I climbed the mountain as
if I was carrying, you know,
another person on my back.

529
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,290
I did the hiking as if I was doing that.

530
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,140
So I did things like I trained in,

531
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:43,680
in tell your ride with my
husband's cousin's Stacy. Um,

532
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,050
and you know,
PSA,

533
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:49,460
it's a lot easier to ski down a mountain
trail than to hike up it because that

534
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:54,110
was some serious hiking up,
some serious trails, those,

535
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,890
but it was so gorgeous when I got to the
top and I was doing actually altitude

536
00:33:57,891 --> 00:34:01,130
training because you know,
those are like 12,000 feet,

537
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:05,060
14,000 feet peaks that we were hiking.
Um,

538
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,150
so when I was,
when I got to the mountain,

539
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:15,380
when I got to there the third time,
I was feeling pretty great about myself.

540
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:18,860
I was feeling like I was ready.
In fact,

541
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,720
so much so that,
um,

542
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:27,040
by the second day two people, two of the
four people who are with us for four,

543
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,800
including myself, were
feeling sick, feeling tired,

544
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,570
feeling like they had made a mistake.

545
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,470
Like they didn't really want it to come
up Kilimanjaro and how could I have said

546
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:39,620
yes to this crazy idea.
Um,

547
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,210
anyway, I started to feel
like, yeah, I feel good.

548
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:46,580
And even after that second
day on the wrong guy route,

549
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:51,080
which is 10 hours of hiking,
10 hours of just drudgery,

550
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,120
it's not a huge incline,
but it is a long slog.

551
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,690
The porters and guides actually
asked me if you know, hey,

552
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:03,380
do you need me to carry your backpack
like two or three times because they were

553
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:07,430
already carrying backpacks of my, you
know, fellow hikers. I'm like, no, no,

554
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:11,570
I feel good. And so, you know,

555
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:16,250
that night when I went to sleep I
was thinking, okay, it's so cold.

556
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:19,520
It was actually so cold that night that
our water bottles frozen our tents.

557
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:22,490
So you know, if you go camping a
lot, you know that kind of night,

558
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:24,890
like all you want to do is
put your sleeping cap on,

559
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:27,830
put yourself in your sleeping bag and
go to sleep so you can wake up for when

560
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:32,090
the sunrises and it could possibly be
a few degrees warmer when you wake up.

561
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,410
So as I was, um, as I was going to sleep,

562
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,500
I started hear rumblings in
Swahili and the tent next to me.

563
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:42,360
That's where the porters
and guides were hanging out.

564
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,280
And I don't know a lot of Swahili,
but I do know a couple things. The,

565
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:50,640
for most important thing that I know
is what they call me in Swahili.

566
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,450
My nickname on the mountain for
all three climbs was Mama Qube wa,

567
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,710
which means big woman, which
didn't bother me. You know,

568
00:35:57,711 --> 00:36:00,960
that's the way they differentiate
me from the other people.

569
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:02,310
They know who they're talking about.

570
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,270
But then I started to hear laughter
and it wasn't like Mama Kubu.

571
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,810
I told this really funny joke and
I'm going to tell you what it is.

572
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,700
I knew at that moment that they were
making fun of me and so these are the

573
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,830
people that we were paying
to help us up the mountain.

574
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:24,240
And I started to feel for the first time
like, I'm not going to do this anymore.

575
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,080
I've done this. This is my third time
up the mountain. I know my way back.

576
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,140
I'll just get a ride to
the hotel and I'm out.

577
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,850
Because I started to think to myself
like, I, I'm not going to do this.

578
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,820
If the people that we're paying to
support us up the mountain don't think I'm

579
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,610
going to make it,
how could I possibly make it?

580
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,460
So I finally told myself to sleep.

581
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:47,850
I remembered things like when I was
doing spinning classes and they did,

582
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,890
you know these mantras and I totally
tried to get myself into the mode where I

583
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:56,310
was like, okay, I believe in me.
I'm going to ignore what they said.

584
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,950
But here's the thing about Kilimanjaro.

585
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,930
You can't push off things if it's raining.

586
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,950
You put on a rain jacket or you
will get soaked. If you're hungry,

587
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,490
you need to eat something or
you're going to be, you know,

588
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,920
you're not going to have enough
energy to do what you need to do.

589
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,030
If you're thirsty,

590
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,350
well then you're far beyond
being dehydrated and you
need to be drinking. Right?

591
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,260
So with the same thing goes with emotions.

592
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,350
It's a really great mountain to kind of
toil through something that you need to

593
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:28,050
figure out because the,
all you have time to do is think,

594
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,730
but you have to do something
with that emotion. And for me,

595
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,990
someone who's been struggling with their
weight for since she was nine years old,

596
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:41,991
I know when people are making fun of me
and I couldn't just put it off anymore

597
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:46,650
and I'll just do a quick reading
about what happened after that point.

598
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,950
So the next morning I
was still feeling it.

599
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,340
I was still feeling upset about
how they felt that, what they,

600
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,060
what they said about me.
However far I walked,

601
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,250
however much I tried to
think of other things,

602
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:02,130
the humiliation of last night
was there and it was raw.

603
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,850
I was overcompensating by being perky,
a cheerleader,

604
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,710
even if I would have never made it on a
team, let alone be on top of a pyramid.

605
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,510
But being perky and positive was how I
usually dealt with everything in public.

606
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,400
I needed to confront Kennedy,

607
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:21,090
but in such a way that he would continue
guiding me up the mountain safely.

608
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:25,950
So when it came time for a water in
pee break amid an outcropping of rocks,

609
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,300
I approached our guide.
What I always with what I always do,

610
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:33,150
when I'm upset or nervous,
I smiled.

611
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,390
I didn't want him to know that is
mocking words made me want to turn back.

612
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,650
So there I was swallowing my true
feelings, trying to be nice. After all,

613
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:43,180
his job was not an easy one.

614
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,660
He was already carrying
Tracy's backpack to help her.

615
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,900
But my cheeks burned.
I was always,

616
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,530
I always live with the feeling that I
couldn't or shouldn't speak up in the face

617
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:58,090
of bullies or my abuser or even my father.
I was swallowing.

618
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,910
I was used to swallowing my
words like 22 rifle shells.

619
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:05,260
So when it came time to
swap, say my words, I nearly
choked on the first syllable.

620
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,960
I want to talk to you
about something I said,

621
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:12,610
interrupting a Swahili conversation he
was having with our assistant guide last

622
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,110
night. I heard you. You were talking
about me. What were you saying? Sorry?

623
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,020
Kennedy said I was pretty
sure he was pretending.

624
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:23,890
He didn't know what I was talking about.
I heard you last night.

625
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,460
I heard you making the trails.
I do when I'm going up and down the trail.

626
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,560
I heard you making fun of
me. I was talking with some
porters who wanted to know,

627
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,190
are you sure she's going to make it?
I was answering them.

628
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,590
They don't believe you're
going to make it to the top.

629
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:43,090
Kennedy said he looked embarrassed,
maybe not because of what he said,

630
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:46,330
but for getting caught from
his tone the night before.

631
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,750
I couldn't help but think that he was
one of the people betting against my

632
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:54,340
success. I knew his laughter and
I believed he was laughing at me.

633
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,110
They don't believe it. I asked.
Yeah, Kennedy answered, looking away.

634
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:04,450
Did you make any money, Beth? Siast
you should. I said, bet on me.

635
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,973
Bet On me.

636
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,530
So that's the only the only time in my
life probably that I've been able to come

637
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:15,610
back with something that to say to
somebody who's made making fun of me and

638
00:40:15,611 --> 00:40:19,360
middle schools just, I was,
uh, you know, an embarrassment.

639
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:22,330
Like I would just hear people making
fun of me and I would just run away and

640
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:24,550
then I'd think about it
like two days later on.

641
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:29,380
The only thing that I can think of of
why I was able to say something with such

642
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:34,381
power and convention conviction
and strength was because
Kilimanjaro allowed me

643
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:39,400
to be all strong. And so I can
ask for what I need for in life.

644
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:40,540
Um,

645
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,130
I can do things that I want to do because
I was finally standing up for myself.

646
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,780
Um, so my wish for you is that, you know,

647
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,550
whatever it is you want to accomplish,

648
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,960
if after this talk you want nothing to
do with Kilimanjaro, whatever it is,

649
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:59,740
whatever goal you have is
that you continue to bet
on yourself because it will

650
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:03,730
always pay off for you in the end.
So thanks.

651
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,770
And I'll take any questions that you have.

652
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,200
Um,
I'm planning a Kilimanjaro hike in June.

653
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:18,170
So first one normally
hike around the bay area.

654
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:22,730
So what do you think will be like most
surprising or shocking to me or what

655
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:25,980
should I do extra to
prepare? Okay, so, uh,

656
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,540
the most surprising or shock being
shocking is when you're shopping for hand

657
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:32,720
wipes, multiply the amount that you
think you need by about four or five.

658
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,580
Um, you know, the training
that you do is pretty obvious.

659
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:40,520
You want to hike up mountains,
you wanted to build strength,

660
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:43,050
you want to build endurance.
Um,

661
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:47,360
but the hardest part is the mental part,
you know,

662
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:51,830
going past what you think you
could possibly do on your own. Um,

663
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,420
that's hard.
But then also in,

664
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:57,250
during that when you feel kind of Yucky
about yourself because you have a shower,

665
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,130
I mean they give you,

666
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,690
at least the tour group that I went with
gave you water to wash up and stuff,

667
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:05,630
but you just feel so
grimy by the end of it.

668
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,670
And that can be kind of tough to
um, endure the physical, you know,

669
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:12,650
usually if, you know,
if you hike around home,

670
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,700
you do a great day hike and then you go
home or you go to a hotel and you shower,

671
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:20,840
that's, you know, backpacking is not
like that where you actually have to, um,

672
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,700
be where you are and continue being
in that mode for several days.

673
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,130
So really prepare for that.

674
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,460
The not only the physicality of the
mountain but the emotional part two.

675
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,200
Thanks. Yup. I want to know what
inspired you to write about this book,

676
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,790
the first book that you write.

677
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,230
I did write a book that I self published
called fat woman on the mountain and

678
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:49,520
that was about my first climb
and I self published that,

679
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,080
um, because I, it was 90% done
on my computer and I thought,

680
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:56,420
well I might as well just
share it with the world.

681
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,560
But this is my first book with a publisher
and I've been lucky enough to work

682
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:04,330
with seal press, which is actually
based, um, nearby in Berkeley, um,

683
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,180
their publisher for
women by women. But, um,

684
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:13,160
as I was working to get
the proposal ready, cause a
nonfiction book, you, you know,

685
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:15,590
you write a proposal, you don't have
to write the whole thing at first,

686
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:19,850
but you have to write a good portion and
know where the book is going. My agent,

687
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,830
Kim Burrell had mentioned that,
you know,

688
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,040
she was looking at the proposal and I was
really focusing on the mountain climb.

689
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:34,100
You know, I'm a fat person and I'm
climbing this mountain. Isn't that great?

690
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,930
You know, it was an adventure story
and she, and I had, uh, you know,

691
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,640
was, uh, what was a very difficult call
for her to make and say that, you know,

692
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,060
this is a great story. Of course it's
important for you to tell this story,

693
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,040
but I need you to be more,
um,

694
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,590
open with your struggles with food
because that is an equally as important as

695
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:58,640
this physical struggle to
hike a mountain. And, um,

696
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:02,480
she assured me, and then people, writers,
like Cheryl strayed, who's my teacher.

697
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,670
She wrote wild that it didn't matter
what I put on the table about my issues

698
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:11,060
with food because two thirds of the United
States struggles with weight and some

699
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,380
way,
shape or form.

700
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:17,710
And so it didn't matter
how open or embarrassing I
thought a story would be that

701
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:21,320
there would be a lot of people nodding
their head or understanding someone

702
00:44:21,321 --> 00:44:25,280
else's behavior because of it.
And so that's what I decided to do.

703
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,230
And with that advice,
I actually change the title.

704
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,280
I had originally called
it big fat mountain,

705
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,740
which I still think it
was kind of good title,

706
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,960
but as I was writing the last
scene, um, which is in a gorge,

707
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,490
I thought,
oh my gosh,

708
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:45,840
it has to be gorge because it means so
many things stay too much in the low

709
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:50,490
point between mountains. Um,
and also slang for gorgeous.

710
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:55,230
But that's third of it though.
It's mostly those two meanings of course.

711
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,720
Um, so anyway, the paradigm of, you know,

712
00:44:57,721 --> 00:45:01,560
sometimes you get some feedback and
even though it's difficult to take, um,

713
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,770
it really was important for me
to hear that. And really, um,

714
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,590
and right to that point.
And once when she did that,

715
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:10,500
I felt like the floodgates open.
I could share anything.

716
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:12,590
And in and thought woman on the mountain,

717
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,500
I shared about being sexually
assaulted in my father, you know,

718
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,710
not being a real big
part of my life, but, um,

719
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,860
in gorger really kind of let it all out,
which was,

720
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,780
it was really important for me to do.
Oh, you playing to play it again? Well,

721
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:32,160
I think it's safe to say it's time to
move on to other mountains. Um, you know,

722
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:35,640
Kilimanjaro three times. I mean, maybe
Oprah could asked me to climb it,

723
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:39,760
but that's about it. Um, but I,

724
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,020
I would love to hike Machu Picchu. Um, I,

725
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,660
I mentioned I studied with Cheryl strayed.
I did that in the French Alps.

726
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,640
So I did a lot of hiking when I was there.

727
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,870
But the most important thing for me at
this point in my life is that hiking

728
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:53,250
comes naturally to me.

729
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,260
So it's not something that I put a barrier
up because of my size. Um, or, you know,

730
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:00,900
have I lost 10 pounds? Have
I gained 10 pounds, you know,

731
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:03,930
wherever I'm at the scale that I love it.
In fact,

732
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:08,220
so much so that I'm an American hiking
society ambassador to share that the

733
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:12,450
outdoors are for everybody.
Um, but you know, they're,

734
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:16,380
my victories today aren't huge mountains.
They are things like, you know,

735
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:19,980
before I left on these two talks,

736
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:23,490
I did a talk at Purdue and um,
I made sure that, you know,

737
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:26,550
I had my seeds ordered for
my community garden plot,

738
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,560
so I had healthy things
for my family to eat. Um,

739
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,250
there are things like going to family
swim because putting a bathing suit on for

740
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:39,600
me it can be as intimidating as Everest.
Okay. Let's just be honest here, you know,

741
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:44,601
so that I actually am leading an active
life no matter where I am on the scale

742
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:48,060
for myself, for my kids, for my future.

743
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,830
So you mentioned wipes and they saw the
polls and I'd read the blogs, you know,

744
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:53,050
what,

745
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:56,200
is there any kind of equipment that you
needed that you didn't think you would

746
00:46:56,201 --> 00:46:58,000
have needed or did you didn't read about?

747
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,510
Well the, you know, if you go
with a reputable tour company,

748
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:06,320
they will give you a supply list. So you
can feel pretty comfortable about that.

749
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,660
Um, the people that Rei won't
steer you wrong usually.

750
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,260
Um, I would say that the most important
thing for you to move money into his,

751
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:18,120
into your socks and boots. Okay. Um,

752
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,350
I am not a fancy bag kind of person,

753
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:24,590
even though there's a Bloomingdale's and
the next town over, I never go there.

754
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:28,550
But if I go to Rei,
I mean I dropped $300 on a pair of boots,

755
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:30,790
but it's worth it.
Um,

756
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:36,330
I bought a pair of a solos that actually
I took up Kilimanjaro three times and

757
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:39,490
all the training in between.

758
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,630
And the only reason I gave them away
at the end was because our guide was

759
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:48,100
wearing sketchers. Okay. You know,
and so you want to make sure, um,

760
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,470
as a side note,
if you do decide to climb the mountain,

761
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:54,550
you want to make sure that you're a
guide company really takes care of their

762
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:58,300
porters because it's, uh, you
know, it's considered a good job.

763
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,810
However, you know, you want to make
sure that they have good footwear,

764
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:06,110
that they have enough to stay warm because
you'll see how much you pack. And it,

765
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,080
um, it'll depend, you know, there's,

766
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:10,300
there's guidelines about
how many pounds it can be,

767
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,100
but then you see these porters
are carrying up all your
stuff and then there's a

768
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:20,070
tiny little backpacks. So, um,
think about that for sure. Um,

769
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,180
when you go,
but I'm hiking poles.

770
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:26,440
It's good to start training with them
even though you don't think you need them

771
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,910
because you know, it does take a lot of
your shoulders to kind of move with them.

772
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,510
Um, so you don't want to be
feeling like that is, um,

773
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,550
something new for you on the mountain.

774
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,510
You really don't want anything to
feel really totally new for you.

775
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:44,260
Any of your gear except for meeting maybe
gators because those go on the outside

776
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:46,780
of your pants.
So

777
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,280
one last follow up.
Sure.

778
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,250
I read somewhere that you wanted your
shoes to have a little bit of space so

779
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:53,320
when you come down your
towed isn't seemed cam,

780
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:57,010
but that seems kind of odd in the sense
that going up you don't really want

781
00:48:57,011 --> 00:49:00,730
loose boots either. Huh? Was
that an issue when you came down?

782
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:02,530
Did you feel like your
toes are getting spam?

783
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:07,380
Well, yes and no. I mean it's a,

784
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:11,960
it's an interesting question. You want to
feel that with your outfitter. You know,

785
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:15,960
whoever's selling you your boots and
look up more online about that. I mean,

786
00:49:15,961 --> 00:49:19,830
because I've had, you know,
my third climb, by the time
it got down the mountain,

787
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,390
I had this horrible blister,

788
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:24,990
which I won't describe because it's
probably like the adult content.

789
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:28,440
Like you don't want to
hear about that on my toe.

790
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,870
But I think it's because my laces
weren't tight enough. You know,

791
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,040
it was probably like too tired to
just go down to the tie them tightly.

792
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:38,160
So you know, you want to make sure
all those things are taken care of.

793
00:49:38,161 --> 00:49:41,660
Another thing is you want to make sure
your toes are really well clipped and

794
00:49:41,661 --> 00:49:46,620
your toenails. Because if you, if you
have two long toenails, that will also,

795
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:51,140
you'll lose a lot of toenails because of
that. So lots of chips, lots of footwear,

796
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,800
ask lots of questions.
I mean,

797
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:56,430
the people who work at outdoors stores
often do it because they love gear and

798
00:49:56,431 --> 00:50:00,420
they love hiking. And so, um, if
they don't know than someone else,

799
00:50:00,421 --> 00:50:03,960
I'm sure someone on their staff
has done a similar hike. Yeah.
