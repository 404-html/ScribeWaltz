1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,140
And so now without further
Ado, uh, Sarah McBride,

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,160
thank you

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,610
on, can you hear me? Thank you so much.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,430
Thank you all for coming
out during your lunch break.

5
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,560
It's wonderful to be here at Google.

6
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:26,730
My brother in law works in the New York
office, so it's great to be with family.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,940
Uh, my name's Sarah McBride. Uh,

8
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:31,650
I'm the national press secretary
at the human rights campaign,

9
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:35,070
the nation's largest LGBTQ
civil rights organization.

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,970
I am 27 years old. I'm a
native of Wilmington, Delaware,

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,790
a proud graduate of American
University and I'm a transgender woman.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,750
It took me 21 years to muster up the
courage to say those last two words,

13
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,700
transgender woman today,

14
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:58,290
they are among my proudest identities
and this afternoon I can stand before you

15
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,310
as the person that I am, but of
course I don't have to tell you that.

16
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:03,750
It hasn't always been that way.

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,650
I remember as a child lying in my bed at
night praying that I would wake up the

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,770
next day and be myself to just have my
family be proud of me and to still be

19
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:17,460
able to pursue my dreams.

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,270
I was a big reader of history growing
up and in reading the history books,

21
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:23,460
it became abundantly clear to me,

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,150
but no one quite like me
had ever made it very far,

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,510
at least no one who
was out and growing up.

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,540
It was clear as the sky is blue that
my dreams and my identity or mutually

25
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:41,370
exclusive.
And so I kept that fact inside.

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,970
I told myself that if I could make
it worthwhile for other people,

27
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,660
for me to stay in the closet by making
a difference in this world by making my

28
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:49,590
family proud,

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,360
but those things would somehow
bring me wholeness and completeness.

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,850
I think one of the challenges we have
in the fight for trans equality, uh,

31
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,860
differs in the fight for gay equality is
that people who aren't transgender have

32
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:10,080
a difficult time understanding what it
feels like to have a gender identity that

33
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,650
differs from your sex assigned at birth.
For Straight folks,

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,010
they understand generally speaking,
what it's like to love and to lust.

35
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,030
And there's a entry point into
empathizing with gay, lesbian, bisexual,

36
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:25,380
and queer individuals who
aren't transgender but
because they don't necessarily

37
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:29,700
have that analogous experience for the
experience of being in the closet as a

38
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:30,391
trans person,

39
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:35,391
it becomes a little bit more difficult
and for me and while every journey is

40
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:39,720
different and every experience is
different for me, being in the closet,

41
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,750
not being seen and affirmed as my whole
self by society felt like a constant

42
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:46,470
feeling of homesickness,

43
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,990
that unwavering ache in the pit of my
stomach that would only go away when I

44
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:56,991
could be seen and affirmed as myself
and I'm like home sickness with physical

45
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:01,930
location which has a dissipates with
time and getting your used to your new

46
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,830
surroundings.

47
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,490
This homesickness would only increase
with distance during my sophomore year in

48
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:13,180
college after moving down to DC
for my home state of Delaware,

49
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:17,830
I was elected president of the student
body of American University and it was

50
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,090
through that experience.

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,800
It was through advocating on a number
of issues including LGBTQ equality,

52
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,850
that it became clear that the things I
told myself would make me feel whole and

53
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,890
complete.
Making a difference in this world,

54
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,260
but those things would actually fill the
void in my life and at a certain point

55
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:39,340
that homesickness had become so all
encompassing that my gender identity was a

56
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:39,860
reality,

57
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,830
was a fact that I thought about every
single waking hour of every single day.

58
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,790
I remember sitting in Church on Christmas
Eve night with my parents listening to

59
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:54,520
the choir sing and looking
up at the stained glass
windows and just knowing that

60
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:58,900
I couldn't spend any more time
missing the beauty in this world.

61
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,370
I couldn't spend any more time watching
my life pass by me without fully living

62
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,340
as myself.
And so I didn't waste any time.

63
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:11,341
I came out to my parents the next day on
Christmas Day in 2011 I kind of ruined

64
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:14,320
Christmas.
But you know what?

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,810
The big present for them
that they were not expecting.

66
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,740
And while my parents
struggled with my news,

67
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:25,741
while my parents made clear that they
really wished this wasn't the path that we

68
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:28,060
were on,
that they loved me,

69
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,850
and that they would support
me in every step of the way.

70
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,980
My parents, they, they feared
rejection in every sense of the word.

71
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:39,970
And we sat down and we talk for the
next several days as they went through a

72
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:44,530
mourning period,
it sort of felt like I was dying to them.

73
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,150
So I sat down with them and I ask them
every question while simultaneously

74
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,830
listening to their cries and telling
them that there was nothing I could do

75
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:56,020
about this,
that this was who I am and this was,

76
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,650
these were the steps that I need to take.
And so I answered every question,

77
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,410
mostly beginning with,
are you sure? And I said,

78
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,650
I'm as sure as the fact that I love you.

79
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,570
They asked my dad a progressive,
uh, asked me, he said,

80
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,190
I don't quite understand.

81
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,710
One of the things that I feel like
we've learned is that gender is a social

82
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:18,370
construct.
And how do you feel a gender identity?

83
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:20,660
How do you have a deeply held
sense of a gender identity?

84
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:22,240
If gender's a social construct,

85
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,160
and I told my dad that for me
gender is a lot like language.

86
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,400
Language itself is a social construct.

87
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,700
Every single word has
been created by humankind,

88
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,300
but language expresses very real things.

89
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,700
The feeling of happiness,
that sensation is very real.

90
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,210
The word happiness is a social construct
and just like with gender where there

91
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:53,020
are an infinite number of ways to express
an individual deeply held sense of

92
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:56,590
your gender identity with language,
with everyday individual feeling,

93
00:05:56,591 --> 00:06:00,170
there's an infinite number of
ways to express that feeling,

94
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,990
whether it's in the different words you
use for the different construction of

95
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:07,991
sentences or the nonverbals and gender
in many ways operates the same way.

96
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,010
So these conversations, they could help
my parents intellectualize this news,

97
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:16,370
but it didn't solve the
fact that they were scared.

98
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,270
But with the courage and confidence that
that my family gave me in May of 2012

99
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:26,210
during the last day of my term as student
body president at American University,

100
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,840
I announced to the broader
campus community that I was
Sarah and an op Ed in the

101
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:32,120
Aau student newspaper.

102
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,760
I was very scared and nervous
about the university's response.

103
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,970
This was 2012 it was well before what
Time magazine called the transgender

104
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:45,890
tipping point and I had seen
the university welcome gay,

105
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:48,470
lesbian,
and bisexual students pretty seamlessly,

106
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:52,220
but I wasn't quite sure how they'd
respond to a transgender student,

107
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,230
let alone a transgender
student body president.

108
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,690
And almost immediately after posting
that note and then posting the op Ed,

109
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,110
the messages of love and support began
to come in from students across campus.

110
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,360
And when I was student body president,

111
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:12,470
I always said that our college campuses
should look like the country we want to

112
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,420
build in 10 or 15 years.

113
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,990
And what was amazing was that on that
night in 2012 Aau was trying to send a

114
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,220
message to the country,

115
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:26,420
which is that while we may still be
learning about transgender identities,

116
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:31,070
and while we may not totally
understand transgender experiences,

117
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,220
this is how you respond with love,

118
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,680
with acceptance and with support.

119
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,300
One student commented that the joy on
campus sort of felt like we had just won a

120
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,350
sports championship,

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,800
which I don't know how we would know
because a doesn't actually win sports

122
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,800
championships,
but it was just an overkill,

123
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,290
overwhelming sense of joy and love.

124
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:56,291
And it became abundantly clear to me that
as difficult as it was for me to come

125
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,294
out,

126
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,290
it was relatively easy compared to the
experience of far too many transgender

127
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,430
people across this country,

128
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:08,270
particularly transgender folks living
at the intersection of multiple

129
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,680
marginalized identities.

130
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,140
And so I wanted to make sure moving
forward that the privileges that I had and

131
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:16,910
coming out of keeping my family,

132
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,070
of being able to continue at my
school of being safe from violence,

133
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,060
that those would no longer be a privileged
but rather a right guaranteed to

134
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:29,810
every single person, no matter their
sexual orientation or gender identity.

135
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,630
Because it shouldn't be a
privilege to keep your family.

136
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,830
It shouldn't be a privilege to be able
to keep your job or stay in school

137
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,020
because you come out as transgender.

138
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,590
It shouldn't be a privilege
to be safe from violence.

139
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,540
So I moved back to my home state of
Delaware. I began working with our states,

140
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,180
a quality organization, Equality
Delaware, because at that time,

141
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:54,860
Delaware was one of a majority of states
in this country that still lacked clear

142
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:58,630
and explicit protections
from discrimination for, uh,

143
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,020
for transgender people.
And to this day,

144
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:04,590
a majority of states and the federal
government still lack those same explicit

145
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,320
protections for Lgbtq people more broadly.

146
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,690
And so day in and day out,

147
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,370
we went down to the state legislature
and I started out telling these

148
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:17,910
legislators about all of the stack stats
and all of the statistics and all of

149
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:22,620
the facts. But as I watched my parents
connect with these legislators,

150
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:26,940
I realize that my job wasn't
to offer the most cogent case.

151
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,990
My job was to offer the most compelling
case. And at the end of the day,

152
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:34,140
stories have the power to make change.

153
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,210
Vulnerability,

154
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:41,160
I learned was oftentimes is oftentimes
our best path toward justice and equality.

155
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,660
Because vulnerability, it transcends
geography. It transcends ideology,

156
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:48,660
it transcends race, religion, gender.

157
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,690
Everyone understands what it
feels like to be vulnerable.

158
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,080
Everyone understands what
it feels like to be other,

159
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:58,320
and everyone understands what
it feels like to be scared.

160
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,270
They don't want that for themselves.

161
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:02,820
And hopefully they don't
want that for other people.

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,370
And so by telling our stories,

163
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,630
it became abundantly clear to these
legislators that behind this national

164
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:14,100
conversation on transgender rights
are quite simply real people,

165
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,220
people who love and laugh,
hope and dream,

166
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:19,860
fear and cry just like everyone else.

167
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,580
And when they learned that simple but
radical fact about transgender people,

168
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,400
they could no longer look us in the eye
and deny us the equal protection of the

169
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:32,250
laws they swore to uphold.
And so in,

170
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:36,570
in June of 2013 we were able to convince
enough state legislators to pass the

171
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,430
gender identity nondiscrimination act.

172
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,090
And fortunately that night the governor
signed it into law in Delaware.

173
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,190
But like I said, that isn't the reality
in most states across this country.

174
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:50,760
And so I moved back down to DC to begin
working first at a place called the

175
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:53,880
center for American progress and now at
the human rights campaign to try to make

176
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:57,330
sure that the change we've seen in
states like Washington and states like

177
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:59,550
Delaware,
while there's so much more work to do,

178
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,500
to at least allow other places in this
country to see the change that we've seen

179
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,420
in places like Washington and Delaware.

180
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,860
Now I come to this fight and one of the
most important stories that I share in

181
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:17,550
my book is the fact that
I come to this fight,

182
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,760
not just as a transgender person,
but also as someone who's loved,

183
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,990
someone who's transgender.

184
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,190
I met my future husband Andy fighting
for equality and we fell in love.

185
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,400
I did myered his extraordinary
courage, optimism, and advocacy.

186
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,250
You was a transgender man about
three years older than me.

187
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,800
After we started dating,

188
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,330
Andy was diagnosed with
cancer and after radiation,

189
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:46,740
chemo and surgery, and eventually
getting a clean bill of health.

190
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Andy received the news that every single
cancer patient fears his cancer was

191
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,730
back. It had spread, and
for him it was terminal.

192
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,930
After Andy found out that he
didn't have much time left,

193
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,860
he asked me to marry him and
of course the answer was yes.

194
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,530
Three weeks after his terminal diagnosis,

195
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:13,330
we married on the rooftop of our
apartment building in front of family and

196
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:14,164
friends,

197
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,610
and then just four days
after that he passed away

198
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,170
and I share that story today and I share
that experience in this book because

199
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,960
knowing and loving Andy
left me profoundly changed.

200
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,030
He taught me how to love and be loved.
He taught me how to live the values.

201
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:36,970
I fight for it work in my own life,
but more than anything else,

202
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:41,971
my relationship with Andy underscored for
me that change cannot come fast enough

203
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,530
that every day matters when it comes to
building a world where every person can

204
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:51,280
live their life to the fullest.
After Andy passed away,

205
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,560
I went through the
different stages of grief.

206
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,290
I went through sadness and disbelief,

207
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,260
and then I eventually landed on anger.
I'm not an angry person.

208
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,360
By nature.
I find petty anger,

209
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:07,660
the kind of anger that you feel when
you're slighted by a friend or feel under

210
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,410
appreciated to be kind of a waste of time,
and I'm a pretty lazy person,

211
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,320
but that's not the only type of anger
that exists. There's also righteous anger.

212
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,940
The kind of anger that when met with a
mission and hope has throughout history

213
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:23,110
help change the world.

214
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,660
Andy had had the courage to come out as
his authentic self at a relatively young

215
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:29,494
age.

216
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,310
He have the courage in college to say
to this world that tells us that who we

217
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,070
are as wrong, that he would
not spend one more day hiding.

218
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,630
He was supposed to have three quarters
of his life as his authentic self,

219
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,910
but because of circumstances outside of
his control, he had less than a quarter.

220
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,480
Some people have even less time than that.

221
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,810
Hope it can be limitless.
Ideas can always be found.

222
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,340
Inspiration is often endless,

223
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:01,900
but time that is the one resource
and none of us can afford to waste.

224
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,080
Dr. King called it the
fierce urgency of now.

225
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,860
I was angry that society,
that a hateful world,

226
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,940
even with his progressive family and
friends had kept that time and truth away

227
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:17,440
from Andy that had kept him inside of
himself for what ended up being a majority

228
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,280
of his life.

229
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,380
And it made me more fully realized
that when we ask transgender people,

230
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,840
when we ask any marginalized person,

231
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:29,950
whether we ask people living in poverty
or women or people of color are those

232
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:30,701
with disabilities.

233
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:35,701
When we ask anyone to sit back and
allow a slow conversation to take place

234
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,050
before we grant them opportunity
and treat them with dignity,

235
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,520
we are asking that person to watch their
one life pass by without the respect

236
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,040
and fairness that every person deserves.

237
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,970
This is truly a critical moment in the
fight for trans equality and the fight

238
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,480
for Lgbtq equality.

239
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,200
Over the last year and a
half at the federal level,

240
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:05,201
we have seen attack after attack
after attack on the Lgbtq community.

241
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,150
Not to get too political,

242
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,620
but the political is personal and this
conversation and just a few months after

243
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,950
taking office, Donald Trump, Mike pence,

244
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,760
Betsy devoss and Jeff sessions rescinded
lifesaving guidance promoting the

245
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:22,100
protection of transgender students.

246
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,410
They've appointed Antia quality extremist
people who've compared being gay to

247
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,590
pedophilia and called transgender youth.
Part of Satan's plan.

248
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:34,820
They've appointed people like that to
administration positions and the federal

249
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:39,020
bench. They've granted a sweeping license
to discriminate to government workers,

250
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:43,160
federal contractors, and even healthcare
professionals against Lgbtq people,

251
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:46,230
religious minorities and women,
and of course,

252
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:50,540
and one of his most shameful moves,
yet in a series of erotic tweets,

253
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,030
although every single one of his tweets,
his erratic,

254
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,280
he targeted transgender troops,

255
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:58,970
whereas hate by trying to reinstate a
ban on transgender people serving openly

256
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:01,610
in the military,
which is America's largest employer.

257
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,860
But we also know that the
challenges facing the Trans
Community do not begin and

258
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:09,530
end with the federal administration.

259
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,450
2017 was the deadliest year on
record for the transgender community.

260
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,220
At least 28 transgender people,
mostly trans women of color were killed.

261
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,700
And while that violence
has been on the rise,

262
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:26,300
in part because of politicians all
too eager to appeal to the darkest

263
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:29,600
undercurrents of American
society that hate is not new.

264
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,800
I mentioned that a majority of states
and the federal government still lack

265
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,340
clear protections from discrimination
and employment and housing and public

266
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:38,174
spaces.

267
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,250
And through it all Lgbtq people are as
diverse as the fabric of this nation.

268
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,270
And for those living at the intersection
of multiple marginalized identities,

269
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:51,320
those forced to face not just transphobia,
but misogyny and racism,

270
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,320
the stigma, the prejudice,
the discrimination, and yes,

271
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,290
the violence can have
often deadly consequences.

272
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,700
In 2017 we saw over 130 Antia quality
bills introduced in 30 states.

273
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,280
I'm very proud that here in Washington,

274
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,480
you all were able to keep an initiative
off the ballot that would have targeted

275
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:15,440
transgender people for discrimination
that sent a powerful message across this

276
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,274
country.

277
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,480
That discrimination will
not be tolerated by voters,

278
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,790
by activists,
by people across the state.

279
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,750
But we still have a lot of challenges in
state legislatures across the country.

280
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,780
And the two most frequent
types of bills we're seeing.

281
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,410
The first is legislation that seeks to
utilize religious freedom as a guide,

282
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:37,220
as to license discrimination.

283
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,870
These bills are coming from the same folks
who are trying to keep people from an

284
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:43,820
entire religion,
from entering this country.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,120
And yet they're trying to claim that
religious freedom allows them to have a

286
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:52,080
sphere without LGBTQ people, without
interaction, uh, with Lgbtq people,

287
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,410
religious freedom as a
core and fundamental value.

288
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,820
But religious freedom has always been
a shield against government persecution

289
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:00,930
for religious minorities.

290
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:05,190
It has never been and should never
be a sword to inflict harm on people.

291
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:10,620
The second type of bell we're seeing are
the North Carolina style bathroom bills,

292
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,840
legislation that seeks to
forbid transgender people
from accessing restrooms

293
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:17,490
consistent with their gender identity.

294
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,950
One of the most frequent questions I
get is why do we hear so much about

295
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:24,960
bathrooms and this fight
for trans equality?

296
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,340
And the first thing I say is that frankly,
transgender people would rather,

297
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,470
for the most part,
not talk about bathrooms.

298
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,070
We're talking about dignity and equality
and fairness throughout daily life.

299
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,560
But yes,
that includes restrooms.

300
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,740
It's opponents of equality that
keep bringing up restrooms.

301
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,360
And they do it for two reasons.

302
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,870
The first is the knowledge that
bathrooms are politically potent weapons.

303
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,970
Every single battle for
civil and human rights.

304
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:55,440
Opponents of equality have
sought to center in on bathrooms.

305
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:59,580
In the conversation, we saw it in the
fight around the civil rights act.

306
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:02,580
We saw it in response to the push
for the equal rights amendment.

307
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:04,950
We saw it in the early days
of the gay rights movement.

308
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,420
We saw it in response to the effort to
pass the Americans with disabilities act,

309
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:14,421
and today we're seeing it in response
to the transgender rights movement and

310
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,000
they understand that everyone feels a
little bit vulnerable and restrooms.

311
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,450
Everyone feels a little bit squeamish and
restrooms and when you can stoke fears,

312
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:25,650
when you can take advantage of people's
ignorance and lack of understanding of

313
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:26,730
who transgender people are.

314
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:31,731
Bathrooms become fertile ground for for
fearmongering and for scare tactics,

315
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,810
but it's also a little bit more insidious
than that why they are focusing on

316
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:37,644
bathrooms.

317
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,780
The reason is because they understand
that if they lose on every other issue,

318
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,120
if they can win on bathrooms,

319
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,050
if they can legislate or allow for
discrimination to occur in bathrooms,

320
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:53,130
it becomes the closest thing to a
silver bullet to allowing discrimination

321
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,390
throughout daily life.

322
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,920
Because if you cannot easily and safely
access a restroom that makes sense for

323
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:03,270
you, it becomes much more difficult
to go to school, to go to work,

324
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:05,670
to leave your house for more
than two or three hours.

325
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,650
And so these efforts are nothing more
than a thinly veiled attempt to legislate

326
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:12,960
and pushed transgender
people out of public life.

327
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,950
And we need our allies to understand
that we need folks to understand just how

328
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:22,470
dangerous this agenda is for
transgender people across this country.

329
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,880
That it's not just an indignity,
which is bad enough.

330
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,050
It's not just allowing discrimination
in one small area of life.

331
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,310
It is nothing more than an effort to push
us back into the shadows and into the

332
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:36,144
closet.

333
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,610
But we've also seen in response to every
single one of these attacks that when a

334
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,580
politician comes for us, whether
it's Pat McCrory in North Carolina,

335
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:47,010
whether it's Donald
Trump in the White House,

336
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,650
we have seen that each attack unleashes
a national dialogue that only hope only

337
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:55,600
serves to open hearts
and change minds further,

338
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,460
and in the end it ends up sewing the seeds
of the destruction of the politics of

339
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:04,570
hate and the policies that they seek
to implement. We saw at North Carolina,

340
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:08,840
we're seeing it now nationally,
which is that when our allies stand up,

341
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,770
when diverse LGBTQ voices are heard,

342
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,290
when the business community speaks out,

343
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,700
we can still defeat the
politics of fear and division,

344
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:21,550
the politics of discrimination
and misinformation.

345
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,110
One of the things that I carry with me
in all of the work that we're doing is

346
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:32,590
advice that my brother gave me
in the last month of Andy's life.

347
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,330
My brother who's a radiation oncologist
and has watched far too many people pass

348
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:41,140
away from cancer. He said to me, this
is going to be incredibly difficult,

349
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,600
but take stock in the acts of amazing
grace that you see around you every single

350
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,270
day.
And while it's almost a trite saying,

351
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:52,960
sort of find the beauty
in even that tragedy,

352
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,540
it was a perspective change that
allowed me to truly find that beauty,

353
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,680
to see that hope only makes sense in
the face of hardship and a witness,

354
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:05,380
the little miracles that happened
around me every single day.

355
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,280
And it taught me beyond that experience
that all of us can bear witness to acts

356
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:15,220
of amazing grace that even
in the darkest moments,

357
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,610
even in the most troubling times,
if we look around for it,

358
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:22,570
we can see acts of courage,
bravery and compassion all around us.

359
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,130
And we're seeing it every day across
this country and the people marching and

360
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:30,790
the people protesting and folks showing
up in record numbers and special

361
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:35,290
elections and people standing up against
the politics of hate in ways that we've

362
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:40,291
never seen before and young people in
Parkland turning tragedy into action.

363
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,170
We're seeing that amazing
grace every single day.

364
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,610
And if there's also one thing we've
seen throughout the movement for Lgbtq

365
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:52,360
equality and throughout every single
battle for civil and human rights and our

366
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:57,190
country's history,
it's that change is always possible.

367
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,510
It's not easy.
It doesn't happen inevitably,

368
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,820
but with hard work and compassion,

369
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,790
it is clear that we can make
more tomorrows better than today.

370
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,580
And I get to see that
change every single day.

371
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:14,200
In my job with HRC when I came
out six years ago is transgender.

372
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,370
It was clear that my dreams and my
identity were mutually exclusive,

373
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,650
and yet today I get to meet
countless young transgender
kids across this country,

374
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,100
young transgender people like Stella,

375
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,650
a 13 year old from just out of Seattle,

376
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,090
who when I met her last year and asked
her what she wants to be when she grows

377
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:38,200
up, she declared without any hesitation
that she will be the first transgender

378
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:43,201
president put once seemed so impossible
that we could live our truth and dream

379
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:48,050
big dreams is now very
real to kids like Stella.

380
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,830
The mere fact that these young Lgbtq
people exist today demonstrates how far

381
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:55,970
we've come.
But of course,

382
00:23:55,971 --> 00:24:00,290
the fundamental truth remains that no
one in any community is totally equal

383
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,670
until all of us from the
gay Muslim refugee to the
queer undocumented immigrant

384
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:09,290
to the transgender woman of color
living right here in Seattle until every

385
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,440
single one of us is treated
with dignity and fairness.

386
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,510
But I know that that day
will come and when it does,

387
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,770
when our understanding of we,
the people finally includes all of us,

388
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,840
a young Lgbtq kid will grow up and learn
about these struggles for justice and

389
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:31,190
equality in their history books and never
have to know what this progress felt

390
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:35,270
like to all of us because they
will never know anything different.

391
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,950
And that will be because of advocates
and activists who dreamed of a different

392
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:42,650
world.
It'll be because of Lgbtq people,

393
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,770
marginalized people speaking
out and stepping up.

394
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:49,490
It'll be because our allies worked with
us to bend the arc of the moral universe

395
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:51,950
just a little bit more towards justice.

396
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,070
So I want to thank you
all for having me today.

397
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:58,340
I'd love to answer any questions
and I appreciate you coming for this

398
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:00,140
conversation.
Thank you all very much.

399
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,300
[inaudible].

400
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,930
So there are several openly trans,
um,

401
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,160
celebrities, I guess you can
say. Ah, we had like Renee Cox,

402
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,850
uh,
um,

403
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,470
Laverne Cox, silver, not sorry.

404
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,490
Um, uh, and uh, Caitlyn Jenner. Um,

405
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,770
very different, very, very
different, very different.

406
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,270
Um, any comment on, on how they, um,

407
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,910
represent the trans community
or it's a good question.

408
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,390
Um, I think Laverne Cox
is an incredible person.

409
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,140
I think Laverne Cox is one of the
best spokespeople that we have for our

410
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:47,130
community, even though that's not her
job. Her job is, is to be an actor,

411
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:50,670
but she has taken on the responsibility
that comes with being a trailblazer with

412
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:54,230
such grace and such compassion and,
and,

413
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,260
and such scale that I am perpetually
thankful for folks like Laverne Cox,

414
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,160
Janet mock, so many
others. Um, Caitlyn Jenner,

415
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,800
uh,
is,

416
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,670
I'm very happy for Caitlyn Jenner.
Um,

417
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,970
I think on the whole,

418
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,570
Caitlyn Jenner is coming out has been
a net positive for the transgender

419
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:23,571
community because I do think that her
coming out offered a opportunity for

420
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:27,600
conversations that weren't
happening in far too many places.

421
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:31,050
One of the best things that
that happened that night,

422
00:26:31,051 --> 00:26:36,051
the Diane Sawyer interview aired was
that every single local ABC station also

423
00:26:36,991 --> 00:26:41,780
after that segment, how to story about
a local transgender person, right?

424
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,410
Not Laverne Cox,
right?

425
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:45,990
Every single one feature a
transgender person in that community.

426
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:49,720
And so often we hear from elected
officials, from people. Um,

427
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,400
there aren't any trans people that live
around here. And that's just an absurd,

428
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,710
it's just not true.
Uh,

429
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:58,440
and so in having that opportunity
to elevate those stories,

430
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,510
to demonstrate the
diversity of our community,

431
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:05,250
the fact that we are in every single area
of this country, uh, was truly profound.

432
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:09,270
And I think, you know, there
were, they were, excuse me,

433
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:14,271
seven year old people in Iowa or in
Arizona who were having conversations

434
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,170
perhaps in perfectly,

435
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:19,740
but we're having conversations about trans
identities and trans people maybe for

436
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,660
the first time around their
dinner table that night.

437
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,750
And that's how change happens.
Now.

438
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,520
I don't for really one
second, uh, agree with,

439
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,420
uh, Caitlin Jenner's politics and, um,

440
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,710
I would love to have a prolonged debate
with her about that at some point.

441
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,330
Um, but, but I'm, I'm, I'm happy
for her. I think for the most part,

442
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:46,280
we've got some exceptional folks who
we're serving as, as Laverne Cox says,

443
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:48,360
this possibility models
for so many young people.

444
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:53,361
And that's truly incredible that there
is a generation growing up that's living

445
00:27:55,501 --> 00:28:00,501
authentically that can turn on their
television and see folks in television,

446
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,160
in business and politics
for the first time,

447
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,600
not just as themselves, but succeeding
as themselves. And that's lifesaving.

448
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,120
Thank you so much for being here
and telling your story. Of course.

449
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,600
So my sister's transgender and she,

450
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,840
she wants to just be perceived as
female and wants to erase her past.

451
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,940
So I'm wondering what's your,

452
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,970
how do you make sense of your
past and what's it like being out,

453
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:36,160
being openly accepting of your own
identity? So that's a great question.

454
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,983
Excuse me.

455
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,040
I think one of the most dangerous
narratives I think we have in the Lgbtq

456
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:45,370
community is that everyone has to be out,
everyone has to be out.

457
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:50,370
And I think that that is an unfair burden
to place on an already marginalized

458
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:53,860
community. I think particularly
for transgender people,

459
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:58,090
when in existing in this world,
if people know they're transgender,

460
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:02,740
it can oftentimes be an asterisk on
their gender and they know they can't be

461
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,040
fully seen as themselves,
which then causes pain.

462
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,660
I don't want to cause anyone pain
and I don't want to have to go about,

463
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,730
one of the things that
Andy always taught me,

464
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:17,080
and we actually had this conversation
around out in Antioch Quality Politicians

465
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,910
who were closeted. And Andy said
to me, one, we're not gonna,

466
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,430
we're not gonna open any
one's heart by adding people.

467
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:28,450
But I'm fighting for a world where every
person can live their gender identity

468
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:30,610
and sexual orientation
the way they need to.

469
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:36,310
And that's a principle that
I'm not willing to sacrifice,

470
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,320
so I'm not willing to universalize.

471
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,960
This notion that everyone has
to be out in pursuit of a,

472
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,220
that contradicts that tactic and if my
principal that I'm fighting for is not a

473
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:47,380
first principle that I'm not
willing to break than what is,

474
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,830
so I think we have to get past this
place where everyone has to be out.

475
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,200
Sharing one story can be
incredibly empowering.

476
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:58,770
I want to build a world where people
can be seen as trans people and be seen

477
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:02,980
fully as the gender identity
that they are. Right.

478
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,480
One of the things that I always say is
people write trans woman as one word and

479
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:08,980
I say, no, it's two words.

480
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,800
My identity as a woman and my
identity as a trans person,

481
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,080
they compliment each other.
They interact with each other,

482
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,270
but they don't negate one another.

483
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,640
They don't change the other
fact about one another.

484
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,990
I'm proud of my transgender identity. I'm
proud of the journey that I've been on.

485
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,490
I think being transgender has made me a
stronger, a more compassionate person.

486
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,990
I think being transgender helped
lead me to find the love of my life.

487
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,590
And I think being transgender has brought
me into a community that is beautiful

488
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,700
and part of the rich diversity of
this country and this world. Um,

489
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,230
and so,
you know,

490
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,120
there are going to be people for me
who aren't willing to see me as a woman

491
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:48,970
because I'm also out as trans.

492
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,320
And I'm fortunate to have,
I think privileges that allow,

493
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,440
that shield me from the consequences
of those stigmas and biases.

494
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:58,870
It doesn't bother me either.
Um,

495
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,670
at the end of the day it doesn't cause
me pain anymore. It may be used to. Um,

496
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,590
but for those who would experience pain,
I would never want to say to them,

497
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,850
well,

498
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,290
you have to go through even
more for a political end.

499
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,210
Even if that political
and his moral imperative,

500
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,270
I'm not willing to require
someone to live their life,

501
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,890
to watch their life pass
by or to experience more
pain in their one life, uh,

502
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,620
for this movement. There are so many
other ways that we can achieve a quality.

503
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:30,040
So those are sort of my individual
feelings about me being out,

504
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:35,020
but also my feelings more broadly about
not requiring other people who are Lgbtq

505
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:39,930
to be out.
So the,

506
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:44,931
the human rights campaign is not have
the best track record for trends,

507
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,800
advocacy. Uh, for example,

508
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,900
there's the scorecard for
lots of large companies,

509
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,220
um, that will mark 100%
this, this company is,

510
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:02,480
is great for Lgbtq folks
and their, their, uh,

511
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,220
medical insurance will be,

512
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,280
we'll have trans exclusion clauses
and if they can't get a hundred,

513
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:14,390
if they're, if they have
exclusion clauses, that's,
that's that that has changed.

514
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,610
That has changed now.
Sorry,

515
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,610
if you want to finish your question and
I can respond to, to all of it. Right.

516
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,620
I was sorry. I was just asking,
um, that now that you're with HRC,

517
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:28,350
what positive changes have
you seen in that organization?

518
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,320
So that's a great question I think,
and I appreciate you,

519
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,820
you asking that question. Um, so the
first on the, on the question of the Cei,

520
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,310
um, there is a requirement
in the, that companies have,

521
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,210
don't have exclusions that companies
have inclusive health insurance. Now,

522
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:47,000
that doesn't always
mean that every single,

523
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:52,001
unfortunately health insurance plan is
going to cover the full range of services

524
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,070
and procedures that
transgender people need.

525
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,820
And that's an ongoing conversation
that we continue to work with insurance

526
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:03,821
providers on ensuring that their standards
are truly inclusive of the medical

527
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,780
needs of the transgender community.
Um,

528
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,340
but the CEI does require trans
inclusive health benefits.

529
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:15,290
And actually we've seen in
the several years since the,

530
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,150
that aspect has been included in the
CEI and because of so many people within

531
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:23,750
companies articulating and
advocating for change. Um,

532
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,870
but we've seen that the percentage of
major companies that are scored by the Cei

533
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,450
that have trans inclusive health insurance
or don't have exclusions at the very

534
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:37,130
least has gone from single
digits, percentage wise to
60 something percent. Um,

535
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,990
so, so on that front, um,
the Cei, uh, I think has,

536
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,360
is,

537
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,490
is always evolving and always constantly
looking at what are best practices and

538
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:51,130
best practices, rightfully, are always
evolving and changing and improving. Uh,

539
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,670
but on the specific question of health
insurance we do, we do require that, um,

540
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,440
uh, or one of the major elements of
scoring is that there aren't exclusions,

541
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,220
um, more broadly. So I'll, you know,

542
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:08,060
I'll be up front about this history for
folks that don't have quite the same

543
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:10,040
context.
In 2007,

544
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:13,370
the human rights campaign continued to
support the employment non discrimination

545
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:18,110
act even after gender identity was
stripped out by Democrats in the House of

546
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,520
Representatives. And that was a decision
that was wrong. Plain and simple.

547
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,160
I don't think there's anyone at the
organization that would make that same

548
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:27,530
decision twice.
The organization's new leadership,

549
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:31,760
Chad Griffin has apologized for that.
We have a principal that will,

550
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,541
that is unbreakable,

551
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:36,080
that we will never support legislation
that is not inclusive of gender identity.

552
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,690
Um,
and um,

553
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,490
and one of the things that
I truly appreciate about my
colleagues at HRC is they

554
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:48,491
understand that that was a decision that
left real scars for a lot of people.

555
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:55,510
And that changes in perceptions and that
people healing from that pain and that

556
00:34:57,231 --> 00:35:01,310
wound doesn't,
that healing doesn't happen overnight.

557
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:02,240
That it takes time.

558
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,150
And one of the things that I
really value about my colleagues,

559
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:08,870
both trans and CIS, CIS gender is a
term for people who aren't transgender,

560
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,260
is that they understand that even though
there is a ton of great work happening

561
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,490
at the Human Rights Campaign
Today on Trans issues,

562
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,880
that it's going to require that sustained
investment before people are willing

563
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,290
to, to forgive. And frankly they'll,
they'll, they'll never forget, um,

564
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,720
that those scars are
deep and they're lasting.

565
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,750
What are some of the things and some
of the work that I see right now in the

566
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:34,400
human rights campaign on Trans Issues,

567
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,130
first I wouldn't go to an organization
that I wasn't totally positive,

568
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:40,320
was 150% behind,

569
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:44,820
passionate about and centering trans
equality work in their work. Um,

570
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:48,010
before I was on staff at HRC I
talked about the gender identity non

571
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,290
discrimination bill in Delaware,

572
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:53,490
and I can tell you without any question
in my mind is the person who helped lead

573
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:56,670
that effort and Delaware that we would
have not passed that bill without HRC.

574
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,020
HRC came in with resources. They came in
with staff, they came in with expertise,

575
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:01,890
they came in with skill,

576
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:05,610
they came in with mobilization efforts
that truly allowed us to pass both

577
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:09,060
marriage equality and gender identity
protections within a month of each other,

578
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:13,440
which is historic. And, and I saw
that passion. I saw that skill.

579
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:18,240
I saw that commitment from the
staff, from Chad Griffin on down. Uh,

580
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:22,350
and I, I have seen firsthand and been
the beneficiary firsthand of that work.

581
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,420
Um,
the organization is always,

582
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,880
every organization is always
on a path for growth, right?

583
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:33,360
No organization is perfect.
There's always more that can be done.

584
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,850
But in terms of the Progress I've
seen over the last several years,

585
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:44,910
trans work is probably 60 to 70%
of our work at this point. Um,

586
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,640
trans work is not just as
the center of the movement,

587
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:51,720
but it's at the center of the work
that we do every day. Um, you know,

588
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:55,620
we put on precedent on an
unprecedented amount of staff,

589
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,770
volunteers,
uh,

590
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,680
and money into the state of North Carolina
to specifically defeat Pat McCrory

591
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,720
after HB two.
Uh,

592
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,500
because we understood that defeating
Pat McCrory would send an a really

593
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:10,470
important message to Andrea quality
politicians that if you come for us,

594
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,580
we're going to come for you,

595
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:15,390
not just the Trans Committee but the
Lgbtq community and our allies will come

596
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:17,490
for you on election day.
Um,

597
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,350
I see the amazing trans work that's
happening in our foundation programs,

598
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,590
which is working to ensure that our
schools are inclusive of trans and gender

599
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:30,480
nonconforming nonbinary and
gender expansive students.

600
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,290
Making sure that our hospitals
are becoming a bit more safer.

601
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:38,070
As someone who's been a caregiver and a
patient in a hospital, as a trans person,

602
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:40,830
I know just how important that is and
how much work there remains to be done.

603
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:46,190
So we have a team that's
working specifically on
expanding hospital a safety and

604
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:50,210
access and a lot of their
work is trans focused. Um,

605
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:54,360
at the state level. For instance,
there was a battle in Pennsylvania.

606
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,110
We removed our support for a bill,
a nondiscrimination bill,

607
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,660
not that that still
included gender identity,

608
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:03,510
but they stripped out
public accommodations and
we knew that stripping out

609
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:06,980
public accommodations
would disproportionately
harm the Trans con change

610
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,380
transgender community. And so we said
we can no longer support this bill.

611
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:15,360
And the bill died in part because of us
and other organizations saying this is a

612
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,320
first principle.

613
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,970
Any legislation that disproportionately
does not protect the trans community is

614
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:25,140
legislation. We can't support. Um,
we're hiring more trans staffers.

615
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:27,030
I think the diversity on our staff,

616
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,700
both in terms of gender
identity and trans identities,

617
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:34,200
but also in terms of race and religion,
immigration status,

618
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:38,540
all of these different identities
that make up a diverse workforce, uh,

619
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,290
that were consistent consistently trying
to make sure that we're hiring more

620
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,480
diverse staff, more trans and
gender nonconforming people,

621
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:47,950
not just in entry level positions,
but also in senior leadership positions,

622
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,180
public positions and communications and
the foundation and our legal team. Um,

623
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,650
so I've seen a lot of progress.

624
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,340
I'm really passionate about the work that
we're doing and the fact that I didn't

625
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:00,820
join an organization because
I wanted to come in and, and,

626
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,100
and try to make it start doing trans work.

627
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:06,730
I came into this organization because
I saw firsthand just how much they were

628
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:10,450
doing and just how skillfully they
were doing it. Thank you. Thank you.

629
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:18,010
First of all, thank you so, so much. I
have had a cough for like four weeks,

630
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:18,844
so I apologize.

631
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,870
Uh, so my question is, I like, no,

632
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:27,820
and I know of a lot of people whose
opinions on Trans people are like pretty

633
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:31,180
uninformed by actual interactions with
or hearing the stories of trans people

634
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,040
that are often,
you know,

635
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:37,690
very sort of biological essential
list or very rooted in sort of data,

636
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:42,510
gender theory. Um, and I was
wondering how you interact with, uh,

637
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,151
people like that.

638
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:46,750
People who may not even think that
they know any trans people without like

639
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:50,380
taking the whole burden on yourself to
try to humanize yourself or make this

640
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:54,640
about like to try to like convince them
that trans people are real and people,

641
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,080
so that's a great question. Um, I,

642
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,810
I think in terms of how do I deal with it,

643
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,840
I feel a particular responsibility to
deal with that and I feel a particular

644
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:10,770
responsibility and the fact that
I, I, this is my job to, um,

645
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,170
uh,
to be willing to,

646
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,500
to bear a bit more of that burden
of humanizing and educating.

647
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,540
I think there are a couple things.
One,

648
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,860
there are certain things that I am from
about that I'm not going to talk about,

649
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,670
right. My personal medical history,
it's just that it's personal. Um,

650
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,230
and I am
pretty clear,

651
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:33,120
particularly for a reporter
asks me about that,

652
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:36,390
that like I politely push back
and just say, you know, I'm sorry,

653
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:39,960
I'm not comfortable talking about that.
Certainly not all on the record. Um,

654
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,330
you know,

655
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:45,690
there are some people who aren't going
to change their mind either ever or in

656
00:40:45,691 --> 00:40:49,350
one sitting.
And I think understanding that and,

657
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,070
and sort of freeing myself from that
responsibility of feeling like if I don't

658
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:56,430
change everyone from, you
know, a to z in one sitting,

659
00:40:56,431 --> 00:41:00,000
then I've failed or I'm
not doing a good job. Um,

660
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,350
I think that's been been freeing
in many ways. My approach is this.

661
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,980
I know that there are, there's a lot of
ignorance out there. I know I want my,

662
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:14,450
I want allies to educate themselves,
but I understand that like,

663
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,710
it's also difficult to not
know what you don't know.

664
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,960
And so people are going to make mistakes.

665
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:23,010
People are going to come in
with knowledge gaps that exist.

666
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,330
If you're coming to me
with a genuine interest,

667
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,920
a genuine desire to understand
if there's a willingness to grow,

668
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:34,400
if there's a willingness
to not get defensive,

669
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:37,610
if you make a mistake and
I politely correct you,

670
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,500
then I'll sit and I will engage.
If there's no willingness,

671
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,960
then they can come back to me when
they may be grow the heart that they're

672
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:51,170
lacking in that moment. Um, so I think,

673
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:56,540
and I think for the most part,
most people are in that, um,

674
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,550
in that,
in that former category,

675
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,600
I think most people are
compassionate people.

676
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,520
Most people are empathetic people that
when confronted with a human being in

677
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:09,620
front of them,
when confronted with a story,

678
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,170
their hearts will be opened. Their
mind, their minds will be changing,

679
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,160
their hearts will be open at least
a little bit. And you know I,

680
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,000
and so I think that, wow, I'm not,

681
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,120
don't need to spend my
time with someone who's,

682
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,980
who's doing this just to troll or just a
hurt that the vast majority of people I

683
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,200
can engage with because they are,

684
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,050
they're coming to me with a genuine
willingness to have their empathy tapped.

685
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,350
And, and I think that at the
end of the day, if we do that,

686
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,510
if we allow ourselves to do that,

687
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:45,860
and if we allow people to make mistakes
but offer people the willingness to grow

688
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,070
and the opportunity to grow that,
that will make progress.

689
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,690
Hi. Hello. I'm, I'm also
from Wilmington, Delaware,

690
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:56,510
and I'm also a trans woman and we have
like family connections actually people

691
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,020
that I grew up with it no, your
family. Yeah. Can I ask you? Yeah.

692
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:05,670
So your brother is best friends with my
cousin Philip Lahm Plo. Yeah. Oh my God.

693
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,590
Yeah. Delaware is truly so
every time not tell her,

694
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,490
you're like, oh my God. Do you remember
chocolate pit? Maybe they're dated,

695
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,320
made it or relate. Exactly. Exactly.

696
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,090
So I was in a trans activism here.
I'm a founder of Gender Justice League.

697
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:25,140
I'm for Washington state. I Love Gender
Justice League. You, we love you.

698
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,620
And I was part of the effort,
uh,

699
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,480
in front of the Senate to get the bathroom
bill shut down a couple of years ago.

700
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,370
And I have since stopped doing activism
because it's exhausting and draining and

701
00:43:35,371 --> 00:43:36,960
it,
it will eat your life.

702
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:41,990
And My masochism has led me to the dregs
of the Internet and to get my anger

703
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:43,970
out.
And so I was,

704
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:49,070
I see a lot of direct misinformation
campaigns like intentional structured

705
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,860
toxification of communities.
I see things like Prager u and you know,

706
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,980
Jordan Peterson and these people that
come out with this sort of low level soft

707
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:00,930
sell this information for the hard right.

708
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,970
And I wonder how aware slash concerned
are people or places like the HRC,

709
00:44:05,971 --> 00:44:09,360
which I know you guys have legislation
as sort of your main deal. And,

710
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,060
okay.

711
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,190
When it comes to social
communities on the Internet,

712
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,280
like Reddit or youtube comments sections,

713
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,960
where do you guys feel like
the responsibility lies
to make sure that these

714
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:22,690
platforms aren't used specifically?
Um,

715
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,490
to spread this disinformation
and to sort of weaponize

716
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,190
awful? Yeah. Um,

717
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,730
so to the first question of sort
of how aware and concerned are,

718
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:39,120
we are very aware and actively
engaged on the issue. Um,

719
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,530
one of the things that, that we
have tried to do is, uh, you know,

720
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:45,630
there are a handful of,
um,

721
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,620
while the vast majority of the medical
community and scientific community affirm

722
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:52,980
the reality and of transgender people
on the need to have access to affirming

723
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,100
healthcare and affirm
transgender gender identities,

724
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,720
the validity of transgender identities.
There are a handful.

725
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,120
There's always plenty of like
home waiting in the background.

726
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:04,920
Paul McHugh is a great example. Um,
we have done a lot to try to engage,

727
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,880
um, educate the media, uh,

728
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,410
to get statements of opposition from
their research institutions if they're

729
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,460
affiliated with research institutions,

730
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:19,770
articulating that these positions are
not the positions of this institution,

731
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:21,240
that this institution,
you know,

732
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:25,170
Johns Hopkins is a great example with
Makiah was a hospital too that my husband

733
00:45:25,171 --> 00:45:26,340
went to as a cancer patient.

734
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,890
And every single time we got a new
doctor or a nurse, we would wonder,

735
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,130
is this person familiar with Paul Mchugh?
Are they an Acolyte of Paul Mchugh?

736
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:36,720
And will that change the way they interact
with Andy and me because of that. Um,

737
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,160
and so we've actually spent the last
two years trying to engage with Johns

738
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,030
Hopkins to get them to make
a clear affirmative statement
that Paul McHugh does

739
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:48,600
not represent the positions of the
hospital and the institution. Um,

740
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,550
because those are important statements
to be able to combat the misinformation

741
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:56,940
that Paul Mchugh, who's not a
gender or sexuality specialist,

742
00:45:56,941 --> 00:46:01,941
but who has these personal biases that
he writes about a nonscientific journals.

743
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:03,210
But with a doctor in front of his name.

744
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:06,150
That makes it seem like he has
credibility on the issue. Um,

745
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,630
to make sure that we get these statements
that we can have them ready in courts

746
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:12,660
if he's ever testify and legislatures,
if he's ever testifying.

747
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,900
And to again educate the, the, the,

748
00:46:14,901 --> 00:46:18,480
the media about why this person
is not a credible person to be,

749
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,680
to be interviewing on trans identities.
Um,

750
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,480
so we're very aware of that. There's
ongoing efforts depending, uh, Bailey,

751
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,150
I think Jay, Michael Bailey.
Yeah. There, there's a whole host,

752
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,140
there's a wonderful person named Brent
Hannah Hill who does a lot of writing on

753
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:35,011
Brynne's great.

754
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:38,190
And we work actively with Bren tracking
these folks and making sure that we're

755
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:42,660
going in and engaging with
their institutions. Um, the,

756
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:45,900
the second question of
like the responsibility of
platforms to make sure that

757
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:50,490
social media and the Internet is a
force for good as opposed to, um,

758
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,690
you know, a force that Aleks, the 45th
president of the United States, um,

759
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,710
is I think one of the most
significant questions before us.

760
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,840
How do we,

761
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,440
how do we leverage changing and advancing
technologies for good and not for ill?

762
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:15,290
How do we address the reality also that
in this individualized media society,

763
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,310
half of the country is truly
not even hearing the other half.

764
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,130
How do we bridge that divide,
whether it's in cable news,

765
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,670
whether it's an f on Facebook,
whether it's on social media,

766
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:30,880
where people are going into these echo
chambers and if you're going into an echo

767
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:35,050
chamber of hate it emboldens or heat.
Um,

768
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,760
I don't have a good answer, right?
That's honestly above my pay grade.

769
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:42,220
In terms of like what sort of,

770
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:46,690
what are the mechanisms that
these individual platforms should,

771
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,290
uh, utilize or what steps
should they take to address it?

772
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:54,760
I do think they have a moral,
a moral obligation,

773
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:59,761
a business obligation and a practical
obligation to make sure that they are

774
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:04,060
truly rooting out hate
speech when it occurs at,

775
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,370
in violent speech when it
occurs on their platforms.

776
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:09,880
If they have these policies they
need to actually abide by them. Um,

777
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,180
I think they need to make sure that,
um,

778
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,620
that if they don't have those policies
that are adopting those policies for one,

779
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,050
I think one of the exciting things
that we're seeing right now is that the

780
00:48:23,051 --> 00:48:26,380
generation just behind me,
I'm a millennial generation,

781
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:30,850
that's sort of our digital natives are, I
think, I don't, I think they're doing it.

782
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,200
I don't think they know
how they're doing it,

783
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,750
but I think they're already doing it
where they're bridging that divide that

784
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:39,370
exists across media and,
um,

785
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,110
they're utilizing social
media for good. Um, and,

786
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:48,130
and I think that's going to be the
generation that truly figures out how we

787
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,380
solve what feels almost like an
unsolvable problem at this point. Um,

788
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,710
I know the obligations exist, but I
don't have answers for them. Um, and,

789
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:01,740
and I would certainly charge anyone
who's working in tech to actively grapple

790
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:06,040
with these questions to actively grapple
with the policies you have and the

791
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,710
practices that are occurring.
Um,

792
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:13,660
because I truly think it's probably
the biggest question we face.

793
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:18,280
Both. They use both the echoing of hate
on social media that emboldens hate.

794
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,660
And also this divide that no longer
allows us to operate from the,

795
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,950
from from the same fact patterns and
the same conversations and keep us from

796
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:30,760
talking with one another. So it's a great
question. I don't have a good answer. No,

797
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:33,600
that's fine. I'm passionate about it
and I think we need to address it. Okay,

798
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,300
great. Great. Thank you so
much, Sarah, for coming today,

799
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,710
sharing your story.
