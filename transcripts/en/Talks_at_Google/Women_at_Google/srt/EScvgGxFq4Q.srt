00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,340
In case you guys don't know me, I'm James
McKay. I work for is the Gat I'm here,

I'm the executive video
producer, uh, for all this,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,250
the gap videos that we do
around the country on Youtube.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,090
So I was super excited because I
work with youtube all the time to be

5
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:16,630

a youtube sensation with over 670,000

7
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:26,680

and a new cookbook that just came out,

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,570
which is what she's here
to talk about today.

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,930
So I'm going to give the floor to her
for a little bit so she can tell you the

10
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,720
background and how she got started
and about her book a little bit.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,200
Then I'll chat with her and ask a few
questions and then of course we're excited

12
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:40,300
to have everyone in the
audience as questions today.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,110
I think I see a few trays actually
probably from the truck pit that have her

14
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,300
food in it.
So do you want to get started?

You know,

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
my special day or few years ago,
2011 I came here.

18
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:02,780
He could act to you and
at Google or this office,

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,560

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,580
he called the pupping sue and
this is for 200 employees.

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,290
I made this with other my youtube
creators. There was a big heap. So,

22
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,510
and then, now four years
later, 2011 this year,

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,420
2015 I came here with my Cooper.

24
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,540
Okay, Dan. Hey Youtube.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,380
Youtube. When Google,
this is saving my life.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,840
And your 2007 I,
first time I posted my video on Youtube,

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,180
I'm teaching Korean
cooking through my video.

28
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,610
And then at the time I
never knew that this school,

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,820
this kind of a success will be coming.

30
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,210
But now you could actually like 2011
I came 2015 with my own cookbook.

31
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,380
This book is made with
a publishing company,

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,310
hope to Mifflin and
that's the best editor.

33
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,140
My call rider all vote people. I
can not imagine. I couldn't imagine.

34
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,630
So this is a book is a soldier
or around Waldo bookshare.

35
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,500
So this is my real success.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,410
Without to Google and Youtube Company,

37
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,540
I could make it plus my reader,
my audience or who trusted my recipes.

38
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,170
So they love, love, love my
recipe all around the world.

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,860
They learn Korean cooking
from my website and my video.

40
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,090
That's why I'm here.
And also on other things.

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm very honored to sit here today.

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,690
Is that you guys a taste of my food?

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,880
You are Google chef. I Made Google
Chapeau Cook my recipes from Cooper.

44
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,350
All my God,
this is very success successful.

45
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,710
So when I started my video for the first
time in 2007 I was working as a family

46
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,650
counselor in Toronto,
Canada. My mom said, mom,

47
00:02:57,651 --> 00:03:00,910
I'm BGD today's and I'm doing some
youtube, a video of my mum said,

48
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,210
what about your job? My mom
is kind of bleeding, you know,

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,820
reluctant to encourage me.

50
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,100
But now I was the mice 40 about

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,810
And then my mom is a
living in La Korea town.

55
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,300
She just said that she doesn't
understand the English,

56
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,650

They translate basically. Oh

60
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,660
This is the New York Times and New York
Times reporter said Blah, blah, blah.

61
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,790
And then now my mom is so
proud of me. She said, Oh,

62
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,050

63
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,860
So she's a so proud of me. These days
things are changing. They're like this.

64
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,830
So,

and today I tasted that the
recipes from my cookbook,

This is a awesome,

75
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,200
and you know how much I'm
honored to be here. You know,

76
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:55,000
think about this four years ago,
not many people trusted my recipe and,

77
00:04:55,001 --> 00:05:00,001
but I'm here that with as a cookbook
author and the mainstream and in the

78
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:00,850
mainstream,
you know,

79
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:04,900
people acknowledge my ability
and then I'm just sitting here.

80
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,220
Okay. I just to talk about my, the story,

81
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,500
you know what I did in
Korea? I was born, raised,

82
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,530
lived in Korea and also I cooked
for my family for years and years.

83
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm, I'm I just the typical Korean
housewife who loves cooking.

84
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,290
And when I was young, ever
since I was young, I was very,

85
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:31,030
very interested in delicious of food.
You guys, uh, interest in delicious food.

86
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,270
I met the, some guys, uh, I met in
New York a few years ago. He said,

87
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,870
I don't like a food. So kind of rare,
you know, so I don't like a food,

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,830
but you know, I just thought,
okay, you shouldn't be hungry.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,360
Maybe you love it. Anyway. Uh,

90
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,920
when I was in Korea,
I never went to any culinary school.

91
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,010
I never learned actually
recipe for a mini Cooper.

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,820
All the recipe side, just a
naturally cooking home, cooking.

93
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,200
And from my mom,

94
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,150
my grandmother's two grandmothers are
two sides of both sides of my aunts and

95
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:10,280
relatives,
even marketplace.

96
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,900
And then when I taste something good
and then I gotta learn how to make it,

97
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,870
that's the difference.
A lot of my friends that they love,

98
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,850
they love that it's delicious,
the food,

99
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,780
but they don't want to learn
how to make it. But in my case,

100
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,980
I want to learn my eyes. I just
own Valio who, how can I make it?

101
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,690
And then if I tasted it really
tasty, I come home, try to recreate,

102
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,780
and then luckily I can taste some food.

103
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,250
And then I know the how it's
made. Hmm. What's inside?

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,960
I can figure it out easily.
So when ever since I was young,

105
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,070
like my old families,
my mom's side, the ends.

106
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,510
And then when I tasted like a,

107
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,350
who is the best version of each dish,

108
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,670
I can just acquire TDT coming.
And then for example,

109
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,390
there is a Korean, some kind of
soup every day, every [inaudible],

110
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,460
everybody loves this kind of subsoil even
sprout. So, you know, 30 sounds good,

111
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,320
very healthy in a soybean Sprouse who,
but uh,

112
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,510
my uh, id to the, my, uh, I
visited my aunt house, my aunt,

113
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:21,320
my mom's younger sisters
house, two hours, you know,

114
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,870
the distance from where I used to live.

115
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,360
And then my aunt gave me this suit,

116
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,990
Korean soybeans [inaudible] different,

117
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,050
I taste it and she added try
the anchovies and to make,

118
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,500
they're like really Umami, full taste,
you know, Sabre, they make it savory.

119
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,890
And also she added some hot pepper
flakes there and some onion chopped onion

120
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,700
plus and ships cooked that ground,

121
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,550
the toasted toasted sesame seeds on top.

122
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,020
And then I was going to eat,
you know, my, uh, my meal, my,

123
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,010
my Auntie said a week.
And with this, right?

124
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,590
You needed this, the radish, Kimchi.
So ready. She GMT coming ready.

125
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:10,430
She Kimchi wasn't, I read a
fermented, so cases painting, cringe,

126
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:13,250
crunchy.
So I added my,

127
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,110
my aunt asked me how to eat
this. Oh my God. Unbelievable.

128
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,370
This is a soul. So tasty, much
better than my mom's version.

129
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,610
So ever since that I just
there my call number coke,

130
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:29,080
soya bean sprouts soup is that,
that's my recipe. But I'm,

131
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,940
I may change my mind maybe tomorrow
if I tasted someone else's, you know,

132
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,070
soybean spousal better than
this recipe I got alone.

133
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,780
And then I gotta share this recipe
with my readers, my audience.

134
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,200
And these recipes are
all posted on my website.

135
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,160
So my old readers, they love, love my,

136
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,120
some kind of an authentic way.
My recipes, they love, you know,

137
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,730
they just tested my recipe
and they trusted my recipe.

138
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,490
So I told you I never studied
it at any [inaudible] school.

139
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,410
I actually, I am, I'm, uh, I have
a master degree in education.

140
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,210
I studied the philosophy of education
and I used to teach at a university where

141
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:15,660
I studied.
And also when I was in Korea,

142
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:20,661
I used to be English teacher later
and translator interpreter and uh,

143
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,890
later,
uh,

144
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,100
I had the chance in from 1992 to
[inaudible] 95 and for three years I uh,

145
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:35,850
with my family, we went to,
uh, we came to Missouri,

146
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:39,570
Columbia, you know, the Columbia,
Missouri, small, small city.

147
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,710
I met Columbia,
Missouri.

148
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
Anybody was a Kansas,

149
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,650
there's a middle meat, uh, like
a miserable America. So I uh,

150
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:57,651
when I was there and I
met a lot of Korean pet,

151
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,950
so Korea, next pet Korean housewives
and then they were mostly,

152
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:06,930
they are students at the Columbia
University and then they, we met that,

153
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:07,710
you know,

154
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,940
almost every weekend we at
the park and Pat Latish.

155
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,420
So this potluck issue,
I have to bring the one dish,

156
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,830
like today you had the Jap chair. I
bring jobs. So usually we do, you know,

157
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:24,750
at the park Korean barbecue and somebody
bring the Kimchi, somebody bring their,

158
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:27,810
you know, some of the side of
the show you a vegetable dish.

159
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,540
And then we make it all nice,
nice,

160
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:35,541
nice paddle party and some dishes that
I never tasted there because I was

161
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:40,910
growing up. Uh, I grew up in the
reader's southern southern park cds,

162
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,540
southern food, even if a small
country but still they are like,

163
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,040
you know, some the area, you
know, so uh, different provinces.

164
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,920
So I came from really south,
you know,

165
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:57,921
the CD and named the Ohsu in a harbor CD
so that when I was in Missouri and some

166
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:04,530
food they like chicken Friday stick
each skin. It's called the [inaudible].

167
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,210
I had never tasted it before,
but somebody came from different region,

168
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,570
from the, where I lived,
she just talked to me.

169
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,650
I had to learn because a so
tasty crunchy like a candy.

170
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,180
So and this kind of
things all my life long,

171
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,220
like a recipes are coming this
region from that region. Even,

172
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:29,010
I just moving around though
until junior high school.

173
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:31,080
I lived in southern party in my city,

174
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,350
but from high school my parents sent me
to soul your bit to be successful you

175
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:37,564
got to go to so,

176
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,930
so from Seoul and then university
graduate school and then you know,

177
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:47,931
so I had the chance to taste all different
division and food and then I collect

178
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,530
my some recipes and like
one by one for myself,

179
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,450
I had never thought about that.
You know,

180
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,620
youtube was someday I will
be a youtube or cook. Yeah.

181
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:03,520
I never expected at the time probably
if I had known that I wouldn't have

182
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,650
learned the more,
more passionately.

183
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,760
So some and then two,
uh,

184
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,410
2002 I immigrate to Canada.
So Canada,

185
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,690
Toronto,
I did all kinds of job.

186
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,590
First I studied with in a cashier,
cashier,

187
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:25,060
my next door I went there to manager
who is manager and the manager came.

188
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,640
So I, I want to work here,
can I work here? So what,

189
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,480
what can you do? He asked me. So I
said I can do computer, you know,

190
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:36,250
so typing.
And he says,

191
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,230
what we need is that person
who can carry heavy stuff,

192
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,600
loading or no odor. So I
said, okay. Anyway, so my,

193
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,500
my resume is a kind of book nine useful,
you know,

194
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,130
because McCray j school,
who cares, immigrant,

195
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,970
even my English is not perfect.
So anyway,

196
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:02,260
I came home and about, he called
me in one week, he said, Oh,

197
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,250
you're gonna become a cashier.
Sure. And then I did a cashier.

198
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,580
I learned a lot.
I mean whatever I did in my life,

199
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,250
I learned that there
are a lot of with them.

200
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,260
One example I learned when I was in a
cash working education is there like a

201
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,370
water, water is a small battle
is tons of tons of a charging,

202
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,590
but large butter don't charge tax.
So I don't know why,

203
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:29,020
I think we make sense a little
bit. Some people, you know,

204
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,690
kind of boarded a pretentious
person, you know, I,

205
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,060
I'm willing to pay for small batter.
Okay,

206
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:36,520
you deserve to pay more for large battery.

207
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,170
Probably family members are waiting
for this. You know, a world, you know,

208
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,750
I don't know. This is just only my
theory. So kind of was more thing.

209
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:47,920
How to make a sandwich or American, you
know, the North American style sandwich.

210
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:52,600
I just all the time learning and I
tried to sell my chicken. Wow. I have,

211
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,520
I'm so ambitious. Right? So the guy
named, I never forget that the manager,

212
00:13:57,521 --> 00:14:02,170
because he, he helped with me.
You know, one day I asked them,

213
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,440
hey frank,
I can make some Korean fried chicken.

214
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:08,140
Everybody knocked down
when they taste my chicken,

215
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,030
so can I bring some my chicken? You can
taste. And they sure I brought here,

216
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,050
I made it all kinds of,
I just work hard and then,

217
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,220
but he couldn't eat any one
piece because there is a peanuts,

218
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,260
he has a peanut allergy and then,
but all my other cashiers, you know,

219
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:30,520
my coworkers, they love it, they
love it. And then they ask me, Oh,

220
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:34,780
can I older, can I order some Korean?
See with Rice roll, Kim Papp, you know,

221
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:39,010
so it's what I used to sell a
few people, you know, later. But,

222
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,090
and when I work with, there's
also, I was working as a, you know,

223
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,040
the movie movie extra and
movie extra in the movie names,

224
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,790
the how to deal have, will have
ever seen the movie. Yes. Um,

225
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,980
I came home and then, you know, memorizing
English is a very difficult for me,

226
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,790
sometimes a bit backward.
I, I, uh, memorize it.

227
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,650
People are asking me who was
in, you know, Oh, I just, uh,

228
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,130
I got a job and today I went
there and then, you know, so, uh,

229
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,480
I did the movie and how to deer,
they ask the me who was in, you know,

230
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,570
who's in there. So I don't
remember, like, you know,

231
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:21,770
the guy named a Galliger Pete,
you know that Pirogue oliger

232
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,400
what happened to you guys? So He's, uh,

233
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,350
he's name is [inaudible].
I always like a,

234
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:34,910
forget his name or people asking me,
his name is a penal Galliger, you know,

235
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,810
also the, the girl name,
I forgot the total. He,

236
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,390
she's a more famous than Peter Valeo.
And then you been truly,

237
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:45,380
how I never forget it. Stay
about a pirogue. Our LIGO isn't,

238
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,150
sounds like a galley, so. Okay Peter
plus a galley and then never forget.

239
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,100
And then, uh, Inco in
Canada. I was working also,

240
00:15:55,101 --> 00:16:00,101
I used to teach English to
Korean immigrants and also
later I got a good job at

241
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,380
nonprofit organization
as a family counselor.

242
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,410
I work there for three years and then
before I came to America and then I become

243
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,230
Canadian citizen. And then, uh,

244
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,230
now just to the 2000 when he's eight,

245
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,580
I came to America to labor
more adventurous life.

246
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,700
And this is my making video and also
making BDO and running my website is my

247
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:26,414
full time job.

248
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,180
So this is a very fascinating story.
People are asking me,

249
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:36,680
where are you from? And then I know
what it means. They see my face,

250
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,690
right? So even though I'm a legally
Canadian, I always say I'm Korean,

251
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,140
but legally Canadian,

252
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,140
but waiting for my green card in America.

253
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,660
So like, uh, um, so this is, uh,

254
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,990
like a, you know, this is my life journey,

255
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:01,991
so I'm always interested in learning
something new and also his pastry food.

256
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,710
Food is a, no matter where I live,
no matter what I did for these,

257
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:10,040
always in my heart,
some delicious food I find,

258
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,010
I gotta learn how to make it.
So this is,

259
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:18,020
this is where I am now.
So I made this a cookbook.

260
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,650
So you guys found my
cookbook. This is, uh, I'm,

261
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,590
let me tell you how I got imbibe.

262
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,040
Imbibe with do with it is
making Coppo my uh, my website,

263
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,410
my website, um, 2000, the two.
Oh, I didn't talk about this.

264
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:40,400
You know how I made a youtube
video? I have a, my son,

265
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,230
my son was a computer at the time,
computer science student.

266
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,160
He asked, could me, ma'am, have you ever
heard about youtube? So yes, I have.

267
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,170
He says, why don't you, why don't
you share your recipes on Youtube?

268
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,880
Probably, you know, you'll be so popular
because of your food is delicious.

269
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,440
And also neighbor, you are content.
We'll never runs out. That's true.

270
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,570
The content or never runs out,
you know,

271
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:11,250
I see the lateral youtube creators like
at the beginning or they did it and then

272
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:14,670
later or there is nothing to show anymore.
Right?

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,630
So cooking is just my lifetime,
like a really passion.

274
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:23,220
So that's why like I was
very interested in his idea,

275
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,330
but I was not sure how, I mean just
the only, I have a small camera,

276
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,720
really cheap camera and we just,

277
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:34,530
the little digital camera
with a video function.

278
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,510
But how can I do, how can I edit,
how can I film, you know, no idea.

279
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,160
But like around,
you know,

280
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:45,480
a few weeks later I decided that
sounds like really fun. So let's do,

281
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,650
and in April,

282
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,570
2007 I posted my first video. Spicy
stuff, right, is queen. I just,

283
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,420
I wanted to surprise my reader,
my audience,

284
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,960
I just brought it from Korean, uh, China,

285
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:05,550
China town or Korean grocery store,
huge frozen squid.

286
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,680
And then in front of the camera I just
cut it in half and then take the guts out.

287
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,880
And then in the meanwhile,
just so I was washing and stuff,

288
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:19,140
right and spicy.
And then my gas detected gas detector,

289
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:23,450
so England wing and then behind the me
background with, I did this, I see this,

290
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,450
I know,
oh my God.

291
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,620
[inaudible] behind me and the Kimchi
I was going to make a Kimchi is salty.

292
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:31,290
The cabbages is just there.
And they even,

293
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:35,870
I didn't think about background
background and the music, even just the,

294
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,420
without any permission,
even I didn't know that's illegal,

295
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,230
like Amaury say music and then put this
merger because at the time that's my

296
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,280
favorite museum. And then I made
it. Okay, sounds good. Looks good.

297
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,200
And then I went to bed next to the day I
walk when, oh, so I was really doubting,

298
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,790
you know,
who is going to watch this?

299
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,350
So how can they find me naturally
next a day. Many people subscribed,

300
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:02,610
subscribe to me and then they
said, oh my God, it looks good.

301
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,050
Someone already made it
this. And he imagined someone
already followed my recipe.

302
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,330
And then they also said all kinds of book,
good encouragement in a nice comments.

303
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:14,250
A plus next to request.

304
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,360
Can you make a Korean bean paste
this to Korean, Kimchi, Korean.

305
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:22,830
Bulgogi so Whoa, this
is so fun. People just,

306
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,150
these guys are real, my friends,
you know. And uh, before doing this,

307
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:31,020
I had another hobby.
It is a kind of a internet like my,

308
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,920
that's why I got my name,
monkey monkey is the hammer in Korean.

309
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,340
It's my idea or Korean names.
Kim Guangzhou, Guangzhou,

310
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,560
nobody pronounced very correctly.

311
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,380
So a Mountie I got his
name because the uh,

312
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,280
the CDO but heroes, the o nine
game, I was like, you know,

313
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:53,281
wielding some hammer and then
this old throw away my stress,

314
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,340
you know,
by playing my game or nine game.

315
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,530
So and then around it even I made some
good friends still we keep in contact.

316
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,790
So people from Montreal and people from,
you know,

317
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,470
La and Singapore, you know,
sometimes we'll use the play a game,

318
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,450
like some task force,
you know,

319
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:18,040
task force and means that you can't to
go to bathroom even for three hours until

320
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,740
you finish it. It's a cable
mission. You can't get out of there.

321
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,620
And then I used to do this,
but the uh,

322
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,490
these are cooking. Bdo is a kind of
a more fun for me because of this.

323
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:34,990
People are real people who cook,
follow my recipe and then okay,

324
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:39,220
I at first I kind of a handful of my hour,
the leftover,

325
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,420
my hour is that for my game,
half is for this.

326
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,430
So I couldn't sleep much.
Sometimes they're like I said all day,

327
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,240
all day play game plus making video.

328
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,700
So anyway,

329
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,530
as soon why later I was
like a chosen as a youtube,

330
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:56,830
a pattern at that time,

331
00:21:56,831 --> 00:22:01,240
all day you become a pattern
and then you can get paid.

332
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,130
But not digitally is everybody. I
think I they are usual pattern. So,

333
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,280
and then they gave me pattern
or some kind of metal.

334
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,260
So mother mother was probably,

335
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:14,770
you guys are heard about this mother
is a right next to my channel.

336
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,580
So really motivated me to
work a hard more and more.

337
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,190
And then,
uh,

338
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:26,191
so ever since that time I keep posting
my video and then a few months later my,

339
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:32,221
I made my website because I really need
a home on the Internet because some of

340
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,630
my, uh, youtube audience, he
said, Oh, I, how can I find it?

341
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:41,250
It's the Korean ingredients. So what
is it, you know, and also like, uh,

342
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,260
what so a lot with things
to talk about in a,

343
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:48,700
like a keeps when you make a specialist,
especially this thing is 20 minutes,

344
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,090
like a sizzling things or why
something like I needed this.

345
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,300
So I really needed to
make them my website.

346
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,290
So I made it this monkey.com and then uh,

347
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,350
ingredient to follow and then kitchenware
follow and where to find Korean

348
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,290
cooking, uh, grocery
stores. Where can you find,

349
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,610
and then my readers a day they submit,
okay,

350
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:16,810
this is my favorite Korean store. And
then they just submitted the information.

351
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,870
So,
and then all this,

352
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,330
my website is a gradually increase,

353
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,610
keep getting bigger and bigger.

354
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,600
And then eventually some
people send me forum monkey.

355
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,860
I made you a chicken,
my chicken and I,

356
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,800
it was a big hit. I went to the patty,
everybody asking me where I learned,

357
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,000
I talk about you and then Oh my
God, that's, you saved my life.

358
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,030
So many touching stories that, you
know, some, someone married the Co, uh,

359
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,870
Korean,
the Korean husband,

360
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,640
the American lady who married a
Korean husband. And then recently,

361
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,590
some they don't get along where kind of
a path of the food to our cultural thing.

362
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,510
So the lady found my recipe,
she made the Korean bean paste,

363
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:09,320
the sue for husband,
husband said, oh my God,

364
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:13,100
this is my mom's food. Where did
you get this? And then you know,

365
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:18,101
the food by not only food by itself but
also like the wife is a working harder

366
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,420
to, you know, to get along well to
get a better relationship. You know,

367
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,090
that's the kind of uh,
uh, make the husband,

368
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,200
they really like feel better
so they get along. So anyway,

369
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,710
now could this kind of a story
is a tones and tones of a story.

370
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,340
Every morning I wake up,

371
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,580
I read the email and the through the
old my social media and all the time,

372
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,970
yeah, I'm encouraged them
then I am empowered. So, uh,

373
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,310
this thing is that,
you know,

374
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:51,311
so my website is getting bigger and
bigger and and sense I just made another

375
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:55,130
section as a Korean food.
The photo you guys would make their,

376
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:58,990
because they sent him email.
This is the noodle soup that I made.

377
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,410
Would you recipe and then they
show me, you know, to send to me,

378
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:07,160
it takes time and effort. You know, they
have to use a four o Chav, you know,

379
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:11,670
so they have to do some something and
then they send me and then I just said,

380
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,470
wow, this one I got to share with more
people. So I made it a Korean food,

381
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,810
the photo section.

382
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,930
So this is for you make my recipe and
then you pray have a story or it does

383
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,500
matter and no story,

384
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,640
just the poster directly
from your computer posted.

385
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:33,530
And now so fattoush and stout
on the photos or my website,

386
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,200
this is my treasure,
this is my treasure.

387
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,550
And then later my readers
that they become friends.

388
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,770
They are these guys like
a Korean Padilla leaves,

389
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:49,430
you guys know about Korean Padilla
leaves is called the Kenyon. So anyway,

390
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,020
so Padilla leaves and I make
a Padilla, labor, Kimchi,

391
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,970
Padilla pickle. And then
somebody said that, you know, oh,

392
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,150
I found it that you know, my uh, my yard,

393
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,670
I thought that this is like weed all
the time. Every year I got rid of this.

394
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,810
[inaudible] these guys are so,

395
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:12,980
so be alive next year again coming alive,
you know,

396
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,250
so they will really get tired of all this
kind of a precious vegetable curry for

397
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:23,480
Koreans. I pay, I pay to the lottery
de la Porte. Really smart packaging,

398
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,050
right in Korean store. But
some people are just, you know,

399
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:32,000
parallel lives at a throwaway and like
we talk about perilla leaves, you know,

400
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,050
and then some people say, oh, I don't
know, I'm the living in middle of nowhere.

401
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,000
I cannot find in a Korean store. How can
I find the Padilla leaves? Oh my God,

402
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:44,400
I like to taste. And then my
reader, another reader, okay,

403
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:48,210
I will send you the packages seat.
So he sent it to her.

404
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,670
So they guide these guys
that became friends.

405
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,680
So I thought that maybe it's a time for
me to make a day meeting place, you know,

406
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,960
sort of my website.
So I made a forum.

407
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,220
So through the forum they talk with
each other and then they share.

408
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,050
They all their know how you know,

409
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,200
so some people are making
Kimchi at the beginning.

410
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:11,640
Seven years ago when she started him,
she asks for them, is she bugging me?

411
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,720
Hey you,
you made a 10 10 pounds of beginner.

412
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:20,430
How about the one pounding him? Chill.
Can you give me a recipe or knee? Small.

413
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:24,630
One pound of Kimchi recipe.
This is unbelievable for me.

414
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,950
It's as a Korean,

415
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,950
we make a Kimchi like a 2010 year
heads of Napa cabbage. I make even,

416
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,170
I never know that. What's the pound?
That was a big deal. You know?

417
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,610
Usually the Korean cabbage is a huge
Chinatown. Cabbages are so small.

418
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:43,480
I don't know where they find that.
This Korean Napa cabbage is a huge,

419
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,690
like I saw some people were asking me,

420
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,340
please cut down the recipe
and give me so one cabby,

421
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:54,860
Napa cabbage here. I don't know from
what to say, you know? Okay. It,

422
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,800
you know, Kevin Sizes
are different. Anyway.

423
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:03,801
One of my readers say he's a she or here
many people they studied the like the

424
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:05,780
only one cabbage,

425
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,650
but now they make a tiny pounds
of Kimchi because Kimchi snotty,

426
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,330
rejected only one side of dish.
With the guilty you can make a soup stew,

427
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,440
pancake and steam that you can add edit
chapter this in the to the dumpling

428
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,370
everywhere you can make all kinds
of dishes you can make here.

429
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,880
So like an like a Korean housewives.

430
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,820
When I lived in misery Columbia,
I had a friend,

431
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,670
you know she's from China and the Miss
Uie and Mr Youi came to my house and then

432
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:39,120
opened my winter refrigerator.
Her eyes are like, Ooh,

433
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,810
this is a kid.
Yes.

434
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,490
[inaudible] she couldn't believe that
this a has a eating laudable Kimchi. Kim,

435
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,040
this is a usual thing for making
cheese or wreck a huge container,

436
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:54,630
this amount of a container and
then, but these days, my readers,

437
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:57,570
my audience, they love GIM
today, make that amount.

438
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,520
Some people are selling him
to Monte am I said, Corey,

439
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,700
you're guilty to Koreans years.

440
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,310
So my Brazilian reader let me know.
She is a selling Kimchi.

441
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,040
At the Korean church to Korean.

442
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,230
So really fascinating stories every day.
I've just always hear that.

443
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,180
Yeah. So this, um, and then
some people are asking me,

444
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,370
hey, Matea even though you just, uh,
give, give us the recipe, I need a book.

445
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,090
I like to give it to somebody
who is not access to computer.

446
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,440
And then I like to give them the real
written recipe. So can you make a book?

447
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,730
But I never thought about like this
kind of old I said, okay, sure.

448
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,970
And then I made the pdf pdf and
didn't have Carla with last,

449
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:48,690
have a Carla and then sold on Amazon also.
First I studied it,

450
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:52,570
I could give away for free. So Steve,
you guys that can get, you know,

451
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,470
a thousand nodes for free, you know,
book one book two W two, three, four,

452
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,270
one, two, three. Even I never thought
about the making we are book at the time,

453
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,570
just the people to ask me, okay,
sure, I will do that. And then, uh,

454
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,910
the book was a download. The millions
of people download it for free.

455
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,800
So actually when I pitch my Bible,
I just, that was a really cool,

456
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,900
so I asked my agent to see,

457
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:21,070
this is evidence of my book is a millions
of people download it even though

458
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,350
that's a free number.

459
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,570
But the book we are book people who want
to get the real book in their hands is

460
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:31,860
that we made it as a pdf file
and then nice to kind of uh, uh,

461
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,780
small sizes are really small,
but full price is so expensive.

462
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,020
But it shouldn't be because
I use the caliphate book.
Should it be colorful? This,

463
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,700
my theory about Cooper,

464
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,170
I might theory about cookbook is that you
should have a laudable California nice

465
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:49,390
photos and step by step photos,
you know,

466
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,470
and saw that I'm a visual person,
you know, youtube, a video,

467
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:57,490
why I making video, right? So, and then I,

468
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,060
but problem is they're expensive.
$30 for discipline.

469
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,570
I don't make much money from this.
I'm imagine, imagine, you know,

470
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,420
because otherwise I need
to make a black and white.

471
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,410
So I don't like the idea of
black and white. The Cooper,
no matter what happened.

472
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,070
So anyway, someday I, I was uh,

473
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:18,670
thinking there may be some day I shouldn't
make a rear Cooper because of real

474
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,480
cookbook.

475
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,480
This a book is a much cheaper and also
prices are cheap plus La [inaudible]

476
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,560
people something like a recipes of
almost the same but like a make you guys

477
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:36,220
understand better.
For example,

478
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:41,210
my uh, my co writer, her
name is Lauren, she's um,

479
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,480
I make a recipe and I send her
and then she make a kind of,

480
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,920
basically I gave her my chore and
then she makes Jewelry. Right.

481
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:55,960
And then she's a okay multi then
you say that that this or you cover,

482
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,680
uh,

483
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,680
the cover or uncover you cook the 50
minutes of where cover or uncover I was a

484
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:06,030
first grader. What does he
mean? Of course cover it inside.

485
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,480
I just thought their cover and then
yes, cover as a swallow, you know,

486
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:15,481
my frustration and then sometimes
[inaudible] it means that sesame oil is a

487
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:17,320
toasty.
You are on toasted,

488
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,160
toasted in Korean cuisine over
your toasted toasted sesame oil.

489
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:28,420
It is always, always a sesame
seeds toasted on toast here.

490
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,070
Always a toasty. Right. And then like a,

491
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,510
and also I was so shocked when she,

492
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,710
when another editor
rolly he's name is later,

493
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:43,711
he joined our team and my book is made
with tones of what people were only,

494
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,410
he's a really tuffle editor. He
asked me all Monte, you made the,

495
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,390
you made a decider. Uh, the beef
Jerky, you know, people Jerky,

496
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,860
you guys are, she didn't follow
you. If you get the today,

497
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,610
you both make a few eating a beef people,
you're keep making this is,

498
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,410
everybody loves that.
My beef jerky people get,

499
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,270
he asked me how many pieces there,

500
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,760
I mean I don't remember.

501
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,880
And also he said this
is a how many servings?

502
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,320
It depends on how much you like that.
Right? I mean if we were just like, uh,

503
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,930
three pounds of beef brisket, I made it
this. And then you know, some people,

504
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:28,840
five of people it just to in one
time or just a one person like, okay,

505
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,820
I see, but it's a for one year
and then you can either, I mean,

506
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,290
so make them so frustrating. But you
know, I was always a lack of swallow.

507
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,053
Yeah.
Right.

508
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:43,210
My cookbook buyer later coupled by are
those guys who will have a same question,

509
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:48,110
may have the same question. So that's
right. I shouldn't feel frustrated.

510
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,940
I sure do appreciate this.

511
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,360
And then actually eventually I had to
make my people jerky again if exactly the

512
00:33:55,971 --> 00:34:00,560
follow my recipe, cut it
then okay, this resume,

513
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,420
this is Raleigh.

514
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,210
And then this is my 30 [inaudible] or
something or like a pieces and then the

515
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,571
exactly.

516
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:13,380
And then I just made the three d
divided and then one portion for Roy,

517
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,340
the one portion for my cookbook writer,

518
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,790
core rider for one third is a for myself.

519
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,080
And then I divided it right the knee.
And then I sent them,

520
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,570
I sent them an Ambula Roy,
next day he got here.

521
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,920
Holy Delicious.
Oh my God.

522
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,950
Has He emailed me and my other,
you know, cove right. Also.

523
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,680
So this is when I make this a cookbook.
I have a lot of,

524
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:46,580
a lot of funny stories and you
know, stay, I don't remember or,

525
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,940
and then sometimes I should write
down. Otherwise, you know, I get older,

526
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:54,560
I always forget some, uh,
this is like a long journey.

527
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,910
But, uh, around the full
four or five years ago, uh,

528
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:02,540
eventually I met Bestival best agent.

529
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:07,340
So this agent made,
made it possible to make my cookbook.

530
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,720
She found the, so all
the, you know, uh, best,

531
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,810
the publishing company and also
call rider and also, you know,

532
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:18,470
the food, uh, food for designer and all.

533
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:23,240
Everybody's so kind of a set.
So I'm so lucky. I'm so lucky.

534
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:28,241
First why I'm lucky I've got involved
with the youtube and Google guys so you

535
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:32,750
could already sense to pay me money.
So I'm, this is my full time job.

536
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,590
And then also my readers, my
reader audience, they, me,

537
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:38,960
they love me,
right?

538
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,140
And I'm lucky n now I'm just invited this,

539
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,370
they may, they may the you a chap made
it there. My recipe. How fascinating.

540
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,040
Disease. You know, the stories
I can keep going in on you. So,

541
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:57,060
but I think that there's enough
that you guys ask me questions.

542
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,180
Question. I mean, do
you think it's, it was,

543
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,700
became so popular so quickly because
there's a lack of knowledge or a lack of

544
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:05,850
authority about Korean cooking in
America and you're filling that void?

545
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,890
I think the first,
the food is delicious.

546
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,390
Food is delicious. Amanda, like a,

547
00:36:14,391 --> 00:36:19,070
I didn't know about even I
used to go back, pack travel.
I have a lot of hobbies,

548
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:23,810
you know, so, but I traveled
to many countries, different
countries, but always,

549
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:28,050
I believe they're like a foodie.
You know, you've got Korea,

550
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,340
especially Korean travelers,
you traveling on other country,

551
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,780
you got to taste the other cultural
food, a tool. And if they say, oh,

552
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,800
we dial two Korean Kimchi,
I can, I survive. And then
I kind of criticize them.

553
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,720
Oh my God, come on just a two day, three
days. You know, I was thinking like that,

554
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,490
but,
but you know,

555
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,170
later maybe there's those guys or say
the same thing they said, you know,

556
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:56,090
my uh, Netherlands, you know, is
um, the guy named Dick Urania,

557
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,520
he makes all kinds of Korean dishes.

558
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,990
He's a cooking is a better than
Korean housewives cookie. She,

559
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:07,020
he's sending me forum and he said he
traveling crease and then for one week he

560
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:10,730
said, oh my God, I miss my GMT.

561
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,520
So I think they are kind of audit
addictive, you know. So kimchis uh,

562
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,170
and also Korean food is all vegetables,
like all kinds of vegetables,

563
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,990
a mountain, vegetables and Tofu, you know,

564
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:27,530
some the way of a cooking not crazy
and some way like a people really,

565
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,330
it must be appealing to people.
So please d and second,

566
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:37,310
I think. So Korean food, as you know, the
Korean barbecue people think about that.

567
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,020
You make a Korean barbecue at home.
You can share with tons of people.

568
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:47,060
Recently I blog about this and
one of my readers, he married,

569
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,310
he's in Ma, he's a on the wedding day
reception, he made Korean pork belly,

570
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,140
[inaudible] belly. He followed my
recipe or the poker belly and you know,

571
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:00,530
the of the plate and also
the Bono guessable no,

572
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,500
just only $20 in Korea,
Korean grocery store.

573
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,740
And he prepared each table,

574
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,940
people receiving 10 people proceeding
and then he put this in a greedy plate.

575
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,900
Everything,
let them cool them Airbus.

576
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,980
And then pork belly and the leathers.
Samsung,

577
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:22,280
you had the Samsung today dipping sauce
and then everybody just the wrap this

578
00:38:22,281 --> 00:38:26,450
and then they, they was so, so
happy and then do this. Let me know.

579
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:31,280
So I was a very uh, impressed us.
So I just blog about his story.

580
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,750
So this is like a Korean food is that
you can share with many, many people.

581
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:39,910
Is this supposed to be shared? You know,
so I think maybe that's the reason.

582
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:42,940
Where did you learn this recipe?
Oh, this mountain.com. You know,

583
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:47,320
that's why I think people come to my
website and it was also Korean fried

584
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:51,430
chicken. Everybody loves Korean
Fried Chicken because, because why?

585
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,690
Mm, that's delicious.
How double fry. Yeah,

586
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,540
he, that he was acting in. My editor
gave me a hard time when I do this.

587
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,740
Oh this is so delicious a soup.

588
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,900
And she asked me how
delicious you should explain.

589
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,160
Americans don't know how delicious it is.
Ah,

590
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,810
squeeze squid.
Okay.

591
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,930
It's like a truly irresistible
is the one not enough.

592
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:23,510
We say something
Korean Fried Chicken and I is,

593
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:28,511
I know really we always make the coating
is a coating is the maiden reading in a

594
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:30,724
statue,

595
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,390
like a starch potato starch I use and
then making really crunchy and a little

596
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:39,220
sticky.
So because there's some juicy sauce,

597
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,450
I mixed the in the last minute and they
make you kind of a little sticky and

598
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:48,160
Lucas oil tastes like a rice cake or
Gigabit, but very, very crunchy, crunchy,

599
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:52,510
crunchy. So and also it depends
on how much you like spicy food.

600
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,360
You can add the spiciness spicy,

601
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,880
you know the Chili pepper flakes.

602
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:03,100
So I think that that's why in all
crunchy and delicious. Yeah. Yeah.

603
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:03,963
That's why

604
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,220
I recently read an article saying that
Americanize Korean cooking is too spicy

605
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,060
and actual Korean cooking is not as
spicy as we like it. Is that true?

606
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:17,050
No, we're good. Yeah. I see the
old tons of, we are the, you know,

607
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:21,200
some theories from where he coming.
You see the Koreans.

608
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,120
When I go to Korea, like
the, I sometimes visit Korea,

609
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,460
Koreans or loves spicy food and it was
all we Koreans believe with spicy food is

610
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,530
a make your body really,

611
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:37,330
you know there is some researchers or
research spicy food they make you always

612
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:42,030
awake and then so it's the Ntis a
Highmark. So you, it's just the,

613
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,430
you are always likely some
make always a smart, you know,

614
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:50,431
so I see food is very good for your health
or the researchers are working harder

615
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,510
but real Koreans are like early
morning TV from early morning TV.

616
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:58,360
I have to see this people,
Koreans love food,

617
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:03,640
all spicy sauce mixed with the spicy
sauce. Eating even, you know, Medica,

618
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:07,120
nobody, I even, I don't feel like
eating spicy food from early morning.

619
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:12,340
I skipped breakfast, I always drink
or your large be huge comes over me,

620
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,490
know black coffee,
that's my breakfast.

621
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:19,150
But maybe there's a surpriser I felt that
you love game til the time, you know?

622
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:23,700
No Way. And I stopped
and then, and then and,

623
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:28,430
and then you know, that's not true. Yeah.
So Korea is a more spicy food. Yeah.

624
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,060
I think it's funny that you mentioned
the New York Times article and they kind

625
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:36,140
of called you the Julia of Korean cooking.
How do you feel about that?

626
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,160
Even that terminology,
Julia Child,

627
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:45,161
these there came from
2007 when I studied them.

628
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,880
Just not long after. I'm already
sorry. You know, my video was sorry.

629
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,330
And then I was living in Canada as Canada,

630
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:58,250
New York Times version cannot Canadian
newspaper on all nationwide. The biggest,

631
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:00,100
the newspaper is the glow.
We May,

632
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:05,000
it's a globe and Mail interview me and
then she asked me, she wrote to them,

633
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,780
uh, Korea, Julia, Julia
Child, right. So I, I even,

634
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:13,730
I didn't know who the Julia Child is.
I embarrassing it. I searched, oh,

635
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:18,080
Julia child, the French cuisine to
you know, America. Uh, but anyway,

636
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,020
ever since that time, many people
call me Korean Julia Child, you know,

637
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,600
but one day, uh, I just,
the Korean newspaper Guy,

638
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,190
a radio guy,

639
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:33,191
Wa I was interviewed after
my article on global may,

640
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:37,820
was on lap as usual,
Korean reporters,

641
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,780
a key bombarded with Amy, can I
interview, can I interview? You know,

642
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:45,320
they don't find the me, but always
everyone, when I'm near times,

643
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,820
they just have kept a calling me when
I'm in youtube and then did some cooking

644
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:54,410
demo. They just come to me. So when
I'm on the main stream newspaper,

645
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,730
they want to interview me.

646
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,380
So there is some that one day there
or Korean interview I asked, I mean,

647
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,740
how do you feel about Julia
Child? I know. So I say, uh,

648
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,790
and also somebody asked the
mayor about that. Martha Stewart.

649
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,120
Oh Ho Ho Youtube,
youtube.

650
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:15,380
We know the subscribers and numbers.
I'm bigger than Martha Stewart.

651
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,150
So they ask the meal about the Martha
Stewart. So I said, Martha Stewart,

652
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:21,230
it doesn't have a youtube.

653
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,940
Well that's why you know that you don't
have to compare me with a Martha Stewart.

654
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,960
Martha Stewart is such a wonderful,
you know, chef in the world. Right.

655
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,050
So just to add,

656
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,570
are you going to have
your own TV show one day?

657
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,460
Um, I would just think about
already some, you know,

658
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,230
TV show people contacted me.
Uh,

659
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,880
but I was very BG doing my Cooper,

660
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,040
so I can't do this at the multi work
murky Casco like this because when I do

661
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:51,620
this, like I have to
focus on this, but my,

662
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:56,360
I don't want to skip my video every 10
day. This is, my readers are waiting,

663
00:43:56,361 --> 00:44:00,560
waiting, waiting, you know, so I
don't want to disappoint my readers,

664
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,500
a youtube audience. So when
I have a more time, uh,

665
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,570
let me think about TV show.
Yeah.

666
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:10,160
Yeah. I think it's a good time to see
if the audience has any questions.

667
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:13,210
Does anyone, here we go? I know

668
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,490
for me I think it's very bitter.

669
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:19,810
It is your personality and it really
makes you a very interesting chef to watch

670
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:23,710
a youtube and even listen to your talk.
Um, can I get the two questions? Um,

671
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,290
one is what is your, not your
favorite non Korean food at second,

672
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,250
who made your logo?

673
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:31,050
Cause I think that's what it also cute
things that you may have on your site

674
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,940
then.
Yeah.

675
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,170
Uh, the logo, um, my
daughter made dot. Yeah.

676
00:44:36,171 --> 00:44:41,100
My daughter is a, she's a
dentist. Yeah. She made it easy.

677
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,800
But I gave her her idea.
I gave up because I cannot,

678
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:50,630
I cannot the role where, but I know when
she was young she can do better way.

679
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,740
So I said, okay, I want to do this
and kind of boy, you know, sign.

680
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,640
They're like dead, you know, some, you
know, some big fish and the big knife.

681
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:01,850
And then I like to do that. And
then she made it this. And also,

682
00:45:01,851 --> 00:45:05,720
what is your first request?
Oh No. Oh, Spaghetti.

683
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,900
Spaghetti meatball. Yeah. I love it. Yeah.

684
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,140
Hi Monkey.
So I'm,

685
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:18,200
I know that sometimes you travel to a
new location and use the local, you know,

686
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:22,090
produce, et Cetera to cook. I saw an
f when you went to Maine. I, yeah,

687
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,000
some bad new England.

688
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,960
Do you have any experience with you can
relate where you found something unusual

689
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:28,880
and tried to use that in good?
In cooking?

690
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,770
Yeah. He must have read
my website, you know,

691
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,590
so like a very deep question.
And whenever like,

692
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:38,460
uh,
uh,

693
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:43,280
before I started my youtube video and
when I traveled in no other country,

694
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,060
for example,
when I went to France,

695
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,610
I love crazy about the front French
cheese seeking to cheese it from Normandy

696
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,440
and yet, and there is, I kept eating and
then I gained weight when I came home.

697
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,770
I didn't mind that, you know,
because of delicious food.

698
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:04,470
But at the time I, even though I
love, love with their, you know,

699
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,940
their cuisine,
uh,

700
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,060
but like around three days after I
thought about something spicy kick,

701
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,640
oh my god, I cannot swallow
very well. I, you know,

702
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,560
I cannot swallow French food
aware of because I like that.

703
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,610
So I needed something spicy
so that I took that, you know,

704
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,810
some Korean hot pepper paste and it
look like some toothpaste, like a,

705
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:28,770
like the smart paste.

706
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,930
And then just in case I might see you
use this guy and then I took it and then

707
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,190
you, okay, time for me to use this.
I went out in a grocery store,

708
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:40,950
you can buy the cucumber everywhere.

709
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,640
I took it and washed it
this and then just one bite.

710
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,460
And then there's the,

711
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,060
I could do some like a pepper
paste up one, you know,

712
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:55,140
one drop and then he's
good. He's good. Now My,

713
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,910
I calm my stomach and I can't swallow
where I'm ready to eat French cuisine

714
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:00,744
again.

715
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:06,530
And then ever since I studied my cooking
video and before in the case I'm more

716
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:11,790
serious to cooking. And also whenever
I travel, like more than one week,

717
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:17,010
I need to make a video. So we did the
roll call, uh, vegetable roll call,

718
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,930
you know, some of the ingredients. So
I have like a, some Cybera ingredients,

719
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,320
like a Corian, a soy sauce,
Korean had pepper paste,

720
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:30,250
the bean paste and the fish sauce,
garlic.

721
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,730
These things you can get
everywhere, right? So this thing,

722
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:38,480
so you cannot find easily plus
Korean rice, Korean rises. Um,

723
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,560
you may,
you may know about Korean rice is a,

724
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:45,620
like we same rice as Sushi rice.
So they did a stickier,

725
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,960
stickier then some Mexican
or long grain rice.

726
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:54,580
Some people are asking me, Oh,
monkey, you know, is that the can,

727
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,570
is it working with a normal
rice nola rising for me?

728
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:02,920
It's a short grain rice Sushi rice
there. All my life, I'm eating this,

729
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,030
but I know what they
mean. So I always, uh,

730
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:11,350
I take them my rice also,
and then I arrived there.

731
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,520
I make a Kimchi and then
I go to their broker,

732
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,890
a Roku or grocery store and the market.

733
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:22,810
And then I find that if I don't find a
napa cabbage, I just find that any green,

734
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,940
any greens,
even spinach,

735
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,420
I bring it and then make just
Kimchi or I just use your cabbage.

736
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,030
Ugo KBG game chores.

737
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,480
I posted the recipe when I
traveled in Mexico at the time.

738
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,250
And then we, the cabbage, half of
cabbage, I made a Kimchi. Oh yeah.

739
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:43,270
It was a delicious, and my, I made
with this too. We did this. Yeah.

740
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:47,710
So all the time I carry
Korean ingredients. Yeah.

741
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:52,690
Is there anything you really just hate
to eat that you just don't like? Uh,

742
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,510
yeah, of course. I like a real person.
Warm first. The first ever food.

743
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,970
I don't like key, like a bug,
you know, I don't need it now.

744
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:04,900
Some people are just asking me,
Oh, can you cook dog though?

745
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,160
And also, um, yeah,

746
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:15,670
pretty much. I love all kinds
of food. Yeah. Oh, one one,

747
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,460
one recipe.
My readers ask me,

748
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,650
chicken feet monkey please. Uh,
make the chicken feet recipe,

749
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:28,780
but for some reason, chicken feet high,
I don't think I can handle, you know,

750
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:33,280
I can handle a live fish. I
can handle live crab, you know,

751
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:36,070
and then also live lobster.

752
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,550
All the recipes are videos on my channel,

753
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,970
but for some reason I don't
think I can handle, you know,

754
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:47,620
some chicken feet and I especially
she can Tony. And then, you know,

755
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:51,580
I was thinking about, oh,
this a little thing. So just
the jumping around, you know,

756
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:56,410
how can I do this? Oh, I cannot, but I
don't know my readers. I love my readers.

757
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,340
Maybe someday I may change my mind.
And also blood sausage,

758
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:03,790
blood associated people love the
Korean sooner. He called the Sunday,

759
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,470
but the blood associated,
okay. I love to eat soon there.

760
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,920
But one day I tried to find it there. You
know, blood, I need to buy blood. Right?

761
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,820
So when the Chinatown I buy,
I bought some blood. But, uh,

762
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,920
it turned out to jester and
also smells not good, you know,

763
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,840
and then I hate that. So I couldn't make
it, but maybe I may change my mind again.

764
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:28,310
You know, who knows. Yeah.
You got a question over here.

765
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,453
Yeah.

766
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,470
Whenever you want to figure
out how to pay for yourself,

767
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,330
what's the hardest thing that
you could try to like replicate

768
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,150
something like a, when I go to the
fusion restaurant, my fusion restaurant,

769
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,040
relapse catered restaurant and then,
oh, this guy made really Kimchi,

770
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:57,050
Brian. I can smell him
to Brian and some, uh,

771
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:01,560
social studies or like a pinkie
pinkish and then maybe sour cream.

772
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,990
But something that I don't know about.
I never went to culinary school. Hi.

773
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,530
Only I know about Korean food there.
So sometimes I cannot figure it out.

774
00:51:10,531 --> 00:51:13,140
And also I don't want to
know about that. Right. So,

775
00:51:13,141 --> 00:51:16,830
but Korean food when it comes
to Korean food is almost, so,

776
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,120
I know when I tasted this, I know that,
you know how even people were asking me,

777
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,870
Monte, I went to the, um,
restaurant Korean restaurant.

778
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:29,220
They gave me something like a sweet
and really salty and they're kind of,

779
00:51:29,221 --> 00:51:33,570
Mikaila is Brown. It is like of some
potato buddies, not exactly potato.

780
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,500
Oh there's the, that's the fish cake,
you know, cause I know that. Right.

781
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:41,550
So kind of the things that I know that
exactly about Korean dishes and also

782
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:45,400
Korean restaurants, you know, North
American, Korean Nestor on what they saw.

783
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:47,610
But usually,
and then I know they're all decided,

784
00:51:47,611 --> 00:51:50,760
is she so the list so
easily I can figure it out.

785
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:54,210
But like a Korean fusion restaurant,
upscale restaurant,

786
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,440
you know those guys alone.
Uh, Corey Enoch Culinary,

787
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:03,260
you know our Tina. So maybe
in like a secret, did they
use a some, you know, spice.

788
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,440
Dot. I don't know, you know? Yeah.

789
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,930
So I'm, I'm curious, do you
have many followers in Korea?

790
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:14,590
Yeah. Did you base labral
Koreans are coming extra like,

791
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:18,730
uh, uh, most of the people
coming North America,

792
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,580
American USA is,

793
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,600
USDA is around the 70%
over my readers are coming.

794
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,150
How much be who you defense.

795
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:32,650
But Koreans are lady almost
none until last year.

796
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,550
But like all over one year.
These days.

797
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:40,960
More and more people coming and
the label Korean comment in Korea,

798
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:43,660
what should I do?
I have to answer in Korea.

799
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:47,550
And also I was thinking there may maybe
these guys is a total understanding of

800
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:51,280
English, you know, so I just
studied the Korean caption.

801
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,120
So I did the English caption.
Uh,

802
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:57,730
I pay for English caption because
I cannot trust the Google,

803
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:02,910
Google translation in the pool with
the youtube of trends in the auto

804
00:53:03,701 --> 00:53:07,540
translation. All My, my eh, and then,

805
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,490
but I hire,
you know,

806
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:13,300
translation and also the Korean
translation is done by me.

807
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:16,840
So I do this. Yeah, that'd be
have time for one more question.

808
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,350
Um, thank you for being here. I actually
go to your website. I'm creating myself,

809
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:26,010
but I go to your website all the time to
see what else is out there. I just was,

810
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,270
I have two questions.

811
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:32,271
One is if I was thinking about why it
took a while for Korean food to become so

812
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:36,640
big in the states, and I feel like
there's this term called [inaudible],

813
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,510
which you know,
in Korean it's,

814
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,740
it means you just do it by the feel of
things. You don't really measure things.

815
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:48,150
You think that that's the reason why
it might have taken so long for it to

816
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:51,240
become big in the states.
And then my second question is,

817
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:55,650
would you ever consider doing mock
bang, which is a big Korean? Um,

818
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:00,180
you just eat on the show and it's like,
it's huge in Korea right now. If I think,

819
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:04,820
yeah, there's a reminded me over my,
the, another reporter from Korea,

820
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:09,410
she a KBS accordion broadcasting a day.

821
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,580
That'd be [inaudible]. Same question
about Mark Bank, but uh, they, uh,

822
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:19,550
a mock bong I saw the one time. They're
kind of, that's not my nice tie. Yeah.

823
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:24,320
I mean, I went to teach Korean cooking,
just the authentic recipes, but I,

824
00:54:24,321 --> 00:54:26,690
in the always at the end,
over my video,

825
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,950
I show them how passionate did I eat.
You know,

826
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,760
sometimes the people say you look like
a crocodile, but I don't care more.

827
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:37,520
People love that. You know,
the, when I enjoy my food,

828
00:54:37,521 --> 00:54:41,510
they know so because I know dossier, you
know, so who cares? Like something is,

829
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,970
it became my teeth,
you know, so everybody,

830
00:54:43,971 --> 00:54:46,700
I mean those guys are following me all.

831
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:51,540
We are the same group community
know who love food. So, uh,

832
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,930
I can answer and then Korean food or why,

833
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:58,760
why Korean food was not popular I think
were Korean food is popular. I'm going,

834
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:58,881
no,

835
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:03,350
we don't have to worry about this because
like Japan is a four digit is popular,

836
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,530
you know that all new Chinese
food, you know, Korean,

837
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:11,030
a Japanese food in me even think
about Chinese food. Chinese,

838
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:15,590
China's a huge country, NBI, huge
country to Mexico. Huge country.

839
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,410
They are not the huge bay here nowadays.

840
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,960
I think with the Japanese
food is a very big Djs,

841
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:25,670
you know about food is delicious
and healthy, right? So, uh,

842
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:28,010
but Korean food is like a trend,

843
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,280
but I'm surrounded by the
people who love Korean food.

844
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:33,850
So I'm almost a like,
uh,

845
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:39,230
I think that everybody loves Korean
food, which is natural, which is natural.

846
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,730
Then I meet, sometimes I'm
interviewed by in a radio host.

847
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:48,410
Uh, when I talk then I feel that, oh,
they don't know about Korean food.

848
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:53,270
A lot of people don't know about
Korean Kimchi. Not yet. So is study,

849
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,140
study.

850
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,550
But I'm very positive and because
maybe there's a trust my recipe,

851
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,150
they share the food that they make.
Share this.

852
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:06,210
We did their family and friends
