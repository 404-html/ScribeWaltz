1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,210
Well,
thank you very much everybody for coming.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,480
It's a tremendous honor
to be here at Google.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,670
I'm really in awe of the speakers
who have proceeded me on this podium.

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,970
There's so many writers and thinkers
and men and women of action who has been

5
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:23,990
part of the Google talk series.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,590
Most of them have presented some very
specific area of knowledge or even wisdom

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,200
or they've talked about how
to do something in particular.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,740
Um,
as a writer,

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,770
what I have to offer is story
and language and that's it.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,200
There's not going to be a takeaway
because art is the marriage of content and

11
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:56,870
form and form cannot be
retold or summarized.

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,093
So

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,450
I'm going to read to you from my book
for Single Mothers Working as train

14
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:05,414
conductors,

15
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,110
which some readers and critics have
described as an essay collection.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,060
Some have said it's a book length essay.
Some call it a memoir.

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,680
That's my publisher because they say that
essay collection is the marketing kiss

18
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,740
of death. Um, some call
it a story collection,

19
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,720
but it really is an essay collection.
Um,

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,920
but whatever you call
it, um, it takes up a,

21
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:35,660
a grab bag of subjects
that are obsessions for me.

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,990
Translation.
Untranslatability I've actually,

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,620
I've forged a new path in essay writing.

24
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,170
There are a lot of
essays about translation,

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,790
but I am the first writer I know
who writes about not translating.

26
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,090
I realized after this book came out that
it has two essays in it that are about

27
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:03,320
books that I decided not to
translate and why. And I haven't.

28
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,470
I have another one in mind.
Um,

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,350
and I have been told that when
you write from your own life, uh,

30
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,020
you will only ever write one book.

31
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,340
This was something that a writing teacher
thundered at me when I was young and I

32
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:20,240
was turning in a story that was purported
to be fiction, but clearly it was not.

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,650
But I think I found the solution because
if you write about books you have not

34
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:29,510
translated, you will never
run out of material. Um,

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,640
so the obsessions that I take up in this
book, translation on translatability,

36
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,480
uh, Russian, French and Yiddish culture,

37
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:41,990
literature and language.

38
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,510
I worked with French and Russian at the
UN. I did not work with the addition.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,530
The UN other obsessions include Judaism,

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,590
marriage and divorce and chronic illness.

41
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,030
I'm going to tell you this story which
is one section of for single mothers

42
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:00,440
working as train conductors,
uh,

43
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,550
which is a highly subjective,

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,880
even quirky account of my experiences
being hired as a new staff employee at the

45
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,890
United Nations. This piece takes
up some other subjects as well,

46
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,030
but they're all subsumed under the heading
of the resistance and grief that we

47
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:27,661
human beings display when we're unwilling
and he going through life transitions.

48
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,891
And in this case,

49
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:34,891
it's the transition from a high flying
international career as it diplomatic and

50
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,980
conference interpreter of Russian and
English to a desk job requiring minimal

51
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:44,170
knowledge of a few languages.

52
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,000
Before I transitioned into a job as a
translator working with documents in

53
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,660
Russian, French, and
Spanish. Another transition,

54
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:56,661
it describes as the transition from the
freedom of self employment to being a

55
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:59,650
tiny cog in an immense bureaucracy.

56
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,050
And both of those transitions were
occasioned by a different transition,

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,580
which was the transition from
health to chronic illness.

58
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,760
Now this is a worm's eye view of what
it's like to work at the United Nations

59
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,090
and it's not terribly favorable.

60
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,670
So I'll give you some background, some
context, but before I get to that,

61
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,120
I want to say that there is a kind of
open secret about my book which I'll share

62
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:32,261
with you.

63
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:36,700
It's something that authors are always
enjoined not to say about their work,

64
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:39,040
but I'm a debut author.

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,910
I haven't mastered the protocols and the
etiquette so I can say whatever I want

66
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,220
now until my second book comes out,
which I don't think will be anytime soon.

67
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,440
This one took over a decade.

68
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,760
And that open secret is that
my book is autobiographical.

69
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,860
I don't know why this is often associated
with shame for writers and many

70
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:05,080
writers will do almost,

71
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,010
they will stand on their head to avoid
admitting this even if it's true.

72
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,690
The pedigree of autobiographical
writing is superb. Everything from,

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,940
uh, Augustine's confessions,
Lord make me chased,

74
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:23,941
but not yet to the little house on the
prairie to remembrance of things past,

75
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:29,350
which you'll hear more about in a moment.
Um, these are some of my favorite books,

76
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,290
but, um, I am,

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,800
I cannot hide the fact that
my work is autobiographical.

78
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:40,780
It's transparently clear. I live on
the upper west side of Manhattan.

79
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,900
My narrator lives on the
upper west side of Manhattan.

80
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,890
I worked as an interpreter
and translator of Russian,

81
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:52,480
French and Spanish and my narrator worked
as an interpreter and translator of

82
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,010
Russian, French, Spanish.

83
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,130
I have a chronic
degenerative lung disease.

84
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,860
My Meritor has a chronic where
you, you get the idea. Um,

85
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,360
but even though it's won a
prize for literary nonfiction,

86
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,500
this book and my writing in
general embraces subjectivity,

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,210
memory lapses,
hearsay and speculation.

88
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,280
And as such, it should not, it cannot
and should not be fact checked.

89
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,620
Its purpose is to tell a story,
not to say, here's what happened.

90
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,530
I would compare it to a
retouched photograph. Um,

91
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,320
so getting back to the United Nations,

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,780
I said I wanted to give you some context
because of the unfavorable impression

93
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:52,070
that my reading may give you.
I believe in the United Nations.

94
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:55,580
I believe in its mission.
I believe in multilateralism,

95
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,270
but many of my UN coworkers,

96
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:04,271
and I have a sneaking sympathy for
that famous remark by John Bolton,

97
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,340
who was George W. Bush, uh,

98
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:12,341
ambassador to the United Nations when he
said that if the top 10 stories of the

99
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,270
United Nations secretary,

100
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:16,430
it should suddenly disappear
and nobody would miss them.

101
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,140
And our sympathy for this remark
has nothing to do with our politics.

102
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,370
Uh,

103
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,990
you would have to search high and low to
find a staffer at the UN who supported

104
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:29,900
George W. Bush, let alone Trump. Um,

105
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:35,090
it has more to do with the way the
organization is run. Sometimes,

106
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,920
um,
the UN is in desperate need of reform.

107
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,950
That reform will probably
never take place. Um,

108
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,670
but it is nonetheless it really necessary
and indispensable organization. Uh,

109
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,810
and one of the problems is that
because its ideals are so lofty,

110
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,790
when it inevitably fails, that
failure seems even greater than it is.

111
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,020
But, um, to get back to the top 10 story,

112
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,340
the stories of the unit of
the secretary of building.

113
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,780
I think one of the reasons my colleagues
and I would not be sorry if it

114
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,750
disappeared is because it houses a moment,
the other things,

115
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,760
the human resources department
and to get hired at the UN,

116
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:19,310
which in my case took several years,

117
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,110
you have to jump through so many
hoops and go through a ridiculous,

118
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,080
uh, gauntlet to do, prove
your qualifications.

119
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,740
I actually had to come in with a rolling
suitcase that contained all of the

120
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:35,030
books I had translated so they could
estimate how many words I had translated

121
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,880
during my previous decade
and a half as a translator.

122
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,040
And this kind of thing causes people to
start their work at the UN already with

123
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,590
an enormous chip on their
shoulder toward their employer.

124
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,210
There are some good things that the,
in the top 10 stories of the UN,

125
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,540
there is a restroom that has a stunning
view of midtown Manhattan for women

126
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,100
only.
Um,

127
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,580
although I'm told that it's been used
as a viewing post to look down on the

128
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,060
roofs of lower buildings nearby.

129
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,310
When couples are interesting and they're
unaware that they're visible. Um,

130
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,920
it also has a locked
room on the top floor,

131
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,430
reachable only by a creaky twisting
staircase that contains nothing else but a

132
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,060
ping pong table.

133
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,790
And this is one flight up from
the secretary general's office.

134
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,100
The Ping Pong table room is a place
where diplomats go late at night when

135
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:42,510
they're locked. A deadlocked,
I should say in talks,

136
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,960
they bang a little ball around to blow
off steam before they go back to the

137
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:50,370
negotiation table.
One hopes to achieve better results.

138
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,691
Um,

139
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:56,691
so the UN does everything it can
to reduce international tensions.

140
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,280
And in that connection,

141
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,230
I do think that the United Nations
is important and indispensable.

142
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,430
It's the only place in the world where
all hundred and 93 countries can come

143
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:13,431
together to discuss everything that needs
to be discussed from a sexual violence

144
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,360
in conflict to food insecurity,
to border control,

145
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,590
counter terrorism,

146
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,980
how to stop female genital mutilation
and the human rights of women,

147
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,820
ethnic and racial minorities,
people with disabilities, uh,

148
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,053
and children.

149
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,220
I don't agree with those people who say
we should turn our backs on the UN and

150
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,280
instead found an institution
that's for democracies only.

151
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,160
I think that would be very,
very problematic.

152
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,270
I think that the non democracies are
precisely the countries that need to be

153
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:52,860
kept in the loop and in the discussion.
Furthermore,

154
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,520
I'm not sure who would decide
which countries are democracies.

155
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,050
Is the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea? Uh, democracy?

156
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:05,160
Some people obviously think so.
The Democratic Republic of Congo,

157
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,060
also known as the international
capital of rape. Um,

158
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,900
and then there are countries
whose democratic credentials,

159
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:17,901
credentials have been burnished for
centuries that seem to be veering toward

160
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:20,160
other forms of rule.

161
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,910
And there are democracies that become
authoritarian and then one hopes return to

162
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:28,464
democracy.

163
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,510
Are they going to join this hypothetical
organization than be expelled and then

164
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,770
reapply for admission when
they return to democracy.

165
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,470
So with these unanswered questions,
um,

166
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,550
I will now read to you
Proust at rush hour. Um,

167
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,640
there are two things you need to know
because this is not quite at the beginning

168
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:54,420
of the book. It references, uh,

169
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,110
the lung disease,

170
00:11:56,111 --> 00:12:01,111
which I was diagnosed with in the course
of working as a contractor at the UN

171
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,040
and undergoing all the processes
for becoming a staffer.

172
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,470
And it also references
my bid for that job,

173
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:11,380
which was a bid for financial
and professional security.

174
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,220
So Proust at rush hour,

175
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,760
my job is a drag,

176
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,890
like most nine to five gigs I imagine.
But Oh,

177
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,820
the commute,

178
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,980
the commute is a golden border at the
beginning and end of each work day that

179
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:34,510
sheds some of its shimmer onto
the leaden expanse in between.

180
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,080
I should add that I wrote this a few
months after I became a permanent staffer

181
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,550
and I didn't realize until a few years
later that it was actually a lament for

182
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:50,380
the last freedom of self
employment. So, but oh, the commute.

183
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,130
The commute is a golden border at the
beginning and end of each work day that

184
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:58,450
shed some of it's Shimmer shimmer
onto the leaden expanse in between.

185
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,670
I'm a New Yorker,
so taking the subway to work is a given.

186
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:09,150
The subway provides in miniature all of
the charms of long distance train travel

187
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,390
minus the view.
There is the unencumbered time,

188
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,610
a commodity beyond price for those who
sell their waking hours in order to

189
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:20,020
afford a place to sleep.

190
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,680
There is the heady state of in between
this a brief release from all worldly

191
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,740
entanglement.

192
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,250
There is the fact that subway travel is
for now at least incompatible with email

193
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:38,401
and cell phones and that it will always
be incompatible with vacuuming dishes

194
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,640
and laundry.

195
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,060
They are about half a dozen things tops
that you can do on the subway dose.

196
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,240
Observe the people around
you, listen to music, read,

197
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,330
think things we should all do more often.

198
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,670
I was not always a commuter.
I used to be self employed.

199
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,070
I worked from home and when I traveled
by conveyance of choice was the jet

200
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:07,450
plane. State banquets at
the Kremlin mafia trials,

201
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,000
forgotten literary masterpieces,

202
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,120
KGB files declassified under Yeltsin
to be reclassified later under Putin,

203
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,290
I translated them all.
It was a house in time.

204
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,510
The border between working and not
working was porous. When work was slow,

205
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,710
I took a walk or a yoga class.
When a deadline loomed,

206
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,690
I worked weekends or evenings as to why
people dreaded Monday and thanked God.

207
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:35,650
It was Friday.

208
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,660
I lacked all understanding when
people spoke of their commutes.

209
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,350
I listened as to an account
of some quaint foreign ritual,

210
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,020
but in my mid thirties panic bore
down by health insurance was patchy.

211
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,520
My retirement meeker,

212
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,090
my income blossomed and
shriveled with the seasons.

213
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,530
I began planning for the transition from
free spirit to commuter boning up on my

214
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,140
French, so it was to get that
job I'd set my sights on.

215
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,890
Apart from the expense,
there was nothing onerous in this.

216
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:14,540
Who would object to spending some months
in Paris immersed in the language of

217
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,240
Moliere and sitters,

218
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:21,241
guns or this was a dream I had nurtured
and then set aside almost 20 years

219
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:25,600
before and I was glad of any
pretext to make it come true.

220
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,910
Last French mastered.

221
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,100
I prepared to take up my new job as an
interpreter of Russian and French into

222
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:34,934
English.

223
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:40,090
Working in a tall building of green glass
at midtown Manhattan is eastern edge

224
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,900
and now unforeseen things began
to happen during the trial period.

225
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:48,950
Before the job was to become permanent.

226
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,280
My newly failing lungs made it difficult
then impossible for me to perform that

227
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:56,270
demanding work.

228
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,420
A seemingly from job offer went limp
through a series of short contracts within

229
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:03,860
the organization.

230
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,160
I tumbled down and down in status and job
satisfaction though not salary until I

231
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:17,060
landed in a permanent position editing
English language documents with duties

232
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,710
that called for no more than a passing
knowledge of French or any other foreign

233
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:26,711
language movement up the hierarchy I would
come to understand was the reward for

234
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:33,311
a different sort of fluency all together
directly proportionate to the climbers

235
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:39,101
ability to say nothing and offend no
one in the most elegant way possible.

236
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,140
All at great length.

237
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,380
Shortly after I started the permanent job,

238
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,950
I was copied on an email from
one higher up to another.

239
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,040
It's contents presumably affecting my
future in some way that embodied the style

240
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,910
so utterly that I would be
remiss if I did not rape,

241
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,420
reproduce it here quote.

242
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,540
While I do not think that your concern
is misplaced, ran this missive,

243
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,930
I would say that it may be premature to
suggest that the guidelines would apply

244
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:15,170
uniformly as they stand to all staff.

245
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,770
I hope I'm not being
overly sanguine about this,

246
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,930
but I tend to think that just as our
specificities are being taken into account

247
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,300
to a large extent in the interim,

248
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,860
they would readily be accommodated
in the long term. In other words,

249
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,410
the guidelines only state the policy,

250
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,240
which will no doubt allow for some
special dispensation. However,

251
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,040
I do not dispute for a second that
yours is a legitimate concern.

252
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,000
When I got this,
this is just an aside,

253
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,200
I didn't know what I
was going to do with it,

254
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:54,030
but it seemed like such a fantastic
example of something that I printed it out

255
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,270
to save and then later
I found this use for it,

256
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,220
but I reminded myself as I printed out
the email and taped it to the wall over

257
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:03,090
my computer.

258
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,340
Between the map of the Economic Community
of West African states and another of

259
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:13,230
the former Yugoslavia, we you get slot
republic of Macedonia. I was lucky

260
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,020
at last, I had a permanent job.
It came with health insurance,

261
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,760
which saved me thousands each month on
crucial prescriptions, medical equipment,

262
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:26,970
rentals and doctor visits,
disability benefits.

263
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:29,880
If I became unable to work a possibility,

264
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:34,170
I now had to entertain dental coverage,
so dazzling,

265
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:38,820
but even the receptionist at the
dentist office was impressed. Liberal,

266
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:41,730
sick leave,
of which I would take full advantage.

267
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,100
A son splashed office with a view of
boats chugging up and down the East River,

268
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,480
access to a post office bank
credit union employee only,

269
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,860
low interest mortgages, medical
service, international news,

270
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:58,290
Stan yoga dancers size
and [inaudible] classes,

271
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,200
a cappuccino bar,
cafeteria,

272
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,820
fancy restaurant with enormous bowls of
whipped cream and raspberries on the all

273
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:07,710
you can eat dessert buffet,

274
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,600
nine levels of instruction at
no cost in my choice of Spanish,

275
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,630
Arabic or mandarin and high school
choirs visiting from the heartland,

276
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,570
singing songs of international
peace and brotherhood.

277
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,330
All of this right on the premises.

278
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,600
All mine in exchange for spending my
days doing nothing or what felt like

279
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:35,130
nothing where what I find
something better indeed.

280
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,710
I often ask myself that question,

281
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,450
although my Russian and my newly acquired
French are as noted superfluids in the

282
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:46,740
job where I've ended up,

283
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,610
the hiring process mysteriously included
an eight hour language proficiency test

284
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,340
and just as mysteriously
the word translator figures
prominently in my title.

285
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,930
With some luck in a few years I might
transfer back to a post where foreign

286
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:06,570
languages could prove useful.
In the meantime,

287
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,760
I've decided to read Proust.
Yes, in search of lost time,

288
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:16,650
also known as remembrance of
things past in the original French,

289
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,110
all of it,
seven volumes on the subway standing up.

290
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,310
Here's the drill. In the morning
I get to the subway platform,

291
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,630
pull out the book and open to the page
where I left off the previous evening.

292
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,660
When the subway doors
glided apart and my stop.

293
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,070
It's a fine addition with
the thinnest of paper,

294
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,480
the title tool than guilt on the spine
and a slender grow grain bookmarks.

295
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:44,040
So Mina.
Also guilt,

296
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,240
failure to get the volume into position
before train pulls in means I may not

297
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:53,830
get to do any reading that morning as
it's often too crowded to fumble in my bag

298
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,420
for the book after I board

299
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,250
other things to do before I
pushed my way onto the train,

300
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,490
lay my hands on a pen in my bag and make
sure the sticky note inside the books

301
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:08,530
back cover has not come
unglued and fallen out.

302
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,150
The pen and the little yellow scrap of
paper are for writing down on familiar

303
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:13,984
words.

304
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,130
If I don't have a pen at the ready or if
the sticky note is missing are already

305
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:22,270
filled with scrawls from previous
commutes, I'll go back later,

306
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,890
reread the pages and write down the
unfamiliar words that I didn't capture on

307
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:29,290
the first pass.
Then I'll look up,

308
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,530
look them up during the slow moments at
the office that add up to a work day and

309
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,190
another and another.

310
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,780
The office with the river view is
a wash in battered foreign language

311
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:44,890
dictionaries that it would that appear
to have language there for decades.

312
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,990
If it weren't for Proust and my compulsion
to look up every single unfamiliar

313
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:53,770
word I come across,
they would get very little use indeed.

314
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,770
Here are a few entries from
my Proust word list. Most Sad,

315
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,290
Nino de on Dean,

316
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,560
a Lumbee k may have
early class Gootee gas.

317
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,160
We Gay TAPPC.

318
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:14,170
Sylvia had tests on filamentous please
still and left Vicky meaning respectively

319
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,400
Sullen simpering water,

320
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:23,401
sprite convoluted markish carnation
jubilation tea party to warble,

321
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,140
upholsterer villainy procuress
calling card and Greyhound.

322
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm on the Seventh Avenue
Express now hurdling downtown.

323
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,290
In one hand I hold the book and in the
other the pen so I cannot properly be

324
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:46,690
called a strap hanger.
I assume a wide stance.

325
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:49,750
Bend my knees and ride the
train like a skateboard.

326
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,850
In the 12 minutes or so,

327
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:56,851
it takes the train to barrel down the
line from 96th street to Times Square.

328
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:02,790
I fight in notius inertia's pulled
toward free fall into some stranger's lap

329
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,490
plunging instead into the bucolic
village of Comray or the Paris salons and

330
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:14,701
cafes where representatives of the Hook
Push Yc and the Denny Mon cross paths.

331
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,340
I read Proust almost exclusively
on the subway on weekends.

332
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,630
I rarely pick up the book, the little
volume with the grow green marker lies on,

333
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:30,631
touched on my desk from Friday evening
time of unseemly rejoicing until Monday

334
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,090
morning time of dread beyond reason.

335
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,070
This runs counter to my notion of myself
as someone with an almost religious

336
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:43,030
reverence for literature and it's grades,
but there it is.

337
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,060
My life yields up few moments that
are conducive to the concentration and

338
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:50,180
discipline that Proust requires.

339
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,430
Every week or two I indulge in a
dalliance with some other author.

340
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,630
There's some takes. Sometimes it takes
place on the subway, but mostly off.

341
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,350
When I read on the downlow,
it's always in English.

342
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,610
No need to keep a running lookup list
with the attendant pen and posted note.

343
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,030
Usually the work of some contemporary
author who style is relatively terse.

344
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,480
They'll compare to Preuss,
Proust. Everything seems terse.

345
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,720
I can tear through a contemporary novel
of two to 300 pages in the time it takes

346
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,510
to read 25 to 30 pages of proofs.

347
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,120
Read in brief spurts.
Cruz, 3000 pages. Well,

348
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:37,150
the 700 I've read so far reveal reveal
themselves to be a series of hundreds and

349
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,460
hundreds of linked discursive essays,
two to five pages long.

350
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,190
Here's a description of a bouquet of
chrysanthemums and madam swans chambers,

351
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,520
which segues into mention of a sunset
whose color is similar to the flowers,

352
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,980
which dog legs into a discussion of how
her former life as a kept woman with a

353
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:05,240
sideline in prostitution, nurture,
you know, debt as she's known to her,

354
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:06,620
numerous intimates,

355
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,630
a taste for a range of luxury goods
delivered to her door from exclusive

356
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:14,240
establishment spending
many around the small.

357
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,260
Here is a discussion of the
difference between the face.

358
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:22,880
A famous writers presents at a dinner
party and his interior life as laid bare

359
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:25,280
in his books and of the young narrators.

360
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:30,281
Astonishment at the contrast between
the two aspects of the men who's work as

361
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,360
long admired a contrast,

362
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:37,361
so marked that he thinks the party guest
must in fact be some other writer who

363
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:39,920
coincidentally bears the same name.

364
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,560
Here's a meditation on a musical phrase
that largest in swans memory after

365
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:50,120
repeating repeated hearings
here is times square.

366
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,070
I almost missed it and grossed in a
description of the acacia trees and the

367
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,190
public toilet on the shelves of these,

368
00:25:57,191 --> 00:26:01,220
say where near where Marcel and she'll
bear to play hide and seek afterschool.

369
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,230
I pause mid sentence,

370
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,670
ride the human wave off the train
and come to rest on the platform.

371
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,280
Later when I resume reading,

372
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,630
I will cast around in the middle of a
two page paragraph to find my place.

373
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Although in a 300 page stretch in which
Proust places under a microscope the

374
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:22,970
narrator's love for his playmate,

375
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,200
his pain when he decides to cut himself
off from the girl because she doesn't

376
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:28,040
love him back.

377
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,230
His brief conversations with her parents
when he visits her house and hours

378
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:37,610
carefully chosen so that the girl will
not be there and hearing about his visit

379
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:42,611
later will perhaps be intrigued and how
Odette accessorizes the Kimono she wears

380
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:45,090
when receiving guests.

381
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:50,420
Whether I resume exactly where I left
off inadvertently skip ahead or reread

382
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:56,451
half a page without realizing it right
away is if almost no consequence,

383
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,030
I come up the stairs and cross a wide
underground space on my way to board the

384
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:07,380
shuttle to grand central and
before I see them I hear them.

385
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,700
The warm ludic sounds
evoke an involuntary smile.

386
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:17,150
I follow the music to the top of the
stairs around the corner and behind a wide

387
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:18,024
pillar.

388
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,350
I stopped to soak up the feeling
that rolls off these musicians.

389
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,290
They're playing a washboard. Adults
Simmer, a fiddle attempt, marines,

390
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,330
symbols,
drums,

391
00:27:28,331 --> 00:27:33,331
the Banjo and a basis though not all at
once as instrument to play a ratio is

392
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:39,141
about two two $1 bills and cds
spill out of an open guitar case.

393
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,190
The men are wearing odds and
ends reminiscent of other
worlds and times a Bolo

394
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:50,850
tie, a Bandana, a striped
railroad cap, a cowboy hat,

395
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:56,210
a stocking cap pulled down low over
dreadlocks with them is a woman who wears

396
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:01,791
her excess flesh like an urban stole
and passes out flyers to the sparse

397
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:06,300
audience, which is constantly
dispersing and replenishing itself.

398
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,330
When she runs out of flyers or audience,

399
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,520
she shimmies to the music in a manner
that appears deeply introspective.

400
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,640
The flyers and the handwritten sound
sign propped against the instrument case

401
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,080
announced that these are the ebony
hillbillies. The men are not young.

402
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,970
The calm they radiate is not a natural
fit with times square at rush hour,

403
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,540
but utterly at home in their music making.
They carry it off.

404
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:39,050
Their attitude captivates kindly never
rushed each one in gross and his own

405
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:44,841
playing and simultaneously adjusting to
his partners in numerous infinitesimal

406
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:49,080
ways. They are doing their thing
and doing it to perfection.

407
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,430
Soon I will hasten toward
the low cost mortgages,

408
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:58,140
the Cappuccino bar, the Arabic lessons,
the polities and the raspberries.

409
00:28:58,141 --> 00:28:59,010
With whipped cream,

410
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,470
I'm always precisely 10 minutes late
and no one in the office ever seems to

411
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:09,030
notice, but for the moment I'm swept
up. Where do these men live? I wonder,

412
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,820
it's always the first
question in New York or asks,

413
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,820
do they ride the train
training from far Rockaway?

414
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,810
Maybe they've come in from
Jersey City on the path train.

415
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,200
Do they have day jobs benefits?

416
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,390
I doubt that anyone has ever gazed
admiring a miring Lee at their dental

417
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:32,310
insurance cards. They play drum, click,

418
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,080
scrape and saw one of them taps his toes,
another stamps,

419
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:41,890
his heel, a third does something
like singing but less melodious.

420
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,000
They do not look like the kind of
street musicians who interrupt.

421
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:50,680
They're playing to Bob their heads
and say thank you Ma'am to passers by

422
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:55,120
dropping coins, coins in their
case, no, they are not that kind.

423
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,550
I stand off to the side watching and
listening for as long as I can before

424
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,140
running to make my connection.

425
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:07,120
I head for the shuttle which goes
ceaselessly back and forth between times

426
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:08,680
square and grand central.

427
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,240
I have my pick of three trains on
parallel tracks, numbered one, two,

428
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,290
three and four.
They all go to the same place.

429
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,440
Someone wants to explain to
me why there's no track too,

430
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,490
but I forgotten the reason. There's
a track to elsewhere in the system,

431
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,000
but it Peters out before reaching
times square, something like that.

432
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:32,800
I clutch the little volume in one hand
preparing to open it and regain my place.

433
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,650
Mid sentence behind me.
The men.

434
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,530
Did they grow up together
somewhere in East Tennessee?

435
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,700
Did their group coalesced in a bar
in Brooklyn before Brooklyn was hip?

436
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,150
Are They Harlem born and bread
are still addict on the shuttle.

437
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,320
I'll read one more page,
maybe two.

438
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:55,210
If I recognize all the words about debt
and the ladies who come to her Wednesday

439
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:59,710
afternoons and discuss where they have
their dresses made or about a brothel

440
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:04,690
where the met him always urges Marcel to
try out a Jewish prostitute with messy

441
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:09,280
hair. She's better educated and a better
conversationalist than the others.

442
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,120
Since the mme and Marcel always dimmers.
No thank you.

443
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:17,470
Maybe next time I'll get off the
shuttle at grand central with the other

444
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:21,850
passengers and traverse the stations.
Cathedral like expense.

445
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,610
There are easier,
faster routes to work,

446
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,400
but a day that brings
with it a sense of awe.

447
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:32,610
Head tilted to take in that vast
space is a day not yet entirely lost.

448
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:39,030
I will admire the parolee faced clock
that anchors the center of the Grand Hall.

449
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,460
Go down a narrow marble
floored passage where vendors,

450
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:44,860
so grilled Hawaiian tuna,

451
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,900
peppercorn sausage cheeses that
virgin exquisitely on the foul,

452
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,970
mangoes, Bananas, foster cupcakes,
whatever they are. Tiramisu,

453
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:57,280
cake and other treats with names.

454
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:02,281
Fancy beyond recall wrapped in crinkly
paper or packed in bright tins and

455
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:04,450
dripping with snob appeal.

456
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:11,070
I will emerge from underground into the
city and the shadow of the green glass

457
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:16,390
building. I cannot hear the
music anymore. That's all. Folks,

458
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,280
I'll be happy to take questions about
anything I just read or said or anything

459
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:27,114
about the book.

460
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,390
Did you ever finish?
Sorry,

461
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,590
did I ever finish Cruz? I am
finishing Proust. I'm still finishing.

462
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:43,460
She's uh, I'm on volume four. Um,

463
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,100
I was reading volume one in oh seven,
I think.

464
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:51,490
So I put it down for years at a time and
the last time I put it down I decided I

465
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:55,640
should reread the parts
that I had read in French.

466
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,580
I should reread them in
English as a memory jog. Um,

467
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:01,910
so that took a year and
now I'm on volume for.

468
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,730
Seems like you learned French at
a later age and not, you know,

469
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:11,200
in school, correct me if I'm
wrong. How has that experience, um,

470
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,080
harder? Like what were your
resources, what were my sources?

471
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,970
Resources, sources. Well, I actually
had a very solid foundation in French.

472
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,830
I had taken it for five or six years
in middle school and high school.

473
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,710
And um,

474
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,490
I hadn't touched it or used
it in probably 20 years,

475
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:36,960
but it was all there. It was just like
opening a book that had been closed.

476
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,190
The grammar was all there. I just needed
to be, to learn how to comprehend,

477
00:33:41,191 --> 00:33:45,300
spoken French and add vocabulary.
Um,

478
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,670
so I, I, as a freelancer,

479
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:52,671
I was able to take time to go to friends
and take French classes and mingle with

480
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:56,970
French people. And I had a mentor
who was already an interpreter,

481
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,510
the UN who was coaching
me through this process.

482
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:03,740
And she told me which newspapers to read,
what movies to go to,

483
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:08,300
what TV shows to watch,
uh, you know, go to plays,

484
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,030
find yourself a French speaking
boyfriend. She said to me, um,

485
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,100
so that was how I did it.
It took about six months.

486
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,553
MMM.

487
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:22,990
And it's important to note that since
I was working only from French into

488
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:23,824
English,

489
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,300
I didn't have to be able to speak
flawlessly or right flawlessly.

490
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:30,790
I only had to comprehend fro flawlessly.

491
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:36,030
And that's a passive skill that's much
easier to acquire than the act of skills

492
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:39,150
of speaking and writing
and other language. Um,

493
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:44,360
and although there's a widespread
perception that it's harder to learn a

494
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:48,560
language when you're an adult,
I don't think that's necessarily true,

495
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,470
especially if you've already
learned a foreign language,

496
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:55,760
then you have a lot of the conceptual
apparatus in place already and you just

497
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,080
need to add another layer.

498
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,980
MMM.

499
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,900
Because as another speaker in this
series, Noam Chomsky said, uh,

500
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,480
I'm not quoting verbatim, but the
idea is that grammar, the big,

501
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,610
the broad concepts of
grammar are the same,

502
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,060
generally the same from one language
to another. And when you master those,

503
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:16,240
you just have to add some
unique pieces for each language.

504
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,830
You intrigued me with your, um,
untranslatable statements about books.

505
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:25,070
I'm curious how you define that or
what makes a book on translatable?

506
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,660
What makes a book untranslatable?
Well, I can only say for myself,

507
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,390
okay,

508
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,790
what makes a book untranslatable?

509
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,730
Because other people then went on
and translated those books that I,

510
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:40,350
that I declined to.
I think as a translator,

511
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:44,790
you have to believe that everything is
translatable. Otherwise you're a fraud.

512
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,600
But as a person who knows more than
one language in more than one culture,

513
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:52,380
you know that it's not possible. So you
have to live with that contradiction

514
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,043
in my,

515
00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:00,110
well literary translators like to say
that you can only translate those books

516
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:01,860
that you fall in love with.

517
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,000
And I didn't fall in love with any
of those books that I turned down.

518
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,370
So I guess that's the first condition
because literary translation is not

519
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:15,450
remunerative at all.
It's the worst paid form of translation.

520
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,263
Um,

521
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,690
I turned down books because there were
things about them that I felt I didn't

522
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:27,480
fully understand. Um, as it happens,

523
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,450
the books that I write about here
that I decided not to translate,

524
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:31,770
we're all oral history.

525
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,940
They did not have difficult
words or idioms in them,

526
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:40,941
but I felt that I would not be able to
capture the unique voice of the speakers.

527
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,630
Um,
one of them contained many,

528
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:50,631
many different speakers and I didn't know
how I was going to contrast them all.

529
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,640
They all felt different and I did a
sample of a few pages and I felt like

530
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,770
everything that I did was correct,

531
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,840
but there was something
about it that was not right.

532
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,890
Later I found out that the person who
had done the oral history in different

533
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:08,940
versions of the book,

534
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:13,941
she actually attributed the same
passages to different speakers.

535
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,800
So my concern, I was apparently
more conscientious than she was.

536
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:24,210
Um, but there are also words
that are untranslatable.

537
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,030
Um, I, somebody asked for this for an
interview recently, what's the word?

538
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,040
What's the word in Russian?
That's untranslatable and I answered,

539
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,520
there was a word that I encountered on
one of my first big stays in the Soviet

540
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,300
Union when it was still the Soviet Union.
The word is [inaudible].

541
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:50,850
The root is stolen, which means
table Za. The suffix means around.

542
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,000
And then the last part, yeah, just
indicates that it's an abstract nouns.

543
00:37:55,001 --> 00:38:00,001
So this word literally means that
which goes on around a table.

544
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,100
Um,

545
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:07,100
but it means something like feast
plus banquet plus all the conversation

546
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,430
speechmaking toast,
drinking,

547
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:14,670
singing and the bonds
that are arising between,

548
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,480
among all the people around the table.
Um,

549
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,960
and all the work that went into putting
out that spread all in one word.

550
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,520
Um, in a culture where
feasting and gathering is very,

551
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:30,510
very important.

552
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,680
And it also is usually signifies kind of
a private family or friends event, not,

553
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:40,380
not an official. So how do you put
that all into one English word? Okay.

554
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,260
I want him to draw a parallel that,

555
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,240
that I'm a little embarrassed to
make as with many people here.

556
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:49,470
I write software for a living.

557
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,040
One of the things about software
is that it's never done.

558
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:56,910
You can always go back and
Polish it and improve it. And um,

559
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,110
your writing seems your, your style
of writing seems to be the same,

560
00:39:01,111 --> 00:39:05,140
that however much effort you put into it,
however carefully you,

561
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,840
you craft it,
you can always go back and change it.

562
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,310
How do you know when you're done?

563
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,010
I know what I'm done because
the deadline has passed, but,

564
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,750
but how do you know when you're writing,
when you're done?

565
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,530
How do I know what I'm done?
Well,

566
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,350
there was a French poet who said, no work
of artists ever done, only abandoned.

567
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,253
MMM.

568
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:34,310
I do tend to procrastinate by spending
a great deal of time polishing.

569
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:39,840
That's a nice word for it. Uh, Oscar
Wilde said, I spent the day writing,

570
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,910
I spent the morning putting in a comma,

571
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,740
and then I spent the afternoon taking it
out. I don't know how I'm done. I mean,

572
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,200
for this book they were
revisioned deadlines,

573
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,020
but when I was writing the
pieces over the course of years,

574
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:54,840
nobody was waiting for them.
Uh,

575
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:00,240
I think that I was producing about 40,

576
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,430
35 or 40 publishable pages for many years,
a tiny amount.

577
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,360
And I guess when I just felt that I'd
spent enough time polishing and I wasn't

578
00:40:12,001 --> 00:40:16,050
adding anything substantively
new, uh, then I would stop.

579
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,570
But they're never finished
until they're bound. But, um,

580
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,740
Raymond Carver used to get his books
from his publisher just published and he

581
00:40:25,741 --> 00:40:27,630
would take out a pencil
and start correcting.

582
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,850
I'm tempted to do that sometimes.
Thank you very much.
