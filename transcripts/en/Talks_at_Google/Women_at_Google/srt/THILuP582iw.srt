1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,630
So we're,

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,860
we're thrilled this afternoon to welcome
Dr. Rose Mcdermott to the talks at

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,330
Google program.
Now,

4
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:16,380
it's no question that politics is on the
forefront of people's minds these days.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,190
Um, Doctor Mcdermott a discusses her
latest findings from our research and the

6
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:24,270
effects of biology on political attitudes,
preferences and behavior.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,940
Please join me in welcoming.
I'm rose to Google. Thank you.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,980
Thank you very much for taking
your time out to come and, um, uh,

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,880
have our chat today about
genetics and politics. And, um,

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,920
I was just mentioning to Margaret Levy,

11
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:46,480
the director of the center
that the theatrical piece
of the whole election thing

12
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:47,590
has been really dramatic.

13
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:51,880
I really didn't know which part of
it to pay attention to yesterday. So,

14
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,890
um, uh, we'll leave lots of
time to chat about it. But, um,

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,000
what I want to do is run through a little
bit of the work that we've been doing

16
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:06,001
on the genetic foundations of politics
and why that's interesting and different

17
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,430
and important is that for
the last 50 or so years,

18
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:13,930
really since the start of people
investigating political ideology from the

19
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:18,620
perspective of political science,
the notion has always been that, um,

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,960
these things are socialized, that you
learn them at the feet of your parents,

21
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:24,550
that you are,
you know,

22
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,430
at the knee of your father and you
love your father and your father's a

23
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:30,340
Republican. And so then you come
to love the Republican Party.

24
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,910
So it has some kind of affective
part and emotional part,

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,110
but also a part that's really about your
education and your family experience,

26
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:42,580
but not something that's instantiated
in any kind of biological sense.

27
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,240
Um,

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,240
and in the last decade or so myself and
concert with my primary collaborator on

29
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:49,930
this work,
Pita Tommy,

30
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:54,400
who's at Penn state and a few other
people have been working to start to

31
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:58,330
investigate the extent to which some of
these questions of political ideology

32
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:03,130
may actually be instantiated, uh,
biologically and genetically. Um,

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,160
and this work really a dates to a seminal
piece that Nick Martin and Linda Neves

34
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:12,820
did in 1986 in the proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.

35
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:15,430
And Linden is a very
interesting guy. He's a, um,

36
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,480
he's an ordained minister
in the Anglican Church,

37
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,290
but he's also the father of
behavior genetics and a lot
of really important ways.

38
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,183
Um,

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,840
and what happened up until that time is
that everybody looking at genetics was

40
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:33,610
really looking at things like disease
processes and social attitudes was always

41
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,070
the control.
It was the thing that everybody knew.

42
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:39,130
It had nothing to do with genetics
and nothing to do with biology.

43
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,820
And what they were able to show in this
original piece is that it's not the

44
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:46,510
control that actually you
see bigger effects on some
of the social and political

45
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:48,910
attitudes.
Then you even do on disease processes.

46
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,180
So how you do these studies with twins,
right?

47
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:57,181
So you look at the difference between
identical twins and fraternal twins and

48
00:02:57,641 --> 00:03:01,270
identical twins are basically same person
genetically that just happened to be

49
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:05,710
born in two different bodies.
And fraternal twins are
like any other sibling set.

50
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,450
It's just that they're
born at the same time.

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,980
And because of the mathematical way you
can traction that you can analyze the

52
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:16,270
extent to which these
attitudes, um, our genetic,

53
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,290
I'm not just attitudes, but
social behaviors, disease
processes, whatever it is,

54
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,150
shared family and shared family or things
that you share, not just your family,

55
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:29,500
but education and other kinds of social
processes and unique environment,

56
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,420
which is the thing that
only happens to you.

57
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,750
What's important about unique environment
though is that some of those processes

58
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,790
are also biological.
So for example,

59
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,300
the in utero bath in which you
just state is a unique environment.

60
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,020
It's got some biological elements to it,
but it only happens to you of course,

61
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:48,910
unless you're a twin. So when you look at
this, um, the way that this is measured,

62
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:53,830
and this is what this graph is here is
the Wilson Patterson scale and it looks,

63
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,620
it's the way that genetics as
opposed to political science,

64
00:03:56,621 --> 00:04:00,670
people look at attitudes and it just
has a bunch of words, different topics,

65
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,830
the draft, you know, gun control, things
like that. And people just respond,

66
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:08,200
yes, no, or I don't
know, which is immediate.

67
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,350
Usually there's about a 38 items and
you can then traction what percentage of

68
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:18,190
them can be attributable to genetic
versus environmental factors.

69
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,250
And when they originally did
this work in [inaudible] 86,

70
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,030
almost half of the contribution
to people's attitudes
came from these additive

71
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:32,020
genetic factors.
So when later on,

72
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:36,280
some number of years later when Peta,
Tommy and I started looking at this,

73
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:40,120
we broke it up not just by
overall liberal and conservatism,

74
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,920
which is how the original work was done,

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,960
but to actually look at specific things
from political party identification to

76
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:48,640
political knowledge and so on.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,390
And in this graph you can see the
blue part is the part that's genetic.

78
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,830
That green part is the part that's
kind of unique environment. Uh,

79
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,530
the orange part is the sort of shared
environment and you can see it really

80
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:02,730
differs by per particular topic.
Um,

81
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,100
one of the interesting things about
this is what it shows is that political

82
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:10,870
ideology, like, you know, um, liberal
to conservative in a world scale.

83
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:15,680
Think about it. Communists
versus fascists, not just
Democrat and Republican, um,

84
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,350
is highly genetic. It's got a
very large genetic contribution.

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,380
Whereas political party identification,
Republican,

86
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:27,720
Democrat actually has very low genetic
contribution. And we can talk about um,

87
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,300
uh, why and how that works in and how
it's different if you're interested, uh,

88
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,550
in the Q and. A. So the question becomes,

89
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:40,750
is there a real difference between not
just people but politicians on the right

90
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,321
and the left.

91
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:45,790
And so I just want to have you take a
look at some of these images because I

92
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,270
fundamentally believe that some of
the differences are embodied that they

93
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:52,470
actually have sort of
physical elements. So, um,

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,330
and you can see some of them in
the expressions that typical,

95
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:58,670
these are all the official, uh,
photographs that people have.

96
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:01,010
So in the United Kingdom,
this is Theresa May on the left,

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,430
Boris Johnson on the right,

98
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,440
you can see in France Marine Le Pen who
may or may not win the French elections

99
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:14,030
on the right. Depends I guess on
the Russian hacking. Um, and uh, uh,

100
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,990
Halon two's has the lowest approval
rating ever in the history of the French

101
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:21,350
republic on the left.

102
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,500
And of course our classic
last series of elections.

103
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:28,880
You can see how those things
work. Um, so there's some,

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,090
there's different ways in which you
can measure physical end genetic

105
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,920
contributions.
Obviously I've shown you,

106
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,140
I described a bit about how that happens
genetically in how you look at it at

107
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:41,660
twins, but there's other ways
you can look at it as well. Um,

108
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,620
this study which was done by Daren
Schriber when he was at San Diego, um,

109
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,560
was trying to look at the way in which,
um,

110
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,150
MRI technology and looking
at brain activation patterns
can help you distinguish

111
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,010
people on the right
and people on the left.

112
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,640
What was interesting about this study
is that the gold standard in political

113
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:02,480
science about telling whether somebody
is a Democrat or Republican is just to

114
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:05,300
ask them, right? Like are you on
the right or are you on the left?

115
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,910
And then they tell you and then you see
whether or not they vote consistently.

116
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,880
With that,
using this MRI technology,

117
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:14,180
he was actually better able to
predict how people would vote then,

118
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,014
then telling him.

119
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,520
And what was particularly interesting
is that people on the left had a lot of

120
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,800
activation in a part of the
brain that you see here,

121
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,120
which is the insula that's
associated, uh, with uh,

122
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,010
feelings of disgust and people on the
right had a lot of activation in the

123
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:34,200
Amygdala, which is associated
with feelings of fear, um,

124
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,970
by and large emotional activation
in general, but fear in particular.

125
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,990
So another way you can measure them
is with skin conductance response.

126
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:43,760
This is actually Matt Hibbings hand.

127
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:47,390
This is from a series of experiments
that John Hibbing did in Nebraska using

128
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:48,800
physiological measures.

129
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,320
And what you can see with what they
do here in these studies is they show

130
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,270
reactivity to particular images.

131
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,430
I'll show you what those
images look like in a second,

132
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,790
but you can show that people who are on
the right have much more activation to

133
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,020
threatening stimuli.
And that's basically what you see here.

134
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,740
So what is threatening stimuli
look like? Oh, sorry, this,

135
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,250
this is what threatening stimuli it
looks like, right? So you can see,

136
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,200
and there's positive images too.

137
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:22,460
You can see they show images of like
bunnies in the fields and you know,

138
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,790
little kids, um, and flowers and
kittens and things like that,

139
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,410
but also quite threatening stimuli.

140
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,910
And what you can do using eye tracking
technology and we've been doing that is

141
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:36,710
to look at the ways in which people
look at different parts of these images.

142
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,210
Now the reason that is interesting and
important is that a lot of discussion

143
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:43,280
about politics is about how,
okay,

144
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:47,060
we have the same experience but we
differ in our interpretation of it.

145
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,180
And with the eye tracking
technology shows you is that,

146
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:54,140
that's not entirely the case.
We may differ in our interpretation,

147
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,000
but we also differ in what
we experienced perceptually.

148
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,920
So what we pay attention to as somebody
on the right or as somebody on the left

149
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,980
is literally different. And I'd like
to show you some examples of that.

150
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,020
So what you see here, the red dots are
where on average these are um, you know,

151
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,900
aggregated findings. What people on
the right are paying attention to.

152
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:18,090
And the blue ones are what people on
the left are paying attention to. Um,

153
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,230
what you see here is that what people
on the right are paying attention to is

154
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,670
what the spider,

155
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,430
they're paying attention to the
threat they're paying attention to.

156
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,320
You know what the concern is,

157
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,620
whereas differentially people on the
left are paying attention to eyes.

158
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,230
Liberals love eyes.
If you ever do eye tracking technology,

159
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:35,940
what liberals are paying
attention to our eyes,

160
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,570
they really want to know what people are
feeling and the best way to know what,

161
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:42,090
how people are feeling. You think
it's the mouth, it's not the mouth,

162
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,880
it's the eyes.
So that's what's going on here.

163
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,920
And you can do it across many domains.

164
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,740
It doesn't just have to do
with fear and threat domains.

165
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:51,720
You can also do it with sexual domains.

166
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,310
So you can see here what I love about
this is liberals are all paying attention

167
00:09:56,311 --> 00:10:00,300
to the jewelry and the hair, right? Like,
oh, I sort of like that necklace and she,

168
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,860
how does she do her hair?
Right?

169
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:05,950
And what are the people on the right
paying attention to the boobs and the lick

170
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,230
la lip lock, right? Like, it's all
about, um, a particular kind of, um,

171
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:15,090
sexual, um, whether you want to construct
it as threat or opportunity, you know,

172
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:19,050
however it is, there's really different
ways in which they're paying attention.

173
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,200
So it's not just that people are
differing in their interpretation,

174
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:26,370
they're actually experiencing
different, um, uh,

175
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,720
perceptual realities both visually and
auditorily. You can show this with, uh,

176
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,770
we've done experiments where we've also
had different narrations associated with

177
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:41,490
these stories and you get
people responding to different
parts of what they hear

178
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:44,880
as well. Um, and there's interesting
and important sex differences.

179
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:47,490
Men tend to respond much more
to the visual part in women,

180
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:49,820
much more to the auditory part. So, um,

181
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,660
there's other differences as
well as ideological ones. So, um,

182
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,030
this shows you that there can be
political, um, uh, associations with this.

183
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:03,870
The darker colors are where people are
spending more time looking at the image.

184
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,770
So this is a man, he's got a cane,
obviously the cops and the gun, right?

185
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,160
So what happens is that conservatives
tend to pay much more attention to symbols

186
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:17,370
of authority, the badge of the gun, things
like that. Whereas the liberals are,

187
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:20,250
again, not only paying attention
to the eyes, but if you look at it,

188
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,060
they're also paying much more attention
to the cane, right? So they're,

189
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,060
they're literally literally experiencing
different aspects of these images.

190
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,460
When you cross these images
with particular kinds of
political attitudes and

191
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:33,294
behavior,

192
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,830
you can see that the kinds of things
people are paying attention to actually

193
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:42,810
affects or is affected by
or most likely both, um,

194
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,760
their attitudes around certain things.
So this image is actually,

195
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,360
you can't see the back part of the image,
but these are guys around a coffin.

196
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,220
So they're looking at a coffin.
And as I mentioned,

197
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:55,600
we had these different stories,

198
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:59,650
these different auditory stories and in
one story we told them that this person

199
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:03,100
had died in combat and another story
we told them that the person had been a

200
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:07,390
looter who had been shot that had been
looting a important archaeological

201
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,990
treasures. And you can see that
between liberals and conservatives,

202
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,520
it doesn't really affect how much time
they spend looking at this part of the

203
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,490
image of people saluting it,

204
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,830
whether or not you know how the story is,

205
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,720
but it really does affect the Luder if
you tell them that there are Luder, right?

206
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,160
So if you tell them they died in combat,

207
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:33,940
both liberals and conservatives respond
similarly. If you say it's a looter,

208
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,380
the conservatives are going to be spending
much more time looking at that part

209
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:40,870
of the image of the solute
than the liberals are.

210
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,590
You can also cross it the other way with
the image I just showed you of the cops

211
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:48,250
with the man on the ground where you can
describe it as either a beat down or an

212
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,810
arrest.
And again,

213
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,810
you get different levels of how much
time people are spending looking at the

214
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:56,080
cane. Um, depending on what
kind of story you tell.

215
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,800
Yeah.

216
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,190
Uh, this also happens as I
mentioned with sex differences.

217
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:05,780
You can see male versus female spending
time looking at the necklace, uh, in the,

218
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,910
in the Madonna and Britney Spears one.

219
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,250
But this other image which
is a woman actually, um,

220
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,420
somebody dressed in combat fatigues
holding an injured child and you can see

221
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,540
that men and women are spending different
times looking at the child's face

222
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,690
versus a child's body
as well. Um, so you can,

223
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,570
you can look at these things both
from the perspective of ideology,

224
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:28,250
sex differences.
You could do it any way you want.

225
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:31,760
You can do it with religion or any
other kind of identity that you want.

226
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,650
These things then also predict
policy preferences. So when you look,

227
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:41,630
have people look at images of soldiers
saluting a flag and then ask questions

228
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:45,020
about did the u s make a mistake
about sending troops into Iraq?

229
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,070
You can actually predict their response
based on how much time they spend

230
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:52,190
looking at the flag versus how much time
they spend looking at other parts of

231
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:53,024
the image.

232
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:57,560
So that those spending much more time
looking at the flag are those who are

233
00:13:57,561 --> 00:14:01,940
going to say, no, we didn't. We
didn't make a mistake going into Iraq.

234
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,530
And the other image,
you can also look at,

235
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,000
ask people about whether or not they think
we're gonna this was done a few years

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,240
ago before I'm the u s pulled
out of Iraq, um, candy.

237
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,980
Or will they win the war in Iraq?

238
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,880
And depending on how much time they
spend looking at the tanks as opposed to

239
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,760
looking at the sheep, you
can actually predict, again,

240
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,220
whether or not they think
victory is going to be possible.

241
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,620
So these are various ways in
which you can measure and look at,

242
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,840
um, uh, biological and
physiological contributions to,

243
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,540
um, uh, political ideology.

244
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,390
But then the question becomes
a web part of it is genetic.

245
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,070
Okay.

246
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,280
So one of the things that drives me
crazy when I watched the news is that

247
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:48,530
they're always talking about how,
uh,

248
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,420
researchers find the liberal gene or the
gene or the gene for fear or the gene

249
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:58,330
for blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. And what's important
to understand is that, um,

250
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,780
there is no such thing,
right?

251
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:04,070
There's never going to be a gene for
these are very, very complex processes.

252
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,360
They involve many,
many,

253
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:10,361
many genetic factors in interaction
with environmental factors and um,

254
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,480
they happen across developmental pathways
based on like what happened to you as

255
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,370
a kid,
what happened to you in the moment.

256
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,350
And so it's never going to be that there's
a gene for it's much more complicated.

257
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:26,240
And if I have one take home
message, that's it. But if we have,

258
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,403
um,

259
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,330
if in fact the story I'm telling you based
on the data I have is true and a very

260
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,390
large percentage of our
political ideology is heritable,

261
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,870
then the most important choice you make
and your children in determining your

262
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,050
children's a political ideology
is your choice of mate.

263
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,940
So that brings us back to how
mating actually contributes
to the development and

264
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:49,820
polarization of politics over time.

265
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,140
And that's what I want to spend a little
bit of time talking about before having

266
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:58,490
a conversation with you. So this is
obviously a very complicated slide,

267
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,050
but I just wanted to sh to show that
there's many things that contribute to an

268
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:06,800
outcome. It's not right a gene for,
but we have developmental issues,

269
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,690
we have physiological issues,

270
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:11,630
we have lots of other things
going on in development.

271
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,780
But what I'm going to have pay
attention to right now is this issue of

272
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:15,980
individual DNA.

273
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,190
How your individual Dna from your parents
meeting and mating determines not only

274
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:21,951
you,

275
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:25,670
but how your individual meeting may
affect your children's political ideology

276
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:29,480
and other characteristics.
So the classic work on mate selection,

277
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,520
which again was done from a,
you know,

278
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:34,850
a socialization perspective
by David Buss in Seventies.

279
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,250
I'm looked at as people, basically
what the characteristics were that, um,

280
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,390
and these were done in
strait population's,

281
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:44,090
remember this was done in
the seventies before. Um,

282
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,000
there was quite as much
attention to homosexual meeting,

283
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:50,110
but this was really about
heterosexual meeting because, um,

284
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,620
we were really looking at, at children.
So, um, when he looked at them,

285
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:57,890
you can see there's a lot of overlap
between what males and females say that

286
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,150
they want.
Um,

287
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,720
the ones in Italics are the ones where
it's statistically different in how

288
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,530
important those characteristics are to
them. Although this was done in the 70s,

289
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:09,650
recent studies are very, very,
very similar with one exception,

290
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,420
which is that now men really care a lot
more about how much money their female

291
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:15,231
counterparts make.

292
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:19,040
So that's becomes a much more important
than physical attractiveness and recent

293
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,190
studies, uh, in, um, male meeting.

294
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,020
So that's the only part in which is
really significantly different than it was

295
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:26,854
in the 70s.

296
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:33,070
So one of the studies we did is we
went through an online dating site.

297
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,990
I actually did this myself.
I can't say what the site was,

298
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,990
but I can say it was the
single most depressing thing
I've ever done in my life.

299
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,340
And,
um,

300
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,020
we took 313 zip codes and we took the
first five men in the first five women.

301
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,290
And, um, we looked at
how their profiles were.

302
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,780
So what did they say they care about? Did
they say they care about politics? Um,

303
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,700
did they say that it mattered and so on.

304
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,230
And what we found is that people are much
more likely to say that they were fat

305
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,810
then, that they had a
political preference. Right?

306
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,870
So this is the woody Allen line about
how you're trying to double your chances

307
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:05,190
for a date on a Saturday night.

308
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,400
By not saying I'm only going to date
a Republican, or I'm only gonna date,

309
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,430
you know,
a Democrat or whatever it happens to be.

310
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,270
But the reason that's important is that
people are wrong about what matters in

311
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:16,290
their meat choices.

312
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,350
So they think that what matters is that
they share interests like going to the

313
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:23,820
movies or going to the beach. But if you
look at what happens in longterm mating,

314
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,980
what holds people together, that's
not it. So then the question becomes,

315
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:33,270
is it really about politics? And I
want to show you some data about this.

316
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,730
People think that what happens is that
over time people converge that they're

317
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:42,270
starting to become more similar in
politics over time. And in fact,

318
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:46,470
that's not the case. What you get is
as sortation not convergence there,

319
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,710
they're meeting and meeting and matching
up with the people who share their

320
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,650
political ideology. They're not
becoming more similar over time.

321
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,990
And we know this from longterm studies,

322
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,860
these look at people before marriage
and about 10 years after marriage.

323
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,060
And you can see that the statistical
associations don't change very much.

324
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,650
What does change is how you look.

325
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,650
So people start to look much
more like their spouses.

326
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:12,360
So if you have pictures of people when
they get married and then 10 years later

327
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,100
and you have independent coders, they'll
say at the beginning, you know, oh,

328
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,220
these people don't look at all alike.
And then 10 years later they'll say,

329
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:23,190
these people are brother and sister.
They're there physically related.

330
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:26,670
They're not spouses. And it's because
you mimic each other's facial expression.

331
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:29,190
It changes the way that the
blood flow works in your face.

332
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,330
And you start to look alike.

333
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,470
So don't marry somebody you don't find
attractive because you look like them, uh,

334
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,870
over time.
Um,

335
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,410
so it's not actually the case
that you have a sortation,

336
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:44,850
you have this convergence.
So the question is if you,

337
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,010
if you don't know that you're looking
for somebody in the same politics,

338
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:50,250
right?

339
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,770
You think that what you're looking for
is somebody who likes movies that you

340
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:56,940
like, but in fact the people that you're
actually marrying as opposed to dating,

341
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:00,840
but actually marrying and having kids
with are the same than what's happening.

342
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:04,140
It's not actually an issue of selection.
It's an issue of d selection.

343
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,410
Your d selecting the people who don't
share your basic fundamental political

344
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:10,254
values.

345
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,120
When you look at the things that people
who are in longterm marriages actually

346
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:20,121
correlate with anything
more than a random chance,

347
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,520
there's only three things.
Religion,

348
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,280
which we know is actually him
off lists on socialization.

349
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,940
So what I mean by that is it is a
socialized thing where you're basically

350
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,840
meeting and marrying people in
your same social network of six,

351
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,610
share your same religious orientation,

352
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,070
whether that's being an atheist
or whether it's being a Jewish,

353
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,050
whether it's being a Muslim, whatever
it is, politics and drinking frequency,

354
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,620
whether you're a teetotaler, whether
you're an alcoholic, everything else,

355
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:50,320
all the things that you think
matter, whether it's you
know, your ideal body type,

356
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:53,050
how much people sleep,
extroversion, introversion,

357
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,050
it's less than would be
expected by tossing a coin.

358
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,680
And these are really longterm
marriages, right? 30 years or more.

359
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,000
There's one exception to this
and that has to do with race.

360
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,450
This is of course an American sample.

361
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:10,510
And so it's hard to say whether
or not this is true outside race,

362
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,650
but what you do get is that conservatives
are much less likely to be willing to

363
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:16,000
marry outside their race.

364
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,360
And what's really driving this
is conservative white men.

365
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,650
So conservative white men really don't
like to marry outside their race.

366
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:27,400
And that's really what's driving this.
But that's the one exception to this, uh,

367
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,350
earlier.
Larger generalization.

368
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,830
Now from an evolutionary standpoint,

369
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:35,260
if you think that some of this
is genetically instantiated,

370
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,410
and I believe that the data suggests that,
well it doesn't just suggests that,

371
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:43,180
but really demonstrates that what
happens is that over many generations you

372
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:47,920
would expect more political polarization.
And by that I mean as liberals,

373
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:50,440
Mary Liberals,
as Conservatives and Mary conservatives,

374
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:53,680
they're much more likely to have
children have those same dispositions.

375
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,480
Now a hundred years ago,

376
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,530
it didn't matter so much because what
was happening then is that we're wealthy

377
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,900
men were marrying
beautiful women on average.

378
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,430
So the political ideology of the woman
wasn't as important to the meat choice.

379
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,260
But now as marriage has
become a luxury good, right?

380
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:15,190
Marriage is actually one of those things
that's more bifurcated by class now,

381
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:18,880
then, um, money was by race in the 1950s.

382
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,630
So there's two sets of people, right?
There's people who get married,

383
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:25,900
have kids engage in the
intergenerational transfer of wealth,

384
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,800
and then there's people who have kids
never get married and never have any

385
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:31,900
wealth to pass along to their children.

386
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,580
But those who actually get married
and have children in this kind of way,

387
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,840
in this sort of, um, you
know, uh, bifurcated way,

388
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,660
you're getting a pulling
apart of ideology, right?

389
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:46,600
You're getting a pulling apart where
liberals are marrying liberals,

390
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,130
conservatives or Marin conservatives,

391
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:51,460
they're having children who
are disproportionally that
way cause it's not random

392
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:54,400
anymore.
And so you get increasing polarization.

393
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,460
It doesn't take as many
generations as you might think.

394
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,520
And I think that's why we're
seeing at least in part,

395
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,600
increasing political polarization over
what may have happened in Saint 1950.

396
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,780
So as I mentioned,

397
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:12,550
if what's going on is that longterm
mates actually select each other based on

398
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:15,880
political ideology. But people don't
know that they're doing that, right?

399
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,700
Because when they write their
online profiles, they don't say,

400
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,880
I'm unwilling to marry a
Democrat on average. Um,

401
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,460
then what's happening is d selection.
But if you don't know it,

402
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:29,230
it means it's happening unconsciously.

403
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,070
So the question is how is that
happening and our solution,

404
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:36,040
our suggestion was that it happened
through smell, through pheromones.

405
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,740
And that was the experimental
tests that we ran on this.

406
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,020
What made us think about this was actually
running genome wide association tests

407
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:49,290
on political and looking at those aspects
of the chromosome that appeared to be

408
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:56,240
most related to political ideology.
So when you do these tests,

409
00:23:56,241 --> 00:24:00,530
those that are considered suggestive are
those that are like two times 10 to the

410
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:01,100
eighth,

411
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,820
whereas those that are
considered significant are
three times 10 to the eighth.

412
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,990
And if you look at those
factors that cross those,

413
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:12,920
those thresholds of suggestion or
significance with regard to political

414
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:17,900
ideology, every single one in the miss
somehow related to olfaction to smell in a

415
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:21,350
disproportionate way that explains a lot,
right,

416
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:24,890
explains how it is that people
know this automatically,

417
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:28,250
how their d selecting and how they're
not conscious about that selection.

418
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,200
So we ran a study on this. This
is actually done at Harvard, um,

419
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,940
and we actually did it
not just on em, um, smell,

420
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:42,740
but we also did it on voice and on,
um, facial similarity and so on.

421
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,180
Um, but our notion was that
political ideology probably
worked on pheromones very

422
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:50,540
similar to the way that the
immune system works on pheromones.

423
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,600
So we know there's a lot of data showing
that, for example, people actually, um,

424
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,990
find those whose immune system functions
differently than there's much, much,

425
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:03,410
much more attractive than
those whose ideology. I mean,

426
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:07,970
whose immune system is the same that
works through pheromones, not conscious,

427
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:08,804
automatic,

428
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,820
but definitely matters because if you
have children with someone whose immune

429
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,380
system is similar to your own,

430
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,250
they're not going to be as protected
from as many sets of pathogens as people

431
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,700
who are different. So we thought that
political ideology work the same way,

432
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:26,830
but in a different sense in that you're
attracted to those whose ideologies this

433
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,520
is the same rather than people
whose ideology is different. So,

434
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,830
um, we took 190 people, we took a bunch
of studies on personality, politics,

435
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:41,090
lifestyle and so on. Um,
and then, um, had the,

436
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,360
found a bunch of people
who had extreme ideology.

437
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,650
They're liberal or conservative.

438
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,860
It's hard in Massachusetts to
find extreme conservatives,

439
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:52,790
but we shook some trees and found a few
of them and they come into the lab and

440
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:57,200
you give them, you know, fragrance free
shampoo and fragrance free, um, you know,

441
00:25:57,201 --> 00:26:00,050
soap and everything and you ask them
to take a shower with all this stuff.

442
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:04,070
And then they were gauze pads under there,
under arms for 24 hours.

443
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:06,740
And you ask them, you know, they
could exercise and whatever,

444
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:10,970
but not teed certain kinds of foods,
not to wear certain kinds of perfume,

445
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,340
not to be around scented candles,

446
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,010
not to sleep in a bed with
another person or an animal.

447
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,470
And they do that for 24 hours for
$20, which is unbelievable. Um,

448
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,090
but they do do it.
Um,

449
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,860
and then they come in the next day
and they give you these samples.

450
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,970
And so then what we do is we take these
samples and we have about, you know,

451
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:32,720
an additional hundred 90
people smell those samples. Um,

452
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:36,770
and then ask them questions about how
they feel about these samples. You know,

453
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:40,460
do you think this person is,
um, you know, trustworthy?

454
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:44,820
Do you think this person is intelligent?
Do you think this person is, you know, um,

455
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,350
a kind. And then we asked them, can you
get this person's political ideology?

456
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,500
And then we ask them,
do you find this person attractive?

457
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,950
And what's amazing about the results
where it came out the way I expect it,

458
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,460
which was surprising.
Um,

459
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:03,240
and what we found was none of the things
about intelligence or respect or any of

460
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:05,280
those kinds of things ended
up at all significant.

461
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,100
What was absolutely significant is
how attractive they found people.

462
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,760
So they found those who shared their
political ideology much more attractive

463
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:15,900
than those who didn't. But they were
wrong about guessing their ideology.

464
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,850
So when you said, do you know
that, let's say you're a liberal,

465
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,470
do you know what this person is completely
random in their assessment of whether

466
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:24,390
or not that person is
liberal or conservative.

467
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,480
But if you look at whether or not
they find that person attractive,

468
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,640
you can absolutely predict it back.

469
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,260
So it was one of these really funny
studies where it's so wacky that no one

470
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,240
believed it would work.
I wasn't even sure it would work.

471
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:40,290
And so the first day we did, um, my, uh,

472
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,580
really amazing statistical guy
who's at Harvard, it was like,

473
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:45,510
this isn't going to work.

474
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:49,950
And he opens the first vial and he smells
it and he gets sick. Like he's like,

475
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,280
oh, I can't do this. Like this
study isn't going to work.

476
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:58,800
And I picked it up and I smelled it and
I didn't smell thing. And I thought, Ooh.

477
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,640
And so I called over the lab manager
and I said, Sarah, what do you smell?

478
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,760
And she said, I don't smell a thing.
She was like, let me get my boyfriend.

479
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,090
So she gets her boyfriend from the back
and he smells it and he literally threw

480
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:11,970
up. He was like, that's
the most disgusting thing
I've ever heard of my life.

481
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,040
And I was like, this is really gonna
work. And what happened was that those,

482
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:21,450
the person we were smelling
was a conservative guy and
both of them were liberal

483
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,710
guys.
And so it was a really different reaction.

484
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,790
And the last day of the study was
really interesting because, um,

485
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,330
I was running all the subjects and this
guy came in probably the second to the

486
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:40,920
last person and he said, um,
one of your samples is rancid,

487
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,910
you know, it's really gone bad, you can't,
um, use these samples anymore. And I said,

488
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,880
oh, that's really interesting. You know,
which one is it gave me the number,

489
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:52,200
you know, 190 ever a time. 190. Thank
you very much. He leaves in the next one,

490
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,720
the next person who comes in
as a young woman and she says,

491
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,130
what are you going to do with the
vials when you're done? And I said,

492
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,090
I'm going to put them in the freezer
and then I'm going to do a molecular

493
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:07,110
analysis of the DNA that's contained
in the sweat. Are you sure? Yeah,

494
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:11,760
I'm pretty sure why. Well, you
have to for each one. And I did,

495
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:15,240
it was like a right arm and a left arm,
right? And I said yes. And she's like,

496
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,380
you don't need both of them. You can do an
analysis on just one. Right. And I said,

497
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:23,400
yeah, I said, why? She said, can
I take one of them home with me?

498
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,460
And I was like, no, you can't
take one of them home with you.

499
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,260
And when I asked her which one it was,

500
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:31,140
it was the exact same one that the guy
before had just told me it was rancid.

501
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,250
It was 190 right. And again,
conservative guy, conservative woman,

502
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,330
liberal guy who had come in.
Um, so, well you can see here,

503
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,800
and this looks a little backwards.

504
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:44,110
This is how it conservative
feels smelling a conservative,

505
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:48,280
how conservative feel smelling a liberal,
how men feel,

506
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:52,240
smelling women, how men feel,
smelling, sorry. Men feel smelling men.

507
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,110
Men feel smelling women while you'll see
is women hate the smell of each other,

508
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,680
right? Men really kind of liked
the smell of each other. Um,

509
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,830
conservatives, uh, really like
the smell of other conservatives.

510
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,160
Liberals like the smell of liberals.
Conservatives don't mind.

511
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:12,160
The smell of liberal says quite
as much when you do it on voice,

512
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:14,320
what you find is the other asymmetry.

513
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:18,370
So liberals hate the sound of conservative
voices more than conservatives hate

514
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:23,290
the sound of liberal voices. So you get
some differences on the voices as well.

515
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,290
So why does it matter? Is is
that, um, attitudes aren't
just attitudes, right? Um,

516
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,750
spouses, a sword on it. People
pass this onto their children. Um,

517
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,120
these differences are partly genetic,
but partly environmental. Um,

518
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,360
and we differ in the way that
we experience these things.

519
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:43,430
And it doesn't just matter for politics,

520
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:47,540
it matters for things that are much more
important, much more important, but,

521
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,780
but important in wider parts of the world
rather than just who runs the Horse,

522
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,220
who wins the horse race of the election.

523
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,360
And so I want to talk for just a
minute about one of those applications,

524
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:00,500
which I'm most interested in,

525
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:04,130
which has to do with processes of violence
and how attitudes affect processes of

526
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:07,760
violence. So we see them all over
the world, right? Right now the big,

527
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,310
the big stories are from Syria,
but it's kind of, you know,

528
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:12,560
eternal wherever it happens to be.

529
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,740
And you see it play out
also in domestic politics,

530
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:18,440
especially regarding things
like immigration. Right?

531
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,440
There's violence toward people who may
not share your particular political views

532
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:27,170
or share a different ethnicity or a
different religion or even a different sex

533
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:29,750
or sexual orientation.
So it plays out in many ways.

534
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,320
So we did one of these studies
where we actually looked at people's

535
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:36,740
dispositional level of fear. That is
the extent to which their temperament,

536
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:37,820
their genetic temperament,

537
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,380
it makes them more likely to react with
fear to particular stimuli than others.

538
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:46,190
And this is, this is different across
individuals from a baseline level,

539
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,820
meaning some people just have
higher levels of dispositional
fear to begin with.

540
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,830
Then other people do. What you find is
that those people who are more fearful,

541
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,680
um,
are more hostile to immigration.

542
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,440
Do object to multiculturalism,

543
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:05,120
don't like the notion of foreign trained
doctors want segregation and so on. Um,

544
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,240
and so what's actually happening is that
the reality is that fearful people are

545
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:16,170
conservative. It's not the
conservative people are
fearful, but fearful people, um,

546
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
you know,
become conservative.

547
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,600
So the other city we did is we actually
looked at the relationship between the

548
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:27,170
propensity for physical aggression
and the likelihood of supporting

549
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:28,820
interventionist foreign policy.

550
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:33,650
And making different kinds of decisions
on complex, um, moral and political tasks.

551
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,530
And I just wanted to show you what this,
what the scale looks like.

552
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,500
People respond one to six
from this is what I'm like to,

553
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:43,070
what I'm not really like. Um, and they're
basically physical aspects, you know,

554
00:32:43,071 --> 00:32:45,140
you'd like to get in
physical fights and so on.

555
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,390
And people who rank higher on these
scores are much more likely to support

556
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:53,270
interventionist, foreign policy,
aggressive foreign policy.

557
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,370
These are some of the decisions.
We have the mic.

558
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,510
We also have the mic moral dilemmas about,
you know, you're on a ship that's over,

559
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,720
you know that Scott, too many
people it's about to turn overboard.

560
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,870
One of the people is very sick.
Do you toss him overboard or not?

561
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,620
And whether or not to give a vaccine that
you're not sure it's going to work to

562
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:10,490
a group of people.

563
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,570
And what you find is people who are much
more likely to respond with physical

564
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:19,000
aggression are more likely to engage and
support aggressive and interventions.

565
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,450
Foreign policy are much more
utilitarian in there. Um, uh,

566
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,040
moral decision making.

567
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,370
This is also true for men who are
physically stronger and women who are more

568
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:33,290
beautiful as assessed by other
people, not by themselves. Um,

569
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,760
so,
uh,

570
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,790
this is basically what I said the other
point to make is that there are real sex

571
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:39,170
differences in this.
Um,

572
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,850
men are more likely to endorse these
aggressive actions in general. Um,

573
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,840
and there's other factors that
do influence these outcomes
and these assessments,

574
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,470
the most important of which is really
education and also whether or not people

575
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:54,200
have fathers and whether or not
their fathers are involved with them.

576
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,360
To the extent that you
have absent fathers,

577
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:59,870
you get much more strong
endorsement of aggressive action,

578
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:04,250
much a stronger manifestation of
aggression and much more utilitarian moral

579
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,940
calculus. So support for, um,

580
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,180
processes that allow fathers to
stay with their families, uh,

581
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,920
has huge downstream
effects for their children.

582
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:18,230
And the final thing is just to say that
although these genetic factors I believe

583
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:21,530
really matter and account for
about half of what we're seeing,

584
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:24,770
these things always exist in a social
context in those social context.

585
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,510
Like whether or not you have a father,

586
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,860
like whether or not you have a good
education really affect the operation of

587
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,980
these genes and how they, uh,
come out in the real world.

588
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,250
And if any of you are more interested
in looking at this more deeply, um,

589
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,050
this is my edited volume on, um,
evolution, biology and politics,

590
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,140
which has a lot of summaries
from various different people,

591
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,330
including chapters on like, um, chimps,

592
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:52,070
chimps and how these things are
related to evolutionary, um, uh, uh,

593
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,670
impetus as well. So, um, I'm
gonna stop there and then, oh,

594
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:58,790
I don't have quite as much
time as I thought, but, um, uh,

595
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,810
have a discussion that I'd really like
with you with thoughts, questions,

596
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,180
comments, objections, concerns.

597
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,220
I saw that your, your studies,
um, worked with different groups,

598
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:13,370
different countries. There's some
Australian studies and you know,

599
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:17,010
the definition of liberal and
conservative in a, you know,

600
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,980
more socialist country might be different.
So do these patterns map on,

601
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,170
is that another area of research?

602
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,280
Yeah, that's a great
question. So, um, the,

603
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,160
we have data from lots of
different countries. Unfortunately,

604
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,580
the countries that we mostly have data
from our western industrialized countries,

605
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:38,280
so Australia, Denmark, Sweden, the United
States, you know, places like that.

606
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,900
But with those studies, what we've
been able to show is that, um,

607
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,760
these differences between liberals and
conservatives show up in every population

608
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:52,200
we've been able to look at across the
course of about 50 years that we've had

609
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:55,320
data that we've been able to look at.
What's important though is,

610
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:58,710
is part of the caveat of your question,
which is that again,

611
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:02,580
it's not Republicans and Democrats
in the narrow American sense.

612
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,440
From a world perspective,

613
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:09,420
Democrats and Republicans in the American
sense are like this far apart, right?

614
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:12,270
They're basically the same thing.
They're what we call Lockian liberals.

615
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:17,220
They believe in capitalism. By and large,
I mean Bernie, not so much, but, um,

616
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,850
you know, really, um, committed
to democratic principles,

617
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:22,500
capitalist economic structures,

618
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,350
particular kinds of notions
of tolerance and equality.

619
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,450
So they're different in
some domestic things,

620
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:31,320
but in kind of the world spectrum
from fascism to communism,

621
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:33,880
much more similar than they are different.
Um,

622
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,500
and when we look at these things in
other countries and around the world,

623
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:41,940
the ways in which they're stable are
really this kind of world political

624
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:46,710
spectrum from fascism, uh, on the
right to, um, communism on the,

625
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:49,650
on the left.
And I should have said that backwards,

626
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:53,250
but I'm trying to do it
this way. Um, so, um,

627
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,670
that's what matters is to just think
of ideology and a broader political

628
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:59,100
spectrum than just the
American political discourse.

629
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,020
And then you have real stability.

630
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,090
And I think part of what's going on here
is that you have a situation where from

631
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,320
an evolutionary standpoint,

632
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:12,321
you have some real universal
basic principles that
appear across every society

633
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:17,670
across time that basically have to do
with topics of survival and reproduction.

634
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:20,880
So think about sex and
reproduction issues. Um,

635
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,160
a resource allocation issues and issues
related to in group defense and outgroup

636
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:30,620
discrimination. The topic
may change given, you know,

637
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,610
the everyday topic may change from year
to year and from country to country so

638
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:39,480
that sometimes sex and reproduction
looks like fights over prostitution or

639
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:42,270
pornography in 18th century England.

640
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,060
But now it looks like a fight
over transgender bathrooms.

641
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,220
The specific topic may change,

642
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:50,910
but the underlying issue is about
regulating topics of sex and reproduction,

643
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,740
which are, you know, these
universal concerns. Um, from
an evolutionary standpoint.

644
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,300
Yeah. I'm also curious if you've, um, uh,
looked at work in a adult development.

645
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,200
Um, so also at Harvard, uh,
like Robert Keagan, uh, and, um,

646
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,620
so kind of building on the like,
so Piaget sort of identifying,

647
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,220
you'd have stages of child development.
Yeah. But as adults continue to grow,

648
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,640
I'm seeing the world, uh,
they're sort of perspectives,

649
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:18,700
continued growth through phases, seeing
the world in terms of greater complexity,

650
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,760
understanding their own motivation and
the motivation of others in greater

651
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:22,810
complexity.
Yeah.

652
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,330
Is it something that you've looked at in
terms of like the biological correlates?

653
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,500
Yeah. So, yes and no. Um, we've definitely
looked at the developmental piece. So,

654
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,230
um, especially one of the GS
that I've studied most, um,

655
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,160
Jewess Lee is this, um, a thing
called Mal monoamine oxidase.

656
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:42,730
And there's a particular kind of
polymorphism. It's, some people call it a,

657
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:46,810
some people call it a low activation,
however you want to call it, colloquially,

658
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:48,280
it's referred to as the warrior gene.

659
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:50,980
But I don't really like that
cause it's very pejorative. Uh,

660
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,090
it gets that terminology really from its
association with the Mallory population

661
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:55,924
in New Zealand.

662
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:59,350
And that is the only population in
the world where you get a much higher

663
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:01,270
percentage.
So in most of the world,

664
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,170
about a third of men show
this particular polymorphism.

665
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,840
And in New Zealand it's about two thirds.

666
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,590
You don't get it as much in women
because it's on the x chromosome.

667
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:14,860
And it's a recessive gene,
meaning since women have two copies,

668
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,060
it's very rare to find women who
have two copies of this polymorphism,

669
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,140
somewhere between eight and
12% of the population of women.

670
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,880
But it's really lower than that and about,
but in men it really is like 35%.

671
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,890
Um, now the reason I point to that gene
is it's the one that's been most closely

672
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:37,270
associated with, um, a susceptibility
to physical aggression.

673
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,280
And it's hugely effected by developmental
experiences. So, for example,

674
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:45,550
if you, um, have traumatic
early life events,

675
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,500
it makes it much more likely that the
gene will get activated or expressed and

676
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:54,070
you're much more likely to
then demonstrate physical
aggression later in your

677
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:58,570
life. And it matters when that
happens. So in this sense,

678
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:03,160
like Freud was right, zero
to five matters. But what
really matters is puberty,

679
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,340
so 11 to 15,
11 to 16,

680
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,210
and it's probably because there's a whole
cascade of hormones that get activated

681
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:15,160
around that period of time. So it's not
just the traumatic early life events,

682
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:19,480
it's how many you have and how severe
they are. So this is not like, you know,

683
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:24,100
I think of it as, it's not the Stanford
problem of like I got a B plus, right?

684
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:28,090
This is like my parents were in
jail, my brother died. Um, you know,

685
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:32,710
I grew up in a combat zone. These are
really severe developmental traumas.

686
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,550
Um,

687
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:38,380
and when you have a lot of them and
particularly when they happen at junctures

688
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:39,011
in time,

689
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:42,970
which is why I personally believe father
absence of puberty is particularly

690
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:47,700
problematic for potentiating violence
in certain populations. Um, I mean,

691
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,410
populations who have those kinds
of traumatic early life events,

692
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,250
that's the way in which developmental
aspects can really interact with these

693
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:58,960
genetic things to change the expression
of them. I don't usually like, um,

694
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,160
what they call snips, studies, you know,
single nucleotide protein or single, um,

695
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,210
you know, gene studies. But the stuff
around Mei was so well developed,

696
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:08,680
it's very clear that this,
you know,

697
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:12,730
probably about 10% of physical aggression
depending on whether or not you

698
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:16,870
believe the Dutch, um, knock outs.
There's a family. And in that,

699
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:17,950
that we study in,

700
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,210
in the Dutch population where the whole
family lacks this gene all together and

701
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:24,940
so they're really violent. There are
always causing arson and you know,

702
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,080
murder and all this kind of stuff.

703
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:31,240
And we do know from my snuck out studies
that this is really important. So,

704
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,520
um, those kinds of things
developmentally really matter.

705
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,090
The other piece that you add
about like, you know, the,

706
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,770
the Piaget and piece about understanding
yourself and understanding others and

707
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,990
perspective taking and how that matters.

708
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,650
I see that as the way in which various
aspects of education potentiate the

709
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:56,660
activation or the suppression of,
of not only genetic predispositions,

710
00:41:56,661 --> 00:42:00,650
but also the environmental contingencies
that interact with and control them.

711
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,700
And that's why that's the place where
I think education really matters.

712
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:07,160
And when I say education here,
I don't mean just sitting in school,

713
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,820
I'm in the ways in which you train
your own brain, not through what you,

714
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:14,800
not just what you read, but in social
interaction with other people. Um,

715
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,690
particularly, I mean, if you
really believe these studies,

716
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:21,140
which I do has a lot to do
with eye contact and the
way in which you're able to

717
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:23,630
have, um, um, perspective taking,

718
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:26,960
which allows for the emotional
recognition of somebody else's experience.

719
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,200
So it's about learning empathy and then
it can change the ways in particular in

720
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:35,900
which you see expressions of violence,
but other characteristics as well.

721
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:42,110
You had mentioned that in the Mri scan
there was sort of a indication towards a

722
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:46,350
reaction of fear towards risk
on the conservative side.

723
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:49,890
And then you've mentioned
discussed on the liberal side. Um,

724
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:53,520
how do you see that manifest in
political views on the liberal side?

725
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,050
I think it's not the only emotion. I
mean, I want to start out by saying that,

726
00:42:58,051 --> 00:42:59,340
but the way that I see it,

727
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,090
and sometimes I see it manifesting as
discussed and sometimes I see it as

728
00:43:03,091 --> 00:43:06,550
manifesting as contempt.
So it's this kind of, um,

729
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,510
it's not just that the
other side is misguided,

730
00:43:09,511 --> 00:43:12,750
but the other side is
somehow morally corrupt,

731
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,420
morally irresponsible.
Um,

732
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,630
the other thing I should say about the
insula is it's not just about disgust.

733
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,660
It also is about holding simultaneous
holding contradictory ideas

734
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,180
simultaneously.
So it's about complexity of thought.

735
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:31,170
And I do think that there's
lots of additional evidence
that shows that liberals

736
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:33,600
in general, um, uh,

737
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,990
tend to entertain a lot
more complexity of thought.

738
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:40,170
And that's not always necessarily a
good thing because what happens with

739
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:43,320
complexity of thought is you can
paralyze yourself, right? Like, well,

740
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:44,580
it could be this or it could be that,

741
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:48,030
or there's 18 other ways in which the
sub for, you know, the subtle form of it.

742
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,040
I mean,
you can see a lot of it in the debate.

743
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,390
She know where Hillary would be like,

744
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,410
and then there's point a and 0.8
has three sub points, you know, and,

745
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:58,950
and Trump would be like, it's sad, right?
So there's this very different kind of,

746
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,210
um, yeah, it's very, very different kinds
of approaches. So I want to say that,

747
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:06,010
that the insula has this other piece of,

748
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:10,590
but the way that I see the disgust coming
out is the unwillingness to see the

749
00:44:10,591 --> 00:44:14,810
other side or the other person as,
um,

750
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:20,570
a a moral being worthy of consideration
in the same way as another liberal.

751
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,030
Right. Um, so that there's this, um,

752
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,840
I'm not going to call it a failure of
empathy because it's not really about

753
00:44:27,841 --> 00:44:32,130
empathy. It's really more about,
um, subject object to, right.

754
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:36,810
So the way that I saw it in this last
election was a real disregard for class

755
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:38,400
considerations.
You know,

756
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:41,760
where you wouldn't see liberals
talking a lot about poor people.

757
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:45,420
So much as they were talking about
race and gender and sexuality,

758
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,900
you weren't hearing a lot about the
white working class who is suffering. Um,

759
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:53,430
not just from poverty,
but from, um, you know,

760
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,840
a whole bunch of other,
um,

761
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,860
cultural upheavals that felt real to them.

762
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:02,700
And because liberals didn't
consider that they should be real,

763
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,100
they weren't going to
be considered as much.

764
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:09,780
And I think that that's what ended up
biting us, you know, biting the, um, uh,

765
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,750
liberal, uh, supporters in the, but, um,

766
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,320
when that group really rose up and said,

767
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,420
I don't care that I'm
hurting my own self interest,

768
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:20,730
I just want to make sure
that you get hurt too. Right.

769
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:23,550
I'm going to take you down with me.
And I think that there's, there's that,

770
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,680
that failure of connection
and, and, um, um, uh,

771
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:30,780
equivalents of,
uh,

772
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,250
moral consideration of the other as a
subject and not just an object that is

773
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:38,580
what you see play out. I don't see
that as much on the conservative side,

774
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:40,980
but the fear thing is just activated.
I mean,

775
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:45,870
the Republican convention was like a
festival of fear. Everything was like,

776
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:48,490
be scared and then be more scared
and be more scared than that.

777
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:50,050
And then there's these other
things you thought about,

778
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,340
you know, like it was sort of a hysterical
fear. Um, and that was very, very,

779
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:58,000
very activated. And so that, that
was the way I saw it on both sides.

780
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,890
I was wondering if you had done any
research or had any thoughts on people who

781
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:06,390
find themselves politically opposed
to their parents and the rest of their

782
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:07,190
family?

783
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:11,090
Yeah, so, um, that's the most obvious
thing when you think about genetics. Like,

784
00:46:11,091 --> 00:46:14,120
well, if I'm not like my parents, then
how can I, you know, be like this.

785
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:17,540
And the way I think about is a friend of
mine who had a kid who had red hair and

786
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,310
was convinced that his wife had cheated.

787
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:24,250
And so he went out and forced her to
get a DNA test on the kid and, um,

788
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:27,590
it causes a divorce. And then as soon as
his mom came to help take care of them,

789
00:46:27,591 --> 00:46:29,810
cause the divorce was happening,
she go on and look at the kid and said,

790
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,410
oh my God,
that looks just like my grandfather.

791
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,280
Right. And what happened was he
had never known his grandfather,

792
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:39,400
but she had known the grandfather.
And so things skip generations.

793
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,010
It's true not just with
hair color and eye color,

794
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,370
but it's true with political ideology,
right? So we're not just our parents,

795
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,170
we are the sum of all of our
ancestors across multiple generations.

796
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:53,680
And so, um, if we're not like our parents,

797
00:46:53,681 --> 00:46:56,530
that doesn't necessarily mean that
there isn't a genetic component.

798
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,640
And part of how we know this is that
people look much more like their parents

799
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:01,870
till they leave the house.

800
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,320
And I think that that's because there's
a lot of socialization going on in the

801
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:09,820
house. It's not okay to not be what the
parents are, but once you go to college,

802
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,380
what you see is people
shifting dramatically and
they're actually shifting back

803
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:17,590
more toward their genetic predisposition.
And it's because, you know,

804
00:47:17,591 --> 00:47:19,020
the sort of the,
the,

805
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,470
the tamping socialization of the household
gets lifted and then you are what you

806
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:25,270
are.
And some of that is your parents,

807
00:47:25,271 --> 00:47:27,580
but your parents aren't just your
parents and your grandparents or great

808
00:47:27,581 --> 00:47:31,030
grandparents or great grip, you know,
and, and on back on through, you know,

809
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,800
multiple history and
these things have very,

810
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:37,120
very long history is 13% of the men on
the planet are direct descendants of

811
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,080
Ganga con.
Right?

812
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,350
I mean there's these really long
histories of particular kind of, um,

813
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,990
high reproductive, you
know, um, our strategy,

814
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:48,710
reproductive males.
Yes.

815
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:50,500
Oh,

816
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:55,500
going back to the question or the
observation of the emotions of let's say

817
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:59,520
contempt or, um, discussed, uh,

818
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:04,420
influencing or informing the,
the liberal perspective and fear,

819
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,450
primarily informing the conservative,
um,

820
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:12,750
imagine let's say a liberal work to
overcome those negative emotions and,

821
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,890
and really empathize and try to
understand the other point of view and,

822
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:22,000
and rise above it to let's say almost
a Buddhist or like what I mentioned the

823
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:25,630
Dalai Lama. Oh. Might be able to do, um,

824
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:30,200
when the result then still be
very liberal. I mean, isn't,

825
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,550
aren't the qualities of empathy and
understanding and compassion. Um,

826
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:38,750
what I'm getting at is I, I wonder
if I heard the hint of a, of a,

827
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,460
of an equivalents or positive
equivalents that, you know,

828
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,490
there's this negative thing
on the conservative side
and this negative thing on

829
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:46,324
the liberal side.

830
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:49,540
And I can imagine that it's attractive
to try to phrase things that way too.

831
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,450
You know, when the point of view
of trying to appear neutral,

832
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:57,820
but it seems that if we were to extend
this idea of just getting rid of the

833
00:48:57,821 --> 00:48:59,170
negative emotions altogether,

834
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,950
get rid of getting rid of the contempt
or the disgust and try to have

835
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:06,300
understanding where does that
lead politically? [inaudible]

836
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,860
okay. So I'm, I'm going to answer your
question the way I think about it,

837
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:12,500
which may not actually be what you mean.
Um,

838
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:17,840
so the way I think about these things is
from an evolutionary standpoint, and, um,

839
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,680
no society could exist if
we were just all liberals.

840
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,550
And the reason for that is that we'd
get predated by other people, right?

841
00:49:25,551 --> 00:49:28,010
There's always going to be
a few psychopaths out there,

842
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:33,050
even if you just understand that as
mutations of random stuff from nuclear

843
00:49:33,051 --> 00:49:34,220
fallout or whatever.
Right?

844
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,390
So if we want to protect ourselves
from the environment, from animals,

845
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:39,171
from other people,

846
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:42,770
we always need some number
of conservatives who are
going to be, you know,

847
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,470
lack of anything else really
good at combat, right?

848
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:50,570
Protecting the Ingroup outgroup
from our group. Um, attacks.

849
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,010
No,
similarly,

850
00:49:52,011 --> 00:49:55,880
no society could exist who is just
conservative because then there'd be no

851
00:49:55,881 --> 00:50:00,290
cooperation. Nobody to
build houses, organizations,
institutions, Google. Right. The,

852
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,740
it wouldn't exist. So you need
both of them. The problem is,

853
00:50:03,741 --> 00:50:07,790
is how to get that to happen
in concert. Um, I personally,

854
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,520
there's a big debate about
this in the literature,

855
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:14,900
but I believe that we learn to cooperate
because we needed to engage in conflict

856
00:50:14,901 --> 00:50:18,800
more effectively.
Combat is what taught people to cooperate.

857
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,130
In order to have effective combat against
the outgroup, you have to be really,

858
00:50:22,131 --> 00:50:25,160
really good at in group cooperation.
Those things happen together

859
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,590
in genetic senses. What's
that co what? What's that?

860
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,590
What that is called is
frequency dependent selection.

861
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,580
You have two different traits or n number,

862
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,570
different traits that have to remain
stable in the population over time or, um,

863
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,750
the overall society falls apart.

864
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:49,280
If you have a trait that's so successful,
it converges to universality.

865
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:52,190
Think about the fact that when you're
really scared, your vision gets better,

866
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:55,400
your hearing gets Burke better.
That's a trait that's so,

867
00:50:55,490 --> 00:51:00,170
that's so successful in the potentiating,

868
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:03,500
the survival of its possessors
that it converges to universality.

869
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,160
That's never going to happen with liberals
and conservatives because you need

870
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:07,994
both.

871
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,500
The problem has happened now is because
our societies are way bigger than how we

872
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:14,240
were. We grew up, right?

873
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:18,470
We grew up in communities of 150 people
where we knew everybody we could tell

874
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:22,160
who was cheating the system, we could
sanction who was cheating the system.

875
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:26,600
But we now have to apply that psychology
that's really built on 150 people to

876
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:28,220
320 million people.

877
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:32,840
And so all of a sudden that psychology
gets hijacked and thinks that the only

878
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:36,260
way we're gonna survive as if we destroy
all conservatives are if we destroy all

879
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:39,650
liberals, depending on where
we go, that's not gonna work.

880
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:46,390
What in my view is most likely to be
successful is to find ways in which we

881
00:51:50,121 --> 00:51:51,040
joined together.

882
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:56,050
Liberals and conservatives for
a larger goal like the nation,

883
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,650
right?
You can see it in the military,

884
00:51:57,651 --> 00:52:00,470
you can see it in some
places where you know,

885
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:05,360
you can see it in football
teams where race doesn't matter,

886
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:06,860
where ideology doesn't matter.

887
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:10,460
What matters is the particular
mission or the particular goal. Um,

888
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:15,410
and how we get there to a place of
tolerance and a place of recognizing the

889
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:18,830
value of each side I
think is a real challenge.

890
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:20,540
And I wish I knew how to get there.

891
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:25,370
And I'm working with some people
both politically as well as, um,

892
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:28,730
you know, academically to try
and think about ways to do that.

893
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:32,120
But it's a challenge for sure.
And I agree with you.

894
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:34,460
I think the Buddhist perspective
is the right perspective.

895
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:37,820
The problem is selling that perspective.
To a majority Christian country.

896
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,800
So some countries seem to tend
more conservative over time.

897
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,180
And you mentioned that the u s you know,

898
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,140
actually was liberal on
the overall spectrum. Yeah.

899
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,600
But there significant genetic differences.
I mean,

900
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,180
you could and you could imagine that
being the case because the US is a nation

901
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:54,750
of immigrants.

902
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,910
So, um, I, the answer,

903
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:01,840
I'm going to give you a sort of
half assed, which is that, um,

904
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,590
we don't have good genetic studies
of say Middle Eastern populations,

905
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:08,140
partly because we don't get in
there and do those populations.

906
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:10,420
So I don't know whether there's
genetic differences. Well,

907
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:13,780
we do have are these world value surveys
where you go around and ask people

908
00:53:13,781 --> 00:53:17,470
about their attitudes and
you get dramatic differences,

909
00:53:17,471 --> 00:53:19,810
especially on things related
to sex and reproduction.

910
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:22,750
So things like whether or
not homosexuality is okay,

911
00:53:22,751 --> 00:53:27,210
whether or not it's okay for women to
be independent financially or socially,

912
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:30,780
whether or not men or women should have
control of reproduction. Those things,

913
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:34,980
you get dramatic differences. The most
liberal countries are always Scandinavian,

914
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:35,191
right?

915
00:53:35,191 --> 00:53:39,840
It's always like Sweden and Norway and
Denmark and the US is actually not that

916
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,720
high. They are when you think
about it, because like for example,

917
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:46,950
there's still this thing and the United
States where most people kind of think

918
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:48,930
it's best if you get married
before you have kids.

919
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,930
The Scandinavians got rid of that
a long time ago, you know, um,

920
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,840
the worst countries by far always
the Middle Eastern countries. Um,

921
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,080
and so what that, how much of that is
socialized and how much of it is genetic?

922
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,440
We don't know cause I,
we haven't done the genetic work.

923
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,950
I will say that based
on the stuff you know,

924
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
that I've done with mio and the work that
I've seen done with women who survived

925
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:15,300
the family.

926
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,950
So there's a big study done with women
who survived the famine in 1944, nine,

927
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:22,500
9:43 AM nine 43 in the Netherlands.

928
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,620
And they've tracked their children now
through two generations because it was a

929
00:54:25,621 --> 00:54:29,910
terrible famine. And their children
tended to be really underweight.

930
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:34,170
And what they find is that those children
are differentially susceptible to

931
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:38,670
diabetes and being overweight
two generations later
because of huge changes in

932
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:43,350
genetic expression that allowed their
mothers to survive in a famine allowed

933
00:54:43,351 --> 00:54:44,880
them to survive at birth.

934
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:48,630
But then the minute you look at a Reese's
peanut butter cup, you have diabetes,

935
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:49,111
right?
I mean,

936
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:53,250
it's this thing that that has really good
survival advantage and then costs and

937
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:54,870
an environment of abundance,
right?

938
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:59,320
So if you look at those studies and you
think about the way that plays out, uh,

939
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,170
with things like mio,

940
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:06,210
I think if you have environments where
women are pregnant in conditions of

941
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:11,010
incredible deprivation, famine, war,
violence, they're raped, whatever,

942
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,170
and then they grow up,

943
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,040
those kids then grow up in environments
where most of their relatives are killed.

944
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:19,380
They, they're in constant bombing.
I mean, think about Syria.

945
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,370
It's going to cause the expression of
all those genes to get activated toward

946
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:27,330
higher levels of violence.
I think you're going to get what you see,

947
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,950
which is the intergenerational transfer
of only understanding violence as

948
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,050
appropriate conflict resolution.

949
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,860
So there's both social elements
of it and biological elements.

950
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,870
And I suspect that's what's going on.
So like,

951
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:43,710
my whole thing is you want to change
the outcome in the Middle East.

952
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:47,640
Maternal mount, you know,
maternal nutrition. Start
giving these people vitamins,

953
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:50,550
start getting them into safe
environments when they're pregnant.

954
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:51,930
Like that's the thing,
what you should do.

955
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,640
And everybody in the u s government
looks to me like I'm on drugs like,

956
00:55:56,641 --> 00:56:00,960
and what drug are you taking? You know?
Um, because they just think it's crazy.

957
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,910
But I do think that that's how,

958
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,560
that's the place you could intervene to
change it and it would be acceptable and

959
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:11,160
nobody minds being helped, right?
I mean, in that way. Um, so,

960
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:15,480
uh, but it's very hard to
convince people that that's the,

961
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:20,250
that's the right approach. It's
Wacky, right? It's also true, but, um,

962
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,250
that doesn't change the receptivity.

963
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,160
Thank you very much for speaking
with us today. Well, um,

964
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,630
hopes he have you back as your
research continues. Thank you.

965
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:35,520
[inaudible].
