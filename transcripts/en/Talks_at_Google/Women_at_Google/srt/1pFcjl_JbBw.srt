1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,580
I'd like to introduce Karen Page
and Andrew Doernenburg, um, to uh,

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,840
talk today where we're, we're going to
talk a little bit about their new book,

3
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:17,440
which is in front of me,
kitchen creativity, but this
is also their 11th book.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,420
And I've been using your
books for multiple years as
inspiration from when I was

5
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:27,260
first cooking, but also now to help
provide inspiration to our chefs, uh,

6
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,350
in our units around the world at Google.

7
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:32,830
So thank you first for being
here and making time to see us.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,000
It's a true pleasure,

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,820
but a little bit about authors
before we dive into the book.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,050
And we would like to make this
a, uh, kind of a conversation.

11
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:43,660
So as you have questions that come up,
typically leave it to the end,

12
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:46,330
but if there's something that you have a
tidbit you really want to get out there,

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,440
please let us know.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,830
We'd love to make this a conversation
and we're going to do a quick interview

15
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:53,080
and then we're going to break
into what we do at kitchen sink,

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,660
which is our teaching kitchen. And we're
going to do some cooking and chef, dd.

17
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:59,860
And the team are going to put together
a delicious treat and you look at the

18
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:04,660
sample it. So that's always a plus. Um, so
a little bit about, uh, about our authors.

19
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:06,340
So, uh, for Karen on my right here,

20
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:09,640
after skipping a grade care and
received her letter of admissions to

21
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:14,270
Northwestern, university of age 16,
the first person to do the whole thing.

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,160
And I know, right? Well you're the
first person to attend college, um,

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,550
self financed your education, uh,
with seven academic scholarships.

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,970
Super Cool. Uh, you ran your own
birthday cake delivery business.

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,440
Love to hear more about that.
Later on,

26
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,490
you were awarded a Ba in economics and
certified in the women's studies from

27
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:37,960
Northwestern university and he three
named one of six honorable mentions and

28
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:41,800
glamorous top 10 college women competition
and featured on the cover of Newsweek

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,660
as well.

30
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,590
You were invited to the White House twice
back in [inaudible] 86 you also earn

31
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:50,980
an Mba from Harvard business
school, uh, Northwestern named you.

32
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:55,390
And then you three, one
of the universities, 100
leading professional alumni.

33
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,890
Congratulations, council
of 100 right on, uh,

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,970
an avid meditator. Uh, you both like
to run. Uh, interesting to hear that.

35
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,630
And you live in New York City with
your husband to your right. Andrew.

36
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,800
So welcome Karen, great
to have you here. And uh,

37
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,890
Mr Andrew grew up in the bay area here.

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,270
Great to see another bay area
I individual. Um, and you,

39
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:19,120
you kind of transitioned from farmland
to suburbs, so your families, uh, um,

40
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,700
background and backyard
had a lot of trees. You're
obviously into gardening and,

41
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:28,690
and kind of led you into the culinary
world where you started cooking at a young

42
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,770
age.
And uh,

43
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:34,600
you were mentioned as first cooking at
Mcdonald's in your early years as well

44
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:35,321
as,
uh,

45
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,800
one of the few like Jeff Bezos and others
and also worked at Mcdonald's doing

46
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:43,490
quite well. Now from a time
you're adulation. Cute. Everyone,

47
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,490
everyone has their, their start
somewhere. That's awesome. Uh,

48
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,690
three days out of high school
you became a firefighter. Um,

49
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:53,460
so obviously with the amazing devastation
and in northern California with the

50
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,590
fires lately, um, it's great
to see that you were, um,

51
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,330
putting in your dues early on,

52
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:02,370
but at the same time found that
after awhile a firefighting was, uh,

53
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,320
even though it was your best
day of putting out fires
and cooking for the team,

54
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,250
your best days ahead, we're really getting
into the kitchen, see, became a chef.

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,810
You worked in some amazingly
talented, uh, restaurants, um,

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,950
worked under some top
chefs and then after, uh,

57
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,860
deciding to leave the kitchen. So you
worked with lady a shower for a while,

58
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,723
for a while,

59
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,050
decided to leave the kitchen and then I
ended up putting together some amazing

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,390
books that we're going to
talk about in a moment.

61
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,300
You also earned your som certificate.
Interesting Tidbit and sure,

62
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,900
yes, yes. At the same time.
No, at different times.

63
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,560
I think it's an important part of
anybody's culinary education. Absolutely.

64
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,050
Absolutely worthwhile.

65
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,360
And then, um, interesting, uh,
piece as well as you followed a,

66
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,090
your was it your grandmother's left for,
to photography and d might run,

67
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:52,110
mother actually had a dark room,
which you probably have no idea. Yes.

68
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,960
But it was a place where
you developed film,

69
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:58,730
which you probably have no idea what,
that there was a time where that happened.

70
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,960
Yes. That's my fault. So you and you
did all the photographs for the buck,

71
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:04,680
is that correct? For this one or this
one then? Vege Flavor Bible. Yeah,

72
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,930
that's right. Yeah. So Ma Ma multitalented
individual Sarah on the room. Indeed.

73
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,000
So it, it's, it's my distinct pleasure and
total excitement. I can't say it enough.

74
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:16,620
We talked to ned copy for the last
hour and how excited I was to,

75
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:19,030
to see you guys here.
Please welcome her authors.

76
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,360
[inaudible]

77
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,990
I can't have to interject by
saying, first of all, Scott,

78
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:28,790
thank you for that and
amazing introduction.

79
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,380
I was worried we're going to be here for
hours if you're starting out just like

80
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,560
Steve, but that was lovely. Um,

81
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,520
but the reason that we're here is
actually because of this man. And, um, we,

82
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,960
I haven't had the pleasure of meeting him
in person before, but, um, we have been,

83
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,740
uh, in the email and email
touch and in virtual touch, um,

84
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,940
ever since he gave this
wonderful interview to this
national magazine where he

85
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:55,820
mentioned one of our books,
his, uh, his, uh, favorite book,

86
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,290
which we actually got to see today,

87
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,600
which was thrilling and
it gets bound together.

88
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,610
What were you describing
with butcher string?

89
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,150
Yeah, so kind of fallen
apart. This is priceless.

90
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:08,610
So if anyone tries to take this from me,
good luck.

91
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,990
This is the first edition culinary router
street and it is in the same condition

92
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:17,580
as it was 17 years ago when you signed it.
It was literally signed in 2000.

93
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,240
And it was a book that I used,
um,

94
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,600
for inspiration on a day to day
level when I was writing menus.

95
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,220
And we're going to talk about how chefs
and gain their inspiration and I'll call

96
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,540
Ariens and, and even home chefs,
home cooks gain their inspiration.

97
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,200
And there's such a variety of
techniques in becoming creative.

98
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,690
But this book is something
that's very near and dear to me.

99
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
And when I brought it out to Andrew
when he was dining at our restaurant,

100
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,130
I humbly said it's, it's getting used as
you can see the binding's falling off.

101
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,880
So my only feedback for the publisher
is a stronger binding here cause the

102
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:52,520
butcher's twine is not quite
working or duct tape included.
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

103
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,890
But inspiration,

104
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:57,350
I mean part of our inspiration for being
here is really Scott and the amazing

105
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:00,830
reputation that Google has
for its culinary program.

106
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:05,350
And to know that you've been here for
how many years now is it both your,

107
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,990
that you have helped to have a raise it
to a really a world class level when you

108
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:17,460
started out there was just
I think a handful of cafes
and now, you know, they're,

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,980
they are all over the world.
Um,

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,600
but for those of us who've never eaten
any Google before, this is a first,

111
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,593
um,

112
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,330
to know that it is legendary in
terms of the choices available,

113
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:33,320
the quality of the food and now being
here at this wonderful new location that

114
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:38,120
we understand just opened, um, a
matter of weeks ago. Really. Um, it's,

115
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,690
it's something that gets us on a plane
from New York City to come out to the bay

116
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:45,980
area to see what it's all about. And
the fact that we, if we had any role,

117
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,940
um, the most, my new role and,
and being an inspiration to you,

118
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,510
then we're thrilled to be able to be,

119
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,690
to be here with all the Googlers for
the first time. So thanks for having me.

120
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,390
I often talk about, um, your books.

121
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,340
Obviously this has just
been released a week ago.

122
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:01,740
So many of you probably
you're flipping through it,

123
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,340
but a lot of your books
follow that same thing theme,

124
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,390
which is to really unlock the creativity
and the potential in chefs' minds.

125
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:12,090
And again, whether it's a professional
chef or whether it's shops at home.

126
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,310
And what I found that these books are so
amazing at is I always say it's hard to

127
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,980
plan to be creative on a specific day.
You know,

128
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,780
you can book the time in
your calendar and say,

129
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:25,170
on Wednesday I'm going to write a menu.
But you know, you don't feel well,

130
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:27,540
the weather's bad. Something comes
up in the news and you're just,

131
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,470
you're not feeling it.

132
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,690
Tell me how this book is helping chefs
and individuals kind of overcome that.

133
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:35,550
There's,
there's a lot of great pieces in there,

134
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:39,210
but maybe unpack a little bit of some of
the initial thoughts that you put into

135
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:44,211
this book to help chefs and home chefs
really kind of get that creative edge and

136
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:46,080
bring their best forward.

137
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,510
Well, I think it's true that
for any of those who cook,

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,240
whether it's at home or professionally,
um,

139
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,480
you're always looking for inspiration
and there's a lot of sameness.

140
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:59,840
Otherwise it takes place when you're
making the same thing day in and day out.

141
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,440
So if you can learn to bring
creativity or you're cooking,

142
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,720
it's going to add that
much more enjoyment to you,

143
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:09,920
to everybody that you're cooking
for and with. Um, but beyond that,

144
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,900
it's really a matter of the creativity
is the most important skill that we can

145
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:15,950
possibly have.

146
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,700
And so if you can learn the skill of
creativity from the world's best chefs,

147
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:22,560
what better way to learn it? We had, um,

148
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,200
done research on the fact that CEOs are
saying that the number one skill for

149
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:31,400
success in leadership and in businesses
creativity, it's not integrity,

150
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,170
it's not global thinking, which
is a little interesting. Um,

151
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,670
but the fact that it's
creativity makes it a study,

152
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,730
a subject that's worth
studying. And so, uh,

153
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:45,500
we also realized that the only one in
four people survey say that they think

154
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,120
that they're at their creative potential.

155
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,150
So to the extent that we
can become more creative,

156
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:52,160
it's something we can
apply to our daily lives.

157
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,230
It's something we can
imply it in the kitchen.

158
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,800
And so what we did with kitchen creativity
is we wanted to create the ultimate

159
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:02,100
culinary brainstorming tool.
So if you want to be more creative,

160
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,700
what are some of the things that you can
use some of the best practices and used

161
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:09,540
by the world's best chefs to become
more creative and really, um,

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,380
we map out the process of creativity,
which I know we're going to get into, but,

163
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,810
um, both in a general way. Um,

164
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,440
in terms of culinarily coming up
with a new dish, I'm trying to, uh,

165
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,970
take old dishes and make them new again.
Um,

166
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,800
but then also from just a
best practices standpoint,

167
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:28,680
how do you let your creativity flow?

168
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:32,250
And we've got some advice from some of
the leading creativity experts in the

169
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,440
world talking about how
to make that happen.

170
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,350
Yeah. It so don't, don't downplay that.
I think one of the things that, uh,

171
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,600
gotten me excited about culinary artist
for me when I looked at a years ago was

172
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:45,720
the pedigree of chefs you have in
your, in your back pocket. I mean,

173
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,630
I'm interested to hear how you informed,

174
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,600
is it some of the initial relationship
with these shops and when you're talking

175
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,900
about every top shop out there,
whether it's Danco repair, uh,

176
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,060
Danny Meyer's restaurant,

177
00:09:56,061 --> 00:10:01,061
or you've got amazing chefs that are
taking their time to share some of their

178
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:04,820
most intimate secrets on what's
made them successful. Um,

179
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,760
and I don't take that lightly and none
of our chefs at Google that do such an

180
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,060
amazing job and bringing the food
program to live here. Do either,

181
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,870
I mean these are the inspirational
chefs that they look to aspire to be.

182
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,390
What were some of the initial,
how did that happen?

183
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:20,400
Like what was that first chef you're like,
oh my God,

184
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:21,234
if I could just get this right.

185
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,000
How did that go about? When we started
out, we had never written a book before.

186
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,730
And so how do you get the world's
best chefs to talk to you?

187
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,511
We didn't really know,

188
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:33,230
but the ace in our home was that Andrew
was working as a professional chef in

189
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,650
Boston and he was working with
Chris Schlesinger and Lidia Shyer,

190
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:39,950
who at the time or two of the best chefs
in the country who happened to be in

191
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:41,180
Boston.
And so having,

192
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,110
starting out with the two of them
and then he went on to work with Anne

193
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,600
Rosenzweig at a Arcadia in New York City.

194
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,580
And once we had the three
of them in our pocket,

195
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:53,570
we can kind of go to people because there
was three big names that they knew us

196
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,600
personally. They had some belief
that we could actually write a book.

197
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,650
And so they thought,
well,

198
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:01,040
if Lydia is Ann and Chris isn't an
ANZ and then you know, I'm into.

199
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,470
So from there we went to other top chefs
in Boston, in New York. From then, um,

200
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:07,820
we were doing the research
on weekends and evenings.

201
00:11:07,821 --> 00:11:11,390
We would travel to San Francisco
and knocking Gary Danko store.

202
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,090
Actually he would also
work with metal in it,

203
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:16,600
that Matt and Cam and the up at the
school for American chefs at or vineyards

204
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,720
where Gary, when Gary Danco,

205
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,150
we met others. Jeff's through her too. But
the key is Karen writes a great letter.

206
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,180
That's how you do. She goes, well, we
just interviewed these other people.

207
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:30,040
Would you like to be
included in our new book?

208
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,590
And even though they didn't know us,
they knew the other people. It's like,

209
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,820
and also asking for 15 minutes
who only need 15, 20 minutes.

210
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,250
And that always almost always turned
into an hour. And I'll never forget,

211
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,620
we interviewed the chef Barbara Tropp,
a legendary restaurant tour shaft,

212
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,990
China Moon Cafe in San Francisco.
And at the end we,

213
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,190
we talked to her for like
almost an hour and a half years.

214
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,270
I've never had a conversation like
this and we're like neither of weight.

215
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,390
And then she says, well, try
not to edit my words too much,

216
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,180
where like you went to Princeton,
you're good.

217
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,480
Yes, she's spoken poetry.
Just an amazing woman,

218
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:12,590
founder of the women chefs
and Restaurateurs Association
that we talked about is

219
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:15,980
near and dear to Dee and myself
as a former board member of that.

220
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:18,800
So I think once you kind of get started,
then it,

221
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:22,880
it easier to get the ball rolling. And
that's true of any aspect of creativity.

222
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,830
Um, the good to quote, it's like, you
know, whatever you can imagine, um,

223
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,410
and I won't get the words
right, but, uh, you know, be
bold, take action, and then it,

224
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:35,510
it really has a magic to it
that really starts to unfold.

225
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:38,480
So once you take action in a certain
direction, we talk in the book,

226
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:40,430
there's an atcs,
that section of the book,

227
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,040
the back of the book is
laid out like Flavor Bible.

228
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,760
If any of you are familiar with that where
it's a three column format, uh, a to z.

229
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:50,270
But instead of flavors, we have apples
to Zucchini in the flavor Bible.

230
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,420
We have every other topic under
the sun from architecture to um,

231
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,080
Alice in wonderland, Alice in wonderland.
There's actually a restaurant based on

232
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,450
some wonderland, the book. And we
actually finished up with a yoga,

233
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,450
Rick Bayless of the frontier grill and
Taco Bompo restaurant of the year on the

234
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:10,284
James Beard Award.

235
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,930
He's been doing yoga for 20 years and
this is what's fun about knowing these

236
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,320
people for so long. It's like, hey
Rick, would you mind, you know,

237
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,740
doing a yoga pose for us.

238
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,940
So is did his chef's jacket and he was
pops up on the counter and does yoga for

239
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:22,774
us.

240
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,360
He's amazing for as long as we've known
him because we interviewed Rick Bayless

241
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:29,930
for all of our books. We had never
seen him do this amazing pose before.

242
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,230
But you know,
anyone's multitalented as you,

243
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,710
as Rick who has been doing yoga for 20
years, it's um, it's pretty awesome.

244
00:13:36,711 --> 00:13:40,490
So what an inspiration to talk to
chefs in it. And again, you know,

245
00:13:40,491 --> 00:13:43,490
when you're talking to chefs for your
11th book as opposed to your first book,

246
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,440
it's a whole different
ballgame because they,

247
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:48,140
you built up a certain level
of knowledge and trust.

248
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,340
And so we were talking to people about
what inspires them and they went a little

249
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,320
rogue with that. Went there, went there.
And you can tell us quite honestly,

250
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,150
you know,
I look at my ingredients,

251
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:02,750
I talked to my ingredients and so I'll
take an apple and I'll put it in the

252
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,950
center of the table and I'll have a
conversation with the apple and say, okay,

253
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:08,570
yeah, Paul, what are we going to do today?

254
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,300
You've done some interesting things
before, but what are we going to do today?

255
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,450
And that there's this level of intuition.
You could call it mediumship,

256
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,810
channeling, whatever you want to call
it, that that takes place. And, uh,

257
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:22,310
we were talking about the most
respected chefs in the country.

258
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:26,600
So Jose and is based in Washington, DC.
We'll talk to his ingredients. He said,

259
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:29,510
if you talk to your ingredients,
they will always tell you a story.

260
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,120
You just have to have your
ears open to hear that story.

261
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,240
Guy Olivera who just won the James
Beard award this year is the best, uh,

262
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,540
outstanding pastry chef
in the United States.

263
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,510
She's the one who puts the apple and
the parchment paper in the center and

264
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:45,190
Restaurant Danielle in New York City
and says, talk to me, apple, um,

265
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,050
to Phillip Foss from El Ideas in Chicago.

266
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,860
Phillip Foss. He's great. Uh, this is
a very fascinating restaurant. It's,

267
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,020
it's in a loft way out in the middle of
nowhere. They say, take a car, you know,

268
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,110
don't take public transportation.
Um, but he will say,

269
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,770
the ingredient is my child and I want my
child to succeed and be happy and it's

270
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:11,390
up to me to care for the child and, and
make sure it's a physically, emotionally,

271
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,890
and mentally and spiritually happy.

272
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,550
So he treats his ingredients like
the children and raises them again,

273
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:21,551
has that conversation and he has the
craziest menu I think I've ever seen.

274
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,950
He will do a menu based on the 80s he
will produce a dish and play a certain

275
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,630
piece of music that is inspired by.
Okay.

276
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,070
Madonna is like a virgin. Like what? Yeah,
that was for the Ada that he'll serve.

277
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,510
Um,
cocaine,

278
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,540
which is basically a lime and coconut
powder on a mirror with the razor blade is

279
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:45,890
Michelin Star restaurant. I
hear that he's, he's out there,

280
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:49,910
but he's got a Michelin
Star. He's respected, he's so
celebrated. And so, you know,

281
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,010
there are chefs out
there who are creative.

282
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,860
They're pushing the envelope and they're
doing a lot of things that are a lot of

283
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,590
fun. And you might not serve
exactly the same things at home,

284
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:01,170
but you can be inspired by the
thought process. He does a job.

285
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,910
He does a dish of
frosties and French fries,

286
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,900
which was inspired by his daughters as
a single dad for a while and raising his

287
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,960
kids and the babysitter took them to
Wendy's where they learned to dip there.

288
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,270
Did anybody do that?
If their French fries and cross,

289
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,640
did you ever have it in a
Michelin starred restaurant?

290
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,930
If you go to El Ideas in Chicago,
you can taste it there.

291
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,050
So, um, what, what I love
about these books again is it,

292
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,820
it's caters to a variety of audiences.

293
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:28,760
You've got people that are
cooking at home, you've got
people that are beginning,

294
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,440
beginning to look,
cook or learning to cover.

295
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:32,240
You've got people that are
cooking for many years. And I,

296
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,710
what I love about this in essence is
it's very similar to our program here is

297
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,870
we're really trying to enable people
to pick up skills and give them the

298
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:41,480
competence. And um, when you,
when you dive into the book,

299
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:44,250
you're going to see that the quotes
in here are not only from some of the,

300
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:46,040
the biggest and baddest names out there,

301
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,640
but they're the really great tidbits
that really helps unpack what they're

302
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,070
thinking in their thought process.
So let's think,

303
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,320
let's talk a little bit about the book.
So the book is very interesting.

304
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:57,720
This is a book of no recipes.
Um, this is a book of,

305
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,550
and thank you because there's a lot of
recipes out there, but it's really around,

306
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,060
um, uh, a few different aspects. So
you start the book around mastery.

307
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,120
And so there's a section on that
which I'd love to talk about briefly.

308
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,510
And then section two is more around
alchemy and the transformation stage.

309
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,300
And then number three is around
really that creativity aspect,

310
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,340
which obviously is the bulk of it.
Can you,

311
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,210
can you talk about the three
different sections, uh,

312
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,920
briefly so we can kind of
get an understanding of why
you went back direction?

313
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,950
Um, and then what we'll
bring in some examples?

314
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,230
Sure. Um, well we start out
with mastery because it's,

315
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:31,080
Picasso lets us know you can't break
the rules unless you knew what the rules

316
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:33,750
are. So you start out by
understanding the rules.

317
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:38,130
And the way to do that is really
to learn to think like a chef shop,

318
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:41,730
like a chef in season, like a chef. And
so in terms of thinking like a chef,

319
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:46,731
we have done lots of research on the
leading books that chef's everywhere say

320
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,020
that you should have in your
culinary library at home.

321
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,010
We've narrowed it down to the 20 top
books and if you read these books,

322
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:54,750
if you really absorbed that information,

323
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:58,020
you're going to know what the best chefs
know and that will give you a starting

324
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:02,130
point in terms of knowledge,
in terms of skill you want to learn to.

325
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,390
Well actually one of the things
that's important with the chefs is,

326
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:09,391
and the shopping aspect of this shopping
is a skill that if you are willing to

327
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:13,770
invest in the same level of ingredients
that the best chefs work with,

328
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,680
you're not going to have the same results.
Um,

329
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,310
sometimes the hardest part is
figuring out where do you buy it. Um,

330
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,800
and chefs have already done that hard
work for you to find the very best of the

331
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:23,581
best ingredients.

332
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:27,330
We have a list of the purveyors that
provide chest with some of the, uh,

333
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,950
hard to find ingredients, spices,
herbs, seasonings, things as,

334
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,330
yes, yeah, lots of grains and
flours. They don't want the, their,

335
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,260
their polenta milled a certain way or
their flour mill the certain way. And so,

336
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:43,320
um, we've got a guide to
where to shop like a chef.

337
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,300
And then in terms of seasoning,
like a chef,

338
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:48,600
I mean that's really what we were
talking about it in culinary artistry.

339
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:52,020
So many years ago when we
banished chefs to a desert island,

340
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,720
asked them to bring only 10 ingredients
that they we cook with for the rest of

341
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,090
their life.
The number one ingredient was salt.

342
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,940
And Salt is really the master technique.

343
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:03,190
All the chefs in the room are nodding
their heads like, yes, of course. Um,

344
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,890
but to learn to add sodium to addition
a way that enhances flavor without

345
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:12,420
necessarily adding flavor, which we get
into in the alchemy stage of things.

346
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:16,620
But um, there it gets a little
more complicated than beyond,

347
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:19,990
above and beyond the Flavor Bible.
We talk about different elements of salts.

348
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:23,520
So not just which salty different
chefs use. Some use sea salt,

349
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:28,230
some use mind salt, some use,
you know, pink salts, you know,

350
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,060
there different salts
for different purposes.

351
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,820
And thinking more specifically
about the salt you use,

352
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,530
adding and adding not only sodium,

353
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:39,000
but in some cases who mommy threw
a salty ingredient or um, other,

354
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,910
uh, ingredients that are complex that
will add more than one. Taste. It once.

355
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,640
If you learn how to work with them,
it can really elevate your cooking.

356
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,460
We talked to one chef, um, the
other night in New York City,

357
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:53,580
we did an event and he was talking about
the fact that he was actually ran out

358
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:57,060
of salt, which was like the first
chef I've ever heard. But it happens,

359
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,860
that's the exact reaction
run out of it at the restaurant.

360
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:06,450
But at home he opened up his refrigerator
at home and he had fed a cheese there.

361
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,010
So you took the liquid from the federal,

362
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:12,360
which is salty and he used that as
sort of a liquid salt ad hoc and only,

363
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,370
you know, it's a, it just one
of those things that it's like,

364
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:17,550
well of course you could use salty
ingredients. It doesn't have to be solved.

365
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,240
And I think part of what cook kitchen
creativity is all about is how can you

366
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:24,360
open your mind to thinking not
about specific ingredients,

367
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:27,750
but think of concepts that you're adding
to a dish and to use it and really

368
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:28,820
extrapolate from there.

369
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,210
It's interesting to think through the
whole aspect of just seasoning because

370
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:34,190
people think, oh, you just have
solvents done. Well there's,

371
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,650
there's types of salters
layering when to add the salt,

372
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:38,630
when to add it and not getting
in the end of the fucking light.

373
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,940
And these are the tips that are within
the book that really helped, um, uh,

374
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,810
a good shot, become a great chef and a
great chat, become an excellent chef,

375
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:48,980
whether again, you're home
chef or not. Um, so the,

376
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,120
the first day just mastery in it, you
made it very clear that, you know,

377
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:55,510
and all the chefs had this in the book
that to be able to master anything,

378
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:58,270
it's a lot of practice, a lot of
discipline. It's a lot of time.

379
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,680
And once you understand the rules,
then you can attempt to break the rules.

380
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:04,780
And then I think it kind of
takes you to that next step.

381
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,720
So talk a little about the next section,
which is around that transformation,

382
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:08,770
that alchemy stage.

383
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,280
That's the stage that we really been
writing about and talking about four years

384
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:15,680
now under the guise of culinary artistry,

385
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:18,050
the Flavor Bible and what
to drink with what you eat.

386
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:21,470
So I'll give me is really about how do
you take something common and turn it

387
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:22,730
into something precious.

388
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,590
And what we mean by that is that there
is a benefit in the culinary world that

389
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:29,330
one plus one doesn't equal two.

390
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:32,810
There are instances in which one
plus one can equal three or more.

391
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,670
And what we have dedicated our research
too over the years is trying to identify

392
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,100
what is the lock that you can put there,

393
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:42,980
the key that you can put into the
lock to really turn it to unlock the

394
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,960
deliciousness of particular ingredients,

395
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:50,170
whether they're herbs or spices or other
seasonings for specific ingredients or

396
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,810
is, and this is what led
us both to some ace school,

397
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:57,980
is realizing that if you've got a
perfect plate of food in front of you and

398
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:01,160
you've got the wrong wine in your glass,
when you have the two together,

399
00:22:01,161 --> 00:22:04,730
which you inevitably do because you eat
and drink together, it's going to clash.

400
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,530
It's going to ruin the food.
So we,

401
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,630
we became committed to studying wine and
earning our Sameei certificates because

402
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,720
it was so important to me.

403
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,550
Is it a mass part is an
important way to master flavor.

404
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:21,230
And that was the best means that we had
to be able to train our palettes and to

405
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:25,850
learn more about what, what was the secret
to matching the best wines with food.

406
00:22:25,851 --> 00:22:29,210
And so we also interviewed dozens of the
best someways all across the country,

407
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:30,800
including it,

408
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,120
some of the top restaurants and people
that you're well acquainted with and

409
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,460
really compiled that into what
to drink with what you eat,

410
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:41,150
which is the ultimate food
and wine pairing guide.

411
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,960
Because you can look up the food, it
will tell you what wine or beer, spirits,

412
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:48,920
cocktails, water, coffee,
tea or etc. To drink with it,

413
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:51,560
to enhance the flavor of that food.
Vice versa.

414
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:54,260
If you're starting with a bottle of wine,
you're starting with a beer,

415
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:55,400
you're starting with something else,

416
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,750
what food can you serve with it to best
enhance what's in the bottle or what's

417
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:03,230
in the glass. And so when you bring
all of those elements together,

418
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,840
that's what really what we're
talking about in terms of alchemy.

419
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:10,010
If you master some of the principles
of what are the key flavor pairings,

420
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:13,040
what are the key, you know, so the,
some of those standard, you know,

421
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:17,270
son Sarah Oysters or peanut
and Anwar and salmon. Um,

422
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,860
if you master some of those,

423
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,270
it gets you so close to the ballpark
that you could actually be only okay chef

424
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:24,590
with a modicum of talent.

425
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,620
But if you understand those principles
and can apply them in the kitchen,

426
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,800
it's going to make you
shine to a whole new level.

427
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,551
Yeah,
and I always,

428
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:35,210
we always talk about thinking about
what's in the glass as a sauce also.

429
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,770
And again,
you know,

430
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,240
a really easy way to do that quick
tool as if it grows together,

431
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:42,074
it goes together.

432
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,950
So if you're in Italy and you're
making pasta from northern Italy,

433
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,690
see what they drink in northern Italy,

434
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,770
if you're in the bay area and
you're grilling a steak or gosh,

435
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,480
I have a bottle of this end,
you know,

436
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,850
the right there in Napa valley and
they're all next to each other.

437
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,940
There's a natural synergy.
But also I think it's also funded,

438
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,410
and just wrap this part up a little bit,
is that it's not just wine.

439
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,470
You can,

440
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,570
you have a lemon soda with a salad and
that could almost be your dressing on a

441
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:12,560
salad. So you think outside just
the classic pairings. And like,

442
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:16,760
we all know that you can actually
drink white wine with many things.

443
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:19,760
You can actually drink red
wine with fish now it's okay.

444
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,960
Peanut and Warren Salmon. So think
you know, of all the beverages,

445
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,700
what do you can bring in?
And again,

446
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:30,701
that's going to change a of meals
just by having the proper beverage.

447
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,780
You know, that's, that's the three there.

448
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,240
I think you hit on a lot of a lot of
key points and it goes much deeper than

449
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:40,810
just the actual dish itself. It goes to
what's being paired at your surrounding.

450
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:45,460
And it creates that experience that if
any of you think about your most epic

451
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,420
food experience you've ever had,
it couldn't be a hotdog at the ballpark.

452
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,870
It could be at a Michelin Star restaurant.

453
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,420
There's different things
that all came together.

454
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,640
Absolutely a great culinary and
makes that look so easy. And Zach,

455
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,280
a lot of these tips are in the book
and so it's super, super exciting.

456
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,040
There's a great quote in the book and it
starts off by saying, um, you know, to,

457
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,070
to not copy other shots, but
to be able to get inspired. I,

458
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:13,300
and many others feel that copying
is actually the gateway to get into.

459
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,760
Can you speak to that because
it's kind of a contradiction,

460
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:16,840
but it actually makes total sense.

461
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,620
Yeah. Smell that that's
sort of the, the, you know,

462
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,160
Hook in the beginning of the book is
talking about we want to teach you

463
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:26,910
creativity. What's the definition
of creativity? It's not copying,

464
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:31,911
coming up with something that's
new and useful and surprising.

465
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,510
And yet by definition, how do you get
to that point of being able to do it?

466
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:39,030
You need to learn the rules.
How do you learn the rules you'd copy.

467
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,400
So that's the push me pull you.

468
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:45,960
And I think that that is a lesson that
comes through time and time again in the

469
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:50,090
book and that it's never one or the
other. It's never a hot versus cold. It's,

470
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,180
it's both. And, and we talk, um,

471
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,890
in the back of the book under why you'll
find yes and being one of the key rules

472
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:57,600
that you need to master for creativity.

473
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,600
And if it's the first
rule of improvisation,

474
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,820
if you've ever done any
improvisational acting,

475
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,550
you know that if someone
says something like, okay,

476
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,030
here's the premise of this scene,
I'm going to walk in and you know,

477
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:11,760
I dropped the book on the floor.
Uh, you don't say, oh no, no, no,

478
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:14,700
you didn't drop the book. You'd have
to say yes, you dropped the book.

479
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,210
And that was the book that I was on,
the wait list for it. The library.

480
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:19,820
It's like yes.
And um,

481
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,660
that was the book that my
ex boyfriend actually wrote.

482
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:26,940
And you,
you add onto the story.

483
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,990
So you always add onto it because
you never want to break that chain.

484
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,160
So the key that you can take from the
improvisation or rules and to apply in the

485
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:38,880
kitchen is, or no matter what happens,
you trust that it's there to serve you.

486
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:42,690
And it's for a reason. And what we
tell people is, it kind of goes,

487
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,880
if you at in the beginning of the book,

488
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:49,110
there's a list of ingredient of different
classic dishes and what their origins

489
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:51,930
were. And a lot of times
they came from mistakes.

490
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,820
So there was something that went wrong.
You know,

491
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:58,020
the Burrito Burrito gets knocked into
the deep fat fryer. Hey Jimmy. John Goes,

492
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,380
or the, the Ravioli gets knocked
into the deep fat fryer. Hey,

493
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:05,010
toasted Ravioli turns into a thing.
People love it. So it's never,

494
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,610
things are never really mistakes
that if you pay attention to it,

495
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:10,950
and so it pressman and
wolves in San Francisco,

496
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,810
the intern under cooks the egg
that you asked her to hard boil.

497
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:19,350
It's soft boil. It oozes out. Wait
a second, that's kind of cool.

498
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,270
And you find out that people love
things that who's out of other things,

499
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,750
all the secrets out of our,
our mistakes,

500
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,230
right? I think front Adria talks in
the book about the fact that, um, you,

501
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,830
if you're unique and if you're doing
something innovative that no one else has

502
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:37,310
done before and you're not copying,

503
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:39,310
and then no one can really
judge it against anything else.

504
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:40,870
And I think that's a good point.

505
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:44,410
But you cannot go that direction unless
you've got the understanding of the

506
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:46,030
technique and the master to begin with.

507
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,850
And obviously if Rhonda is one of
the most acclaimed chefs out there,

508
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:50,410
and so he can,
he can easily pull that off.

509
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:54,010
But I think it's a great testament to
get inspired by seeing what other people

510
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:58,390
do, have conversations, whatever your
inspiration is this the document you do,

511
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:02,320
you have a lot of great tips in the book
around how do you capture that moment

512
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:04,450
of creativity?
It's about always being positive.

513
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:07,420
It's about surrounding yourself
with others on great conversations.

514
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:10,420
It's about writing things down.
And you know, most most chefs,

515
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:12,620
great chefs have either
a, you know, a pocket book

516
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,280
and a notebook right by the
bedside because Brian, you wait

517
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,140
cup sometimes you've had this
amazing thought. Or for me it's,

518
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:22,800
if I exercise it's like I get that mom
moment of that would work and they,

519
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:23,011
you know,

520
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:25,830
you have to write it down and it's
about all these great little tips that

521
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,580
sometimes are not revolutionary. It's
just, yes, this makes total sense.

522
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:33,390
Let's do this more often. And you can
take that outside the kitchen as well.

523
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:33,801
Yes.

524
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:36,920
And that was one of the benefits of being
able to do book number 11 is because

525
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:40,940
chefs were really up front with us about
their creative process involving, um,

526
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:43,340
in a lot of cases,
a personal reflection time.

527
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:46,220
So whether that was through
journaling or through meditation,

528
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:49,040
we found out that a lot of the chefs
we've been talking to for years where

529
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:52,880
you're very deep meditators, um, talk
with Eric repair of Laverne or down,

530
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:57,020
which is on the world's
50 best restaurants list
about his Tibetan Buddhist

531
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,270
meditation practice that he credits as a
source of his creativity. Mario Batali,

532
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:07,100
who was studied TM after being recommended
to it by Jerry Seinfeld of all people.

533
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,650
Um, and so he studied through the
David Lynch Foundation. Um, and uh,

534
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,400
other chefs are big meditators,
yoga doers, martial artists,

535
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,160
a runners.
Because for those of us who are runners,

536
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:23,630
like Andrew and I have run marathons.
When you're doing 26.2 miles, you know,

537
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:27,860
it's all mental. It's not
physical anymore. So like

538
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,420
business, it's very, very, uh, you bring
out all your senses when you're cooking.

539
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,820
How many people here love to cook at
home? All right, I kind of figured it,

540
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,010
you're going to be so more inspired
now this, but, um, when it brings out,

541
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,800
it brings out all, all of it and it's
very draining. It's emotionally draining,

542
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:44,380
sometimes more than even physically
draining depending on what you're doing.

543
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,880
And I think that,
you know,

544
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:49,210
whatever you need to do to create that
balance is going to keep you at your best

545
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:51,910
so that you can be at your best
consistently. Because, you know,

546
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:55,470
working with men and if we're not
feeling creative that speaks in the

547
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,340
[inaudible], you can see it.
You can, you can smell it,

548
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:59,370
you can taste it or you can't.
Right.

549
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,160
And when you look at,

550
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,200
he calls that the aura of a dish where
you know that the most important aspect

551
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:04,800
of the dishes,

552
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,870
that connection between the dish itself
and the person who's eating it. Sure.

553
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,970
And she believes it's love that you can
actually taste it if there's Solon a

554
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:15,180
dish, if there's love in a dish or
if there's not, if a dish falls flat,

555
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:18,330
she knows that people are just started
cooking with everything that they can

556
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:19,170
bring to a dish.

557
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,310
Sure.

558
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,390
So we're going to do a transition here
and speaking of bringing everything that

559
00:30:23,391 --> 00:30:27,660
we can to a dish, we're going to do a
little fun year with eating and the team.

560
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:31,290
So we're in the kitchen sink, a teaching
kitchen at Google and Sunnyvale.

561
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:35,010
And the team here is going
to talk through, we're going
to move the chairs out.

562
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:37,920
They're going to talk through kind of
how they look at inspiration when they

563
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:42,320
create meals and recipes for our Googlers.
If they teach them to cook. And a,

564
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,330
it will be a kind of narrating back
and forth and asking her all sorts of

565
00:30:45,331 --> 00:30:48,420
questions and seeing how it comes to
light. But we're excited for this.

566
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:50,900
So chef dd, welcome. Thank you.

567
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,863
Let me get out of your way.

568
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,080
So tell the audience here and obviously
our virtual audience a little bit about

569
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:07,590
what you do and what kitchen sink
is for the folks in the audience,

570
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:10,740
they probably understand it, but
you're, you're delivering, uh,

571
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,240
cooking classes to Googlers. Yes.
Sometimes families, sometimes families.

572
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,910
And you're teaching people
on a variety of spectrum,

573
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:20,640
whether they know how to
cook the comfortable with
cooking or, or not at all.

574
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,640
Yup. Um, sometimes we have people
that cook six, seven nights a week,

575
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,990
sometimes the just getting into the
kitchen and they want some basic knife

576
00:31:28,991 --> 00:31:33,520
skills and basic cooking techniques.
So, um, we have a full culinary program.

577
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,710
Single subject classes could be
who literacy based skill building.

578
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:43,840
Um, we do a core culinary
program, lots of team events,

579
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,490
um, guest chefs. So, um, usually
two classes a day or more.

580
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,260
I do have the coolest job on campus.

581
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,800
I get to live in this amazing space

582
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
every day. And you're in a
brand new teaching kitchen here.

583
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,450
So I'm gonna move the
chair out of your way.

584
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:59,100
And why don't you just talk a
little bit about, I know that,

585
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:01,500
I know I have a kind of an understanding
of what you're looking through here,

586
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:05,190
but I was talking to Karen and Andrew
earlier about what I call the chefs'

587
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:07,940
arsenal. And the chefs' arsenal
for many shops is expected,

588
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:11,310
especially in the older days when
we were trained as you've got sugar,

589
00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:13,800
you've got salt, you've got
fat, whatever that fat might be.

590
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:17,220
And those are the three things that
typically dominate and deliver flavor.

591
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,440
And we still use those, but we use
them a lot more thoughtfully. Um,

592
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,700
we have a very intentional look, uh,
outlook on the food program at Google. Uh,

593
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:28,110
and we want,
while we want to deliver on deliciousness,

594
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:30,360
I love the fact that you said that,
and that's in the book.

595
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,690
We want to deliver on deliciousness.
We can do this in thoughtful ways.

596
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:36,750
And so you're going to talk through your
dish today and kind of how you're doing

597
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:38,720
that with the Google twist.
Um,

598
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,310
and talk through some of the ingredients
that are your modern day arsenal that

599
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:47,090
are still delivering on the
attributes of sweet sugar.

600
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,700
Salt and fat,
you're doing them in a thoughtful way.

601
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:54,590
Um, yeah. So one of the things I think
about when I'm building out a dish, um,

602
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,680
let's start with seasonality. I
think that's really important. Um,

603
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,740
and I'm thinking about the dish today.
Um,

604
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,010
I just was thinking about all these
amazing fall squashes that are coming into

605
00:33:05,011 --> 00:33:07,800
the market.
So roasted up some butternut squash.

606
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:12,570
We have some Delicata squash
roasted as well. And then,

607
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,550
um, thinking about, um, other ingredients
that would go well with this dish.

608
00:33:17,551 --> 00:33:18,384
So,
um,

609
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,610
some Nice Kale mushrooms and not
only mushrooms, roasted mushrooms,

610
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:27,000
so some roasted Shataki
mushrooms really get into

611
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,630
super tasty salty Umami for sure,

612
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,630
roasting a lot. And I, and I don't,

613
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,030
for those that can't see
the ingredients up close,

614
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,850
you're developing a
heightened sense of the,

615
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:44,470
of the flavor of why the caramelization
of the natural sugars in the squash and

616
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,460
the mushrooms. You're extracting the
water to get more flavor. And so you're,

617
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:49,610
you're really delivering on flavor.
And most of this,

618
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,440
if not all of this has it all plant based.

619
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,940
And so you're highlighting the seasonality
as we're heading into fall. Um,

620
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,210
we have some of the squashes here,

621
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:59,000
but you've got some staples
that are always on our menus,
whether it's the chemo,

622
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,070
why are the mushrooms and things like
that, a roasted shallots as well. So yeah,

623
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,470
really nice plant based dish, not
one of the things. We also um,

624
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,660
driving kitchen sink as
well. And then, yeah,

625
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,690
thinking about you could take this set
of ingredients and then I think about,

626
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,120
okay, how am I going to build flavor, um,

627
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,140
with a sauce or the dressing
or the sparkling water or
the wine. Right. So, um,

628
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,690
today I wanted to take a kind of a,
a trip and a map to uh,

629
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,680
Thailand and use some Thai
ingredients. Okay. Excellent. Um,

630
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,530
so things like fish sauce,
right,

631
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,400
salty, Umami. It's that layer
of salt that's not just,

632
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,750
just solid caramelization too.
A lot of flavor in there. Um,

633
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:48,260
soy sauce. Um, another, no Fermin,

634
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:53,200
fermented sauces, fermented
flavors, really rich in Umami. Um,

635
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,030
palm sugar, a little bit of sweet,
but also bill nuts. Yeah. Right? Yes.

636
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:58,640
Um,

637
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,370
Kinda caramely Vanilli not just that
plain white sugar thing happening out

638
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:04,280
there.
Um,

639
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,040
fresh ginger or classically
for tag along the route.

640
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,260
Um,
Thai chilies,

641
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:16,261
a little bit of that heat and that sensory
that you want to pause you right now,

642
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,280
right

643
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,240
now because of what you're,
you're,

644
00:35:19,241 --> 00:35:22,630
you've delivered on so many attributes
that are so important to any rate meal.

645
00:35:22,631 --> 00:35:25,570
And obviously within our,
our guidance that we provide where chefs,

646
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:27,840
we have a saying called flavor roles,
flavor rules.

647
00:35:27,841 --> 00:35:31,510
It has to be there or why bother
just go home and pack it up.

648
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,370
But there's also rules of flavor and with
DDS talked about is you've got amazing

649
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:38,720
flavors here and happened to be
plant based. They don't have to beat,

650
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,770
you've gotten a mommy
that sixth sense of that,

651
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,910
that neediness through machines soy saw.
So you've got the spice through ginger,

652
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,950
you've got spice through Saracho or Chili,

653
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,040
you've got the herbaceousness
from the Cilantro,

654
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,520
you've got the crunch from the nuts.

655
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,480
You've got all these different aspects
that for a district truly be craveable

656
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:58,230
for you to want one more bite. You need
to get all of these elements together.

657
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,540
And what dd is going to do now is to
pull these together in a way that, um,

658
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,200
is going to want the diner to go back for
that next bite. And as our focus here,

659
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:07,321
we're,

660
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:11,100
we're trying to help our users make
better choices with food because the food

661
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,710
here is something that is
plentiful and bountiful.

662
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:18,570
It's easy to make wrong decisions and
our job is to make it easier for you to

663
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:21,510
make better choices and
to enjoy what you had.

664
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:24,610
Because a lot of times users come to us
and say, this is the highlight of my day.

665
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,170
Lunch was like the highlight. So it
should be, it should be me experience.

666
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,730
Hopefully not. No one's saying no or yes,

667
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,730
there's audience has questions.

668
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:39,130
You guys can chime in while dd
starts putting this together.

669
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,470
You picked some of my favorite
compliments to. Uh, I,

670
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,680
I love this combination
of squash and mushrooms,

671
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:50,830
the earthiness balancing
the sweetness of the squash.

672
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:55,000
I think it's still seasonal
and yet there's a real
complimentary nature to that

673
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,580
and actually do that.

674
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,850
I thing I like is the fact that the
nuts, the nuts, we'll add crunch,

675
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:00,770
but also it's protein and it's fast.

676
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:04,760
So when you were talking about fat being
such as playing a role and it still

677
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:07,850
does and fat is actually soon
to be considered a flavor,

678
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,240
but that's a good way to make the dish
even healthier as opposed to like a

679
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:13,700
creamy dressing or something like that.
You can get it all there.

680
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:16,460
So you're actually getting two for one.
Actually a little bit of a mommy too.

681
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:20,000
So that's a really key thing. And if he
doesn't like print them nuts, it's like

682
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,360
walnuts. You know how we were talking
about earlier that kind of stealing that,

683
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:29,020
taking it nice and it's a check out the
book of course, before you got here,

684
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,790
how was like, right, I've got to put
the mushrooms in there, so thank you.

685
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,080
I basically read well and your tension
and of course King Wah with it's high

686
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:44,740
protein content. Always feel virtuous
when I have it. I love the texture.

687
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,160
It's more of a textural thing for me,
I think then flavor,

688
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:50,470
but I love the earthiness of it.
Um,

689
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,340
knowing that I'm doing something
good for my writing, right.

690
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,250
There's a beautiful array of
colors for those that are up here.

691
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,850
You can smell it and it's a cold dish.

692
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:02,240
So imagine if some of these words were
heated and you could easily add your warm

693
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:06,440
mushrooms are warm. Squash and temperature
plays a lot into what we do as we're,

694
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,430
you know, creating dishes because
you eat with your eyes first,

695
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:13,640
but you even before that is if you
walk into any cafe or restaurant,

696
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,410
the first thing you generally
get is a smell of something.

697
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:17,690
And hopefully it's something that's,
you know,

698
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:21,080
not overpowering like Cologne or perfume,
which is why chefs don't wear,

699
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,070
it's beautiful, which is why chefs
don't wear that. So refreshing.

700
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,010
One of the things that I loved,
needed to speak to is the,

701
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,050
the disciplines within the program of
Google about really practicing your

702
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:35,120
recipes. I mean this is something
that you've made before.

703
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,130
Not something that you see on top
shop where you get five ingredients,

704
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:41,230
you put something together.
That's perfect day one.

705
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,070
And the reason I mentioned that and I
love that the TV shows that have really

706
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:48,100
brought the popularity of food
and getting more people excited,

707
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,810
but at times I think there's a challenge
out there that a lot of people think

708
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:55,720
that just throwing ingredients together
is, is the way it is for shops.

709
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:56,590
And that's not the case.

710
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,760
They spent so much time testing and
training and retesting and retooling and

711
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:04,240
what we call a signature recipe.
It might take us weeks, months,

712
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,240
or years to get to a point and talk a
little bit about your thought process of

713
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:07,841
how you got this,

714
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:09,990
cause I know you just didn't go in
their fridge or if you're like, ah,

715
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,680
that looks like fun, but you had some
bought with this. So let us give us some,

716
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:18,430
some insights as you're compiling mixed
fleets. Yeah, absolutely. So like I said,

717
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:23,290
back to, um, seasonality,
um, deliciousness,

718
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:27,490
craveability um, you know, super
important. And so, you know,

719
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:32,410
going back to, you know, roasting the
butternut squash, um, thinking about,

720
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,860
um, the fish sauce, all
those fermented things.

721
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,670
I'm actually surprised I didn't put me so

722
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,110
paste on this because
I'm obsessed with me,

723
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:44,760
so it's always better with me sir,
but often better with me. Great.

724
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,240
The magic ingredient a little bit

725
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:51,560
with salad dressing or um, you
know, adding it into a dish.

726
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,770
What do you said about roasting
the squash? Because again,

727
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:58,730
every ingredient also has a key that
unlocks it in terms of technique.

728
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:02,560
You don't boil it, steam it, roast
it to get the ultimate flavor.

729
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,710
Yeah, great point. Um, you
know, adding in the crunch with,

730
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:10,350
with some of the red bell peppers
and also a little bit of sweetness.

731
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,750
We roasted the shallots as well.
Nothing concepts in the book.

732
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:20,430
And then, you know, we balanced taste
right, the sweet, the sour, the salty,

733
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:24,880
the bitter and Umami. So it's like chefs
favorite two words need salt. Yeah. Yeah.

734
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,090
I think even in the book,
like people,

735
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,220
people new joke that the chest can look
at a dish and say it needs salt in nine

736
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:30,620
times out of 10 the right.
Yeah.

737
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,380
So you're about to put this together
and obviously the team is in right now

738
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:39,330
Jerrod's tasting nutritious,
that it's so key.

739
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,390
How many people here have, have cooked
at home. And there's always something.

740
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:47,040
There's that one little element missing,
right? It could be salt, it could be acid,

741
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:50,040
it could be that balance.
And that's the fun in,

742
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:54,000
in the kitchen is to come up with what
is that perfect balance that you're

743
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:58,050
looking for and what would DDS got here
is a perfect opportunity to deliver on

744
00:40:58,051 --> 00:41:00,420
amazing, delicious, because
you've got all that going on.

745
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,830
But what Thai food specifically, it's
either really good or really wrong, right?

746
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:07,200
Because if you're too high on the sugar,
if you too high on the spice,

747
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:10,100
it just throws the balance off, right?
And so what she's doing now, it's,

748
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,810
she's going through and she's
looking for those, those, uh,

749
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,850
specific balances and incorporating
the ingredients. How's it tasting?

750
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,750
Good.
Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee checked that.

751
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,670
I think with the sweetness,

752
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,700
sweetness gets a bad rap that you
don't want to eat too much sugar,

753
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:29,810
which I think is true,

754
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,370
but also sometimes all you need is a
little bit of sugar to be a enhancer and

755
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:38,990
you get, and there's that peak, um, aspect
of when you're looking at how to season,

756
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,780
where you learn, okay, it's,
it's, it's enhancing place.

757
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,800
Enhancing has upset starts stalling
flavor. And so if you add too much sugar,

758
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:46,830
it will do all the flavors.

759
00:41:46,831 --> 00:41:49,970
So you kind of have to work on
getting to the peak of that apex.

760
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:52,070
But is it still going up in the new four?

761
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:55,100
It starts going down and I think that's
just a matter of trial and error.

762
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:59,570
Repetition, as you said before,
personal tastes in some instances.

763
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,250
Yeah. And that's a challenge. A
personal taste obviously with, you know,

764
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,120
hundreds of thousands of
dollars running around.

765
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,620
What are our approach on that is to
create food that is approachable for

766
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:10,780
everyone but personalizable
for everyone as well.

767
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,140
And so a lot of the time will be
garnished is on the side purposely.

768
00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:18,590
So that people can add their element of,
of acidity is spice, et cetera. Um, and,

769
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,460
and I find myself doing that more and
more when I cook at home is because

770
00:42:21,461 --> 00:42:24,700
everyone has different tastes. So a
question for you, for both of you,

771
00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:27,400
if you had three ingredients that are
always in your refrigerator that you would

772
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:28,234
rely on

773
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,690
and it always changes, right?
Absolutely. Cases during the season.

774
00:42:33,691 --> 00:42:36,840
Two we'd have to have me
sit, well champagne, I don't
know about that ingredient

775
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,150
is getting importance.
It is always in the original

776
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,990
parmesan cheese Parmesan is a world
war horse because we ate Vegan for two

777
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:55,060
months and we've found that it was really
hard to live without Parmesan. Sure.

778
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,850
Why would you want to do that? Yeah. Yeah.
All right. We still farmers on, cause I'm,

779
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,490
I'm picking up

780
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,480
Jesus Umami name. Okay. And then
actually none of the refrigerator on the,

781
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:07,710
on the next month or next to the stove
as I always have a wide variety of

782
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,480
winners. Champagne, Sherri Balsamic,
white Balsamic, dark balsamic.

783
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,280
And what's cool about vinegars?
I think this is the,

784
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,930
if you want to be more creative tonight
by a different bottle of vinegar,

785
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,380
make each same salad and do a one
with balsamic vinegar tonight,

786
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:26,120
one with a squeeze of lemon tomorrow
and one was champagne vinegar.

787
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:30,290
The next day you'll have three completely
different salads and also vinegar,

788
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:35,310
seven different degrees of acidity to so
champagnes and he was very soft lemons

789
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,620
role. It's always off. So we
always have a lot of vinegar.

790
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:42,540
So it's sort of basically salt sour.
Actually it says own sauce. Oh, okay.

791
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,620
Touch your skin. Says we've got
a little bottle of that, uh,

792
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,080
after we leave feeling
inspired to cook tonight. Yeah.

793
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:55,320
The thing is is that if you have those
key ingredients, whatever they are,

794
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:58,230
and I think it changes from week to week
because we don't like having the same

795
00:43:58,231 --> 00:44:00,540
thing every night. So some
nights it's like, okay,

796
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:05,541
we better have rice and beans and Avocados
because that'll get us in the Mexican

797
00:44:05,581 --> 00:44:09,440
realm. We want to have a good salsa
on hand or either a fresh, uh, uh,

798
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,880
pick up the guy a or a great,
uh,

799
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,110
jarred salsa and just be being able
to throw those elements together very

800
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,800
quickly so that you can eat in a different
country every night of the week if

801
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:21,180
you've got or every week.

802
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:23,940
You can sort of shake it up if you
want to use over some leftovers.

803
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:29,130
But when we are in a pasta mood, we want
to have pasta on hand. Um, Olana Pesto,

804
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,340
we love the combination of pasta,
pesto beans.

805
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,010
If you know it's one of those 10,

806
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:39,630
15 minute meals that you boil up the
pasta. If you, sometimes you even,

807
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,430
even authors who write about food,

808
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:45,880
don't want to be that ambitious to
do an got to be, that takes an hour.

809
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,140
You just want something, okay, I want
something delicious and one in 15 minutes.

810
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:53,220
Right? The combination of the Pesto
and wiping and pasta is a staple.

811
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:55,890
And then we throw in some Greens because
you want to have some nutritional value

812
00:44:55,891 --> 00:45:00,070
in there. So she's a good one for smart
kitchen. It's expenditure different.

813
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:02,870
Going into a pasta and go into
a salad can go into a curry.

814
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,621
I stuff when I got that,

815
00:45:03,621 --> 00:45:07,890
I was looking at this really what made
this dish special is the fact that dad

816
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,970
decided to take it to Thailand.
I smells great, but look,

817
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,180
if I looked at these ingredients fall,
yeah, I could easily turn this into Chile.

818
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,490
You know like this be, this will be my
Chilean home. Swash Greens, mushrooms,

819
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:23,880
beans. Yeah. Bands you can go
to a completely different place.

820
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:26,130
So the question we'll use
at night is like, well,

821
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:27,600
what country do I feel
like being in tonight?

822
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,890
And often sometimes it's a split because
one of us is researching one thing and

823
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:34,220
when this is research and the other
thing it's like, oh, he has it.

824
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,270
Have couscous was, I've been
reading about Moroccan food all day.

825
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,160
It's like couscous, why would
you want couscous? You need,

826
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,630
you need noodles tonight.

827
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:44,280
So that's always a music question
to ask yourself. It's like,

828
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,500
what country do I want to be
in? And then it's like, okay,

829
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:50,930
then you go in and grab
everything you have at a huh.
Super Fun. Super Fun. So DDS

830
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,260
plating the demonstration played
up in the team behind you.

831
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,730
I'm just gonna play that.
The samples,

832
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:59,060
what I'd like to do now is to open it
up to any questions that we might have

833
00:45:59,061 --> 00:45:59,830
while the,

834
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,540
the authors are here and finishing up
the plate up and then we'll have a quick

835
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:05,310
sampling and then we'll do a
book signing after that. Uh,

836
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,510
so if there are initial questions to
start racing your hands, um, if not,

837
00:46:08,511 --> 00:46:11,210
I'll just keep gathering because I don't
think I don't have this opportunity

838
00:46:11,211 --> 00:46:12,150
often.
Yes,

839
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,673
just start.

840
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:31,640
It's totally meant to be flipping
through it. You flipped through a to z.

841
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:34,610
Anything that catches your attention,
it catches your attention for a reason.

842
00:46:34,611 --> 00:46:37,040
I think flipping through it is the
absolute best way to read the book.

843
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:40,160
You can read it chronologically,
it's laid out in a chronological manner,

844
00:46:40,161 --> 00:46:41,210
but you don't have to,

845
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,380
I would say pick it up whenever you need
inspiration and we wrote it to be there

846
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:46,310
for when you do.

847
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:49,640
So the question just to
repeat it for the audience,

848
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:53,210
that oil on video is that it is or a
starting point in the book and I think you

849
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:54,044
captured the graders.

850
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:57,590
There could be but it doesn't have to be
and I think that that would be the same

851
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,700
for many of the books that you have is
I literally was in culinary Igert street

852
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:03,890
just a few days ago,
not because of the fact you were here,

853
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:07,550
but I had some questions just around
ingredients study to write for a menu for

854
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:11,750
the Montana event and I need a little
inspiration and I was not feeling creative

855
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:14,090
at the moment. Help
me, Karen, help me out.

856
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,200
And so you can definitely use those
books at anytime as resources and I think

857
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:19,400
what you're going to find in this one,

858
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,510
did you indeed do that even more so
because there's so much good stuff in here

859
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:28,600
with all the chef tips, the quotes,
amazing. No additional questions from the,

860
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,470
from the audience

861
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,840
in the front and then
we'll go to the back. Yes.

862
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,010
How did you season the roasted vegetables?
Yeah,

863
00:47:38,011 --> 00:47:40,210
just a little bit of olive
oil and salt and pepper.

864
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:45,211
So really simple that way you could really
take this base dish here in a variety

865
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:52,480
of direction. So, um, if I was
feeling more Mediterranean today,

866
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:54,740
I could have done lemons and Federer,

867
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,990
Parmesan and or some champagne vinegar,
maybe some Bazell.

868
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,123
Um,

869
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:05,130
so keeping your sort of
my core roadmap simple.

870
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,700
Plus we have leftovers.

871
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:12,220
Today's tie tomorrow can be submitted
to ade and it's like a whole new dish we

872
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:14,130
season at home for the exact same reasons.

873
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,680
You want the flexibility if you want to
be in a different country the next day.

874
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,800
If you season it upfront with
something that's very identifiable,

875
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:22,510
but this specific cuisine
you're going to have,

876
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,990
you're going to stay in that country
the next day and the next day is it up?

877
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,560
We never call it leftovers. We
call it the encores. We are,

878
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,820
it's like, yeah, you just,
some of that a little bit,

879
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,460
it's really interesting to add your
question is I know what you're getting at,

880
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,490
which is, you know, what do I need
to do to get to that end result?

881
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:47,370
And you know you could use butter,
you could oil,

882
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,970
oil doesn't really matter at this point.

883
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:51,790
You obviously chose oil because it's
neutral and it's a little lighter fat,

884
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,950
but what you've done really
well in this is the technique.

885
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,250
You've found a way to diocese in a way
that they're consistent size so they're

886
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:58,084
going to cook evenly.

887
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,820
You found a way to brown them off
so that they still have texture and

888
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:02,980
caramelization but they're not
mushy nor are they crunchy.

889
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,280
These are the things that make or break
a great meal and take a little bit of

890
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:09,670
time to to think through
but nice job on that.

891
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:12,700
There was a question in the back and
we're going to repeat the question just so

892
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:17,440
we can get it on
the entire process.

893
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,530
The entire process when it comes
to the research for our books.

894
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:23,200
And this one in particular,
you know, we, for this book,

895
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:27,670
we had both a bottom up and a top down
approach where the bottom up approach was

896
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:32,671
basically talking to chefs about what
they felt was important to know about

897
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:33,970
their creative process,

898
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,690
about how they cook and all of them have
different specialties is some of them

899
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:42,250
have different countries
that they specialize or
different techniques that they

900
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:46,630
specialize in something that roots their
cuisine and makes it different from

901
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:47,500
anyone else's.

902
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:52,710
And so we wanted to understand from
talking to Kyle cannot at single thread

903
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:58,141
about his influences and working in Japan
and that Japanese sensibility that he

904
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:04,081
brings to his food in conjunction to the
crazy stuff that he's doing with Heston

905
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,190
Blumenthal and that
he'd learned at elderly.

906
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,620
We're working in elderly,

907
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,600
so he sort of brings it all together
in a really interesting way.

908
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:17,260
Other people like Rick Bayless from
Frontera Grill in Chicago is much more

909
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:19,060
specialized in Mexican cuisine.

910
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,030
And so we wanted to really
understand that by talking to Rick,

911
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:24,040
we talked to his chef to cuisine,

912
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:28,310
but we really wanted to understand
their approach to thinking about things.

913
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:32,120
And the beautiful thing about it is that
when you talk to people who are at the

914
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:34,550
best of the best at what they do,

915
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:36,620
they've been doing it in
some cases for decades.

916
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,860
And that creativity is
reflected in evolution.

917
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,490
That their cuisine goes through the
evolution of their thought process,

918
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:48,140
where they're designing a new menu and
had brainstormed a list of adjectives

919
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:50,300
that best described certain dishes.

920
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:54,470
So they organize their menu not
by appetizer, entree and dessert,

921
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:56,420
but by characteristic.

922
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,870
So it shows the level of thought
process that they put into it.

923
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:04,310
They're also used inspiration by d of
different paintings and different works of

924
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,330
art in their restaurant.

925
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:09,260
It will come up with dishes that are
reflect reflection of that. So, um,

926
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,860
the research is extensive in
terms of speaking to chefs.

927
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,940
We also do extensive research
on a restaurant reviews,

928
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:19,210
trying to understand
their restaurants from it,

929
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:22,730
from a local critic's perspective.
We reviewed their cookbooks,

930
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,730
we view their menus.
Um,

931
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:30,650
and then we kind of put it all together
and kind of bring it all together.

932
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:35,480
We also studied creativity from
the ex, uh, from the point of view,

933
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:39,620
various experts on creativity.
So we spoke to experts like Michael Gal,

934
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:44,621
the author of how to think like Leonardo
Da Vinci and the art of connection on

935
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,340
how do you, uh, really bring
those elements of creativity,

936
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:51,080
what are the things that
we should be looking for?

937
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:55,970
And he is identified some of the key
genius thinking attributes of Leonardo Da

938
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,610
Vinci. We saw them in the
world's most creative chefs.

939
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:03,440
And so I think through that,
um, opportunity of really
bringing the two together,

940
00:52:03,441 --> 00:52:04,670
we saw how chefs,

941
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:08,780
we're the perfect exemplars of some of
the best creativity that's going on in

942
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:13,590
the world today and to really take a look
at their best practices and really try

943
00:52:13,591 --> 00:52:18,380
to translate that for anyone, whether
it's a professional chef or a home cook,

944
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,060
um, to help you to be more creative when
you least feel the inspiration to be

945
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:23,960
creative.

946
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,360
So we have one,
one or two more questions.

947
00:52:28,361 --> 00:52:32,350
So one thing that I'm taking away from
this and I hoping you are as well as the

948
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:34,060
thought and to intentionality,

949
00:52:34,061 --> 00:52:37,030
depending on whoever you are that's
creating something is immense.

950
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,810
And when you are preparing your next
meal or when you're at a restaurant,

951
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,600
I would say when you're preparing your
own meal or someone else's cooking for

952
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:47,740
you specifically, get home, turn off
the TV, turn off the distractions,

953
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:52,120
and take a few minutes to
really be mindful of the
experience that someone else

954
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:54,070
has prepared for you or that
you prepared for yourself.

955
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:56,350
And the reason I mentioned that,
and this is in the book as well,

956
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:01,530
is music and other distractions can
either enhance or completely detract from

957
00:53:02,051 --> 00:53:07,051
the experience and knowing the thought
that went into just something as simple

958
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:11,020
as a salad. And this is not a simple
dish and it was delicious by the way,

959
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,440
that roasted mushroom,
the winning,

960
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,460
the winning hook there that got me to
go through x bite was that mushroom.

961
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,900
But think about that as you're,

962
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:22,570
as you're creating things and have a
conversation with people when you're

963
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:24,490
cooking for them.
Because this is what it's all about.

964
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:27,870
And the reason I mentioned turning down
the TV is it so easy just to be mindless

965
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,450
and just, you know,
it's not dining anymore,

966
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:32,610
it's just kind of feeding
and we all do that at a time.

967
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,730
But thank you for all the
work that you've done here.

968
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,090
Was there another couple of questions
before we line up for signatures?

969
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,850
Yes.
So we have some big

970
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,990
occasions.
Great

971
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:52,440
question. You know, a lot of
times it's, it's very personal.

972
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:56,220
I mean the holidays are times that we
need to get together with family or

973
00:53:56,221 --> 00:54:00,330
friends, loved ones. And there's a lot of
childhood memories that are involved. Um,

974
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:03,180
Andrew and I, our families had different
stuffings when we were growing up.

975
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:07,290
Sit down. We have a multiple stuffing
celebration, um, this time of year.

976
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,550
But a lot of times, you know, there's a
sacredness. You don't always want to be.

977
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:14,700
Creativity isn't always a good
thing. You know, Daniel Ballou says,

978
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:17,210
if you're making steak free,
you let it be steak free.

979
00:54:17,211 --> 00:54:19,420
You don't want to get too
creative with that. Um,

980
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,240
and sometimes there's sacred cows
are sacred turkeys when it comes to

981
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,210
thanksgiving,
then he don't want to mess with.

982
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,300
They do want to have a happy
Thanksgiving and you know,

983
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,720
have it be as peaceful and calm
around the table as possible.

984
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,550
You don't want to mess with
people's favorite dishes,

985
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:37,530
but there are times that you can take
what the essence of Thanksgiving is. And,

986
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,640
uh, if you can deconstruct what is
it that's important to you? Well,

987
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:44,040
I want to have some pumpkin
dessert on the table.

988
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:47,010
It doesn't have to be Pumpkin Pie. And
then you can start playing with it. Okay.

989
00:54:47,011 --> 00:54:50,460
Am I going to do a pump and tart?
Am I going to do a Pumpkin Ravioli?

990
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:53,550
Am I going to make it a side dish? You
know, how am I going to play with that?

991
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:57,150
Am I going to come up with a pumpkin
cocktail? So you can have, you know,

992
00:54:57,151 --> 00:55:00,990
there's a place in New York
City where we had, um, a,

993
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:05,991
a Turkey sandwich that was served
with a bag of sweet potato chips and a

994
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:09,360
cranberry fizzy drink.

995
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,850
And you realize all the flavors
of Thanksgiving or right there,

996
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:15,630
but they're in a completely
different format. If you
can take the, figure it out,

997
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:15,811
you know,

998
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:20,160
do the deconstruction of what are the
flavors that me Christmas to you or

999
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:24,480
Hanukkah to you or Thanksgiving to you
and narrow them down. And it's like, okay,

1000
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:28,290
well I have to have stuffing or I have
to have gravy or whatever your thing is.

1001
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:33,750
Sorry. Or should always champagne.
Oh, right. So, you know,

1002
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:35,250
you can,
you can play with that.

1003
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:38,910
We have an exercise in the beginning of
Stage three in the book where we ask you

1004
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:43,260
to think about what your five favorite
childhood dishes were and to really

1005
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:45,150
analyze the information
that's packed in there.

1006
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:48,330
Because we think that all of you know
more than you think, you know, um,

1007
00:55:48,331 --> 00:55:50,280
and it's all packed in your
favorite childhood dishes.

1008
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:53,010
So if you take a minute and just sort
of make a mental note and it's like,

1009
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,670
oh yeah, my mom's blank,
or my grandmother's blank,
or my father is blank.

1010
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,940
When he pulled up the grill and made
this for me when I was growing up,

1011
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,830
I forgot what those dishes were.

1012
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,770
And then think about what
made the dish special to you.

1013
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:06,510
So for me it was caramel apples.

1014
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:09,780
And you'll see a caramel apple example
of different dishes you can make with the

1015
00:56:09,781 --> 00:56:14,781
combination of apple caramel and nuts
that are other than a whole apple on a

1016
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:18,930
step. So we've got a solid example.
We've got a cocktail example, um,

1017
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,400
different desserts,
you know,

1018
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:24,760
an upscale Dysart example using that
same set of flavor affinities or flavor

1019
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:27,040
chords as we called them,
but in a whole different way.

1020
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:30,880
And if you take that simple example and
you apply it to whatever your favorite

1021
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:31,451
flavors are,

1022
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:36,451
whether it's tomato basil and a
Parmesan cheese or something completely

1023
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:41,320
different garlic,
ginger and soy sauce,

1024
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:46,470
you can take that set of compatible
flavors and apply it to a whole host of

1025
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:49,210
different dishes. And that will
get your creativity going big

1026
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,460
quickly. And I would just add one
more thing is that, uh, for like,

1027
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,510
it's like w please Thanksgiving
because that's a biggie. Um,

1028
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:00,010
when you make your cranberry sauce, take
half of it and make it a different way.

1029
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,470
So have your, have the one
that's gonna make everyone happy.

1030
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:04,990
Thanksgiving for God sake.

1031
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,200
But maybe take another one and look up
cranberries and think about cranberries

1032
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:10,090
and like, I don't think I'll
pop some ginger in there,

1033
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:14,440
maybe a little tumeric and I'm a little
orange zest and that might not be your

1034
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:17,230
family's typical one,
but then you're have something new.

1035
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:22,240
And we went vegetarian five years ago,
um, and we were invited to thanksgiving.

1036
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:26,270
So guess what, I learned how
to make mushroom gravy that
year and now, and again,

1037
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:29,640
they'll go on five years. I'm still
working on mushroom gravy, mushroom gravy,

1038
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,270
mushroom gravy. So getting this ad you
don't have, have the classic thing there,

1039
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:34,001
the big,
again,

1040
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:37,270
it makes everyone happy but then just
don't a couple extra dishes and was like,

1041
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:41,230
what's two extra dishes at Thanksgiving?
You know, you sort of pointed out like,

1042
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,860
this is new, let's, you know, and
that's also a fun way to do it,

1043
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:48,170
because also we'll give you a chance to
sort of chill out around Thanksgiving

1044
00:57:48,171 --> 00:57:50,860
and make something New York already
in the kitchen anyway, you know?

1045
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:53,290
But just do have,
excellent,

1046
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,780
well, I know we're at time. I
know there's more questions. Uh,

1047
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,620
what I'd like to do is first give both
of you a huge round of applause for

1048
00:57:58,621 --> 00:57:59,454
coming.
Thank you.

1049
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:00,680
Great.
