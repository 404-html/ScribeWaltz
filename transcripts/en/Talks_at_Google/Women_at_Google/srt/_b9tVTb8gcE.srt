1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,690
All right. Good morning.
Thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,070
My name is Bradley Horowitz.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,100
I'm vice president of photos and sharing
here at Google and it's my pleasure to

4
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:21,930
welcome lovee a gie with us this morning.
You all know love it.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,460
Yeah,
I'm going to do this

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,310
super brief introduction because I
actually want her to tell her story. Um,

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,130
you all know lovey.
I have to confess a week ago I didn't,

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,400
but a good mutual friend Lisa Stone and
invited me to host this talk and so I

9
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:43,020
went into a crash course on
learning about lovey and uh,

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,140
why she is so prominent
in the blogging space.

11
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:52,141
And so I've spent that last week getting
to know her work and I'm super excited

12
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:54,100
and as I shared in the invite,

13
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:58,660
somewhat nervous to be up here
cause she tells it like it is and

14
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,230
it's pretty clear I'm part of the problem

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,493
that

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,410
lovey please.
Let's welcome,

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,220
that's hilarious.

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,323
Ah,

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,010
well thank you.
Thank you for coming.

20
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:19,640
I know you're bouncing around the whole
country and we're glad you had a chance

21
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:22,820
to stop at Google. Had to do it.
Have you ever been here before?

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
No,
this is my first time on Google's campus.

23
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,020
Well, I hope you get a chance
to meet people and look around.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,050
I heard about the epic
slides you guys have.

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,930
We, we have slides. We have
a weird bikes. We have food,

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,410
you know, we'll, we'll treat you right.
It's going to have fun. Okay. Um,

27
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:42,700
so I want to start, I think most people
here know it, but for posterity and, uh,

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,170
for the, the videotape, um, tell
us your story. I mean, who are you,

29
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:48,400
how did you get to this chair?

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,820
By being a professional, a trouble maker.
And that's how I got to this chair. Um,

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,380
I'm a writer. I'm a speaker. I'm a techie
and I have been blogging for 13 years.

32
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:59,210
I started blogging in 2003.

33
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:03,640
I was in college and I was peer pressured
into doing it because my friends were

34
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,900
like, you should start a web
blog. And I was like, okay.

35
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,830
So I went to zango.com and start a web.

36
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,880
And I started a long ago
that Sangha Sangha, okay.

37
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:16,680
Remember Sangha like next to
Friendster and everything. Right.

38
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,660
And I started blogging.

39
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:20,870
I was talking about college life and all
my randomness and Shenanigans and, uh,

40
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,990
who I was beefing with that day.
Nothing interesting.

41
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,990
And I kept basically I have my
college career, chronic board,

42
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,640
which for good in our bed, I just, I read
it and I was like, this is awful. Um,

43
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,430
when I graduated from college,
I deleted that blog and I was like,

44
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:36,830
I'm going to start something new.
And I go to blog spot,

45
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,640
fire up this new blog called
the lovies random rants.

46
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,030
And I was talking about all
things, pop culture, television,

47
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,850
anything I felt like talking about,
but not myself anymore.

48
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:50,660
So that's how blogging for me started.
And uh,

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,490
it basically took on a life of its own.

50
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,750
And you were born in Africa,
grew up in Chicago.

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,760
Yeah. So I was born in Nigeria
and uh, when I was nine,

52
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,150
you guys shouting from Nigeria,

53
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,730
right? Nigeria. So, um,

54
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,230
we moved to Chicago when I was nine
and nobody told me we were moving.

55
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,310
I thought we were going on vacation. And
then I started school and I was like, oh,

56
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:20,010
this means we're staying. Oh. Um,

57
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,170
and it was a big culture shock for me
because I went from never having to be the

58
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:25,861
new girl.

59
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:30,861
Like my best friend was the niece of
the person who owned the private school.

60
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:33,630
I went to add,
been going to high school since I was two.

61
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:37,740
So walking in the room and see people
who didn't look like me and having to

62
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:42,741
reintroduce myself and basically take
on a new persona was a huge shock to my

63
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:47,380
system. But yeah, I had this accent too.
Well, no, not this accident actually.

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,960
I had a major Nigerian accent and uh,
I ended up having to,

65
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:56,400
I lost it consciously by
mimicking my classmates. Right.

66
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,150
And like trying to repeat what they
were saying and how they were saying it.

67
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:03,000
And then by high school my
accident was mostly gone.

68
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,720
Right. Yeah. She thinks it's gone anyway.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,500
Right. You're like, I'm, no, I hear
it. I just said we're Nigerian. Yeah.

70
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,570
So do you think that experience of sort
of being a transplant at nine years old

71
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,430
and uh, being different, um,

72
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,840
informs some of who you are and,

73
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:25,090
and your ability to sort of stand
outside of things and you know,

74
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:28,840
tell it like it is, is that,
is that part of why you, you

75
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,280
well yeah.
So the tell it like it is in this,

76
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,370
that is me is my Nigerian
is and its true essence.

77
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:38,850
Like Nigerians were not a
great filter and people,

78
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,580
okay we're not the ones who were like,

79
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,990
Oh let me like make sure I coded in
all types of Nice things. We just say,

80
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:48,540
well we did, we feel like if you
come to like my family dinner,

81
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,280
we spent the whole time
laughing at each other.

82
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,650
Like somebody would walk in wearing a
sweater that's not cute. It's about,

83
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,000
and somebody will always be like,
why do you have that online?

84
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,870
It's just how we function.
And I'm in my writing.

85
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:04,200
My writing is essentially
who I am in real life in,

86
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,430
in Prince and because I want people who
know me to read my work and be like,

87
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,620
okay, I actually hear her
voice. That's exactly her.

88
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,610
So how I write very much
translates to who I am.

89
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,630
That's interesting.
And uh,

90
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,670
in your youth from like nine through high
school and things like that, did you,

91
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,050
were you extroverted class clown?
Like do you feel like, you know,

92
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,040
before in the pre blogging, pre college
years, like what was that like for you?

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,430
I have been the class clown forever.
Um,

94
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,690
this person that you see is who
I was in high school. Like my,

95
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:42,691
I still have the same friends that did
in high school and we were just a goofy

96
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:47,971
group of people will be in the hallway
just acting the fool or you know,

97
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:53,011
I'm playing spades in the lunchroom
and just spend all time laughing and

98
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,980
basically my group of friends are a
really good reflection who I am. Like,

99
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,120
you think I'm funny?

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,750
You come to Brunch with us and you'll
be in tears because none of them have

101
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,190
behavior or sense.

102
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,520
So it's just how I've been and being able
to have it translate to my writing has

103
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:11,710
been great because literally I,
um,

104
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,690
have these friends who've known me
for 20 years and people were like, oh,

105
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:18,640
how did you find your voice? And I was
like, do you see them? That's me. Hmm.

106
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,240
So it's not even a matter of
me having to find my voice. Um,

107
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,130
it's me just grown it up.
Yeah.

108
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,790
So you went to University of Illinois?
Yes.

109
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,160
And I love how she drops like 13 years.

110
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,660
Like that's a long time in tech
and stuff like that. But you know,

111
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,930
way before you got there, uh, the
web browser was invented there.

112
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,480
Internet explorer. Yes. Yeah. Most
of them were very proud of that.

113
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,150
Knowing. Yeah. My wife went
to school there too. Oh yeah.

114
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,050
It's, it's one of the things they tell
you, what are you going to orientation?

115
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,790
And they were like, at Illinois we
invented, I was like, impressive.

116
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:54,840
I will come here.
Yes.

117
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,990
Cool. This has changed everything
for me. I must be here. Yes.

118
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,730
And did you got into blogging
Wallet College and so yeah,

119
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,100
like do you think that's
how you had access?

120
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,550
Like how did you even come to do that?

121
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,620
Um, so I, I've always
liked just computers.

122
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:16,290
I took my computer type classes in school.

123
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:20,010
I was the person who actually
took an excel class for fun. Um,

124
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,330
so for me, I've always kind of
seen the value of computers and um,

125
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,520
all of these types of software.

126
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,630
But I was also the person who started
infusing social media into the work that I

127
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:35,330
was doing. Like I've been an early
adopter of most platforms and I'm,

128
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,980
blogging was just another thing that
I was kind of an early adopter. I,

129
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,210
because when I started blogging it was
just playing on the Internet. Um, so,

130
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,510
but I was doing it because
I thought it was fine. Um,

131
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,570
how I've been approaching technology
since I had to go to the library to go to,

132
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:55,560
to get my email. My first email
account was a hotmail account

133
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,580
and I think it was like
vet bet at hotmail,

134
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,440
but then when we had AOL and you know,
so I've been through,

135
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:07,200
I've seen the evolution of the
Internet grow and has been really cool,

136
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:10,110
but I've always found it valuable.
Hmm.

137
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,190
So that first phase you said you were
sort of blogging your college experience,

138
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:19,080
but then you deleted the
whole thing. Yeah. Um, do you
still have a copy or? I do.

139
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,530
Okay.
And so many fans and Google cache.

140
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,790
No, I'm just kidding. Right?

141
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,530
Oh yeah, no. Like I had Comic Sans
Font and everything and it was like,

142
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,873
it was just awful.

143
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,740
And it's not up online right now?

144
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,330
No. Okay. I think I like, I actually
was like, okay, legit deleted.

145
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:40,330
But before I deleted the blog,
I like copied and paste every single,

146
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,380
every single post.

147
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,460
It's a word document in the word document
was giant because it's three years of

148
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:48,640
me in college being a fool, being
like, oh, this is my roommate.

149
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:49,930
I didn't really like her that time.

150
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,000
So That's interesting because you're
so out there and so vulnerable,

151
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,280
honest about things.

152
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,200
Have you posted things that you
regret or go back and delete or edit?

153
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:04,680
Like what's it like having that out there?
Cause these days,

154
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,110
once you put something out
there, it's out there. Yeah.

155
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,970
Um, well so here's the thing
is my blogging for so long. Um,

156
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,050
the good and the bad thing
is it chronicles your growth
as a human being and as

157
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:15,660
a thought.

158
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,250
It's somebody who thinks about the world
and so things that there are things

159
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:20,360
that I wrote in 2009,

160
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:24,420
but I would never write today cause I
vehemently disagree with myself. I'm done.

161
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,780
I'm like, no, that was wrong. You
shouldn't. But some of those things,

162
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:30,590
I keep it up to remind myself where I
came from and who I was in that moment.

163
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,340
And the like, even thinking about
high school essays that I won,

164
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,370
I won like two major essay contest
in high school writing an essay on,

165
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,200
um,
whether people should receive reparations.

166
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,770
And my stance was, no, you didn't do that.

167
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,460
Why do you get reparations and I one
essay contest and I read the essay and I

168
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:56,060
was like, God, that's
terrible. No. So, but it's,

169
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:59,780
it's really good to still have the record
of who you were because you see how

170
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:02,690
you've grown, how you've changed,
how your thought has changed.

171
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,940
College changed everything
about my politics and,

172
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,520
and how I look at the world at large.

173
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:11,150
So who I was before college is completely
different from who I am now in terms

174
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:12,530
of my beliefs.

175
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,630
And I guess how much of what you do do
you do for yourself and how much do you

176
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:20,030
do for others? You know, it sounds like

177
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,210
bit of both. A little bit of both.
I try to do most of it for myself.

178
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,310
I think that's why you're so appealing.
Well, because my whole thing is, okay,

179
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,860
I'm one,
I'm not writing an echo chamber.

180
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:33,350
So the idea that I'm just
writing for myself is false,

181
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,440
but I am writer because if I don't
write the words kind of stay with me.

182
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,430
So like I'm the person who's,

183
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,300
who's taken a nap on the plane writing
blog posts too at the same time,

184
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,980
which is completely weird.

185
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,160
But I wake up with an entire post in my
head already and I'm just like, ah, okay,

186
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:50,450
cool.
Um,

187
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,470
so in that way I'm writing for myself but
also I'm writing for people to consume

188
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:59,060
it and um, hopefully change hearts and
minds cause I'm also not trying to write,

189
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,780
um, to preach to the choir all the time
cause it's like at that point what's the

190
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:05,090
point?
So it's a combination.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,350
So you're an early technology
adopter. Yeah. Early on.

192
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,970
Blogspot early with blogging.
Um, are you keeping up?

193
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:19,950
Like where are you at on vlogging?
Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, you know,

194
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:22,580
like is it, are there enough
hours in the day? Yes.

195
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,590
No, there are not enough
hours in the day and I'm,

196
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,340
I'm officially getting filling
like the Odi and tech because

197
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,570
13 years,

198
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,740
14 years come on veteran. But, um,

199
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,480
there are certain platforms I cannot get
with even though I've tried and I'm a

200
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:43,040
digital strategist and I can see the value
in them, but me personally, me, myself,

201
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,650
and I personally,
I have a trouble,

202
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:50,390
I'm infusing it into my daily snapchat
is one of them. I have tried you guys

203
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,993
snapchat.

204
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,260
Here's the thing that I have a problem
with generation in millennials and

205
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,130
generation social media,

206
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:01,360
which I'm a very firm part of is we feel
like everything we do is interesting

207
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,883
and it's not,

208
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,840
it's not like people all spend all day
on snapchat tell you exactly what they

209
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:11,920
did in every moment of their day. And I,
I'll log in to snapshot and I was black.

210
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:12,191
You know what?

211
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,730
Today's the day I'm going to give it a
try and I'm going to scroll through and

212
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:20,580
people are walking to the bus like,
yes, I'm walking to the bus. Dot. Okay.

213
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,610
And, and, and the filters are killing
me softly. You guys like the filters,

214
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,190
the flower filter, the
face. I'm just like,

215
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:31,240
why does everybody look like a cartoon
right now? So I have a snapchat account,

216
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,590
but I log into it like once a month and
I think I've snapchat at twice total.

217
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,920
And I do actually have on snapchat double
life because I'm in these random rooms

218
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:44,680
that I call myself Forrest Gump.
I do all of these interesting things.

219
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,330
That's you totally right. Like
can you believe it? But it's like,

220
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,990
you know what, catch me on Instagram,
catch me on Twitter. I'm on there.

221
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:57,730
Catch me on Facebook to add snapchat
towards a catch a moment by moment.

222
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,000
Thing of my day is just a lot.

223
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,910
Yeah.
And what about vlogging or youtube or

224
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,180
I have actively rejected
you to why I have job.

225
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,170
I said it had Google.

226
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,690
Um, I've, I've, I've made it a point
not to be on youtube because I did.

227
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,740
I don't like the community.

228
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,850
Well, this is something I wanted to talk
about because social media has tons of

229
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:29,350
upside. It is part of why you're here
today and part of why we know about you,

230
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,530
but it's also a place where there's a
lot of hate and a lot of misinformation.

231
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:40,210
Yep. And filter bubble. And I want to
talk about that experience. So, you know,

232
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,970
we're heartbroken.
You've rejected youtube wholesale.

233
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,800
Most of the people who aren't here today
are working on that and fixing it as we

234
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:52,100
speak. So we'd like you to give it a
try, uh, tomorrow or next week. Um,

235
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,920
but you know, what a, is your experience
both good and bad if you've been trolled,

236
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:01,330
have you been doxed have you been, you
know, harmed by social media personally,

237
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:06,130
and how do we,
how should we as owners of,

238
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:11,020
uh, some of the services that people
use, think about what we can do to,

239
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,530
without getting into censorship
and sort of, you know,

240
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:18,680
repressing people's feelings. How do we
create safe environments for, for people?

241
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,641
So,
okay.

242
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:24,110
So my decision to not do youtube has
been one because I hate editing stuff.

243
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,310
And again,
I don't want to just meet me talk.

244
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,690
You're lazy is the easiest
part of it. Oh, absolutely.

245
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,110
But then the second part is I hate the
community on there because that community

246
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:37,790
is so full of hate because at one point
it was where you can actually comment

247
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,950
anonymously.
Yup.

248
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,580
And what that spurs his keyboard courage
of people who decide that since they

249
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:47,280
are a number in a system, they can say
whatever they want as opposed to be,

250
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:48,420
it'd being attached to their name.

251
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:52,040
So a lot of my friends are youtube stars
and like people who've their following

252
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,820
on youtube, like Francesca Ramsey. Um,

253
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,860
and I used to see the comments
they would get all day,

254
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:01,010
every day and to avoid the comments they
would have to sit there and moderating

255
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:02,570
it either themselves,

256
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:06,950
which of course triggers all
types of like trauma and um,

257
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,740
or they just actively just be like,
I threw up a video.

258
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,520
I just never go back into my
comments section. And for me,

259
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the power of the Internet is connecting
with people and I think that's really

260
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:21,170
important. So I was like, you know
what, I'm a writer. I prefer to write,

261
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,790
I'll be riding. Y'all catch me there.
I don't want to do videos yet. Um,

262
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,080
and I know youtube started
fixing some of that.

263
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,880
I was never really recruited
to come back into the fold. Um,

264
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,750
consider this an invitation, an
invitation, come back into the fall.

265
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,060
Like I was using my Vimeo channel
because I was like, you know what,

266
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,680
I need store some video somewhere.

267
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,030
So I just didn't feel like youtube is a
place now in terms of the hate online in

268
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,780
trolling.
So as a black woman,

269
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,820
as a woman is one as a
black person is another,

270
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:51,650
as a black woman is another.
Um,

271
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,590
the type of feedback that we get on
social media is completely different from

272
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:58,790
everyone else. So this was tested out
by, people aren't on Twitter actually,

273
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:03,320
where they did like a week where they
change. They exchanged uh, avatars.

274
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,390
So black women and white men decides to
do this experiment and exchange avatars

275
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:13,391
and see how the difference in your Avatar
affects how the responses you get are.

276
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,710
And the white men who had the black woman
avatars for the week were stunned by

277
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:22,430
the type of vitriol they got for
simple stuff that they were saying.

278
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,350
For me as, um, aside I sources
and the professional shader,

279
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,660
I am lucky to not receive some of
the hate that a lot of people get.

280
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,280
Cause here's the thing, I can
beat you at that game. Like,

281
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,790
I've spent all my life being
shady, I could do this. But um,

282
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,240
I've been fortunate with the trolls are
afraid of you is the trolls don't come

283
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,420
at me as much as they come in to
other people. I will say that. Um,

284
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,980
but one thing that I've loved about my
social media platforms is people saying

285
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:54,830
that my community was reflects me,
which is

286
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,100
king compliment.
Um,

287
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,130
on no matter where I am on the Internet,
I like to keep my spaces clear,

288
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,160
full of hate and free of hate and as
safe as a space that you can get in a

289
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,094
public domain.

290
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,840
So my audience is also very protective
of the spaces that I've created.

291
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,090
So if any type of hate creeps through,

292
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:20,330
they handle it before I even get there
because they understand that this is one

293
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,610
of the few places you can go
and actually read the comments.

294
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:25,400
So how everyone else tells
you never read the comments.

295
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,140
You want to read the comments on my post,

296
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:30,200
on my Facebook or my Twitter
on anywhere that I am,

297
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,780
because my audience is super smart,
super thoughtful,

298
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,020
and they've managed to maintain a space
that is actually good and it shows the

299
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:41,240
best of humanity as opposed
to the rest of the Internet,

300
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:46,000
which kind of shows awfulness.
So I want to talk about filter bubble.

301
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,250
This contract you mentioned you don't
just like to preach to the choir,

302
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,210
right? That's part of what you do, but
you also want to reach people and um,

303
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,310
change people's minds.
Um,

304
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,080
this morning my wife showed me a site
called friends who like trump.com.

305
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,250
I don't know if you've seen this,

306
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,660
but it actually exposes your Facebook
friends who've actually liked Trump.

307
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:08,900
So I did a bit of unfriending
this morning. I can

308
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,180
only, I'm proud to say out of a
thousand or so friends I had eight.

309
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,310
And um, you know, most of whom I
either didn't know who they were or,

310
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,960
uh, hadn't spoken to them in 30
years. I did grow up in Michigan,

311
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:29,580
which can have little pockets of,
you know, purple state sort of. Um,

312
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,020
but uh, I did ask myself, you know, um,

313
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,510
am I perpetuating this filter bubble?

314
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:41,511
Is My feed now going to be filled with
stuff that I already believe and uh,

315
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:46,620
am I not getting exposure? Should I
be, should I have had more curiosity?

316
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:51,621
Is like why on earth would people
I know support a candidate who I,

317
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,100
let's just say I can't get behind who
was a walking Cheetos. You can say

318
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,220
the worst. Um, okay, so here's the thing.

319
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,800
I tell people off jump like my social
media platforms are not democracies there.

320
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,340
Dictatorships, I will delete
our block, our report as spam,

321
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,440
as at, at will. Okay.

322
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,500
And feel no guilt about it because
here's the thing is that's not a filter I

323
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:18,760
really even want to be a part of,

324
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,670
to be like clearing your
space of Trump supporters who,

325
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,390
that was one of the few things that
I draw the line. It's like, oh,

326
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:29,890
we can't be friends off jump. Okay.
Like there's no conversation here.

327
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:34,210
You support him because supporting him
means you support and tolerate hate and

328
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:39,211
misogyny and Islamophobia and
antisemitism and anti woman.

329
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:44,641
And it's just anti every thing that
is not straight white male and it's a

330
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:48,160
problem.
So you deleted those people.

331
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:50,980
I don't think it's necessarily creating
a filter bubble because here's the thing,

332
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,800
what do you learn from them
besides what you already know,

333
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,020
which is that hate does
exist in the world.

334
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,650
And even educated people who are
somewhat sensible and logical can still

335
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,030
tolerate awful things and
people who perpetuate that.

336
00:20:07,031 --> 00:20:11,640
And I don't have the capacity to even
do that. Like I don't, I am not a, um,

337
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,180
mediator. I'm not the person you
walk up to just like, oh my God,

338
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:20,650
let me see both sides. Oh No. I'm
very much biased about everything.

339
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,800
So yeah.
I've

340
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,690
heard you talk about the difference
between journalism and writing. Yeah.

341
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,080
You consider yourself a writer and it
sort of speaks to this a biased and proud

342
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,450
sort of attitude you have. Can you
talk a little bit, you know, uh, we,

343
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:40,380
we at Google we have things like Google
news and even our search results,

344
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:43,620
we work very hard to
make them fair and uh,

345
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,070
talk about journalism versus writing
and not only the role you have in that

346
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:53,140
spectrum, but where should Google
said it? Should we be opinionated or,

347
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,020
um,

348
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,400
so I do call myself a writer and not
a journalist because I feel like as a

349
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:04,401
journalist you do have to maintain some
level of like what objectivity and just

350
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:09,180
be like, you know what, I'm not
always going to choose sides.

351
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:12,120
I don't know how to do that.
I'm the person who can't write.

352
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:15,660
I can't write anything but op eds I can
give you, but there'll be fact base.

353
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,411
So for me,

354
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:19,590
I give myself the responsibility of making
sure I'm double checking to make sure

355
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:21,300
I'm not passing on fake news,

356
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,590
making sure that my opinion is
based on some fact that I heard.

357
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,000
So that is important. Um, as a company,

358
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,740
I understand if Google wants to
maintain like neutral ground,

359
00:21:34,741 --> 00:21:39,600
so it shows both sides.
But then as a person of opinion,

360
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,290
and I think as a leader in all things,

361
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:47,160
Google might need to one day step
up and say, actually this is the,

362
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,780
this is the lane that we pick. Like
if somebody goes into Google and, um,

363
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,050
wants to find a way to join a hate group,

364
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,750
I feel like it should be a little bit
more difficult for them to find it,

365
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,291
you know,

366
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,700
to find that type of information
because essentially you can serve up the

367
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:04,680
information to them on a platter and be
like, just because we're being impartial,

368
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,570
but what does that do for the
world? And how does that impact, um,

369
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,340
what the betterness of the world.

370
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:13,950
And I think Google is a company
that cares about that in some way.

371
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,310
Sort of make it that easy.
I feel like it would be a mistake.

372
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,640
Yup. The people that aren't working on
youtube or thinking about that, right.

373
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,510
But it is, I mean, you look at Google,

374
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,670
it's pretty clear we have a
very diverse workforce. Um,

375
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,420
just looking out at the
audience. Um, I'm kidding.

376
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,590
He was like,
I'm shit.

377
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,570
I wish this was representative of our
workforce. Unfortunately this is a

378
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,013
virus.

379
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,780
So, um, but we are working
on it. Uh, I think,

380
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,710
you know,
we have,

381
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,160
we're very much in a listening
and learning mode and as
we try to address this,

382
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,160
like any, uh, any advice on that front,

383
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,640
how do we actually create the people
who are creating these products?

384
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:09,880
How can they more represent
the world and the audiences?

385
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,030
Google and other tech companies
have got to start trying harder,

386
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,500
even harder than you are now.

387
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,880
Because here's the thing is I think,
I feel

388
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,900
like every company needs to reflect the
world as it is for the greater good of

389
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:27,560
that company too.
Because more diverse voices in the room,

390
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,210
your product is going to be even better
because you're getting all types of,

391
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:34,490
you would be like, have you thought about
this? That doesn't work. What about this?

392
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,230
And I think it's in your best
interest to get you some more color,

393
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,070
get you some more people of different
backgrounds who can be in a room and be

394
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:44,360
like, okay, this is what I think.

395
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,810
And then get shut out by
their coworkers who are white.

396
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,450
Um,
you know,

397
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:53,990
like even recently I was reading an
article about how the women in the White

398
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,570
House and the Obama administration have,
have formed like this bold tron when,

399
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,370
when they're in meetings,
if one woman says an idea,

400
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,000
another woman repeats it and then
somebody else repeats it, who's a woman,

401
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,070
just so the idea is not given to a man.

402
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,760
Cause we'd been enough rooms where we
say something and everyone's like, eh.

403
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,990
And then the dude says it and they
were like, great idea. You like word.

404
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:18,860
Like I didn't just say that four times.
So in that type of a way,

405
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:23,130
I think I'm tech companies need to
one, if not even necessarily, um,

406
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,190
them having a conscious bias to be like,

407
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:27,590
I'm just only going to hire white people.
That's not it.

408
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,460
We tend to engage with people who
are in close proximity with us.

409
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,250
People who look like us,
who are like in our immediate circles.

410
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:36,680
So those are the people we end up,
uh,

411
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,710
tell him they have job opportunities
and those people end up,

412
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:44,711
I'm basically applying what needs to
happen is the very pointed and focused

413
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,230
attempt to go outside of that proximity.

414
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,100
Like go to places where you haven't been
asked people who don't look like Doug's

415
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:54,450
executive team and honestly
get some black void,

416
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:59,000
your executive team to y'all need
that. Um, but I think it's a,

417
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:02,360
it's a process that needs to start
now and people need to be very, uh,

418
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,220
very prioritizing the about it.

419
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,130
Like it shouldn't be one of the things
I was like, if it happens, it happens.

420
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:11,420
It needs to be like a focus. Yeah.
Because in what, 2030 or 2040,

421
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,640
there's going to be no ethic
majority in the, in the country.

422
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,970
So it behooves Google and Facebook
and Twitter and all of them.

423
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,820
Apple, like everybody needs to
start making it a point to fine.

424
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,220
And it's not a quarter system.
It's not you being like,

425
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:28,790
well we need more black people. We
need for Latinos, for Asians. No,

426
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,090
you want to find people who qualify
and they're out there. Like people say,

427
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,630
I can't find black techies,
I can't find Latino techies.

428
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,830
There are Twitter lists of people who
have 500 best says black techies at the

429
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:46,190
top.
So we're out here where we exist and be,

430
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,150
we do have some competence in search,
so we ought to be,

431
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,400
oh, okay. Like Google is like the
search Kane of the entire universe.

432
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:58,630
Okay. Not even an earth. They're
probably aliens is using Google. Um,

433
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:04,310
so you have no excuse not to be able to
find and find the people who are good.

434
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,263
Yeah.

435
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,330
Cool.
Um,

436
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:15,020
so you have the spirit of uh,
putting us on the spot. Yeah.

437
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,590
Me In particular, I want to share
something you recently wrote another day,

438
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:21,480
another Hashtag white people,

439
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,860
you gotta get to work now
about the killings of black
people by law enforcement.

440
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,870
You say white people, I'm talking
to you. This is your problem to fix.

441
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,220
Y'All got some work to do
because the system that y'all
keep on privileging from,

442
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,120
you've got to help us dismantle it because
those of us who are black and Brown,

443
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:43,770
we have tried, you created this robot
in it is yours to deactivate my skin.

444
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:48,300
Folk don't have the passcode. This
is your monster to slay word. Yeah.

445
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,250
So,
um,

446
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,370
for those of us that agree,
where do we start?

447
00:26:57,371 --> 00:27:01,630
How do we become better at
helping slay the monster?

448
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,480
Yeah, you got to slay the dragon man. Um,

449
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,560
it's a multistep process and I think it
comes from we can change policy all day

450
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:12,770
everyday,
but if policy is changed,

451
00:27:12,771 --> 00:27:16,930
but the hearts of the people who are
in these spaces when force it don't,

452
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:19,030
nothing happens. So the, the,

453
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:24,031
the real deep belief that it is the
job of white people to fix racism.

454
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,710
Because if we could have fixed it by now,
we would have done it.

455
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,600
And we have tried. So one listening, um,

456
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,240
I've seen enough conversations
where people are like,

457
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:41,050
here's how I felt when this
issue happened. And somebody
walks in and be like,

458
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:43,030
well, maybe you're just
looking at it the wrong way.

459
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,670
I was telling you how I thought about it,

460
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:50,230
but here you are trying to argue me
down about my opinion and my feelings,

461
00:27:50,231 --> 00:27:53,350
which feelings are valid.
So one,

462
00:27:53,351 --> 00:27:57,040
listening to when these things happen, a
lot of times people will say, you know,

463
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,240
I don't know what else to say at this
point is getting even worse if you don't

464
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:05,230
know what to say. Amplify the
voices of those who do. So you know,

465
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,800
lending your platform to people
who are able to say, you know what,

466
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,700
this is how it's affected me. This is
what I think we need to do. So Linda,

467
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:14,890
your platforms,
the black and brown voices,

468
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,560
I also think people need to put
their money where their hearts are.

469
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,690
People have money.
Silicone valley has money at the minimum.

470
00:28:22,691 --> 00:28:27,280
Help donate to antiracist organisations
and people who are actively doing the

471
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:28,990
work to fix it.

472
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,920
People who need the resources and
you will need to get in the room. Um,

473
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,880
that's important.

474
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,890
And then some of us have all these
platforms to speak up, speak up.

475
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,520
Um, use it. Cause here's the
thing, I don't have a job. Okay.

476
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,390
Have them say something. Nobody's going
to be like love you, you're fired.

477
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,440
So it is in my best interest to use my
voice because I don't have anything to

478
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:52,210
lose there.
Um,

479
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,040
and also one thing that we need to do
because it's like right here it's lowest

480
00:28:57,041 --> 00:29:01,390
common denominator is our friends and
our family members when they say hateful

481
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:05,920
things about people who are not
in our group who are marginalized,

482
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,500
it is,
we have to say something and you know,

483
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:12,050
you know what we do when we see some
stupid stuff and Facebook will like scroll

484
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,020
and we'll like scroll past
and roll eyes and be like,

485
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,390
Oh I hate the fact that they just
said that but we never confronted.

486
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,730
So that person thinks it's okay.

487
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,230
So even across the dinner table when
somebody is saying something hateful,

488
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,730
it is in that moment.

489
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:28,360
You have to let them know
you can't tolerate it because
that means if you let it

490
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:31,900
happen and you say nothing, you are
saying it is fine, it should happen.

491
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:36,670
Just like that huffing and puffing
is not enough actively being like,

492
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:40,480
hey, that's actually not an okay
statement, here's why you're wrong. Um,

493
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,800
and I wrote that piece a lot of actually
got a lot of notes and in the two weeks

494
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:48,190
afterwards from people who've been like,
I've actually taken that on.

495
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:50,560
One of my friends emailed me and said,
um,

496
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,190
her husband's father always says
something racist every time.

497
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,180
And he just scrolls past it and shakes
his head and Facebook and he's like, ah.

498
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,700
That irritates me.
After I wrote that piece,

499
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,190
his father puts him like racist joke up
and he sends him a three paragraph email

500
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,040
about how that was not okay.
And she was like,

501
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,370
I just want to say thank you because he
told me to let you know that the reason

502
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:14,350
he did he did that was
because he read your piece.

503
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:18,580
And he realized that he can't be quiet
anymore about it. So even small things,

504
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,680
we don't all have to start
a nonprofit organizations.

505
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:22,420
We don't have to be the ones marching,

506
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,920
but we can do stuff in our everyday lives
that actually can move the needle just

507
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:27,670
a little bit.

508
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,780
Yeah, I really, that was, that
was some amazing practical advice.

509
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,160
I wasn't actually expecting,

510
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,220
expecting that much actionable stuff that
I think all of us can do in this room,

511
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,290
in this company and in this world.
Um,

512
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,240
I know for me one of the
challenges was sort of, um,

513
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,280
coming to grips with how much
I had to learn. And for me,

514
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:56,670
a lot of it was really in taking this
unconscious bias training where I sort of

515
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:00,900
walked in their sleepwalking
walking, like, you know, uh,

516
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,090
not expecting to be rattled
or shaken by what happened.

517
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:07,870
But what was really revealed was a lot
of the societal conditioning that had

518
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:11,550
sort of, even me, a good
guy who's trying, you know,

519
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:16,070
to be part of the solution. There's a lot
of deep work we have to do. Right. Um,

520
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,570
that, you know, it was very
humbling in a lot of ways.

521
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,340
It sort of like the last thing I wanted
to do once that part of me was out there

522
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,260
was sort of um,

523
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:30,160
get up and pretend to be part of the
solution when I understood I was part of

524
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:34,810
the problem. Right. And I think the answer
is sort of both. You know, like, um,

525
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,840
when I first started really concentrating
my team on some issues around

526
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:43,090
diversity and inclusion,
um,

527
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,530
I reached out to a friend of mine who's
been doing this work for really 30 plus

528
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:51,790
years and she was sort of like,
welcome to the conversation, you know,

529
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:55,690
it was um, um, people, there
are professionals, you know,

530
00:31:55,691 --> 00:32:00,520
there are people who have spent careers
and lifetimes thinking about these

531
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:05,350
problems and you know, I know a lot
of us are waking up for the moment,

532
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:08,290
for the first time,
but it's important to sort of plug in.

533
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:12,130
And I think your suggestion even didn't
just give resource, whether that's money,

534
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:12,964
time,

535
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,030
technology platforms to those people
who are professionals and have actually

536
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,350
spent a lifetime thinking
about some of these things.

537
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:24,250
Is really important for those of
us that are quickly catching up. So

538
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,770
I mean, I think part of
the thing is, you know,

539
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:29,040
when you start talking about race
and you start talking about like

540
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,750
responsibility of white people,

541
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,080
a lot of times people feel accused like
they're personally the ones who are

542
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,050
being racist. But here's thing that
people have to understand is privilege.

543
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,480
No matter what it is your privilege is,
you know,

544
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:46,760
like I have a bunch of privileges,
I have class privilege,

545
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:51,230
I have a sexual orientation privilege,
I have gender identity, privilege, um,

546
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,770
religion, privileged. So I,

547
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,220
there's certain things that I need to
understand that in all of these systems

548
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:02,360
because I am a part of it and I benefit
from it, I am a part of the problem.

549
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,860
And it's not a loving, you did this one
thing that was wrong to this person. It's,

550
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:10,880
you are part of the system that even
though you might not have contributed

551
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:11,930
personally to,

552
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,400
you still have to help fix it because
you're in a position where you can

553
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:20,200
influence stuff and you can,
I can be in a room where, um,

554
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,460
I am one of the,
um,

555
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,110
I'm going to assume that most people
knew are Christians and that gives me a

556
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:28,940
safe space to talk about my religion.

557
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,770
But if somebody is there who's
Muslim and they feel like they're,

558
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,340
they're not safe because
they're in this space,

559
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,810
it's my job as somebody who is of
the majority group to make them feel

560
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:40,910
comfortable and welcome. Like
I can't just be like, well,

561
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:42,080
it's not my fault cause I don't really,

562
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,850
I ain't say nothing bad
about Muslims today.

563
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:47,000
So last night I ain't got
nothing to do with me know, like,

564
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,910
so I think it's really important
to use it privileges, um,

565
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,250
to basically help marginalized people.

566
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,560
And also part of what we start learning
about privilege and our space and the

567
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,720
space that we take up in the world,
um,

568
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:03,380
is that we are lucky one,

569
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,620
we've done nothing to be in
these spaces a lot of times.

570
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,490
Like I was born Christian, I
was, I've never been poor. Um,

571
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,870
so for me it's like, okay, I can't take
credit for that. I can't do like, well,

572
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,090
you know, I earned it. I didn't, I didn't,

573
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:19,370
it gave me a lot of things
that I worked for him.

574
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:22,510
But also you have to unlearn
a lot of things like you,

575
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,310
you realize that we've
been programmed so well.

576
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:30,670
Then in the process of fixing it means
you have to unlearn stuff as in dump that

577
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:34,430
out your head. That is not
what the world is really about.

578
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:37,760
And that's the really hard part of
unlearning everything you've known for the

579
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:39,860
right way for how many years
you've been on this earth.

580
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:43,310
So you just kinda gotta commit to it.
It's not going to be easy.

581
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:46,400
It's an ego is a drop kick to your ego
when you realize you're part of the

582
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:50,060
problem. It is, it's like damn,
I didn't know I was that person.

583
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,690
You are now, now that you
know that you are that person,

584
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,130
how do you not become that person?

585
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:58,690
How do you make sure somebody else would
not hurt by your personhood? And uh,

586
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:01,670
once the night she wrote about in my
book was um, has, I want to hear it.

587
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:03,110
You heard about the privilege exercise.

588
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,970
I feel like every company
in Silicone Valley,

589
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:10,220
actually every company in general
needs to make this happen.

590
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,150
So the privilege exercise changed my
life and how I looked at the world and I

591
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:18,200
was a counseling center paraprofessional
when I was in college, trained, um,

592
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,910
to be a peer counselor.

593
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:24,911
But the whole first semester was us
learning about who we are and the space we

594
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:25,700
take up.

595
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,140
And literally we spent a whole six months
talking about ourselves and who we are

596
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,680
unpacking them. So one thing we
did with the privilege exercise,

597
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:38,100
so everyone starts in the same line.
Okay,

598
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:41,430
you started the same line and they
make a statement, you the step forward,

599
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:45,540
a step back. So a statement would
be something like step forward.

600
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,680
If you've never had to worry about
somebody in mispronouncing your name,

601
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,460
people step forward, step back if
you've never worried about, if you've,

602
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,190
if you sometimes worried about
where your next meal is coming from,

603
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:59,790
somebody steps back, you know, step up
if you can marry the person you love.

604
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,720
So it's a series of questions.
Sometimes it's like 20 questions,

605
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:08,670
sometimes it's 50 at the end of the
privilege exercise they say stop and look

606
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,000
around the room and see where you
are in relation to other people.

607
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:17,270
So sometimes I found myself for more
higher to the front than I actually

608
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:21,600
imagined I would be and
some of my classmates in the
back. And I was like, wow,

609
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,730
you're behind me. And it gives you the
perspective of understanding like, okay,

610
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:31,380
so the privilege exercise, you get
to actually get to figure out, wow,

611
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,600
I'm behind a lot of people.

612
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:37,590
I never would have thought that or I'm
actually way luckier than I thought I was.

613
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,390
And it teaches you about who the people
you're around are and also some of their

614
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:45,870
struggles because some of my classmates
who are white girls were behind me.

615
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,620
And I was like, I wonder
why. So we got to unpack it.

616
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,910
I feel like it's really important for
companies to do this cause give your

617
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:57,360
employees a chance to understand where
they are in the world and what they fit

618
00:36:57,361 --> 00:37:00,230
in. Because sometimes in these
rooms, the people of color,

619
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,230
the people who are different January
to LGBT people might not feel like they

620
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:07,140
have room to even step up
and say something to you
because they might get shut

621
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:07,974
down.

622
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,820
And the people who were saying things
never understand that they take up a lot

623
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:15,780
of room all the time and don't
give them for other people.

624
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:21,020
So it's a way to kind of recalibrate
and get folks to understand that I might

625
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:24,480
need to either shut up more,
wanting to step up more,

626
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,010
or I need to like advocate for more
people or I need to be the one that's like

627
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:30,630
advocating for myself more.

628
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,930
I think it will be good for Google
to do it for a couple of people. Wow,

629
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,890
that's a great exercise.
Yeah.

630
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,650
MMM.

631
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,490
What I want to do.

632
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,340
We've got a couple of mics up here and
we do want to make this interactive.

633
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:46,640
So as you think of your questions,
while you're doing that,

634
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:50,210
I want to invite lovey too.
If you're willing and open to it.

635
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:54,500
Maybe read a section of your book,
do a little reading for us. Yes,

636
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,560
I can do a reading and
I'm trying to figure out,

637
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,510
should I do one for, okay. So my, my book
is, is a broken up into four sections.

638
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:08,090
Live culture, social media
and fame. Now each section,

639
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:10,040
so the life is like full of shenanigans.

640
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,030
The culture section I talk about
like racism, homophobia, religion,

641
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,500
social media section. I'm talking about
Hashtag I hate your hashtag abuse.

642
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,070
Uh,
Facebook is my favorite soap opera.

643
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,520
A dumbed down news.

644
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,780
How does succeed in business failure?
Real g's move in silence.

645
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,460
So what section would you
like me to read from? Okay,

646
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,100
Gotcha. All right, let's do it. That
was pretty unanimous. All right.

647
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,300
So I actually just basically
give you a run down in the, uh,

648
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,770
let's see.
I think I'll do religion.

649
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,190
Uh,
yeah,

650
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,590
I have a chapter on rape culture
and here I'd just be, I went in,

651
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,350
uh, I'm trying to see
what I haven't touched on.

652
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,640
Privilege. Racism. Okay. So

653
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,293
yeah,

654
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,840
I wrote my, a piece of my racism
sec chapter while I was, while

655
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,530
it was like a week after the Charleston
shooting and it was that night a church

656
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,370
had been set on fire in
South Carolina and I was, uh,

657
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,130
moved to right cause I
was just like so angry.

658
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,443
MMM.

659
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,310
In Charleston,
South Carolina,

660
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:40,850
a small Bible study group was praying
to the Lord and otherwise uneventful.

661
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:44,360
Wednesday at Emanuel Ame Church,
the oldest black church in the south,

662
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:47,840
a white supremacist walked
in and pretending to want
to pray with them and then

663
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:50,960
pull the gun out and murdered nine
black worshipers in cold blood.

664
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,210
It an invasion of a place of refuge,

665
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:56,960
of violation of a little safe space and
definitive proof that there is still a

666
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,430
war on black people in America.

667
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:02,840
Nowhere is safe for us and the work that
has been done over half a century to

668
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:04,430
get us closer to equality has regressed.

669
00:40:04,431 --> 00:40:08,030
And it feels like we're back to where
we started and now another one of our

670
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:13,031
churches is burning and this was 2005
Americans treat and black people like

671
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:16,040
vermin and it's hard not to feel
like we're unwanted, unsafe.

672
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,870
It's open season on black people in
that was not some lone gunman who walked

673
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:21,800
into manual Amie.

674
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,060
He represents the ongoing commitment to
keep us in our place of violent reminder

675
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,670
that we are not safe,
we're not safe in the streets,

676
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:30,530
in our homes at the park or at church,

677
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,110
and I'm fucked up about it because
this was supposed to be history,

678
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:33,944
not the present.

679
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,820
And I feel the anger from the top of my
head is reverberates down to my toes.

680
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,590
This rage makes my skin burn. I feel the
fire in my bones. This is racist men.

681
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:44,290
It's worse, it's ugly, demented and vile.

682
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:48,320
It's also permeates every fiber of what
the United States is made of and it's

683
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,180
what's build the
foundation of this country.

684
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,010
Okay?

685
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:55,220
It's truly exhausted and I'm not sure
if I'm thankful for the undeniable proof

686
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:58,520
that racism is still around us or wishful
for the days when we could be tricked

687
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:00,830
into thinking things were not so bad,

688
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:05,030
but racism is not just random individuals
burning churches and black people

689
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,360
being gunned down the street is a
system of oppression that is so deep and

690
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:12,740
omnipresent that it seeps into every
single aspect of our lives and it is as

691
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:16,220
American as Apple Pie. Drizzle with
canned cheese, top of French fries,

692
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,290
the red stripes on the flag.

693
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:21,080
I really the blood of black and brown
people in many centuries after the

694
00:41:21,081 --> 00:41:24,320
country's creation,
these stains still have not faded.

695
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,830
And let's pause here to say the
racism in America is a stupid as hell.

696
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,100
Racism and prejudice anywhere is dumber,

697
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,580
but it makes no sense
because it's just absurd.

698
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,840
The United States of America is a
country founded on the labor and literal

699
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:42,670
bodies of black and brown people who
are minding their own business. Well,

700
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:45,050
white folks came forth
to kill an exploit them.

701
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,850
This is a place that was discovered by a
dude who didn't know how to read a map.

702
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,640
So he just showed up
on some short thought.

703
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:56,570
He was in India and then proceeds
a plant a flag and go, Tada.

704
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,540
Know what Christopher Columbus needed
was a compass and a clue for being

705
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,410
aggressively mediocre.

706
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,550
But he has a federal holiday in his honor.

707
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,960
He showed up on someone else's property
and claimed it as his because he didn't

708
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,220
know what it was.

709
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,290
This country started off all the way
wrong and continued in the same fashion.

710
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,110
Okay. I feel like Chris
need a Google maps. Okay,

711
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:26,170
like you in the wrong place or this is
not India hot mess and we celebrate hill.

712
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,520
We celebrate him. This is
the, this is so American.

713
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,640
And then Chris, lot of native Americans
wiping out a whole, whole tries.

714
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:38,480
Pillaging the people in called the
Thanksgiving and then to add to the mess,

715
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:41,660
the Dude Bros realized that he didn't
have the ability to build dope shit on

716
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:44,520
their own. So they went to African
capture. Black people are them,

717
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,500
brought them here to be their slaves after
killing millions on the journey here.

718
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,260
Because if you want to
out terrible yourself,

719
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,550
you stuck millions of human beings
inside ships, refuse to feed them,

720
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,400
let them lie in their home field
and then let them die in droves.

721
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,460
So not only did you steal someone else's
home and then killed them when they

722
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:02,660
showed you kindness,

723
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,440
you went elsewhere and then did some
more steel in this time of actual people,

724
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,000
you forced them to come to your stolen
has to do your work for you. I mean,

725
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,720
you're welcome for this too long. Didn't
read version of parallelism in America,

726
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,920
but this is why I should teach.
Okay?

727
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,530
I wouldn't do any worse than current
textbooks like the ones in Texas.

728
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:25,850
They use the words workers instead
of slaves in the section about the

729
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:27,770
transatlantic slave trade,

730
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,180
they call them workers as if black people
were at a career fair in Africa where

731
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:36,140
we submitted resumes and asked to be
beaten and starved and have our families

732
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:39,260
broken in exchange for a journey
across the ocean with no money.

733
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:43,850
Like this is not linkedin.
Why we're not workers. Okay.

734
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,120
So my point is that the United States
does not have a legitimate history of

735
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:48,290
integrity and fairness.

736
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,410
It's been run by villains that
make Disney's look like saints.

737
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,580
Racism is not a byproduct as much as it's
the foundational stock in the American

738
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:55,941
soup.

739
00:43:55,941 --> 00:44:00,020
And this is why black people are still
fighting to be recognized in our food for

740
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:03,470
humanity is success of the country
has been based on our oppression.

741
00:44:03,471 --> 00:44:07,760
So of course it is forever fresh out of
dam to give it by black lives and we are

742
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:10,820
left agree for those. We've lost
the grubby hands of white supremacy.

743
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:15,500
We rage about the perpetual
cycle of mourning we find
ourselves in and we wonder

744
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:17,720
what we need to do to be
secure in our own skins.

745
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,353
Wow.

746
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,130
Powerful ideas but also powerful
writing. I was really, thank you.

747
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,170
Okay. Questions from you?
We have to mix up there.

748
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,510
Googlers aren't shy usually, right?
Don't be shy. I have a lot of practice.

749
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:43,770
We have this event called Tgi F,
which we hold on Thursday. Of course.

750
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:49,110
Um, and uh, we, we have these mics up
there and people are always asking,

751
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:52,740
our founders in leadership are
pretty much anything calling,

752
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,490
telling it like it is. It is a
great tradition. So questions.

753
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,300
Thank you.
So first queen,

754
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:03,510
just want to honor you and thank you
for existing and being here. Jay,

755
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:07,470
share and help lift us all up.
Also on acknowledge.

756
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:11,400
I wish this room was completely full
because you deserve all of the 60,000

757
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:15,930
Googlers listening to you. Um, so there's
that. But actually do have a question.

758
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,150
My question is as Google works on
trying to continue to diversify,

759
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:26,790
so we actually have people working here
that reflect the people we serve around

760
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,624
the world.

761
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,410
How can we also change the culture so
people are allowing us to be ourselves?

762
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,550
I feel like what you said earlier about
speaking straight, not padding things,

763
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:40,770
a lot of sugar,
it really resonated with me.

764
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,490
I think one of the things I find hardest
to be here is that I need to put so

765
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:48,180
much sugar on the front and the backend.
I can't even call it a sticker sandwich.

766
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,013
It's like a cake.

767
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:54,740
So how can we as a people and as allies
help people understand that it's not the

768
00:45:56,581 --> 00:46:00,870
same lens. You can't bring in all
these different cultures, Africans,

769
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:04,330
African Americans, Latinos, Filipinos, um,

770
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:09,590
anyone who's not white and expect us to
act white and a company that is majorily

771
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,910
white.
So communication is cultural.

772
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:19,100
That's one thing that I think a lot
of people of color struggle with and

773
00:46:19,101 --> 00:46:23,990
companies like this communication is
cultural for me. I'm a very direct person.

774
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,560
If I need to send you an email, I'm
going to be like, Hey, what's up?

775
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:31,340
So here's what I need from
you. People prefer, hey,

776
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:34,190
so I hope your day was going well.

777
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,110
I was wondering if you could possibly
do this for me. Who has that time?

778
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,250
Why gotta like layered it with
1500 can I just get to the point?

779
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:44,090
And then people were like,
well,

780
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:47,480
you were kind of short and email because
I asked you a question as opposed to

781
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:52,481
like went through a three
paragraph diatribe about
how you doing girl wandering

782
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:54,680
or how was your weekend?
Honestly,

783
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:57,680
people need to understand that
different communications, um,

784
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,680
skills and different ways people talk.

785
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:04,340
And email is not an
affront to you as a person.

786
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,940
Like if I was to send you a two
paragraph email because I am on the go,

787
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,710
that's not me being short with you.
That's me being on the go.

788
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,610
And I think a lot of black will end up
being the on the go type style and their

789
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:21,080
coworkers and the bean. Like I felt like
that was very short of you. Honestly,

790
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:25,310
there needs to be a little bit more
um, people, he's got their feelings.

791
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,550
That's important.
Get out your feelings as a coworker.

792
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,670
Like somebody sends you an email
in the, you're like, you know what?

793
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:33,460
I felt kind of short. You can ask
him, be like, hey are you okay?

794
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,820
As opposed to like I hear a lot of
passive aggressive stuff happening.

795
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,120
People get out your feelings.
If I sent you a two paragraph,

796
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,220
two sentence email cause I need something,

797
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,740
it doesn't mean I don't want
to know how well you're doing.

798
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:48,550
It means in that moment it's quick. So I
think Google might want to do some more,

799
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,140
a different communication styles. Oh,
you know the one thing that helps, okay,

800
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:58,120
so this is website called 16
personalities.com that allows you to do a

801
00:47:58,121 --> 00:48:02,230
personality test and if you
work closely with any team,

802
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,480
have everybody on the team
do this personality test,

803
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,040
it'll break it down and be like,
okay,

804
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:10,180
so you'll tell you exactly how that
person who sits next to you communicates

805
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:13,900
their, the person who is always on the
go, they're very direct there. Like it'll,

806
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,110
it'll even break it down to the commander
did the command at the diplomat of the

807
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:17,944
mediator.

808
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,180
That helps too for you to understand
how your coworkers like to receive

809
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:24,220
information,
how they pass it on to.

810
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:28,990
It is not a front to you learn who
you're like working next to and then as

811
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:31,660
opposed to people having,
it's like temporary and they
put them in sugar cakes.

812
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,610
Who has time? You guys, come on,
let's do my work and send less emails.

813
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,910
That's also important. Stop email
people for everything. Jesus.

814
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,300
I think part of the problem,
we're all commanders.

815
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,320
What happens if one commander is like,
Oh man, I just got commanded too hard.

816
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:54,530
Okay. Another question.
Uh, so lovey again,

817
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,920
just to mimic a Sarah, uh,
her, some of her comments, uh,

818
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:01,090
just thank you for coming here and
making time for us. I'm not playing here,

819
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:06,170
so my name's Howard and I think, um,
I'd be really curious to hear about.

820
00:49:06,171 --> 00:49:09,140
So there's various domains of types of
work that we could be doing right to kind

821
00:49:09,141 --> 00:49:11,590
of fight institutionalized racism and,
um,

822
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:15,920
kind of address the racial climate in
general in this country. And you know,

823
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:20,150
so you can send emails, you can protest,
you can strategize about policy change,

824
00:49:20,151 --> 00:49:24,110
you can mentor,
you can kind of just be a,

825
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:27,620
even just a shoulder for folks to
crying, you know, cry on and mourn.

826
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,380
And so there's all this
diversity, different things
that we could be doing right.

827
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,250
And I think society kind
of, um, conditions us to,

828
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,420
to maybe want to do some things more
than others because maybe some of these

829
00:49:38,421 --> 00:49:41,090
things might be more risky or challenging,
for instance. So, for example,

830
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:44,560
for many of us maybe protesting and
getting pepper sprayed in the eyes,

831
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,500
it's kind of like, ah, I don't want to do
that. Um, but like maybe if you say like,

832
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:51,790
I can volunteer at, you know, an
Oakland impact hub. Sure. I'll do that.

833
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,110
That sounds reasonable. Right. Um,

834
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:59,570
given the problems that we have
given how minimal amount of, uh,

835
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:02,390
of the workers there are for us,
you know, to address the problems,

836
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,030
what would you say is
like the, the most, the,

837
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,210
the most important,

838
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:12,380
I guess prioritize domain of type of
work that we really need to focus on in

839
00:50:12,381 --> 00:50:14,480
order to get shit done,
right? Like there's,

840
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:17,360
there's tiny different things we can
do and I love the approach of like, oh,

841
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:20,750
just like way your talents and gifts and
whatever. Like you're really good at it.

842
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:21,584
That's what she's doing,

843
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,310
I think.
I think there's no one thing to do.

844
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,640
It needs to be a mortal layered approach.

845
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,030
Knowing what you're good at and where
you can fit in though makes a difference.

846
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:34,430
So I already know I'm not going to be
the person on the front line getting

847
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,960
pepper sprayed out.
I'm not about that life.

848
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,730
I give props to the people who
are my job in this movement.

849
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:45,230
If anything is to tell the stories and
right. I'm just not built for that.

850
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,420
And which means like the people who do
that are actively putting their bodies on

851
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:52,310
the line and for them it is.

852
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,810
We owe them to make sure they're supported
and the work that they're doing is

853
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:59,600
not in vain because if their stand on
these front lines getting pepper sprayed,

854
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:03,020
it better be for a reason and we better
be working to make sure that doesn't

855
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:07,280
keep happening to them. So it means
if your job is to write policy,

856
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,140
you are the policy person.
Yes.

857
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:13,280
Make sure that people who are the who
are in Capitol Hill are changing laws.

858
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,020
If your job is to tell stories,

859
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,990
tell these stories and make sure people
are understanding what's happening in

860
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:21,050
these streets. What's really happening
now with the media is reporting.

861
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:24,650
If your job is, if you just have so much
money, you don't know what to do with it,

862
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,910
give it to some of these people who
can then turn that money into something

863
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:29,744
concrete.

864
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:33,200
So it really comes down to you don't
have to force yourself to do something

865
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:36,560
that's outside the realm of your interest,
your passion, what you're good at,

866
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,400
whatever that is, you could find a
way that's going to help. So again,

867
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,180
find what it is,

868
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,620
where you fit in that place and
do it and kick ass in that way.

869
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,680
So I already know I'm not built for the
life of being on the front lines little,

870
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:55,610
okay.
I know I wouldn't even make it.

871
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:58,970
I am not built for it. So yeah, like
you have to support in whatever way,

872
00:51:58,971 --> 00:52:01,520
you know how as opposed to you being like,

873
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:04,760
well I have to be the person that that
no you don't. They're amazing people.

874
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:07,970
Like uh, black youth project 100
which I have to give a shout out too.

875
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,790
If you want to know some organizations
who are doing amazing work,

876
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:14,870
who are making sure the Chicago Police
Department is actually been held

877
00:52:14,871 --> 00:52:18,410
accountable. There's black youth
project 100 there's dream defenders.

878
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,690
There is Assata's daughters,

879
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,330
so these are people who you
can be giving your money to,

880
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:26,840
who will show where the money's going.
Yeah.

881
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:31,420
Okay. Yes, please. Good morning. Thank
you so much for being here today.

882
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:33,310
When I saw it on the calendar,
you're going to be here.

883
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:36,550
I got super excited because my book clubs
when talking about your book for the

884
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,770
last month, so thank you
for being here. Yeah.

885
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,370
My question to you is how do you
get over that first step of fear?

886
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,940
I feel like people will have voices,
they want to say something.

887
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,090
But as you alluded to earlier,
maybe you don't want to say it at work,

888
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:52,780
we're losing your job or changing in
your world and your friends becoming

889
00:52:52,781 --> 00:52:55,540
different, and how do you get over
that, that sense of fear that you have,

890
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,940
that you feel like you should
be saying something you want to,

891
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:02,660
but you're worried that you're going
to let go of in the process. Um, fears,

892
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:06,350
one of those things that fear itself will
cripple you from doing whatever it is.

893
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,330
And then when you do it and push past it,

894
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,620
you understand that you were more afraid
of the theme then how it really was.

895
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,940
So here's the thing. There are oftentimes
when I write a piece that I'll be like,

896
00:53:16,941 --> 00:53:21,710
oh my gosh, am I sure I want
to publish this? And I'll
sit on it. I hesitate on it.

897
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:25,920
But every single time I press publish,
the response I get, lets me know, yes,

898
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:27,720
you're supposed to do that.
Because here's the thing,

899
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,570
as a person who was thinking about
that thing that you want to talk about,

900
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:33,390
that scary, you're probably not
the only person thinking about it.

901
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:37,410
You are probably amongst people who
are also afraid to say the same thing,

902
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,520
but sometimes all it needs is that one
person to cut through to be like, Hey,

903
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,370
I feel like this is wrong,
or I feel like this is,

904
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,090
and then you'll see the people who
buy. Finally somebody said it, okay,

905
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:49,200
I come back her up now.

906
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:53,250
I think it just comes down to push it
past and if it's important enough for you,

907
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,770
say it,
you know you can,

908
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,340
you can put it in the sugar cake if
that makes it fine in that meeting,

909
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,590
but making sure that point is made because
a lot of times people do the things

910
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:09,540
that they don't even realize
a harp harmful or they
don't understand what damage

911
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:13,320
is doing and they just need to be called
on it to be like, oh, I didn't even know.

912
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,190
Okay, you right. You might have to
be the scape goat. You just be like,

913
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,910
I'm going to say it. I'm going to
say it because this is how I feel.

914
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,860
This is a valid thing to do and I
feel like it would actually push this

915
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:26,550
conversation forward. She's got to do
it. It's not going to be like less scary.

916
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,230
You don't have to like, ah, I'm scared
shitless, but I'm doing anyway. Okay guys,

917
00:54:31,231 --> 00:54:34,470
I don't think this is a good
idea and even just doing that,

918
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,640
you just have to power through
it. Like it. Thank you. Yeah.

919
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,830
Okay.
I can see we have more questions.

920
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:44,040
I think this is the way we're going
to do this. I'm unfortunately,

921
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:47,520
we're out of time and I know that there
are people who need to set up this for

922
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:51,030
lunch. This is also our
lunch room. Um, so, uh,

923
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:53,910
we'll take one more
question and she's here.

924
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,870
That's what I was going to say is we're
going to feed her and show her a Google

925
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:01,830
bike and a little bit of a tour. So, um,

926
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,670
those of you who want to,
I think it's okay with you if a,

927
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,340
we have a little private time with you
by the side of the stage afterwards,

928
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,290
but we'll do one more formal
question and then, uh,

929
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:15,660
we'll hand this room back over.
So, uh, one more question please.

930
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,340
Hi.
I first wanted to say thank you.

931
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:20,860
I'm not quite sure what I'm thanking
you for it, but thank you. Um,

932
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,940
and then I'm not sure if I have a
question or a statement that's two quick

933
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:28,140
things. Um, first you talked
about diversity and Google.

934
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:33,270
Um, I received a question from a friend
of mine who said, you work at Google.

935
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,370
How did you get that job?

936
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,050
And I was just absolutely amazed
because I said I applied. Um,

937
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:46,830
and um, I will say that I'm a high
school dropout, never been to college,

938
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,430
never taken any technical courses,
left high school in 11th grade.

939
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:54,300
But I have enough confidence to
say I'm good, I'm intelligent.

940
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:55,470
I applied.

941
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,800
But I think it's a statement is that
I think Google needs to give people

942
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:07,440
permission to apply. I think we need to
do more reaching out to people and say,

943
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,430
Hey, I don't care if you're this, I
don't care if you're that applied.

944
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,660
We can't just wait for people to
come to us. Um, because they'll say,

945
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:18,600
that's Google. They don't want
me, I'm not good enough. Um,

946
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,380
so any advice that you have for Google
and all the people who are working on

947
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:26,110
diversity, I think that would
be great because everybody goes,

948
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,370
how did you get a job there?

949
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:32,020
And I would love for people that feel
that they are confident enough to at least

950
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:35,530
look at least try because all
you can be told is no. Um,

951
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,820
and the other thing is you were talking
about racism and I have been just

952
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:41,410
feeling helpless,
um,

953
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,250
and watching all of the protests and
getting excited about the Justice

954
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,890
Department saying, um, we're
going to take this, uh,

955
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,250
shooting of this innocent or
not so innocent black person.

956
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,380
And then it turns out that the
Justice Department doesn't, you know,

957
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:58,930
the case doesn't go through. They're
not charged. And I'm a ranter,

958
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,250
which I'm doing now instead
of asking a question. Um,

959
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,440
but I had been posting on Facebook
about the fact that people sit on the

960
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,080
courthouse steps and say,
this is not gonna work.

961
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:12,460
We have to do something about it.

962
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:15,070
And we see Beyonce and we
see snoop Dogg and we see,

963
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:19,300
I'll sharpen all of these activists
and they're saying, this is not good.

964
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:20,290
We have to stop this.

965
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:23,020
But then they step back and then they
go back to their everyday lives because

966
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:26,020
they have this feeling of helplessness
and they don't know what to do next.

967
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,580
So a couple of weeks ago,

968
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:31,450
I gathered a bunch of friends that I work
with from a design company and we did

969
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:34,510
this great big, um, like ideation,

970
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:37,180
brainstorm on what we could
do because in my eyes,

971
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,290
it has to start within the police
department, right? It can't be the police,

972
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,900
it can't be the lawyers that
can't be the district attorneys.

973
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,940
It has to be the police department to Pat,
you know,

974
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:51,580
to go pass that Blue Line of silence
and start telling the other police

975
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,140
officers, you know what? I'm not going
to testify on your behalf. You are wrong.

976
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:59,290
You shouldn't have done that. And I feel
like it has to start with from within,

977
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,440
but I don't know what to do next.
We've got a bunch of ideations.

978
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:06,370
We talked about
redesigning the s, the, um,

979
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,530
pullover and all of these things,

980
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:13,531
but we're now trying to figure out how
to reach other people and how to use our

981
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:19,390
voices and making this great big movement
that says it has to start from within

982
00:58:19,391 --> 00:58:24,250
the police department. Right. I
watched this up an episode of, um,

983
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,970
God, I can't remember the
show. Tay Diggs is in it. Um,

984
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:31,930
I can't remember the name of it,
but he shot a black guy.

985
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:35,830
They couldn't find the gun,
but his partner told him
the next day, you know what?

986
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:40,540
I talked to the captain and I
backed you up. And it wasn't true.

987
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:45,070
And that was just an example of what
happens instead of them saying, no,

988
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:47,950
he was wrong and I'm not
going to stand by him.

989
00:58:47,951 --> 00:58:52,000
So we're trying to figure out ways to
do that in any advice so that I can take

990
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:55,570
it to the next step where it's not just
a meeting of people who go back to their

991
00:58:55,571 --> 00:58:59,620
normal lives and say, oh, we met
but I don't know what to do next.

992
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,460
Um,
the first question of how,

993
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:06,690
so there's is something that feels very
inaccessible about working at Google.

994
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:12,240
It feels like aspiration as
opposed to a reachable thing.

995
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,340
So a lot of people don't even know it's
an option for them because they use

996
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:18,870
think people who work at Google happened
to get it like a magic golden ticket

997
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,550
and they showed up. They, they're
like, oh my god, work at Google.

998
00:59:21,551 --> 00:59:24,950
It sounds like a legend. Like, Oh man,

999
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:28,370
it's like Charlie Wonka's
chocolate factory. Cause I
mean this place is a mess.

1000
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,870
What gas slides?
Um,

1001
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:34,820
I think Google needs to do a better job
of making sure that people understand

1002
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,070
that they actually have a
chance to work at Google.

1003
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:39,050
And they're not just
like engineers who are,

1004
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:43,220
who get coding things and they're
like, oh, you can be a coder.

1005
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,920
You actually have people
do social things at Google.

1006
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:49,340
I think Google needs to actually make
it more accessible so whether you have

1007
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:52,190
people go into more
colleges who were like, Yo,

1008
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:56,570
you don't have to be a hyper
geek engineer to work at Google.

1009
00:59:56,571 --> 01:00:00,950
You can actually apply for like the
events coordinator job or the admin

1010
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:05,951
assistant in job or if you are in stem
you can apply for a job in strategy in

1011
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:07,430
coding,

1012
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:11,870
so I'm not sure why what you guys are
doing but you might want to do that.

1013
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:16,460
I know y'all don't throw a post on indeed
or linkedin but that might help but it

1014
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:19,550
actually would help if people knew that
they could get a job at Google and it

1015
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:23,870
wasn't some like pie in the
sky thing mission to apply.

1016
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:28,020
We are doing a lot of that. I want
to just give a shout out to the team.

1017
01:00:28,021 --> 01:00:32,100
I actually met with them yesterday and
we have a lot of work to do but there are

1018
01:00:32,101 --> 01:00:36,720
people at Google. Part of
it is just making sure we
are aware, people are right,

1019
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:41,721
like mountain view is a little bit
like Disneyland in a lot of ways.

1020
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:46,190
And you know, we have a great big
world out there and Google, uh,

1021
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:50,820
is fortunate enough to have offices in
a lot of places and we have to do a lot

1022
01:00:50,821 --> 01:00:53,850
more outreach, a lot more
inviting, a lot more welcoming.

1023
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,760
And I know that there are teams of
people at Google working on that. So,

1024
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:00,780
and I also have to like give Google
props because here's the thing,

1025
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:04,110
like I know you're constantly being
told to do better because you should,

1026
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:09,740
but the fact that your leadership
is taking it on as an actual thing,

1027
01:01:10,171 --> 01:01:15,171
not just because you are getting
your week's gnashed about it matters.

1028
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:20,100
I think it's really good to see people
at the top who are saying like, okay,

1029
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,660
help us figure out what to do.

1030
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:26,640
We realized we need to do better
so we are we going to do better?

1031
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:30,210
So I have to say props for that because
the trickle effect is real, right?

1032
01:01:30,211 --> 01:01:33,150
Because the leadership didn't care.
Nothing's going to change.

1033
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:34,650
So I just want to say perhaps
you you for that. Yeah.

1034
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:36,160
Red. Okay. On that note,

1035
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:41,700
did he just blocks?
So no,

1036
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,460
behalf of everyone here and Google.
Thank you.

1037
01:01:44,461 --> 01:01:47,630
Not only for coming and visiting us,
but the work you do everyday,

1038
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,060
putting yourself out there, it makes a
difference. Whom we're very grateful.

1039
01:01:51,061 --> 01:01:51,470
Thank you.
Okay.
