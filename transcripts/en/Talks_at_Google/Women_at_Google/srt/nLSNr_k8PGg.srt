1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,680
I'm really excited today to introduce
a new friend of mine, Korean mccanlis.

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,120
She's the sister of literary
icon, Christopher McCandless. Uh,

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,490
and she consulted to closely with Jon
Krakauer on his bestselling book into the

4
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:21,980
wild, which came out in 1996. I'm sure a
lot of you've heard of it or read it. Um,

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,090
she also works as a direct advisor,

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,020
writer and script contributor to Sean
Penn on his film adaptation of end of the

7
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:31,350
wild, which was released in 2007. Um,

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,070
Korean wrote her own memoir about the
experience called the wild truth, ah,

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,770
that was released in November,

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,260
2014 and very quickly became both the New
York Times and national bestseller, uh,

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,600
and it was followed by international
publications in seven countries and still

12
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:50,601
counting the wild truth was selected
for many best books of 2014 lists,

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,720
including those chosen by readers
and editors at Newsweek, vanity fair,

14
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,140
Amazon and Indy. Next. So it's
a pleasure to introduce Corinne

15
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,650
[inaudible].

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,480
Hi,
thank you all for hosting me here today.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,640
I'll keep things pretty casual.
I've got my journal.

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,010
Everyone should always write
in a journal every day.

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,470
I had to put a

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,400
markers and mine of the Google
color, you know, in your logo to her.

21
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:27,780
Remind me where in the journal I needed
to go back to. So anyway, I'm gonna I,

22
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm used to doing very,
very long and formal presentation.

23
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:34,470
So I've got my journal here to help me
stay on point because I really would like

24
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:39,440
to get some time at the end of this
to get into Q and a with you guys. Um,

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,020
so when I was 21,

26
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,710
I lost my best friend.
He was awesome.

27
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,830
My brother, um, he was 24 when he died

28
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:01,240
and many of you know the story,
his name was Chris McCandless.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,250
He had graduated with
honors from Emory university

30
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,383
and

31
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,530
that was the last time that
I had ever seen him alive.

32
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,390
Just the last time I'd spoken with
him, he had written me letters. Um,

33
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,630
but I hadn't spoken to him
since seeing him at graduation.

34
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,520
Two years later,

35
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,180
his body was found in this abandoned bus
in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness.

36
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:34,530
Okay.

37
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,730
There was a lot of mystery surrounding
his death and everything that had

38
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,440
happened during those two years.

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,280
And the story of that time and all of
the adventures that he had during that

40
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:48,564
time

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,100
became known as into the wild as such,
um,

42
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,640
summarized the incredible
book written by Jon Krakauer

43
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,040
and it

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,690
was also developed into a film by Sean
Penn. And Chris's story really became,

45
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,550
I mean,
John's book was so popular,

46
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:11,260
it's published in over 30 languages.
Um,

47
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,680
Shawn's movie also, so beautiful.

48
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,000
And Chris's story reached even
more of a global audience,

49
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,950
but it wasn't the whole story.

50
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,590
So to give you a little backstory,

51
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,630
this is Chris with the Shanandoah
behind him. We used to hike a lot.

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,090
This is my hiking hat,
um,

53
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,530
in that area.
And he loves to be out in nature.

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,050
Chris always said to me that nature
may be harsh and it's honesty,

55
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,130
but it never lies to you.

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,690
Okay.

57
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,190
And he felt,
I don't know,

58
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:01,240
he felt whole, like he felt
real when he was out in nature.

59
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,820
And,
um,

60
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,460
I just remembered it was always
his favorite place to be.

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,190
It was an always an escape for him.
Even at this young age,

62
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,920
Chris and I were very close.
He was always my protector.

63
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,040
I heard it's a cute picture. Right?
All right. This picture tells a story.

64
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,500
This picture was taken
on a typical morning.

65
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,190
Our house was

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,800
on an everyday basis filled
with domestic violence,

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,650
and this day was not unlike any other.

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,760
The violence had erupted over the
breakfast table and continued on until my

69
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:54,410
parents realized that it was time
for church. It was Easter Sunday.

70
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,320
So we were putting into our best suit
and dress and we were marched into the

71
00:04:57,321 --> 00:05:01,580
backyard for pictures.
And

72
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,400
you know,
pictures,

73
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,990
they catch an image in time,

74
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,590
right?
But you don't really know what's going on.

75
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,700
You don't know the whole
story behind the image. And

76
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,200
whenever we would have to pause for
the perfect little family pictures.

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,193
MMM.

78
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,970
Our Dad would be by hand a camera
screaming at us. Smile, smile.

79
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,860
So what we had just been through in
the household, really not in the mood,

80
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,880
but you had to do it. If you
didn't. I knew what was coming next.

81
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,930
Now look closely at our
expressions in these pictures.

82
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,940
So I'm being compliant.
We've got a smile on my face,

83
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,100
I've got my hand behind his back.
I'm trying to convince Chris,

84
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,650
you know, smile, let's get this done
and look at the look on his face.

85
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:08,030
If you really look closely, you know
he's only about six years old here,

86
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,860
but he's already over that
he already understands.

87
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,860
Now what's really important
about this picture,

88
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,400
I've got it on the cover of my book
because people look at that and like, oh,

89
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:21,890
that's such a sweet picture.
But again,

90
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,350
it's the point of the story behind
the images that we see, right?

91
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,800
That's what this whole talk
is going to be about and

92
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,723
hm,

93
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,810
you know, I can remember like, like it
was yesterday. It's, it's, you have this,

94
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,410
this image that you're going
to portray out to society,

95
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,790
but sometimes it's so very different
from what is actually going on.

96
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,063
So

97
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,970
Chris, just even at that age, he wasn't
going to accept that he was already

98
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,473
planning.

99
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,200
He was already at that young age making
a determination of what's right and

100
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:12,160
what's wrong. When you grow up in
a household of domestic violence,

101
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,690
you become acclimated to it.

102
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,710
You don't know at this age that
every household isn't like that.

103
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,220
You don't understand.
So you know when,

104
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:25,840
when your environment is saturated with
that you become completely desensitized

105
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:29,230
to it.
Chris understood something was wrong.

106
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,590
Now as

107
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,690
we grew up, you know, in a lot of
ways Chris was your typical kid,

108
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:43,920
but in other ways there was
just something about him that,

109
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,001
I don't know,

110
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:50,001
you could say it was deeper than most
people at that age and sometimes we would

111
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,960
just have be having typical
kid conversations or where
we'd be fighting over,

112
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,970
you know, that's my space or don't come
in my room. But other times, you know, he,

113
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:03,570
we'd be having these conversations about
an author or something that he just

114
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:07,140
read that he wanted me
to read or you know,

115
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:11,370
big questions and I was more interested
in stuffed animals at that age or makeup

116
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:15,250
at a later age. Chris was different. Um,

117
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,710
at this age,
he was already thinking a lot about

118
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,283
okay,

119
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,270
who he wanted to be and probably most
importantly, who he would not become.

120
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,593
So

121
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,920
John's book became,
were required reading into the wild,

122
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,690
became required reading at about 3000
high schools and colleges across the

123
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:44,080
United States.
John doesn't like to do public speaking,

124
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,610
so he would suggest me, and
it took me a very, very,

125
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,611
very long time to get to the point where
I felt comfortable going and speaking

126
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,540
to people about Chris's story.

127
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,213
And

128
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,530
when I did, I would be talking to
students who are about the sage.

129
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:09,080
This is Chris's typical senior
picture in high school. Right.

130
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,350
And when I came to the school,

131
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,650
you would see a change
in the students because

132
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,140
it became real to them. You know,
it was no longer just an assignment.

133
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,250
It was this lesson because this is a real
flesh and blood sister of this person.

134
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,143
And

135
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,250
it wasn't just that I could see
that they were inspired by Chris.

136
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:37,020
There's usually two camps.
Some people admired him for what he did.

137
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,100
Some people admonished him.

138
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,370
That's part of the reason that it's
something that's that's assigned, right?

139
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,880
Because they want people to get into
that critical kind of thinking and think

140
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:47,010
outside of themselves.
But

141
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,380
what hit me more was that
I never left one school.

142
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,510
First of all, they would always
ask about the backstory, right?

143
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:02,930
Which at first I wasn't necessarily
talking about, but in the Q and a,

144
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,870
that's always what the questions were.
Why was he so angry with your parents?

145
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,250
Why did he leave the way he did?

146
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,200
Why didn't he talk to anybody for those
years after he left college and when I

147
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,730
opened up,
you know,

148
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:17,150
and the safety of the intimate walls
of a classroom where things weren't

149
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:18,230
recorded yet.

150
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,760
I saw this change come over the students
and some in particular because I never

151
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:30,540
left one school and still to this day,
all the years that I've been speaking,

152
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:34,740
I've never left one school, one
university, a corporate event.

153
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,720
I've never left anywhere where at
least one person didn't come up.

154
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,130
And in this case it was these high school
students that didn't come up and ask

155
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,660
for help for the very first time

156
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,500
because they were going
through a similar experience.

157
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,020
And here was someone talking about it.

158
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,043
So

159
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,330
after years of of doing this and
seeing this everywhere I went,

160
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,660
I realize what a disservice I had done
to my brother and not just to Chris,

161
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:11,900
but those who would read about him and
be inspired by him because Chris always

162
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:14,120
said there is nothing more
important than the truth.

163
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,670
And John did an incredible book,

164
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,930
a incredible job writing into the wild
and what was left out of it is my fault

165
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,840
because I want to John to understand.

166
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,740
But I wouldn't let him write that.

167
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,713
MMM.

168
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,740
I wasn't ready. And I
realized later on, wow,

169
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:36,710
what did a service had been done to such
an incredible writer and someone with

170
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:40,610
that journalistic style of Jon
Krakauer to give them information.

171
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,360
But tell them beforehand, I'm going to
tell you something, but my condition is,

172
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:47,060
you're not allowed to reveal this.
I just need you to know.

173
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,370
I didn't think anybody was
going to read into the wild.

174
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,100
So it was kind of John's fault.
Um,

175
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,850
so anyway,

176
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,540
I realize why a disservice I had done
by not talking about this and here,

177
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:06,130
20 years has passed. So you
know, as I mentioned earlier,

178
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,210
I journal all the time.

179
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:10,780
Chris is the one that taught me to journal
and we'll get a little bit more into

180
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:11,614
that.

181
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,680
But I just started writing and all those
journal entries turned into a book.

182
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,603
And

183
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,290
what I didn't expect was

184
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,020
for my book to start a new
conversation about domestic violence.

185
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,390
There were all these blanks and Chris's
story and people rightfully so had

186
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:43,220
filled in those blanks with
their own answers, you know,

187
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,440
as to why he had left the way he did
or what had happened with the family.

188
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,003
And

189
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,020
when my book came out,
or long before the book came out,

190
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:57,520
just when I was in these rooms
of 50 people, 500 people,

191
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:01,300
it didn't matter. When I would
talk about the rest of the story,

192
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,420
it forced people to take
another look at Chris's story,

193
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,490
not in defense of him
because in all fairness, he,

194
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,370
he didn't live his life worried about
what anyone else was going to think about

195
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:15,760
him. He was concerned about what
he thought about himself, but

196
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,230
now that people had the rest
of the answers, a lot of
their perspectives changed.

197
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,550
And that was not something that I realized
when I was 21 years old and he was

198
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,470
gone and I was having to tell

199
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,580
this journalist

200
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,093
why he left.

201
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,363
So

202
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,440
people not only would take
another look at Chris's story,

203
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:53,080
but they started taking another look
at story in their own communities.

204
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:57,430
And I started doing the same thing.
So whenever I was,

205
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,620
um,
at these schools,

206
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,050
and you know, for the most part, these
are, if they're hiring a speaker to come,

207
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,273
um,

208
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,420
these schools are filled with kids who
have a certain amount of privilege right

209
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,590
there. Um, they're all
wearing pretty nice clothes.

210
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:21,460
When I pull up to speak, there's, you
know, tons of cars in the parking lot.

211
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,630
So pretty much all these kids have
access to cars to drive for school. Um,

212
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,630
they all have phones, right?
Computers and tablets.

213
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,150
So they all want to connect
with me on social media.

214
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,800
And I've never really been big on
having a social media presence. My, um,

215
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,190
my publisher is so incredibly

216
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,120
kind and patient with me for not,

217
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:50,880
you're really supposed to be on the
lot and I'm not. Um, but you know,

218
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,920
I do try and make an effort and for the
most part it's when I'm connecting with

219
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,520
these students because I want
to stay connected with them.

220
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:00,440
I want to see what they're,
what they're doing.

221
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,120
I want to see what they're
doing with their lives.

222
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:06,560
I want to hear what they're doing next
because they'll tell me their stories.

223
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:09,080
They'll tell me how they were inspired
by Chris and what they want to do.

224
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,190
But as I am looking at the social media
of these kids that I've connected with,

225
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,610
and these are good kids,

226
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,590
I'm also seeing all these other stories,
right?

227
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,120
That also good kids,

228
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,860
but all these other pages and
connections that populate, right?

229
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:33,530
So I don't have to tell you I'm a Google,
but you know,

230
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:36,560
you're looking at social media and then
someone else has commented and then

231
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,720
that's curious. So I'm going to click
on that. I'm gonna look on that. Oh,

232
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:41,540
I think that kid might've been at
the lecture. Let me look at that.

233
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,420
So I started

234
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,070
to connect more and more into the social
media and with this age group and in

235
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:56,210
paying more attention to what
I saw through them, their
friends, their classmates,

236
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,460
I really began to see
something that concerned me.

237
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,790
Um, there was a lot of good,
but there was also a lot of bad.

238
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,200
And to me it appeared that what I
considered to be a negative influence and,

239
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,130
uh, negative stimuli, it was
quite out of whack. You know,

240
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,590
if you look at the balance,
um,

241
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,220
and what I could see was,
you know,

242
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,250
there's so much stimuli
and reality becomes a blur.

243
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,300
There's just so much going on and
that's what I want to get into.

244
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,220
Um, some of the things that I started to
see, so I just grabbed some screenshots.

245
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,560
I,

246
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,560
I would look at pages of students that
I connected with across the country,

247
00:16:50,471 --> 00:16:54,880
but I also took a closer look in my
own community. So I started looking at,

248
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:55,780
you know,
easy search,

249
00:16:55,781 --> 00:17:00,310
a name of your kid or
your kids' friends or,

250
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,000
um, all of these kids that go to
the high schools around the area.

251
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,370
And these are some of
the things that I saw.

252
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,460
So here's one that's got a
few pictures and it says,

253
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,350
grab your girl like this,
right? And it's got,

254
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:21,710
I don't know what Emoji
that is a funny crying face.

255
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:24,590
And then it's got the hearts right.
Smiley face with the hearts.

256
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,380
It's got to have a name.
I know what that emojis called,

257
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,660
but now let's take a closer look at
these four photos that they have.

258
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,150
So it would be deal, right? Don't be an
overprotective mom. That's not a big deal,

259
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,890
right? It's just a little, nothing
graphic. So there's three of these shots,

260
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:47,270
I guess. It's cool that they have
cigarettes, whatever. All right.

261
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:48,680
And then this is the fourth one.

262
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,090
When I saw that, I found that
shocking. Grab your girl like this.

263
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,130
What I found more shocking was,
and let's go back,

264
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:08,060
maybe it's on here. Okay, let's see.

265
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,780
There's 14 now. This is, I'm
watching these things in real time.

266
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:15,770
So this goes up and then I'm watching
it over a matter of, you know,

267
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:20,140
that day there's 1400
kinda sucks getting old.

268
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:24,350
I need my reading glasses.
1400 retweets.

269
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,020
And what?
1372 likes.

270
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,950
What is there to like about, about
this? What is there to like about that?

271
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,480
All right.
So then I started looking and seeing,

272
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:41,420
looking at more things and um,

273
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,840
I saw this theme and this pattern
that caused me a lot of concern.

274
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,470
So here's just another one.
Okay?

275
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,410
So this is a meme,
right? They called mean.

276
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,810
So here's a skeleton getting
ready to punch a baby.

277
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:05,440
And it says this, this is how infants
are killed during an abortion.

278
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,450
Now I'm not here to talk about
abortion rights or anything like that.

279
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,400
That's a whole nother topic,
right?

280
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,360
But I think it's fair to say that
both sides of that issue could agree

281
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,390
that this is inappropriate. This
is a skeleton. Cold cocking a baby.

282
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,833
Okay.

283
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,410
And again,
you've got,

284
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,130
uh, let's see, 2100 retweets,
almost 3,500 favorites.

285
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,080
Now, the majority of what I'm seeing,
these are school aged kids, right?

286
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:47,700
These are teenagers. This
meme, the mentality to me,

287
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,650
it, they're so separated
from reality. You know,

288
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,500
it's like everything's a cartoon.
It's not real,

289
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,860
but that's a real issue.
Right?

290
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,190
And they don't know the intent of the
person that drew this beam or posted it.

291
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:11,080
Right. Are they saying that this is,
are they, do they think abortion is,

292
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:14,370
is fair? It's a writer day or
they're against it. They don't know.

293
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,030
I started to interview these kids,
right?

294
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:21,570
I started talking to the kids
in groups and I started saying,

295
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:26,200
and I'd show these things
and I would say, why? Why?

296
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,330
Why would you show this?
And they literally would like,

297
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,480
they know it's supposed to be bad,

298
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:33,430
but they kind of have to
cover their face or writers.

299
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,190
I think it's just thought it was funny.
What about that is funny?

300
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,540
And I would say, uh, okay.

301
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,200
And I would name the person that I
blocked out that, that said this.

302
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,340
Do you know who that person is?
No.

303
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,443
Hmm.

304
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,890
So you don't know what their intent is
behind this. Is this a real picture?

305
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,470
I don't know. How would you
like it if that was your sister?

306
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,950
And they're horrified that someone sister,

307
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,860
you don't know what the intent is
of the person that posted this yet.

308
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:12,590
You are readily reposting it.
And that's what I mean by this.

309
00:21:12,591 --> 00:21:16,700
Just constant stimuli. They see
something. Oh Haha. And there were,

310
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,510
you know its peers. Everybody's
retweeting, everybody's
liking. So they do a two,

311
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:24,350
they don't even know why they're doing it.
They don't think about the effect.

312
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,760
They don't think about the intent,

313
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,150
the messages that society
spreads are so important.

314
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,570
Okay.

315
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:42,570
And through social media we are willingly
and incessantly spreading messages

316
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,070
without knowing what the
intent of that message is.

317
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,803
Okay.

318
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,830
So you know,
it's like that noise of society.

319
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,190
And when you talk about

320
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,483
mmm

321
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,620
purpose and everything that you do,
that intent is so important.

322
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,253
So

323
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,820
when you aren't listening to yourself
and you lose that self awareness,

324
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,820
you lose that accountability for what
you're doing with your own actions.

325
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,840
So up to this, it leads me
to contradiction, right?

326
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,330
A lot of times if you're not
thinking about what you're doing,

327
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,070
a lot of times you do
contradictory things.

328
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,420
This is a 17 year old girl
that posted this, right?

329
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,410
Am I just an overprotective mother?
Right? Am I just like someone who think,

330
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:40,180
oh my God, if that was my daughter,
like it's not graphic, right? I mean,

331
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:43,030
there's ads for underwear that
aren't that different than that.

332
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,030
But look what it says.
If we date

333
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,880
with the Emoji with the tongue,

334
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,980
yeah.

335
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,220
But look at, this is her favorites.
Look at the post right before it,

336
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,070
the new Steven Universe episode,
uh,

337
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,170
was about sexual harassment.
This show is so important.

338
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,110
So she's telling people this
is so important and let's see,

339
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:12,030
there's five likes of that.

340
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,360
Yet the very next thing she
favorites is this photograph.

341
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,680
And she writes,

342
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,680
if we date and there's 349
retweets and 562 likes,

343
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,980
it's completely contradictory.
And I have to say that,

344
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,190
um, you know, it's not,

345
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,600
it's not that untypical.
Here's another one. A,

346
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:41,970
if she stuck your fingers keeper,
she nasty.

347
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,040
I mean,
oh

348
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,390
yeah, there's a hell of a Lada
retweets and likes of that one.

349
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,020
So these are just your
typical teenage kids.

350
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,280
These are not these trouble making kids.
And all my kid would never do that.

351
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,910
These, I know who these
kids are, they're good kids,

352
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,530
but it's just they become
desensitized to this, right?

353
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:09,980
And it leads to more and
more and more problems. So,

354
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,820
and while I'm picking on the kids,
I got to say,

355
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:17,150
adults too oftentimes are no better.

356
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,720
So we will have,
um,

357
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,790
an NFL player that gets filmed in
an elevator hitting a woman, right?

358
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:31,030
We will have a politician that
gets caught for sexual harassment.

359
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,320
We will have, um, news anchors,
celebrities, same thing happens, you know,

360
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:39,560
and sometimes they get away with it.
Sometimes the hammer falls,

361
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,470
they lose their jobs, right? And so women,

362
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,970
we as women stand up and we say,
we are not going to accept this behavior.

363
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,890
This is wrong.

364
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:53,891
It is wrong for women to
not be treated fairly,

365
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,430
right? We want a demand fair treatment.
We want an end to sexual harassment.

366
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,200
We want an end to an abuse
of power and control.

367
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,140
Did you refixed shades of gray yet?

368
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,860
Yeah.

369
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,490
Oh, let's read it for a book club and
then we'll go see the movie together.

370
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:16,720
It's a total contradiction.
It's a complete contradiction.

371
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,930
This is the message that we're sending
to our daughters and to the boys that

372
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:27,424
they will date.

373
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,990
So this leads me to

374
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,130
anybody read this book yet?
Jon Krakauer Missoula

375
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,200
heard of it before. Okay. How many of
you have heard of 50 shades of grey?

376
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,940
Okay. So, um,

377
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,510
if you have a child going to college,

378
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,180
you have got to make them read this book.

379
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:59,210
This should be the Fye book for
every student going into college.

380
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,830
Um, John does not need my help selling
ebooks and I'm not doing that for this.

381
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:06,330
This was because I believe in this.

382
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:10,080
My 18 year old will not go to college
without reading this book, um,

383
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,970
college or not wherever
they go. So Missoula, um,

384
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,850
John and his journalistic style
investigates the campus rape culture.

385
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:22,851
And I am not asked to go speak to any
colleges anymore without addressing the

386
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:27,690
issue of sexual violence. Every
college I go to, they want me to,

387
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,970
to merge that into my talk.

388
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,420
It is a huge issue.

389
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,380
But look at some of the things we just
saw on social media and it goes back to

390
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,900
self awareness and
accountability in John's.

391
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:50,300
The overwhelming majority of these cases
are you have a young man in a young

392
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:56,340
woman and

393
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:02,920
in the overwhelming majority there
were highly intoxicated when this event

394
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:03,754
happened.

395
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,400
So there's interviews and you know,

396
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,790
intercourse happened and somebody thought
that it was consensual and the other

397
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,230
person didn't think it is,

398
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,410
but they know that they blacked out
and the other person blacked out too.

399
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,020
And so piecing that all
together is difficult.

400
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,250
And it goes back to what I tried to talk
to students about is self awareness is

401
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:29,460
not just what's my purpose in life and
what am I going to do with my career?

402
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:33,930
It's being aware of your
space in your time right now,

403
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,210
where you are,
what you're doing,

404
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,910
and if you have control of your
intent and do others around,

405
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,230
you have control of theirs.

406
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,620
To me so much
goes back to,

407
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,643
yeah,

408
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,760
in an instance like this, there's
this controversy of truth, right?

409
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:00,280
What's the truth?
And

410
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,200
there'll be controversy about that,

411
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,810
but is it getting enough
attention for the right reasons?

412
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,880
It brings me back to the
influences surrounding these
students that are on their

413
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:15,280
way to college.
Um,

414
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,420
let me give you a little
bit of levity. As I was, uh,

415
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:24,400
on my book tour,
not long after John's book had come out.

416
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,710
Um,
I go into a bookstore and,

417
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,760
um, I'm always looking to see what books
are out there and I'm looking at John's

418
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:38,080
books and John has several bestsellers
and you usually see a few copies.

419
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:43,840
And then I also happen to see Charles
Krauthammer's book and I liked him and I

420
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:47,200
picked it up. And, uh, I'm
on a long layover in Chicago,

421
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:51,190
so I'm reading the chapter that he
entitles, uh, in defense of the f word,

422
00:28:51,191 --> 00:28:55,240
which is brilliant by the way. Um, so
I'm looking at that, but as I'm reading,

423
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:59,950
I'm standing there reading and
I'm distracted. I'm like, what?

424
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,580
You know, something that's catching
my eye peripherally. And it was boobs.

425
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,250
It was a big set of boobs.

426
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,453
Okay.

427
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,950
Everyone knows who that is,
right?

428
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,900
So there's like three copies
of John's book, Missoula.

429
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:18,590
There's a few copies of Charles Commerce,
like 50 copies of this book.

430
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,660
Okay.

431
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,160
And this is Kim Kardashians book
entitled it's her book of selfies.

432
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,200
And No, I'm not trying to
harp on Kim or anything.

433
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,530
I'm just saying let's use this as an
example cause she certainly doesn't mind

434
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:37,610
putting it out there. Um, there's like
50 copies of this book on the shelf.

435
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:39,200
The book's entitled,
Selfish.

436
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,990
And why does the bookstore
have so many of her copies?

437
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,920
It's a big book too. I mean, you're
in an airport bookstore. It's heavy.

438
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,980
Why are there so many
copies and that shelf?

439
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,490
Because they know they're going
to sell them. It's society.

440
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,240
And while I was looking up to
find this cover, I found this one,

441
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,710
which I thought was hilarious.
Kim Kardashians. Shellfish.

442
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,830
That's it. That was, that was a brilliant,
um, all right, let me bring things back.

443
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,460
Okay.
So this,

444
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,270
this just brings me back to the
influence surrounding teenagers,

445
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,860
right?
Um,

446
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,270
and not just kids of this age,

447
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,010
but little kids because the
little brothers and sisters
have kids these age want

448
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:35,390
to be just like them. They can't wait to
get their, their iPhones, their androids.

449
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:40,340
I can't wait to get their phones right.
And that's what they see all the time.

450
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:43,160
They are very aware of what
the teenagers are doing.

451
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,433
Um,

452
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,070
does anyone know this is
someone in particular?

453
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:55,610
Does anyone know who this is?
Anybody recognize?

454
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,390
Okay. And I take this around to, you know,

455
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,450
I've taken this around to a lot of
students in different schools all over the

456
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:03,284
country.

457
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,550
Almost nobody knows who this
person is lately though,

458
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,360
everybody knows who this person is.

459
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,120
Okay?

460
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,980
Right? I know some of you are, which
is when, now what if I said, uh,

461
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,630
cash me outside? How about dad? Right?

462
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,660
You know who that is because
it's all over the Internet.

463
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,480
So I didn't know who it was,

464
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:30,890
but when on Saturday I
had my littlest girl,

465
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,870
my daughter, my youngest daughter
at a Ukulele lessons and he said,

466
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:38,060
hey, you're speaking at Google on
Tuesday, aren't you? And I said, yeah.

467
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:41,510
And I told them what the title
of my talk was going to be. Um,

468
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,830
the socialization of domestic violence,
um,

469
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,960
diluting a devastating
influence. And he says, Oh yeah,

470
00:31:50,961 --> 00:31:55,610
I was a, he teaches at the academy rock.
And so he's got a group of students,

471
00:31:55,611 --> 00:31:59,020
he goes in one day and they're all joking
saying, cash me outside. How about dad?

472
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:01,010
He says, what are you speaking
English? What are you saying?

473
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,710
So then they tell them and they pull
out their phones and they show him,

474
00:32:03,711 --> 00:32:08,000
look at this girl, this is hilarious.
And He's thinking, oh my gosh.

475
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:09,470
Well,

476
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:14,030
so he starts telling me about this
person and come to find out she's got,

477
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:14,511
well,

478
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:19,511
she was on Dr Phil and I watched the
video on youtube and during the video she

479
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:23,870
threatens to beat the audience up.
That's what the cash me outside.

480
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:26,090
How about that is she's going
to beat the audience up.

481
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,480
Her mother translated and um,

482
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,560
and then she got up and she got up in
her mother's face and she was threatening

483
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:34,640
to beat up her mom.

484
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,370
Okay.

485
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,100
This girl apparently now has endorsement.

486
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,470
She's signed a contract
for a reality show.

487
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,510
Let's see how many views are on
this five and a half million views.

488
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,550
Right.
This is the other,

489
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,093
it's a mixture.

490
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:01,000
This is Jack and Draka. I'm hoping I'm
saying his last name right. I met him. Um,

491
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,180
he probably won't remember me,
but I definitely remembered him.

492
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:08,680
I met him at an Fye conference.
Both of our books were featured as books.

493
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,880
Um, do we use it as required
reading at colleges?

494
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,140
And he presented,

495
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,400
and this is a young teenage genius.

496
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:21,790
He's now at Stanford class of 2019.
Who invented

497
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,740
an early did. He invented a, uh,

498
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,250
I don't even have the time
to explain it all properly,

499
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:35,251
but he developed a test
at a very economical tasks
that's an early detector for

500
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:40,600
pancreatic cancer cause he lost someone
in his life to pancreatic cancer that

501
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,470
was very dear to him.

502
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,060
He's also invented a water bottle that,

503
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,640
that these expensive ones that
we buy at the sports stores,

504
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:53,620
but something that can be manufactured
for pennies on the dollar compared to

505
00:33:53,621 --> 00:33:58,621
others and can be sent to these third
world countries where people don't have

506
00:33:58,721 --> 00:34:02,830
access to clean water and they can
go and scoop up this water that's not

507
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:06,730
drinkable and they can drink.
So He's, he's saving lives.
He's changing the world.

508
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,950
None of the teenagers know who this is.

509
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,500
Here's Jack's Ted talk.
It's got 304,000 views.

510
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:16,490
That's pretty good.

511
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:17,740
Okay.

512
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,100
She's got five and a half million views.

513
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,930
Doesn't mean that they are approving
of it, but that saturation,

514
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,600
that's influential because whereas some
of these kids might kind of laugh at her

515
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:35,680
and talk about how she, you know,
they also are thinking, wow, she's,

516
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,490
she's made all that money.
I mean, they're human.

517
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:40,960
That's the kind of things
that they think about.

518
00:34:40,961 --> 00:34:45,280
Kids think about shoes and they want
the range rover like somebody else has.

519
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,230
So let's see. Here's her Danielle
or goalie, I guess her name.

520
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,830
Here's her Twitter page.

521
00:34:56,831 --> 00:35:00,490
She's got 340 no,
I'm sorry,

522
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:05,491
243,000 followers and she just joined
February of 2017 so just a couple of

523
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,920
months. She's got that many
followers. Here's Jack's page.

524
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,770
He joined in July of 2011

525
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,090
okay.

526
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,690
He's got just under 22,000 followers.

527
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,570
Here's his Instagram page.
He's got 3,400 followers.

528
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,180
He's probably had it up for several years.
Here's her Instagram page.

529
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,670
9.2 million,

530
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,470
9.2 million followers,

531
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,410
which means when these kids go and scroll,

532
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:44,730
the latest video that she posted bragging
about bullying people and beating up

533
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:46,080
kids and stealing cars.

534
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,323
Yeah,

535
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,840
there's only 3,400 that are learning
about Jack's latest invention that's going

536
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,940
to change this world.

537
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,930
But what did we as a society,
why?

538
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:05,070
Why does everybody not know who this is?
Why do they know who she is?

539
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:11,130
You know? You don't have to
be intentionally searching
for something negative,

540
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,490
but it's so saturated that
that's what's out there.

541
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,250
Now,

542
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,080
I'm not saying that there isn't also
good that comes with the exposure,

543
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,380
right? I mean, this is, technology
has been a wonderful thing.

544
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,940
So here's an organization, no more.org,
right? They've been fantastic.

545
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,750
I've spoken all around the country at
groups and a lot of times they're related

546
00:36:34,751 --> 00:36:36,520
in some way to this group and support.

547
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,140
I've spoken at New Beginnings and Seattle,

548
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,960
a center for women in
transition in Michigan. Um,

549
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:49,290
the women's home in Texas Samaritan
House where I live in Virginia,

550
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,570
um, Shelter House, the barn
outside of DC. There's,

551
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,630
there's organizations all over the country
that are working to prevent domestic

552
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,730
and sexual violence and they're out there.

553
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,140
But this group has 55,000 followers,

554
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,750
55,000 followers compared
to nine Portola hills. See,

555
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:19,070
let's be fair. Let's, that was
her Instagram page. Instagram.

556
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:24,071
They have 29 almost 30,000
followers compared to what was hers,

557
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,690
9.2 million.

558
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,850
There's something wrong with that

559
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,070
and I don't have all the answers, but I
know there's something wrong with that.

560
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,900
This is the kind of thing that concerns
me because it's out of balance.

561
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,820
I care about it because

562
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,800
I'm worried for these kids

563
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,420
who see domestic violence every day and
have become acclimated to it and don't

564
00:37:59,421 --> 00:38:00,500
understand it's wrong.

565
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,600
I worry for these kids. These are
my girls, Heather and Christiana.

566
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,300
I love that picture. They're little.
They're, or they're bigger now,

567
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:11,710
so they don't like when
I showed that picture,

568
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:15,160
Heather thinks that she doesn't look good
without makeup and that her hair's too

569
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:16,930
curly.
So here's another picture of Heather.

570
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,920
So you know, I worry about this as a
mom, I worry about this as an advocate.

571
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:29,450
I worry about this as a community member,
but I also worry about this

572
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:31,910
as a sister

573
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,070
because am desperate

574
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:41,070
to know that we have as a human
race that we have learned something.

575
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,570
Okay?

576
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,340
In the past 25 years,

577
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,810
it's been 25 years,

578
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,653
but

579
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:02,080
I don't have the power and I don't have
all the answers, right? I'm one person.

580
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:03,850
There's a lot of advocates
all over the country

581
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,410
who does have the power.

582
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,390
I think you guys have the power.

583
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,310
We're at freaking Google.
All right. What's a Google?

584
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,730
Google is is like the highest
number you can get. Right?

585
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:26,250
10 to the hundredth power. I'm
not a mathematician. I googled it.

586
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,290
These pages that populate these,
these recommendations that come up,

587
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,730
somebody is programming all that stuff.

588
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:40,731
Somebody is creating that some of the
most brilliant minds are in this a hundred

589
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:43,200
plus set of buildings.

590
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,160
Why can't we come up with a way that

591
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,700
that helps with a better balance?
I'm not talking about censorship,

592
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,050
I'm talking about balance. I'm talking
about educating these young people.

593
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,373
Okay,

594
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,090
there's gotta be a way to do it

595
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,380
and I challenge you guys to
come up with those answers.

596
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,850
So I think that can bring
us into the Q and. A.

597
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:15,780
You guys have everyone's
attention every day.

598
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:19,500
You and companies like yours have
everyone's attention every day.

599
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,060
So what can you do to
help with this balance?

600
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,313
Okay,

601
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,350
so what I take away from, from hearing
you talk and reading your book is that

602
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,600
in his own way, Chris and his
time when he was coming of age,

603
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,060
was frustrated by a lot of the
things you've just mentioned.

604
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:45,120
Maybe not Instagram and Twitter back then,
but

605
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,870
that didn't exist back then.
Exactly. That's one of my points.

606
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:49,640
Like students will say to me,

607
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,150
why don't you just pissed that
he didn't send you a text?

608
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,370
You didn't hear from him for two years.

609
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:59,030
He didn't even send you an email
and I hold up my phone and I say,

610
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:03,200
we now have these back then and they think
she looks amazing for being 200 years

611
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:07,040
old. I mean, they don't. It's it's,

612
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,990
they can't comprehend it.

613
00:41:08,991 --> 00:41:11,900
That's like trying to explain to
someone that there no oxygen in the air.

614
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,130
They can't comprehend that.
That's why to me,

615
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:20,600
these all these things aren't
necessarily real to them.

616
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,230
Right.

617
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,500
They're clicking and favoriting
and reposting without
really thinking about what

618
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:25,334
they're doing.

619
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,420
No. If I may, that's a
great transition road.

620
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:31,680
This is what I was getting at is in
both John's book and in your book,

621
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,130
you do a great job of
about how Chris was just,

622
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,870
you began to talk with how Chris was a
little different even at age six. Right.

623
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,460
He was more aware than most.

624
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:45,100
Right. He, he cared about authenticity.
He had principles and, and,

625
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,210
and you described him as being unique
in that way. You and your book,

626
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:51,000
you say even even friends would say
your brother is a little intense.

627
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,500
Not in a bad way,
but he's intense.

628
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,260
It's what I wonder is if
you fast forward to today,

629
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,910
it is still the norm for people
to click on cash me outside.

630
00:41:59,911 --> 00:42:04,050
How about that instead of
the book here. Thank you. Uh,

631
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,780
let's be fair enough.
Fair enough.

632
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,940
It's still the norm for people to be
attracted to that and not to stand up in

633
00:42:08,941 --> 00:42:12,260
the way that Chris did. So
what I wonder is, is is,

634
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,710
is do you have thoughts free for students
that you speak to around the how and

635
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:17,790
why they can be more authentic?

636
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,820
Some of it's entertainment, right? You
have students who are going through these,

637
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,241
you know,

638
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:27,241
calculus classes and did they
necessarily want to think that much?

639
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,910
And so part of it's entertainment,

640
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:38,110
but there has to be some responsibility
and accountability because you can't

641
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:43,121
tell me that seeing that and that being
so saturated and not just that it's

642
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:45,830
being rewarded by adults.

643
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:49,790
It's not other kids that
gave her a reality show.

644
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,473
Right.

645
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,230
So kids see that that's,

646
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,810
that's what I'm talking about is,

647
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:01,850
is that kind of responsibility
and accountability?

648
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:03,020
I probably didn't answer your question.

649
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:08,090
No, no, no. There's, there's no easy
answer to how do you solve this,

650
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,720
this right truth of society.

651
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:13,380
But I think one thing you talk a lot about
is his parenting and how Christen you

652
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:15,390
both, uh, it's beautiful. In your book,

653
00:43:15,391 --> 00:43:18,210
you described the lessons you learned
about how you want to do things

654
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:20,070
differently than your parents did,
for example.

655
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,650
Yeah. My parents weren't all
bad. I mean, they weren't.

656
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:26,160
And I talk about that and I flush it out
in, in my book, they taught us some, some

657
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,210
hard work ethics and a
lot of good things too.

658
00:43:30,211 --> 00:43:34,130
But you have to decide what you're going
to emulate and what you're not. And,

659
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,330
and specifically on the
issue of domestic violence,

660
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,800
breaking that cycle is very important
thing and it's not easy to do.

661
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,410
And so in that same
vein, it seems, you know,

662
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:48,670
you talk about some examples with your
own daughters of how you've tried to

663
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:51,180
embody authenticity. Um, you know,

664
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,060
positive thoughts around relationships
and around relationship with the self.

665
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,750
I know a lot of parents are either in
this room or watching on live stream.

666
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:02,530
Do you have any thoughts or tips or I
how to embody these values and your own

667
00:44:02,531 --> 00:44:03,364
family for you?

668
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,010
Sure. And you know, Gosh, I'm not,
I'm not standing up here like, Hey,

669
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:12,210
I'm doing it right and everybody's got to
get on board. No, no, no, no, no, no. My,

670
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,300
my 18 year old, I love her.
She is such a good kid. She is.

671
00:44:15,301 --> 00:44:18,150
I have an 18 year old daughter that's
never rolled her eyes at me and my

672
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:21,330
presence or slammed the door.
Right.

673
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,300
Miracle is it because I'm such an
amazing parent. I'd like the thing.

674
00:44:25,301 --> 00:44:27,900
So she's probably not going to say that,
you know,

675
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,870
but let's take that for example,
she,

676
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:35,871
I know I take my kids to my events and
sometimes things thinking and sometimes

677
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,220
they don't.
My oldest,

678
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,670
she came up from the basement one night
I was sitting working at the kitchen

679
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:44,580
table and she came up and I might get
off tangent, you can reel me back in.

680
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:49,920
But she came up from watching a
TV show, just blubber. I mean,

681
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:54,480
she was crying so hard
that she couldn't speak.

682
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,630
And I get, I'm like, yeah,

683
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,490
oh my God, I have her. What's the
matter? What happened? What's wrong?

684
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,750
I don't remember the name glow.

685
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,300
She just, I'm like, oh, she's
watching the walking dead.

686
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:18,630
I've never watched the show.
Maybe I shouldn't be letting
my cue watch that show.

687
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:22,980
I don't, you know, but she
is beyond herself with grief.

688
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:29,310
Genuinely. She's a smart
kid and I say, honey,

689
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,200
first of all, he didn't die. Like I hear
you talk about this guy all the time.

690
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,710
I know people that write scripts.
This guy didn't die. Okay,

691
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:41,370
this is the last show of the
season. Trust me. Oh, he didn't die.

692
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,650
They just want you to think sober.
So,

693
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,900
but she could not connect.

694
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,880
She's smart,
but they're so disconnected from reality.

695
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,970
Like it affected her so much and it's
easier to connect the things like that.

696
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,060
Now when I talked to her about real
things that are happening in the world,

697
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:07,830
in these terrible tragedies,
she doesn't have the same reaction.

698
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:12,240
I mean, maybe part of it is a
defense mechanism. You know,

699
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:16,530
it's not that she doesn't concern
about those things, but it's,

700
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,980
that is, that's not good
that that happened, you know,

701
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:24,840
but it's not this and, and so, you know,

702
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:28,050
it bewilders me sometimes, but
when it comes to parents, right,

703
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,750
I say maybe I shouldn't let her watch
that show now I think it's okay for her to

704
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:33,240
watch that show.
Um,

705
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:36,090
it's probably something I
should have watched so I
could make that determination.

706
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,830
Um, but I, I, you know,

707
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:41,490
I talk with other parents about these
issues and I'll mention how I found

708
00:46:41,491 --> 00:46:42,990
Heather posting something inappropriate.

709
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:45,300
And so I took her phone away
for six months and I get this,

710
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,510
you took your daughter's phone. You
know, I could never do that. Oh my God,

711
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:55,920
she would hate me. My kid would hate
me. Like, well, your kid's 12. I mean,

712
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:59,040
and I'm not judging other parents.
Everyone has their own things going on,

713
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:02,610
but it goes back to this
accountability and responsibility.

714
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:06,740
I mean you have to be willing to,
to my advice to parents,

715
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,600
you have to be willing to not be their
best friend because you have to be their

716
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:12,210
parents first. Yeah. And later in life,

717
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:16,050
hopefully they'll realize that you were
their best friend and really looking out

718
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:16,884
for them.
But,

719
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,970
but we all survived without phones
and computers and we were that agent.

720
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:26,820
So you have to, you know, and,
and, and I, my advice to students,

721
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,980
you know,
every time I'm talking with,

722
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,860
I always hold up my journal and
I asked them how many people,

723
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,360
how many people in this room journal?
Okay.

724
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,600
I always say everybody should journal
even if it's one or two sentences. And I,

725
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:43,510
and I don't do it every night.
Sometimes I'm too exhausted.

726
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,780
But the good thing about journal,

727
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,360
and I always say you do it
with a real paper and a pen.

728
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,760
Why do you think it's
with a real paper and pen?

729
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,350
They want to go to their devices,
right? But if you go to your device,

730
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,740
you're going to be bombarded by all
this stuff. Some good, a lot bad.

731
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,300
And that's the noise, this noise
of society. What are your thoughts?

732
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,890
What are you thinking?

733
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:11,020
Get away from all the influence and figure
out what your place is in this world.

734
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:11,950
What you want to do.

735
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:12,883
For sure.

736
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,600
You talk about your brother being your
protector all the time in and you see it

737
00:48:17,601 --> 00:48:20,750
in the picture. Do you see
it in the stories share in
the book? And I wondered if,

738
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:25,810
if his inclination to think about these
deep things at a young age was in part

739
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:29,330
because he was a protector for you.
He was in a way,

740
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:33,590
I think trying to self parents a bit and
provide some positive influence in your

741
00:48:33,591 --> 00:48:34,940
life and help you as well.

742
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,360
And so he was taking that
responsibility at a young age,

743
00:48:38,361 --> 00:48:40,640
younger than most people are comfortable.

744
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,990
And now you're encouraging kids to journal
and do what Chris did in taking some

745
00:48:44,991 --> 00:48:47,240
accountability responsibility
for their own selves.

746
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,490
But you're also talking about
parents and we're thinking, what,

747
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:51,170
what I hear you saying is parents,

748
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:54,110
it might suck if your
daughter hates you for a day,

749
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,350
but that's your kid fair a week,
however long it takes. Right.

750
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,040
But I hear you're saying to parents,

751
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:04,100
take some responsibility to have that
difficult conversation instead of just

752
00:49:04,101 --> 00:49:06,410
batting your eye or looking
at looking at another way.

753
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,360
We all need to be more responsible.
Is that what you're saying?

754
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,480
Right. And I'm not, yeah, I don't,

755
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:17,310
I'm not stellar at all of this myself.
We, I put we in this and including me. Um,

756
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,030
you know, it's tough for
parents of, you know, my,

757
00:49:21,031 --> 00:49:24,660
I'm 45 years old and I updated
some apps the other day.

758
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:27,330
I have no clue how the hell
they use these things now.

759
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:30,930
But my 11 year old could pick up my
phone and intuitively just figure it out,

760
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,940
you know? So a lot of times when I
talked to parents about social media,

761
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,180
they, ah, I don't even
understand how all that works.

762
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,080
Some of them have the attitude of, you
know what, you just got to trust your kid.

763
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:44,041
You just got it.

764
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:47,430
But they are aware of a lot of the things
that are happening and the things that

765
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:49,950
those kids are exposed to. Sure. Um,

766
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,800
so you have to be willing to have
the uncomfortable conversations.

767
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:55,020
You have to be willing to take the phone.

768
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:58,950
You have to be unfortunately
willing to learn how snapchat works.

769
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:03,300
Um, you do if you're going to
give them the access to it. Right.

770
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,210
You gotta be willing to say,
but let me make a point here about Chris.

771
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,640
You said that, that I encourage
kids to do what Chris did.

772
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,160
Chris died out in the
middle of the wilderness.

773
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:16,760
So I encourage, you know, people tell me,

774
00:50:16,761 --> 00:50:20,090
I get messages from people all over the
world and people say that your brother

775
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,290
changed my life.

776
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:23,183
And

777
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,770
I see where Chris Inspires people

778
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,130
to,
to make

779
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,780
positive changes in their lives.

780
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,380
But when someone tells me and they come
to me and they're in tears and they say,

781
00:50:33,381 --> 00:50:37,820
your brother saved my life,
I say to them,

782
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,790
Chris died in 1992

783
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,540
he couldn't do that for you.

784
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,610
Now he can be a spark that lights a
fuel in you to do that for yourself,

785
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,680
but own it. You did that for
yourself. Yeah. And that, you know,

786
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:57,740
that's so,
so yeah,

787
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,360
I want people to be influenced by Chris's,

788
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:08,540
his desire to have a purpose in life.
Right?

789
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:12,410
He died so young, but he's
influenced so many people, um,

790
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,160
without even trying to, um, and,

791
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,590
and for the most part
in very positive ways.

792
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,380
But Chris was also accountable.

793
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,980
He knew that he put himself in a very
difficult situation and he didn't blame

794
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:30,020
anybody else for it.
You know,

795
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:34,220
I talk a lot about our childhood
and my parents in my book,

796
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,370
but I don't blame them for his death.

797
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,240
Chris put himself out in
the wilderness unprepared.

798
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,500
I do hold them accountable
for his disappearance.

799
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,660
And that's a very different thing.

800
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:52,640
So one of the greatest lessons that people
can learn from Chris and kids of that

801
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:57,641
age is to be accountable and
to have that self awareness.

802
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:03,050
Because at the end, I don't
know if we have time for it, but

803
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,080
Chris,
um,

804
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:10,970
I put some more slides up
here simply because there's
a lot of things. That's me.

805
00:52:10,971 --> 00:52:14,300
I came to the US.
It's Chris on the road.

806
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:21,140
So
just very quickly

807
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,670
at the end of the movie,
they show this note.

808
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,740
So this is the note that Chris
wrote when he knew he was dying.

809
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,280
I have had a happy life and thank the
Lord Goodbye and may God bless all.

810
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:43,010
So he had taken that page
out of one of his books.

811
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:49,670
And on the opposite was this excerpt
from a poem by Robinson Jeffers,

812
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,780
um, from Wiseman. In the bad hours,
it reads deaths, a fierce meadow Lark,

813
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,771
but to die.

814
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:59,580
Having made something more equal to the
centuries and muscle and bone is mostly

815
00:52:59,581 --> 00:53:00,510
to shed weakness.

816
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,290
The mountains are dead stone that
people admire or hate their stature,

817
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:08,580
their insulin quietness.

818
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,800
The mountains are not soften nor troubled
and a few dead men's thoughts of the

819
00:53:13,801 --> 00:53:17,940
same temper. Chris didn't do
anything without a purpose.

820
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,290
He didn't just randomly pull this one
page and decide to write the last words

821
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,310
that he's gonna write in his life
and also didn't do it for us.

822
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:27,600
He didn't do it for anybody else.

823
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:32,530
He didn't know that anybody was ever going
to find this or care. You know, w when,

824
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,170
when these students take pictures,

825
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:39,300
what's the first thing we all do now when
we take a picture, upload it. The first,

826
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,490
maybe you,
since you worked for Google,

827
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,510
I haven't uploaded pictures in
a long time. I'm so behind. No,

828
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,830
the first thing we do is we look at
the picture. We look at the picture.

829
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:53,670
Do we get the images that we're
looking for? Right? But Chris,

830
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,600
these pictures that people see online of
Chris, Chris never saw these pictures.

831
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,090
That was back in the day where you had
this thing called film on a roll and you

832
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:05,610
had to take it to the drug store and
get it developed and you don't even know

833
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,360
what the image is. But Chris, there aren't
five of these pictures. There's one,

834
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,810
he didn't take it. Let me make
sure I'm getting the right shot.

835
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,300
And John John writes about,

836
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,140
which was not a picture I have up here
cause it's too difficult for me, but he,

837
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,780
and I read it at the end
of my ted talk I believe,

838
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:25,410
but he writes about this photo of Chris,

839
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:30,411
the last photo that Chris takes himself
and he talks about how he's standing

840
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:34,590
beneath the High Alaska
sky and if he feels

841
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,640
betrayed that his body has let them
down. I'm, I'm totally John, right?

842
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,420
It's so beautifully and I'm,
I'm, I just, I have it here. Um,

843
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,160
let me just do service to this.
Just takes a minute. Sure.

844
00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:00,410
So he talks about this and he,
he quotes Jeffers Palm and he says,

845
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:06,080
one of his last acts was to take a
picture of himself standing near the bus

846
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:07,580
under the High Alaska sky.

847
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,340
One hand holding his final
note toward the camera lens.

848
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:13,730
The other raised in a braid be
a terrific farewell. His hate,

849
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,060
his face is horribly and
[inaudible] almost skeletal.

850
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,040
That if he picked it himself and those
last difficult hours because he was so

851
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:27,041
young because he was alone because his
body had betrayed him and as well had let

852
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:30,890
him down.
It's not apparent from the photograph.

853
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:36,470
He is smiling in the picture and there
is no mistaking the look in his eyes.

854
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:42,170
Chris McCandless was at peace.
Serena's a monk gone to God.

855
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:46,550
That picture that John's talking
about, it's not. This one

856
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:53,080
is both the hardest and the most
wonderful picture for me to look at.

857
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:58,520
It's a good pain. I call it because
I see he's dying. He skeletal,

858
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:04,490
but he does have this genuine
smile and there's one shot.

859
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:07,910
He didn't take a bunch hoping that,
oh, am I going to get it right?

860
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,330
Am I going to put the right thing across?
He's not thinking about anybody else.

861
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,890
That's just pure emotion coming out of
him and it's real and it's genuine and it

862
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:17,450
happens to be because of his faith.

863
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,003
But

864
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,430
for any of us,
we live

865
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,330
a young number of years or whether we
live into our eighties and nineties to

866
00:56:28,331 --> 00:56:31,420
have that piece at the end of our life.

867
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,600
Whenever that time comes to me,

868
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,810
that's what it's all about to,

869
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,350
to be at peace with the past you've chosen
in life and the way you've lived your

870
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:44,770
life,
what the purpose of your life was.

871
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:47,320
And although Chris Chris's life was short

872
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:53,860
and although he was so devastated to
be losing his life at such a young age,

873
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:58,480
and I know this from reading his journal,
he was at peace,

874
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,340
not because he was dying, but because
he had lived and the way he had lived.

875
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:08,770
And to me, that's my advice for students
is, you know, use those journals,

876
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:09,910
figure out who you are,

877
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,940
figure out what you want to be and what
you want to do and when that day comes

878
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:17,200
for you and it's going
to come for all of us.

879
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:20,530
Unless you guys at Google here figure
out, I mean, it'd be, might be common,

880
00:57:20,531 --> 00:57:24,400
I'm sure you're working on it better find
us to some other planets because it's

881
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:28,870
getting a little crowded. Um, talk to you
on about, yeah, we talked a lot about it,

882
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,480
but, um, but that's my point.

883
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,620
Do you see any of Chrysalis
traits and your children?

884
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,330
Well, yes. So, um,

885
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:49,620
so Heather isn't biologically my child.
I adopted her.

886
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,293
MMM.

887
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,380
So as far as traits, if you mean light
have trials down biologically? Um,

888
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:02,120
Christiana, my youngest,
she is named after Chris.

889
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:07,910
Um, she has down syndrome. Doesn't matter.

890
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,160
Nothing is gonna stop this kid.

891
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:14,960
Things that remind me
of Chris and her are,

892
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:18,230
why can't I go climb the hundred foot
oak tree to play with the raccoons?

893
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:20,720
I don't understand why that's a problem.
I mean,

894
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,600
but there's also just this purity in her,
you know, obviously she doesn't know,

895
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,980
have,
um,

896
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,360
I dunno, she's only 11. I guess we'll see
what, but you know, it's, it's, I mean,

897
00:58:33,361 --> 00:58:36,000
her deep thoughts right now
are about princesses, you know?

898
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,840
Um,
but

899
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:45,130
there's a light and appearance and
her that, that I definitely recognize.

900
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:46,443
Yeah.

901
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,523
Okay.

902
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,040
Three. Cool. Anybody else?

903
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,840
No. Did I talk so much that I
answered all of your questions? Sure.

904
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,080
I'll ask you a final one then
we can go to a book signing.

905
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:02,050
Are you guys going straight to like a
conference room to figure out this whole

906
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:04,480
issue after this?
We've got it booked.

907
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,570
How to populate good influences
coming into people's pages.

908
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,650
This is one, you know, you and I have
talked about a little bit, but um, uh,

909
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,570
when I went and visited the bus in 2012,
um,

910
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,390
there was some supplies and things and,
and,

911
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,740
and notes and journals that people
leave behind for future visitors.

912
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,770
And what was amazing when I visited
was there was a, in a plastic bag,

913
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:26,060
one of Koreans journals,

914
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,390
and I think it's the one that you would
take in with you when you first visited

915
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:33,980
the bus and you'd left it there for
people, I think to write in. And uh,

916
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,460
getting into the bus is not easy.
It's 40 mile round trip.

917
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,710
You have to cross two rivers. It's the
middle of the mosquitoes are insane.

918
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,830
Um, and you know, I
remember we'd gotten there,

919
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:48,200
we'd done a 20 mile day
that day to get to the bus.

920
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:51,650
And the first thing that I see on the
cover of this journal is a Buddhist quote

921
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:55,340
that said, there was no way to
happiness. Happiness is the way.

922
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,360
And it occurred to me that I'd taken
this journey to find something.

923
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:04,010
At this bus as did by the graffiti. There
are hundreds, maybe thousands of people,

924
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:08,870
um, all seeking something. But this
quote talks about it being within us.

925
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,560
Can you talk about it all that has
resonated with you and in your life?

926
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:17,000
That's it. Self awareness. If you
don't get away from that noises,

927
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,340
society sometimes, and you don't
have that self awareness. I mean,

928
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:24,540
it breaks right down to kids going to
college or they don't go to college.

929
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:27,690
They go into a career or they're
doing it they want to do,

930
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,210
or they're doing what
they were told to do.

931
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,090
Are they following their own path or are
they following a path that was laid out

932
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:37,440
for them?
It's not just academics,

933
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:41,820
it's also socially. You know, it.

934
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:46,680
All of these influences that are all
over the internet are determining these

935
01:00:46,681 --> 01:00:50,490
paths and these choices that
we all make all the time

936
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,460
and

937
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,760
the kids are watching it around.
We'll cluster Corinne, thank you.
