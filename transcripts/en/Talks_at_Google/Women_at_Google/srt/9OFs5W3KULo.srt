1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,590
Thank you very much. It's loved.
It's a real pleasure to be here.

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,680
So thank you for giving up
your lunch hour, I believe, uh,

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,680
to come and hear me talk about my book.
And My name is Helen Scales.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,640
I'm a marine biologist. Um, and just
in case any of you are wondering,

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,920
that is my real name scales fish. Yes. Um,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,260
uh,
and this is my book spirals and time,

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
the secret life of curious
afterlife of seashells.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,780
And I want to tell you
a little bit about how,

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,490
why I wrote the book and tell you a
few of the stories that go into it.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,530
Um, starting off, um, all really
the title files and time, the,

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,980
the secret life of curious afterlife
of seashells. And in the review, I, uh,

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,000
I got in the Guardian

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,700
newspaper a few months ago.
Uh,

14
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:54,030
I made the mistake of reading below the
line on the website version and looking

15
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:57,990
at some of the comments people had
written and one person felt necessary to

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,040
comment on the subtitle.

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,630
The secret life of curious afterlife
was clearly a clever, clever title, uh,

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,280
provided by the publisher in forced
on this kind of popular science book.

19
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:12,450
It's the sort of tightly have
to have, um, luckily, uh,

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,440
somebody else commented also what it,

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,380
it just kind of tells you what
the book's about. That's fine. Um,

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,220
but actually it wasn't my publishers.

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,460
It was my mom who came up with the title
and subtitle and I'm really pleased he

24
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:29,010
did because, um, it means she kind of got
what the book was about. It's like she,

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,190
um, from me talking about
it for ages and, uh,

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,640
and also making a read bits
of it as it was going wrong.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,360
She clearly kind of got what
it was I was trying to do,

28
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,690
even perhaps before I
really realized. Um, so yes,

29
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:45,150
there's really two
things I'm doing in book.

30
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,330
One is telling the story
of the lives of the shell.

31
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,650
Michael's the animals that make
seashells and we all know those beautiful

32
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:56,910
objective find on a beach. Um, Martin
pick them up and taking them home,

33
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,380
but what did they come from?

34
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:02,490
How they made what happens in the lives
of the creatures and that left these

35
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:06,200
shells behind. So I
wanted to tell Polly, uh,

36
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,740
the story about the wonderful creatures,
the mollusks that makes the shells. Um,

37
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,270
mollusks are really one of
the most strange, smart,

38
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,010
tough, um, ancient and successful
groups of animals on the planet.

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,830
Um,
we're talking about familiar creatures,

40
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,860
mollusks range from slugs and snails and
squid and octopus to slightly stranger

41
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,011
things.

42
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,850
You might not have heard of things like
argonauts and see what supplies and

43
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:36,840
Chitins and weird little things called
Selena gastros that limit the bottom of

44
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:40,900
the sea. And frankly just
looked like worms. But they
are still modest because, um,

45
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,010
they are one of the most diverse
groups of animals on the planet.

46
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,940
I'm really, they were really
beaten by the arthropods. Um,

47
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:51,840
another phylum,

48
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,810
these are phyla that we're talking about
to kind of bleeping within the animal

49
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:58,810
kingdom. And the arthropods
secured all the insects. Um,

50
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,480
so they definitely weren't
in terms of the, the,

51
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,890
the largest number of species within
a filer does over a million species of

52
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,770
insect alone.
Most of them a beetles.

53
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,800
But mollusks come in like a
good second place frankly. And,

54
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,100
and they are an incredibly strange
bunch of animals that live all sorts of

55
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,940
different lives.
Um,

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,230
it's thought I could be about 50 to a
hundred thousand species of Mollusk alive

57
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:26,470
today that we've
described already. Um, um,

58
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,150
do you have know for
sure cause there's no,

59
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,260
up until now there hasn't been a central
catalog to list all the names of all

60
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,930
the monitors that had been described
scientifically. We are now doing that.

61
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:39,931
So hopefully we will get a bit more of
a grasp on just how diversity is Amazon.

62
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,220
Um,
but uh,

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,540
it's thought by some of
the leading thinkers and
scientists who work on mollusks

64
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,220
that actually there could be more like
200,000 species including ones we haven't

65
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,640
discovered yet, including
creatures like these guys. Um,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,720
so these are all micro cause they would
just gave a found in Papua New Guinea

67
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,560
just last summer.

68
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,970
They are all under five millimeters in
size about size of your little fingernail.

69
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,490
And none of these have been
described scientifically yet.

70
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:09,580
They've just been found.

71
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,420
They were found during an expedition
led by guy called Phillip,

72
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:17,350
you shade from the Natural History Museum
in Paris and he basically spends his

73
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:20,630
life going around the world leading
expeditions, trying to find as many mamas,

74
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:22,600
cause it's possible people
do this kind of thing.

75
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,810
Scientists focus on a group and you know,

76
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,160
really try and figure out what's going on.
Um,

77
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,400
these were all found around
coral reefs. Um, and they just,

78
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,930
just incredible creatures.

79
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,950
I mean these are types of Melissa
snails and clams that no one's ever seen

80
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,950
before. I mean, that was a clown with
pink tentacles. Begin the sake and,

81
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,000
and transparent shells and you can see
it as the skin underneath is brightly

82
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,290
colors.
Um,

83
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,300
but these particular animals and
plenty more that they find on these

84
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:52,780
expeditions, uh, remain kind
of on a, on a museum shelf.

85
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Undescribed they're called orphan
species because we lack the expertise to

86
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:02,530
actually have people sit down and name
individual species but just don't know

87
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:06,800
enough about this kind of diversity.
Um, so there's all this headon,

88
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,020
this hidden side to the lives of mollusks.

89
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:12,850
That was partly what I wanted to talk
about in the book was all the things that

90
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,490
we don't yet know about.
This incredible group of animals,

91
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,480
including the species that we haven't
yet found. And um, and Phillipe,

92
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:22,840
I spoke to him and he's one of the
people who really thinks they could be

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,770
200,000 species of mollusks and a,
and he should know he's looking for them.

94
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,270
He's finding more and more all the time,

95
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,240
even if all he's really doing is doing
a headcount and this is something

96
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:34,510
different. We don't know what it is yet
and we don't know what it might contain.

97
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,440
We don't know how it lives,

98
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:37,870
what interesting things that
these animals might be doing.

99
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,550
And one of the things I really kind of
amazed me while I was writing the book,

100
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,360
um, right up until the point
where by publishers were like, no,

101
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:49,390
you have to stop now. You cannot
put any more signs into this book.

102
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,860
There's so many new discoveries are coming
out of the mollusk worlds that pretty

103
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:55,240
much every week I'd be like,
oh,

104
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,960
there's another cool story I want to
put in the book. Like the fact that, um,

105
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,750
thin pits have the toughest teeth made
out of the toughest known biological

106
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,270
material.
They've knocked spider silk off the perch.

107
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,170
And they figured that actually because
these are the snails that kept themselves

108
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,600
to rock and spend their lives
scraping the rock with their teeth,

109
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,360
they've evolved this incredibly
strong material in their teeth.

110
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,990
So it's like that has to go in the
book somewhere. We have to get it in.

111
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,770
And then I think actually just the last
thing I did manage to get in the book,

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,060
the last story was, um,
about how cone snails,

113
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,900
these are poisonous sees now that live
in the tropics and they are kind of

114
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:34,901
notorious for having incredibly diverse
and complex toxins that they used to

115
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,790
hunt all sorts of animals,
including fish.

116
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,460
And there are a few species
that if they sting a human,

117
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:43,610
they will actually kill them.
A bit of an overkill,

118
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,880
but there's reasons why we think they're
such powerful computers so that they

119
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:51,290
can actually a tiny snail that slowly
slides along the seabed has the ability to

120
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,170
eat fast moving fish,
which is kind of incredible.

121
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,880
And a new discovery just came out a few
months before the book came out. Um,

122
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,320
that they in fact use insulin as part of
their weaponry so that the only animal

123
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:06,400
we know that's kind of
evolved this hormone.

124
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,300
So that essentially knocked out
its prey by giving it a dent,

125
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:12,830
a dose of insulin so that their blood
sugar levels drop and they faint and they

126
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,770
can then eat these fish.
And that's just really cool.

127
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,000
So there were lots of
incredible, cool, um,

128
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:23,120
amazing mind blowing discoveries coming
out of the vonner squirrelled. Um,

129
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,420
and that was a really big part of what
I wanted to do with the book was to

130
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:30,320
capture this excitement of what we're
discovering and the applications of a lot

131
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:30,860
with this.

132
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,090
This sciences is kind of exciting to the
cone snail veterans that have been used

133
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:39,740
to develop medicines that have been
used in biomedical research. Um,

134
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,890
the fact that razor clams, I don't know
if you've ever seen a long thing, um,

135
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,210
shells you might see on a beach.
They borrow themselves in the sand,

136
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,870
but they're much more efficient to
doing it then, then just their muscles.

137
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:55,280
And the shape of this, the strength
of their shell would suggest. Um,

138
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,390
and um,

139
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,210
researchers have figured out that they
actually have this clever technique of

140
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,910
creating little pools of
quicksand around one mistake,

141
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:05,270
dig down and it's incredibly
efficient way of Berry of borrowing.

142
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,870
And um,
this could lead to the next generation of,

143
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,700
of underwater robots that can now fix
things to the seabed even and sort of

144
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,530
undersea cables for the Internet.

145
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,470
It could be being fixed down by these
dog robots inspired by razor clams.

146
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:24,080
So there's tons of cool
stuff about Valascus that I
was trying to talk about in

147
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:27,290
the book. And um, and some of the,

148
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,320
what I wanted to capture too with some
of the big discoveries and some of the

149
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:34,880
big questions that scientists have
thought about when it comes to shells and

150
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,470
mollusks, um, over the years.

151
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,490
And one of the big ones is
the shape of their shells.

152
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,390
How is it that Shell's on made?
They've got these,

153
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,480
many of them are beautiful spirals.
I called my book spirals in time.

154
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,290
I guess cause I wanted to earlier to the
idea that these things have been around

155
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:56,291
for a long time and spiraling around
these carbonate spirals have been,

156
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,940
I've been around for probably
for half a billion years.

157
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:04,350
We think mollusks first evolved in the
oceans about 500 million years ago. Um,

158
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,320
how do they make their shells and why
are there so many different shapes?

159
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,890
And then lots of great thinkers have put
their mind to trying to work out what

160
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:16,020
is the mathematics that light
behind shells and shall making, um,

161
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,280
one of the simplest parts of a shell
of a mollusk aspiring to them is the

162
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:24,670
logarithmic spiral and spiral that
expands at a constant rate. Um,

163
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,750
it was when I Descartes who came
up with this idea of a log spiral.

164
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
And if you cut through a chambered
Nautilus, which is this shell here,

165
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,750
and you get a pretty good
approximation to that,

166
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,660
that logarithmic spiral into dimensions.

167
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,270
And if you look at lots of
different mollusks, uh, lots of,

168
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,520
many of the guests reports
with the spiraling shells,

169
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,600
the snails as well as these,
the Nautilus is and various other,

170
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,060
the bivalves two clans and so on,
they do,

171
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,500
they do still have spirals in their
shells. We'll come to that. Um,

172
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,220
what about in three dimensions?
That was the next big question.

173
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,280
That's that scientists were thinking
about mathematicians and philosophers

174
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:04,281
wanted to figure out how could you make
a three dimensional shouts all very well

175
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:05,850
to say you've got these two dimensions.

176
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:08,700
The locks viral is really
important actually because, um,

177
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,280
the matter how big or small it is,
it's the same shape.

178
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,230
And that is a key rule to making shells.
Is that that tiny or if they're huge,

179
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,350
they um, because they, uh,
they will stay the same shape.

180
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,700
So mosques keep their shells that whole
lives unlike crustacean the crabs and

181
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:27,240
lobsters which shed their shells and
brought new ones mollusks keep the same

182
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:30,730
ones and just growing bigger and
bigger, but they stay the same. Um,

183
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,180
they stayed the same shape. People
if they're tiny or huge. Um,

184
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,030
but how about three dimensions? Um, so
it was, um, if turn of the 20th century,

185
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:43,230
there was a guy called Darcy went with
Thompson who wrote a book called on

186
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:44,940
growth and formed and,

187
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,020
and he was really thinking about shapes
in nature and how can mathematics

188
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:54,021
described the shapes of a splash or a
dia is Adler or indeed the shape of a

189
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:59,380
three dimensional inspiring Chubb. And
he came with the idea that perhaps, um,

190
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,520
you create these three d shales by
spinning a two dimensional shape in three

191
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:08,740
dimensions. Um, so essentially what he's
looking at is having like a central axis,

192
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,510
okay. That pictures, um,
around which may be a circle,

193
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,550
a flat circle spins around and it can
either do so in the same plane or it can

194
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,700
drop down that, that access. It can, um,

195
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,150
the wiles of the show can
overlap each other or not.

196
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,220
And perhaps it would only take
three m this is running away,

197
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,583
um,

198
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,090
three or four simple rules to actually
make all the different channels that you

199
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:39,210
see in nature. So he came up with
this idea, just a theoretical idea.

200
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,310
He couldn't test it.
All he had was paper and Pencil.

201
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,540
Could you make all of the shelves we
see in nature with three simple rules of

202
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,840
this single circle spinning
through three dimensions,

203
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,950
how tall it gets along the access,
and how,

204
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,890
how much those worlds overlap each other.

205
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,900
These ideas we'll pick top or 40 years
later by a paleontologist called David

206
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:02,980
route. Um, who did something
unusual for a paleontologist. Um,

207
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:07,450
certainly at the time he used a computer
and he took these equations from

208
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:10,810
Thompson and he plugged
them into a mainframe.

209
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:14,350
Ibm 1790 computer. There's sort
of thing that was at the time,

210
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,760
this was an in the 60s,

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
50s and 60s was intended to be used for
designing aircraft and nuclear reactors,

212
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,540
but I think he managed to get some time
downtime. Um, he was at Johns Hopkins,

213
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:29,350
University of Maryland, um,
and he used this computer to,

214
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:32,310
to build shells and to see if these,
um,

215
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,260
these simple rules that
Thomson had come up with,

216
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:38,260
whether you really could make all the
different styles that you see in three

217
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:41,290
dimensions. And, um, and he did,

218
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:45,250
I mean the output he had from his computer
work where it was all kind of two d

219
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:48,490
plots, which would then realize
by an artist in three dimensions.

220
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,530
But we can now have a look at kind of a,

221
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,860
a mock up of what the output of
his model would have looked like.

222
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,830
And I'm to let that run. I think it's
incredibly beautiful and mesmerizing.

223
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,220
So what we're doing here is just
changing these parameters, the heights,

224
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,390
the expansion,

225
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,190
the rate at which the
shelf flares open as well.

226
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:08,260
And just by changing
these three parameters,

227
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,590
you do actually get an
incredible diversity of shells
emerging from those simple

228
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,640
rules. That's incredible. Yeah. This,

229
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,950
the diversity of shells can be explained
through fairly simple mathematic.

230
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,070
You get the clan from a spiraling Shelly,
you wouldn't expect that,

231
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:23,320
but it kind of pops up.
And,

232
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,080
and what route did was he created?

233
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:31,081
What's come to be known as the Museum
of all possible shells and populated by

234
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,600
these shells created from this is lower
than that, these, these equations.

235
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,400
And,
um,

236
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,730
and what seem to be all these different
endless forms that you see in nature.

237
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,160
But the really surprising thing he found
was that the museum of all possible

238
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,460
shells actually isn't full of real shells.

239
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,220
If you look at the shells that
have actually evolved, um,

240
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,780
in the past through fossils and
through, um, uh, what's it like today?

241
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,250
There are lots of parts of this space if
you think about it as being this actual

242
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:05,590
space with those three parameters on
each song. The next one is that access.

243
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,560
There are large parts of this space that
aren't occupied and those shells have

244
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,360
evolved and it's very,

245
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,320
it's raised this question about, um, uh,

246
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,370
this is a theory called, um,
sort of theoretical morpho space.

247
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,230
The possibilities of what organisms
could be and what shapes they can be and

248
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:29,020
what they actually are and why
there's a difference between the two.

249
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,080
So evolution hasn't taken mollis cause
shells to all the possibilities that the,

250
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,550
um,
the simple rules could,

251
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,650
could lead to some of these
shelves just haven't existed,

252
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,130
not pointed out to some of them.
Once he made in his computer,

253
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,820
wouldn't have worked there
or clams that wouldn't open.

254
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,670
There are some that would just be
kind of flimsy and they wouldn't be

255
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:51,190
competitive, um, out there in the wild,

256
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,050
in the wild ocean and in
places where molluscs live.

257
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,330
But there are plenty of shuttles that
seemed to be perfectly good and there

258
00:14:56,331 --> 00:15:01,310
seems no reason why they haven't evolved
and there's people have expanded this

259
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:05,130
idea out now and we've built
museums of possible possible, um,

260
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,530
fish and plants and all different types
of organisms that you can look at them

261
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:12,380
or follow it and see what could be,

262
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,380
what potential shapes they could be and
then compare that to what we actually

263
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,340
see. And again, and again, you see
this limit of what is creators,

264
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,100
what evolution has thrown up and,
and what potentially could occur and,

265
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,340
and discussions are going on.

266
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,000
Like there is this division between some
people who think that ultimately, yes,

267
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:33,080
all these shelves could and would
evolve if the situation arose.

268
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:36,800
That's that shell would be well
adapted to a particular condition.

269
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,420
And there are others who
think that actually maybe no,
then that's the evolution.

270
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:45,160
Genetically there isn't the material
that would ever evolve these shelves.

271
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,410
I just wouldn't ever happen.
Um, and the discussions go on.

272
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,060
So that's one of the big questions or
look into in a bit more detail in the book

273
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:54,500
of,
of how shells evolve,

274
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,890
why they're different shapes and why
we don't actually see all the potential

275
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:02,210
shells that mathematics suggest
could exist in the world.

276
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,320
So that's the life part of the subtitle.
Um,

277
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,950
there's also the afterlife and um,

278
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,330
this isn't the bit of the book where I
talk about snail ghosts or any kind of

279
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:18,470
belief in the afterlife.
It's really just my desire to talk about,

280
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,290
uh,
how humans have used shells.

281
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,610
So after the animals inside that made
them died in long gone and they've left

282
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,420
behind these empty shells.
Um,

283
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,940
we do all sorts of things with them
and there's incredible long history,

284
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,940
pretty much to the dawn of humanity
that people have seen shells.

285
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:37,520
They found them and put
them to all sorts of uses,

286
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,350
practical and incredibly deep
symbolism and meaning and seashells.

287
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,870
Um,
I was really amazed researching the book,

288
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,220
just how broad and how universal
these beliefs in shells are there.

289
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,670
Symbols of sex and death and birth and,

290
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,030
and power and money and cultures
all over the world and even far,

291
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:00,560
far from the ocean and have these
incredibly strong beliefs. And Charles,

292
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,490
so I'm going to tell some of those
stories and I partly wanted to try and

293
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,990
reinstate some of the
grander and some of the, um,

294
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,450
the wander and magnificence of shells
in human hives because today I think

295
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:19,421
shells have kind of got more of a
reputation for being fairly kind of bad,

296
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:24,950
cheap, throwaway trinkets, their emblems
of the ocean that we can buy, you know,

297
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,850
buy from a seaside stall or
perhaps we can find them ourselves.

298
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:33,080
We don't maybe pay them that much
attention and people make things like,

299
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,370
um, there we go. That's the kind of
thing people use salesforce these days.

300
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,260
Um, and we make things like this.
And also this, which is true,

301
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,650
this was on site, found this on
sale on Ebay. She's got lovely,

302
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,620
lovely headdress on the her
all day running around. Um,

303
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,300
so I basically just wanted to,
I what I wanted to do is,

304
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,210
was tell stories of how people have used
shells in the past in ways that it far

305
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:01,290
more magnificent.
So this guy here is about 7,000 years old.

306
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,320
I don't know why does this morning star,
I'm going to just hang on a second.

307
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,580
Let us do this a different way so it
just stops, stops going too quickly.

308
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,870
Um,
so yeah,

309
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:16,940
I wanted to tell stories of how people
have used towels not to make comedy frogs.

310
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,260
So next. Um, so this is, uh,

311
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,410
this is a great founder in Bulgaria.

312
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,250
Um, and uh, about 7,000 years
old time of old, you didn't,

313
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,390
it's cool.
They're called the old Europeans.

314
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,340
Then you wonder why it's
doing that auto advance on

315
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,950
it doesn't matter.
I want to tell you what I can do,

316
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,400
what I can put up the pdf and
use the pdf. Yeah, thanks. Sorry.

317
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,443
Okay,

318
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,310
excellent.

319
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,190
Sorry. Um, yes.

320
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:10,610
Stories of shows been using
human lives that's um, this,

321
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:14,680
this incredibly rich history of, of, of
the beliefs and the symbolism of shale.

322
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:19,460
So this, this, um, chat is the
leader of the Wianno community.

323
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:24,461
These guys lived in Europe for about
7,000 years ago up until this point when

324
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:28,730
this was discovered in the 1970s, this
grave in a, in a city of the dead,

325
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,500
um,
in Bulgaria.

326
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,490
It was still that the Europeans were
quite in the gutter Terrian group and that

327
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,310
they were mostly just,
um, nomadic farmers.

328
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,080
That was their sign up until that point,

329
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:42,950
have any elites who are kind of in charge
and that society was fairly even an

330
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:47,910
equal. And then they find a grave
with a guy covered in gold and, uh,

331
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,430
with all sorts of jewelry, uh, including
some very beautiful shall jewelry.

332
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,660
And that's why I want to talk
about this particular case. Um,

333
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,760
around this guy's upper arm.

334
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:01,760
You can see on one side he's got
bangles and commuting a white one.

335
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,350
And that's made from a
shell called spawn diagnose.

336
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,580
It comes from a long way from this part.
It wasn't coming from the Black Sea,

337
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,340
but from the Mediterranean. And, um,

338
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,500
and there was this long
distance trade in the shells,

339
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:15,890
correspond spondylitis that were
carved into beautiful objects, um,

340
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,930
all the way across Europe to Paris.

341
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,070
And I know from what was done with them
was they were carved into bangles at

342
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:25,980
people wore. Um, and it, there's even
been studies to show you that, um,

343
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,030
some of these bangles are put onto
people's arms when they were children and

344
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:32,240
then they, they drew into them
and can take them off again. Um,

345
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,460
this particular one there
was just really intriguing.

346
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:39,350
So it was carved from this big shell,
these big spot in apple spiny oysters.

347
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,350
It's another name for these shelves.
Then in life, they're covered in spines,

348
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,160
but cut them through and they've got
this beautiful bright white home show and

349
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,790
coughed into a bangle roquette's kits
and then fixed it with gold plates.

350
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,160
Um, and that's what this guy's wearing
and we don't know why they did that.

351
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,470
Spurious others,
this is very solid.

352
00:20:56,471 --> 00:21:00,160
The remains that seem to have been
deliberately broken of these shows, um,

353
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,510
left in graves. So there's some
significance behind this particular,

354
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,290
this particular show was always the same
species that was being used and then it

355
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,710
just disappeared. And they stopped being
used at this about 6,000. He's got,

356
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:15,180
and that's it. No more spondylitis. Um,

357
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,480
there was a parallel trade in spawn of
shells in the Americans with the Aztecs,

358
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:23,430
the Mayans, they were using spawn dollar
sales, fall decorations and money. Um,

359
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,990
they were carving statuettes of humans,

360
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,500
giving them to children and taking them
to the tops of the highest mountains and

361
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,660
leaving them there as human sacrifices.

362
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,560
So there were all these incredible
significant stories about shells.

363
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,300
So I tell some of those
stories in the book, um,

364
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,090
and hopefully kind of try to
William State some of the,

365
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,460
the sense of mystery and wonder
about what watch hell's are.

366
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:48,550
And I think one of the reasons people
value them so much is because they come

367
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:52,060
from this doc, uh, deep
ocean where, you know,

368
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,250
full of sea monsters
and things we can't see.

369
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,490
But these beautiful objects washed up on
beaches and people have always wondered

370
00:21:57,491 --> 00:22:01,630
why they come from and how they're made
and holding them. Great three meeting.

371
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,883
So,
uh

372
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,630
Oh no,
I'm breaking the time.

373
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,523
Sorry.

374
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,360
That's fine.

375
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,100
And so it wasn't,
uh,

376
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,370
the beliefs and the kind of symbolism
and mysteries of shells have an all just

377
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:24,460
died out in the past. There's plenty of,
of modern thank you very much. Security.

378
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,210
Um,
there are still some,

379
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:30,390
some one stories in modern of
of shelves fitting that role of,

380
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,480
of some mysterious objects surrounded by
sort of significant beliefs and ideas.

381
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,460
And, and I followed the story of one
of them in the modern world today.

382
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:46,230
If this stuff could see
silk silk from the seat.

383
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,690
And lots of ancient stories have been
told about this stuff called [inaudible],

384
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,350
which comes from a shell
called the noble Penn Shell.

385
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:57,510
It was crazy in the Caribbean,
in the Mediterranean,

386
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,260
they can go talk to a meter tall.
They look like giant muscles,

387
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:02,390
just like a muscle that you would eat.

388
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,380
They stand really tall
and this stuff called CSO,

389
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,940
it comes from the threads that they
make to anchor themselves to the seabed.

390
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,930
If you've ever eaten muscles or had
cooked them a breathing muscles,

391
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,200
you will probably have to bid them and
put young cows the a fibers. That's that.

392
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:18,300
They have same stuff.

393
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,350
I mean these shells have really big ones
cause they been bigger and they have to

394
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,720
use that there. And biceps threads,
which I'll come back to, to, to,

395
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,330
to anchor themselves solidly into
the, don't get swept away. Anyway.

396
00:23:30,331 --> 00:23:35,160
So there's lots of stories told
about Cecil also known as basis. Um,

397
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,480
there are stories told of the
ancient Egyptians varied there,

398
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,480
pharaohs and wrapped in cloth made of see,
Soak.

399
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,910
Henry the eighth had a picnic for the
king of France with his men all dressed in

400
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:48,120
golden.
See soap.

401
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,090
And the stories go on and on the stories
in the Bible of [inaudible]. Um, and,

402
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,350
and a lot of people do still
believe that the, you know,

403
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,980
this has a very ancient origin. Maybe
thousands of years ago. And I went to,

404
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,540
uh, to southern, yeah.

405
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,390
To find and to meet the lady who
calls herself the last Maestro Fci.

406
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:09,470
So can, she says she's the
only person left in the world.

407
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:12,980
He knows how to weave fabric
and threads from this,

408
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,220
this fiber lady called Chiara Vigo.
Um,

409
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,700
there was a story in the BBC
couple of days ago about her. Um,

410
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,460
it might seen it on the BBC website,
check it out.

411
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,780
That gives one side of the
story, which is interesting, um,

412
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,110
about what she goes up to.

413
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,690
And she has a museum of business advisors
museum and a tiny island of Sardinia

414
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:36,050
called some kind of yoga where
she does she practices. We even,

415
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:38,870
she shows people how
this is done. And, um,

416
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,250
we tells all these stories about isis
and see sort of going back into the Bible

417
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:46,050
and beyond thousands years ago.
Um,

418
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,380
but as I was researching
and working on the book,

419
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,310
I met and spent a lot of time with,
um, a few people who actually study.

420
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,180
Cecil can look at them. Um,
the, the academic side of it.

421
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,800
And scholars have tried,
have traced records of sea salt back in,

422
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,570
back in the literature back into the
past and discovered that there's a big

423
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:09,410
problem with this story that Cecil
silk is such an ancient stuff. Um,

424
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,150
and, and really it comes down
to a spelling mistake about, um,

425
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,800
well in the 15th century,

426
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,690
a lot of talk about sea salt goes back
to Aristotle's book on the history of

427
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:24,710
animals and he talks
about Penn shells and, um,

428
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,620
how, uh, they have these, these,

429
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,470
these fibers coming out to
them called [inaudible].

430
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,120
And therefore sea salt comes
from Penn shells and it's, uh,

431
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,800
it's connected to this work basis. Um,
but actually what the truth of it is,

432
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:41,990
is that word basis was never
connected to Penn shells.

433
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:43,640
When Aristotle originally
wrote those books,

434
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,530
it was a translation much later that miss
translated a word that means deep and

435
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:53,100
depth. The word that leads us to
things like, um, at this, um, and um,

436
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,550
bathysphere so word for deep,

437
00:25:55,551 --> 00:26:00,530
what he was originally saying was that
these shells grown the deep water. And,

438
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:03,170
um, and that was that, that's
why he used the word biceps.

439
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,890
And a translation came along, um, in
Latin later on in the 15th century,

440
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,910
shifted an accent from one word of,
I think it actually from the Greek,

441
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,900
from one letter to another and
changed it from meaning deeper too,

442
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:16,340
meaning fine cloth.

443
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,910
And from then on by Isis was associated
with fine cloths and there is a word by

444
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:25,940
isis that means linens and cottons
and all sorts of fine fabrics but not

445
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:26,774
specifically.

446
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,080
But once that translation kicked in and
it was a really popular translation of

447
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:32,900
that book by Aristotle,
everyone thought that by Isis,

448
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:35,210
whenever it was mentioned back in,

449
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,010
in all of the old texts refers to CSUMB
and it doesn't, it just means fine,

450
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,890
plump. So unfortunately all this talk
about Cecil being this ancient stuff,

451
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,930
it doesn't really have any foundation,

452
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:49,020
but no one really is listening to
these scholars who were saying,

453
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,110
have you actually looked and seen
that there is this mistake and we're,

454
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,300
we're actually telling stories that
aren't true. But that doesn't stop. Um,

455
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,170
a certain lady continuing to show people
this and that's fine. I went to see her,

456
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:03,780
she was very pleasant and she
showed me what she was doing.

457
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,080
But when I was in Santiago,
I also met, Uhm, okay,

458
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:10,680
that's a lump of law by service before
it's been processed as it's been pulled

459
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:12,840
off the shelf,
it's got little bits of seashell in it.

460
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,200
And that freeness shop is
a piece of process by Isis.

461
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:20,070
The Cecil before she leaves it,
um, I met these ladies who also,

462
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,850
so we've see so soon.
Chiara is not the only one.

463
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,100
She claims to be the maestro. But there
are some other people who still do it.

464
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,200
And these lovely ladies show me the same
process, how, how they card the fibers,

465
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:36,060
how they spin them and then use them
to, we've um, uh, embroideries I guess.

466
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,290
And the problem, one of the problems is
that the pen shells and are protected.

467
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,140
There are protective species cause for
various reasons they're not doing very

468
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,250
well. They live in sea grass beds, um,

469
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,560
which just suffering from things like
climate change and habitat destruction.

470
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:52,530
So they've been protected and you're
not allowed to actually take them.

471
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:55,620
It's illegal to take these shells.
What harm limit any way.

472
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,010
Kiarra claims that she has found a a
way of sustainably harvesting CSUMB from

473
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:06,570
Shell's, uh, by taking them up and snip
threads and then putting them back.

474
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,500
Um,

475
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,210
the problem is that she's so surrounded
in secrecy and what she does that no one

476
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:15,330
is allowed to go with her
while she's doing this. Um,

477
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,250
and so I can't comment as to whether she's
actually doing this sustainably or if

478
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:24,210
she's up to something else because she
absolutely refused for me to go with her

479
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:26,820
and see what she was up
to. Um, the other ladies,

480
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:30,180
this is the picture of these two groups,
these guys,

481
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,600
these guys just subpoena and Asam, Tina
Pez, we're very open and said to me,

482
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:40,230
you know, we can't get hold of many more
fibers. We can't do this new anymore.

483
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,160
They had a little collection of it that
their grandmother had given them and

484
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:45,900
they use it to show people like me who
wants to just want to see how it's done.

485
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,400
Mostly that mostly they just use other
fibers these days and carry on with their

486
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:52,230
traditional weavings,
but not with CSOS.

487
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,500
And occasionally a fisherman will find a
dead shell and give it to them and they

488
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:58,290
have a bit more to use. But then like,
you know, it's a thing of the past.

489
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,390
We want to remember how it's done,

490
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:03,450
but we can't pretend that we can still
do it because these shells just aren't

491
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:06,510
available. Um, and I just got this very,

492
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,760
I felt like when I was
reporting on the story,

493
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,560
this was not what I was expecting at all.

494
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:14,790
I was just expected to tell a simple story
of this strange old fiber that's been

495
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,110
here since the Bible and kind of found
I was getting sucked into the stranger

496
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:22,690
story than I expected of, of things
not being quite as they should see.

497
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,630
So it was really fun.
So how are we doing for time?

498
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,190
Excellent. A question. I
often get asked by people,

499
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,860
mostly kids, but then they
always asked the best questions.

500
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,970
And when I'm talking about Cheryl's
and molluscs and my book is what's my

501
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:43,270
favorite shell and what's my
favorite mollusk um, so I tell them,

502
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:46,720
that's a really hard question. You do
know that there might be 200,000 species.

503
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,570
Um, but okay, if you make me, I will tell
you that my favorite is the argonaut.

504
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,980
I even have it on my teachers
that's helping with, um, and uh,

505
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,910
there's a couple of reasons why I do
genuinely think that organoids are

506
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:03,970
brilliant, brilliant.
Mollusks. Um, firstly,

507
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,780
all they are the only
octopus that have shells.

508
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,830
So up to pursue the other mollusks
that generally have, um, evolved.

509
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:13,990
Like for that Michelle, they'd
have a soft life. They're very,

510
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,370
have evolved other mechanisms to survive
and to do kind of be well without

511
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:21,640
having an external shell.
But argonauts still have shells.

512
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,780
I can just about make out. So this
is, it's, they also go paper Nautilus.

513
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:28,960
They're not related to the chambered
nautilus and you look a little bit like it

514
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,300
and they have this paper, Rochelle, um,

515
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,960
and then the octopus slips and sunlight
and they're very beautiful creatures.

516
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,820
I've never seen one myself.
Um,

517
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,460
they live in the open ocean and
they're really hard to find them.

518
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:42,070
You have to really just
find the shells washed up.

519
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,090
But I'm no living creature inside.
And for a long time,

520
00:30:46,091 --> 00:30:51,091
the big question was there were these
kind of sort of gentlemanly arguments and

521
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,340
debates among the scientists,

522
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,740
certainly the Victorian
Times about the true,

523
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,770
the truth behind [inaudible] and whether
or not they make their own towns or

524
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:05,380
whether they steal them from some other
animal that we haven't yet discovered.

525
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,480
Um,
this was the likes of Richard Oh,

526
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:10,110
in the guy who set up the
natural history museum. Um,

527
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,970
he was really keen to figure
out whether argonauts where,

528
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,710
what shall makers or basically pirates
that stock shelves, Monica creatures.

529
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,070
And they were just really a
story is told and all sorts of,

530
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,750
I think Aristotle told stories about
this and um, about argonauts, um,

531
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,620
I think he started it all off
actually by claiming to have seen, um,

532
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,640
argonauts using their shells as little
boats. So I haven't got one to tell you,

533
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,090
but Tom,

534
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,790
they are quite hollow and lights and you
can imagine that they would float along

535
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:37,630
the surface of the sea.

536
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,590
And he told stories of seeing these
little octopus sitting inside there,

537
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:45,730
but in their shells, um, and
sticking to have their tentacles,

538
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:49,920
which one of them you can see here, they
do spread out into this white men range.

539
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:50,754
We'll come back to,

540
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,370
but he recommend they put them in the
air as sales and they caught the breeze.

541
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,720
They drifted around in their little boats
or boats or other scientists claimed

542
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:05,140
to have seen argonauts using their arms
as Rohan to run solve along again on the

543
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:09,670
steps of the seat with that all boats.
So, um, and the story gets told them,

544
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:12,610
told if you read 20,000 leagues
under the sea by Joe Van,

545
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:16,480
he tells the story about how Professor
Eran acts at one point pops up onto the

546
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:19,720
nautilus. Haha. There's the nautilus,
there's a name again. Actually.

547
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:23,850
It's quite sweet. The, um, uh,
and he sees, uh, they see, uh,

548
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,470
a raft of, of argonauts drifting past.
It seems to go from a five minutes.

549
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,000
Um, and um, uh,

550
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,890
and yeah, with the is the is which
the sales supposedly drifting along.

551
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,510
Um, and it's his butler. At
one point you pointed out,

552
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:44,080
I don't know if you know the story of
20,000 Leagues under the sea and how it's

553
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,260
Captain Nemo, who's this
kind of crazy, um, um,

554
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,110
Marriner who kidnaps the scientists
and takes him around the world, um,

555
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,380
in the nautilus, which is just
suffering. Um, and there's, uh,

556
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,500
there is some scientific truth, a lot
of the stuff that he writes about us.

557
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,850
What was the science at the time we
knew about, um, that's your van was,

558
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:04,370
it was really a marine biology book,
but kind of with a story,

559
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:07,190
which is quite nice. And,
um, professor Aaron Acts,

560
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:10,310
the Marine Biologists
assistant actually says, well,

561
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:14,300
why didn't captain Nimo call
his ship the Arbonne naught?

562
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,610
Because,
um,

563
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,610
argonauts the optimists can actually
come all the way out of the shell.

564
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,190
Unlike an autonomous, which is
like a snail, you can take it out.

565
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,750
It would immediately not be very, well if
you tried to put us near like Michelle,

566
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:31,270
but the optimists can leave their
shells, but they just choose not to. Um,

567
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,480
and Captain Nemo was kind of the
same. He could leave his, um,

568
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,700
he could leave his submarine be,
chooses not to.

569
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,060
He lives forever beneath the waves,
kind of an exile from humanity.

570
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,500
So I thought that was quite nice.
There was a point about,

571
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,600
it's like you should have called it
the up the arm and or not Nautilus. Um,

572
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,720
so yeah,

573
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:52,190
so this debate went on about
our do argonauts make their
shells or do they steal

574
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:53,024
them?

575
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,990
And the other reason why really wanting
to tell the story of I'm not some why

576
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,410
they're brilliant is because of this
lady who finally cracked this question of

577
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,900
the truth about argonauts.
Um, her name's John John.

578
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,990
We've her power and she
was French and married, um,

579
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,250
a Sicilian Sicilian. He, she
went to, lived in Sicily, um,

580
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,190
as a lady of leisure. She
started off life as a poor, um,

581
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,130
in a little village in France,

582
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:26,990
but ended up meeting this
guy and get married and spent
the rest of her life, um,

583
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,370
as a scientist,

584
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,460
like basically it's a lady of leisure
that she decided that she wanted to go out

585
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,740
and just explore the world.
She explores this lady.

586
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:36,910
She did lots of studies of the animals
of the island. She sounds a bit like a,

587
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,970
a latter day. Gerald Durrell, she brought
things to live in a house with her.

588
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,810
There were pine Martins running around
and, but, but one of the things she did,

589
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:47,900
and she actually isn't very
well remembered for and
why I want to write about

590
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:52,580
her story is that she, she pioneered some
Incredibles marine biological studies,

591
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,470
um, and invented it, um, an aquarium tank
for research. And she built this thing,

592
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,500
um,
which kind of was just made of words.

593
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,980
It was an open box with wooden slats
that let's see water come through.

594
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,780
And she would anchor it at the edge of
the sea and she would take argonauts that

595
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,400
fishermen would catch for her and
she would occasionally catch herself.

596
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,790
And she placed him in these,
in these observation chambers.

597
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:18,740
And she conducted some really
quite elaborate experiments
on them to figure out,

598
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,490
okay, do they make shells or do they
borrow them from something else or do they

599
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,230
parasitize and other animal. And, um,

600
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,250
and I give the details of experiments in
the book and there's a really brilliant

601
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,790
idea. Some of them are a bit cruel, you
know, you have to do things like brake,

602
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,220
Argonaute shells and see if they can
fix them, take their shells away.

603
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,360
And she slowly built up this picture
that really did convincing each show that

604
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,940
Arbonne awesome. Yes, they
do make their own entails.

605
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,490
And in fact it's the females that do.
Um,

606
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:46,560
and the males are just
were nowhere to be seen,

607
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,560
but it was always the females she
found when making these shelves.

608
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,410
And in fact this, um, the
membrane that you see on the,
um, on the outside of start,

609
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,340
that's what makes the show.

610
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:57,510
It's really different to the other
molluscs which have this thing called a

611
00:35:57,511 --> 00:36:00,630
mantle, which covers all of their
body and that's what makes the shell,

612
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,900
whereas they have a modified the
end of two tentacles and they,

613
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,550
it looks kind of silvery when
you see them alive and they, um,

614
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:10,830
they can fix up patches in a shelf.
It's broken.

615
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,890
And they also make the show initially
they only have to make one shell,

616
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,590
like the rest of the mollusks.
Uh, so if they, if they,

617
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,100
if they're parted from that
Shell, um, they don't survive,

618
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:22,930
which I guess is what I think
always hang on to them. Um,

619
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,480
so she started having ideas.
Um,

620
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,970
we are pro power did have ideas about
why were the males that she didn't quite

621
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:32,310
get to the bottom of it.
The females make these shells,

622
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,520
they lay their eggs inside the shells
and use them as a brood chamber, um,

623
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,780
but wearing pants and it wasn't till much
later it was discovered that the males

624
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,210
are tiny, tiny, small, um,

625
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,500
and basically kind of
parasitize the female. Um,

626
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,840
and they have one tentacle with a
packet of sperm on the end of which they

627
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:52,440
looked at her and it sticks to her body
and she can collect a few of them and

628
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:55,860
put them inside her shell and carry them
around until she's ready to fertilize

629
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:57,080
her eggs.
Um,

630
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,070
so the males kind of having
mother different problems
in life and the female, um,

631
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,510
and still things we're finding out
new things about argonauts recently,

632
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:11,330
one guy in Australia found some
live ones and discovered that, um,

633
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,700
they actually use their chamber,
their shelves as a buoyancy aid,

634
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,640
but like chambered nautilus is
they have air inside their shows,

635
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,890
which they use to keep
them floating on the water.

636
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:22,990
So it's a bit easier for
them to swim. And, um,

637
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,710
nautilus is do argonauts
to a similar thing.

638
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,800
He saw them basically if we emptied
all the air out of their shells,

639
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,220
they all would swim straight back to
the surface gulp in some air into their

640
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:35,190
shell and then spin back down until
they were neutrally buoyant at the depth

641
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:36,024
they wanted to live.

642
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,390
So it kind of reduces their costs of
swimming by having a bubble of air inside.

643
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,660
It's like kind of underwater blimp,
which is really cool.

644
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,160
And leads me to my final thing I
wanted to talk to you about, which, um,

645
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,080
takes me back to the title of the book.

646
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,920
And also I want to tell you a
little bit about, um, the artwork,

647
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,270
which I absolutely love. And, um,

648
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,040
really just so pleased with the way
the book has come out and how it looks.

649
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,880
And it all comes down to this
picture of an [inaudible]. Um,

650
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,920
it was around the time I was writing
the Argonaute chapter that I'm,

651
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,763
my publishers.

652
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,670
I published [inaudible] said that I
really had to decide what I was going to

653
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:14,550
call the book, uh, cause we had
to come up with another title,

654
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:18,990
which early on we decided we didn't
like what's going to call it snails,

655
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:21,660
tears and fund the stones.
Um,

656
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,690
and then everyone said the don't know
what's under stones are and what's this

657
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:27,750
thing about snails death. I think
spectator if you want. But anyway,

658
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:28,920
we decided that was no good,

659
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:33,180
but I was so obsessed with argonauts and
I was writing this chapter with all of

660
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:38,000
the great stuff that she discovered.
And um, this all the city's stories, um,

661
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,260
all I can see where I'm going on.
So that was my kind of five year in life.

662
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:44,450
So I wanted to call the book
flight of the Argonauts, um,

663
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,640
especially with this discovery of how
they use air to help them swim underwater.

664
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,840
Um,
and so,

665
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:53,320
and I was hunting around a
line for pitchers of argonauts
and I found this one,

666
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,320
um, and spine, um,

667
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,360
an industry to call Tara and John Gregory
had liberty's websites and not only

668
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:04,260
did he sell tee shirts with these
island, which was really cool. Um,

669
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,260
it turns out that he's in a band
called giant squid. Um, we got into it,

670
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:11,170
he lives in San Francisco and we got in
touch and he'd just been on holiday to

671
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:14,350
one of the islands off of California
and he'd found an organ or shell on the

672
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,690
beach.
We'd have to have this guy,

673
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,420
he's a marine biologist by
training and was retreat,

674
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:22,510
has just finished retraining
as a fine artist. So he was,

675
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:25,980
as Geeky is as Geeky as I am
about all the marine creatures.

676
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,290
It's like we have to have him to do the
front cover artwork because we were also

677
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,124
looking for,

678
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,340
for who we wanted to work with on that
as well as the title of the book at this

679
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:34,174
time.

680
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,930
So we got in touch with him and I'm
really pleased that he agreed to kind of

681
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:40,570
immediately to work with
us, which is fantastic. Um,

682
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,960
and I don't think he quite knew what he's
letting himself in for because we were

683
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:47,260
still undecided about the title and
I was still pushing for flight to the

684
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:51,820
argonauts, so we were like, go and do
some argonauts. So he does some sketches.

685
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:54,960
I'm going to show you some of the
sketches that he gave centers, um,

686
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,310
an unseen before,
since it's very exciting,

687
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,910
but anyone apart from me and my
public. So, um, so first of all,

688
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:03,180
he gave us some sort of tentatively,

689
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,620
I'm on the naughty ones
and I think they're great.

690
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:09,700
And I was really just so keen to have
flights to the arms of knots on the front

691
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:14,200
cover. But no, we decided that no
one would think that it wasn't all,

692
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,680
it wasn't a book about argonauts this
just a bit of it. So we had to return,

693
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,150
think of it,

694
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,210
a different title and it was literally
coming down to the last minute of like,

695
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,760
can we just have another day to
decide what the title's going to be?

696
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:27,820
And I kept on coming up with
ideas that we're working. Um,

697
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,210
and then I went on holiday to Devin and
spend a few days mocking around on the

698
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:33,280
seashore and finding shells
and having a nice time.

699
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,460
And then spirals and time just
popped up and I thought about the,

700
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,690
and everyone else seemed to like it. So
we stopped with spirals and time. Um,

701
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,650
and that actually meant for the cover
that we then had a whole free rein of what

702
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:48,850
we can put on the front cover of the
book. Um, I should say that I really am,

703
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,060
I really appreciated having a chance
to be involved in the sign in the front

704
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:54,670
cover cause I don't think authors
don't always have that opportunity.

705
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,520
If my first book I was just told,
here's your cover, whereas bloom spirit,

706
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,520
we're keen to have me
involved and I really,

707
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,590
it's been really fun
to have to sort of be,

708
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:07,690
be a part of the way it looks as
well as the worst and side. Um,

709
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,150
so I told Erin,

710
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,950
so the two things I wanted to have on
the front cover where lots of different

711
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,480
species of Mollusk,
um,

712
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,330
I wanted to try and capture this idea
of them being this incredibly diverse

713
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:18,700
group and also want them to be alive.

714
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,960
One thing again that I really want to
do with the book is to show people that

715
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,070
Shell's aren't just these boring
dead things that, you know,

716
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,850
sit around doing nothing.

717
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,210
They come from these incredible living
creatures that live extraordinary lives.

718
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,760
So I wanted living diverse
mosques all over the cover.

719
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,400
So the first sketchy came up with
was this, um, uh, which we'd like to,

720
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:43,320
that you can just make that out and
was moved to the laser mollusks uh,

721
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,740
but Jim Martin way the term is like,
nope,

722
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:49,520
too many mollusks cut
it down to confusing.

723
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,490
How about a spiral of bollocks.

724
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,770
The Tajness Byron at times we could
have a spiral. Brilliant idea.

725
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:57,950
So we said go dose a spiral.
So Aaron did this,

726
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:01,210
a couple of spirals get to is do you
want it download page or do you want to

727
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:05,020
coming out as happier? Of course
I wanted to coming out at me. Um,

728
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,800
we then sort of said that's really
pale, but be basically said, yeah,

729
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:12,500
I'm a big spiral going across both
covers he um, pen, pencil, sketch.

730
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,030
He then, this is really
interesting because, um,

731
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,790
I didn't know how art is done these days,

732
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:21,290
but apparently what he did was he painted
these in with ink and a paintbrush by

733
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,560
hand and then he called in on a computer.

734
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,970
So he used a tablet to do
with coloring in afterwards.

735
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,900
I after scanning in the inks and then
came up with some color options and we

736
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:37,150
decided to which one we it. And ultimately
that was wonderful. And I just love it.

737
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,500
I think it's brilliant. Um, some
of the other things he did didn't,

738
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,330
he did it, this administration
at the beginning of each chapter.

739
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:48,110
So I just want to quickly show you those.
So he would give us, I would say, okay,

740
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,820
the chapter about cone snails.

741
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,550
We want a nice active cone
now and catching a fish.

742
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,070
And then he thinks those things as well.
Um,

743
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,510
tucked her about see butterflies,
these beautiful sea snails,

744
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:03,410
that microscopic animals that fly through
the open ocean whole chapter about

745
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:06,180
those.
So he did us a beautiful wedding image,

746
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:09,380
should have a seat
butterflies and then um, oh,

747
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:12,080
I'm an [inaudible] but actually
that's the top two with the argonauts.

748
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:14,450
And they talk also about the
ancient extinct mollusks.

749
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,050
And this is power pursues the are the
biggest ammonite that we did like three

750
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:21,910
meters across. And the little shock
there is to give you scale. Um,

751
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,410
so did some beautiful images.
And then finally,

752
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,660
I'm really pleased that the
book can you get the hard,

753
00:43:26,661 --> 00:43:28,940
but if you do grab a coffee,
um,

754
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,780
the any plates side once this from
my first book, but they said no,

755
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,590
but I really wanted to have beautiful
sails on the beginning and the end.

756
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,770
So I said we wanted went will trap snails
because they've got these incredible

757
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:44,240
complex shells. So Aaron did a little
skit and then that's what it looks like.

758
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,170
So if you do have a
private copy hard back,

759
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:53,530
you have snails about life size
calling over the front and back,

760
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:57,620
copied her back cover. So
they do. Thank you very much.

761
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:02,990
[inaudible].
