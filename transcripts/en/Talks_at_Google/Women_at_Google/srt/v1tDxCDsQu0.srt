1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,870
My name is Nathan.

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,570
I'm just want to thank everyone for
showing up and your patients today. Oh,

3
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,730
we got this awesome little event.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,850
Go on today on it is my pleasure and
honor to introduce Jessica Lay Mayfield.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,020
She had time on her tour to come stop by
and talk with us for a little bit so we

6
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:26,040
can learn about her past and what kind
of brought her here today and we'll end

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:26,880
up like a little set.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,750
Hopefully have some beautiful songs and
maybe some Q and a but as we go. But um,

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,730
yeah. Hello. How are you doing today?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,833
Yay.

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,630
Yeah, I am. I am doing well.
Thanks for having me here.

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,160
Is this,
are we under like a giant guitar?

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,210
I think so, yeah. We're
hoping that you'll,

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,510
the finale will be somehow incorporated
into that guitar, but we'll get there.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,560
We'll get there. Yeah.
Excellent. Well, um,

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,980
you have such a long kind of career,
even though you're kind of like,

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,821
it's a short career.

18
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:07,970
Like you started in a family
band and like I was like a child,

19
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:12,620
like this seems kind of
like a very interesting
opportunity and kind of a way to

20
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:14,480
kind of adapt and kind of
guide your musical career.

21
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:16,040
Would you mind telling us
a little bit about that?

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,660
Oh, okay. Well yeah,

23
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:22,190
I've been doing this
for a really long time,

24
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,430
so I started doing music with my parents
when I was eight years old and we lived

25
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:34,301
on a old tour bus that was owned by a
bunch of popular bluegrass and country

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,880
musicians at one point and basically
just travel around like hippies.

27
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:49,121
And so I've been touring since
I can remember basically.

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,180
That's amazing. Like I can only imagine
just kind of being on the road one,

29
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,980
but let's put the family to dynamic.

30
00:01:56,981 --> 00:02:00,700
Like that could be very interesting
kind of relationship to kind of roll was

31
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:01,121
born with.

32
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,660
And then also just kind of take that
musical experience as a positive and keep

33
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:05,040
moving with.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,070
I think it just Kinda,
it definitely made, um,

35
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,480
really, it just kind of made
everyone feel like they're,

36
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:15,420
there weren't really family
roles. It was just like, okay,

37
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:19,890
we're all on the same level here are
doing the same thing. Sort of, you know,

38
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:20,171
I'm real,

39
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:25,171
I'm just traveling around trying
to make money and you know,

40
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:30,321
so it's just really interesting to
feel like you were on a team with your

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,970
relatives are awesome idea.

42
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,080
You guys take you and your brother take
that street corner and your mom and I'll

43
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:41,730
go over here and let's all play for tips
and come back and see what we got and

44
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:45,590
it's interesting.
So definitely an interesting,

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,593
awesome,
wait,

46
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,930
was there like a favorite song or like
kind of like a goto track that you guys

47
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:52,810
had it together or maybe it was like
the one you guys enjoy doing the most?

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,900
Usually.
I mean we pick kind of one song,

49
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,850
whatever song seemed to be trying
to remember right now. I was,

50
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,230
a lot of times it would be requests so
people would want to hear stuff like

51
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,610
amazing grace. It didn't feel like
okay, I was just like a little girl.

52
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,530
I'm like wow.
Right.

53
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,430
Awesome. Awesome. Well you know obviously
in your musical career denied in there.

54
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,890
I've kept moving.
And then 2006 about if my memory serves,

55
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,630
that's when I'm white lies came out.

56
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,380
That is kind of when I was
first introduced to you and
your music while you were

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,060
a tournament,

58
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,700
the Everett brothers and that was a
beautiful summer of Oh seven I was very

59
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,600
happy to meet you there.

60
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,650
But that was kind of the legend goes that
that was the album that kind of got a

61
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:37,870
particular artist, that
tension. And if I have a right,

62
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,710
the gentlemen from Black Keys, Dan,
our buck. And then what happened?

63
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,060
What snowballed from there?

64
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,180
Well, he's from Akron, Ohio
and I'm from Kent, Ohio.

65
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,510
When I had recorded that
album at home in a bedroom,

66
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,570
it ended up getting over to him somehow.

67
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,280
And then from there we started recording
just me and I've a couple of times a

68
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,070
week and recording, not really
knowing what it was going to be.

69
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:10,071
And then I ended up making my first
record with him and then I made my second

70
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,300
record with him as well.

71
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,930
How will that, cause at that time
he could have been what a teenager,

72
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,500
I would one would guess it'd could be
a very kind of unique kind of guiding

73
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:23,160
experience for like a young artist to
meet someone and kind of, you know,

74
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,200
that's a big name,
you know,

75
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,290
like an adult coming to you and
wanting to produce and push your music.

76
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,910
That seems like pretty magical.

77
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,810
I know it was definitely
interesting to kind of,

78
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,450
I had a lot of friends at the time who,
who knew who they were,

79
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:41,910
who the black keys were,
and I was just kind of,

80
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,710
I got hip to it around the time that I
met him and that was around the time that

81
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:51,420
they were really starting to
get more popular. So I thought,

82
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,480
you know, okay, I'll go
hang out with the sky,

83
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,570
I guess in work in his studio
and then it'll be whatever.

84
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:03,540
But it definitely ended up, uh, you know,

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,010
I still to this day I
meet a lot of people who,

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,940
the first album they heard is the
first one that I did really with dance.

87
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:16,050
So I think that there's still people
that are going back and finding out about

88
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:20,710
me now throw it out. And that came out
over 10 years ago. Right. Almost the sense

89
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,700
that's crazy.
I kind of did the reverse.

90
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:27,610
Like I heard that you were doing backup
vocals on like some kind of like sloppy

91
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,960
Jamey like blues band. I was
like, oh, I should check it out.

92
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,980
And then that's when I find that
you did the backup vocals for um,

93
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,090
things aren't like they
used to be, right? Yeah.

94
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,760
And that was kind of out of the reverse
kind of interaction with the black.

95
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,690
He was like, oh, like who is she playing
with? Oh, okay. Right on this, this week.

96
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,180
These guys are good. Yeah. Awesome.
Well then from there we'll,

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,890
so the next time when we came out with
them with blossoming was so heartfelt.

98
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,290
That was kind of like our first
kind of major produced album.

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,060
Not you and your brother kind of
slow for frilliest produced. Like,

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,270
how was that kind of new experience
from like family jam band panell stuff,

101
00:05:59,271 --> 00:05:59,451
you know,

102
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:04,451
like on your own to kind of like this
more kind of potentially like dynamic or a

103
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,260
specific process?
You know,

104
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,920
it's funny,
I definitely um,

105
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,610
with blast for me it was kind of piece
together over a period of time where Dan

106
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:20,461
had this rental space and he would get
in different gear and Kennan call me over

107
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,400
10 to Guinea pig and try stuff out.

108
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:28,960
And then stuff from the became that album,
which is,

109
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,430
it's funny because then by the
time I did my next album with him,

110
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:38,230
it was real studio vibes. But that
first thing was just kinda like, uh,

111
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:38,711
all right,

112
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:43,711
one of us has to like reach over and
turn this machine on and then get back to

113
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,400
whoever's closer to it and,
and who isn't starting the song first.

114
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,480
So it was very still kind of,
I feel like with blasphemy.

115
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,540
So has those bedroom
me vibes of just like,

116
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,790
hey,
we're using nicer stuff.

117
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,820
But it's just like very small group of
people that we can't even really say

118
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,803
group

119
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,490
was there. Like any kind of
like intimidation level with it.

120
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:13,850
Like obviously you've been around music
and performers as like a young kid.

121
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,920
So like what's it, it's just like
another day at the office there.

122
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,770
Was there kind of like a an all
moment and involved in it at all?

123
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,590
Um, I mean not, not really. I don't
get it. That's interesting though.

124
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:28,760
I don't really get too
nervous around people.

125
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,510
Good for you. It was great power.
More like single people? No,

126
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,670
like a large group of people maybe.
I don't know.

127
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,980
That sounds bad.

128
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,030
Awesome.
Awesome.

129
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,700
Well kind of brought up favorite brothers
earlier and like definitely have seen

130
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,650
you guys tour.
Like anytime you guys go harmony,

131
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,950
it's the most beautiful thing
ever. Well Scotty, so much.

132
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,090
And so you guys have this awesome
Elliot Smith tribute album that's just

133
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,300
beautiful and gorgeous and I can see
obvious that Elliot Smith as a potential

134
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,600
enemies, the ones are on you,
but kind of curious what,

135
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,630
what led you to this specific
project and also with Scott? David.

136
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,610
Oh it was with that. Seth, I'll stop.

137
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,800
Sorry. Pardon me. That's okay.

138
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:13,600
They were actually people that would
come to the show and still think that was

139
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,960
Scott,
which I don't get,

140
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,050
I think people confuse them just a little
bit part of my nerves. No, that's okay.

141
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,220
Whatever.
Um,

142
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,990
uh, we, uh, south,

143
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,060
I realized that we were both big Elliot
Smith fans and that was just something

144
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:42,931
we would end up talking about almost
every time we saw each other until one

145
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:47,950
point we were on tour together and we
both walk into the screen room and it had

146
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:48,621
a piano.

147
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:53,621
And when he started playing an Elliot
Smith Song and I started singing it and

148
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:58,530
from there we were like,
we should do something like this.

149
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:03,531
And we just kept sending each other the
voice memos of Elliot Smith songs until

150
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:07,260
we had an more than enough ideas.

151
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,590
That's very cool.
And slowly out of them.

152
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,560
I was always trying to put my finger on
like a way to kind of describe it and I

153
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:16,350
kind of stumbled upon a review that kind
of just said it so well too where like

154
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,690
it wasn't like you guys trying to reinvent
or like change the songs and make it

155
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:24,000
your own. It was more just kind of
like an honest homage to Elliot Smith.

156
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,180
Like does kind of like put it all into
like a wonderful nutshell for me when I

157
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,730
was like thinking of that album, like
how you guys put it together. Huh?

158
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,631
Well thank you.
It's,

159
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:35,631
it was kind of stressful because
especially as huge Elliot Smith Fans,

160
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:38,620
I think we understood
that, you know, you're,

161
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:43,621
you're attempting to mess with something
that's pretty delicate and s and I had

162
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:48,730
to put myself in the shoes of,
if someone else did that would I be like,

163
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,490
what are you doing anyway? You can't
sing Elliot Smith songs. Like, no,

164
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,390
there's only he can do that. You
know, he's the best of that. So right.

165
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,850
There's definitely that line to draw of
wanting to do a good enough job to do it

166
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:08,230
justice without making it
too different or you know,

167
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,780
ruining it somehow.
I think we just didn't want to ruin it.

168
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,180
Well, whatever level you
found, it was wonderful.

169
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:15,580
And thank you for that version of fun.

170
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:19,720
We're a fun for all of her friends is
just, it gets me, it's very beautiful.

171
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,220
Thank you. Yeah. All right. What else
do I have to harass you with? Anyone?

172
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:25,054
Compliments.

173
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,200
That's what the last pages.

174
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,530
I just have a list of things I like about
Shia so we'll get there. Don't worry.

175
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,450
Yeah. Yeah. Um, well we have your
newest album. I'm sorry. It was gone.

176
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,010
Um, it's very interesting album for me.
It felt like there was a lot more, like,

177
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,840
just seems like there's
so much happening though,

178
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,880
but it flows together really
well. Like it, no, I do like that,

179
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:48,890
but this is why I'm bringing it up.
But I'm like,

180
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,860
just like this kind of
rawness to it within it.

181
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,080
Like it's not like it's scattered.
It flows for me,

182
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:56,330
but it does have like a
different depth for me.

183
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,910
And then when I saw the title of sorry,
it was gone.

184
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:02,570
I was wondering if that was kind of like
kind of reflection of the steps that

185
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:05,930
you were trying to like kind of create
or maybe project with it because it's

186
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,580
such a kind of simple sings a little,
let's just, sorry it's was gone,

187
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:13,040
but it seems like there's kind
of a lot behind it potentially.

188
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,250
Well,
I mean I think this album,

189
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,470
it came together without
me really realizing what if
any theme there was going

190
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:25,561
to be.

191
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:30,561
And I realized that a lot of the songs
were all working together for the theme

192
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:32,890
of being,
uh,

193
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,560
not afraid to be yourself,
I guess,

194
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:40,710
which is all these things sound cheesy
and funny, but it's, I don't know,

195
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:44,400
you shouldn't be embarrassed
to talk about them.

196
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:44,911
Yeah.

197
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:47,710
And that's one of beautiful and I think
that's kind of this variation of style.

198
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:50,530
And I kind of comes in is producing this
all one kind of reflects what you're

199
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:54,790
just saying. I'm just like that genuine
self, which funnel is really awesome.

200
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,260
I was just curious about the title and
like maybe how it played with it. Okay,

201
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,830
sweet. Yeah. Alrighty.

202
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,090
Well I have some more kind of just like
a silly question is for you if we may

203
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,730
and we can lighten the mood a little bit
before we hear some of your banks and

204
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:07,290
your music

205
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,400
ask away.

206
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,810
So like I feel like there was always
someone at shows we just kind of want to

207
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:14,420
scream and I'm like song
or request at you. Okay.

208
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,840
So like is there like any in particular
that have stood out over the years that

209
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:20,690
kind of made me cracked a smile
or maybe or even like indulged?

210
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,813
Hmm.

211
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,100
See I don't think I've ever had anyone
like requests unless it's my song and

212
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,430
they requested that I might play it,
but it's like one thing,

213
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:36,280
people will go back with my
songs and I'll go really,

214
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:39,980
really far to the very,
very first album.

215
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:44,981
And what lives don't want to hear
something that's more than 10 years old or

216
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:49,690
that I wrote when I was like 15,
I'm thinking, I don't remember that

217
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,140
there was this one show where I had played
and then came back up for the encore

218
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,350
and we were all getting ready
to play our hearts around.

219
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,600
This drunk woman comes up
and she goes, no, stop. And
she's like, where? She's like,

220
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:08,800
you're going to play this song. And
it was like some really slow, weird,

221
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:12,100
sad song off of white
lies. And I'm like, no,

222
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:16,480
this is the last song of the night.
It has to be something fun.

223
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:18,750
And like she got really
mad and stormed out.

224
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,320
That's probably a more interesting thing.
I think people get really emotional.

225
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,030
If I don't do that,
they ask me,

226
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,310
well you, you're there for them, right?

227
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,170
Yeah. Like I'm sorry, like I have a plan,

228
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,560
like a list of songs to do.

229
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,150
The band learned

230
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,690
and I promise this one wasn't
like, you know, like, uh, a
temperamental question. I,

231
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,150
I didn't bring it up like on the spot,

232
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:45,940
but I was wearing if over
the years of touring,

233
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:49,330
I'm sure you kind of come across a lot
of interesting to silly to like comical,

234
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,900
like interactions or obstacles.

235
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,250
I'm wondering if you have like maybe
like one that comes to mind that like

236
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,560
brings the biggest smiles
or last as you look back,

237
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,690
obstacles, just silly
things, you know, like

238
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,060
travel and every day on the
road cars, you know, there,

239
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,660
there could be always trouble out there.
Right?

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,890
Oh,
there's always trouble out there.

241
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Like booking a hotel in the wrong city
and then driving to the right city and

242
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,250
realizing it later.
I'm trying to think of what kind of

243
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,930
goofy snafu that happened.
I don't know.

244
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,950
It's actually kind of boring honestly.
I mean it's just kinda like hotel,

245
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,810
like sitting in a hotel,
eating that sounds nice.

246
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,380
Eating in bed, uh, playing
a rock show, eating in bed.

247
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:46,191
Maybe if I'm lucky,

248
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:50,690
I can like lay in bed before
the show too if I have,

249
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,740
this is where it gets really exciting.
Um,

250
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,580
just any basically just like eating and
sleeping and it's people things driving.

251
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,200
Awesome.
Yeah.

252
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,390
Well, can I get up kind of like on
the same level, like is there like a,

253
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,320
a group or an artist that you've enjoyed
and it was kind of touring or it's been

254
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,130
kind of like a special or fun experience?

255
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,210
Well, it's funny you mentioned
it's the ava brothers.

256
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:21,211
I kind of look back on that is that was
some of the first touring that I did.

257
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,450
It was with them and with the black keys
and I was really young and that was the

258
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:32,440
first time I ever did any west coast
touring was with the avid brothers.

259
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:37,441
So there's definitely a lot of first
time tour things with them that I always

260
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:43,090
think about. So that's,
that's fine because I'll go
somewhere to be like, oh yeah,

261
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:46,360
I've been here a million times now.

262
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,320
But I remember the first time I came here.
Yeah.

263
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,480
Sweet. Very cool. Yeah.

264
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,290
And then how about like what
are you listening to these days?

265
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,080
And if there was like,
if you're, you know,

266
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,450
trying to like sit in a bed and
eat some food in a hotel room,

267
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,410
like what do you put on?

268
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,840
Okay, well let's see. Put on,

269
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,450
I don't really watch much TV

270
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,560
music. Is that what you
listen to it? Yeah. Yeah.

271
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,610
Um, and music wise it's
always, it's funny,

272
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:15,200
I don't really branch out very much.

273
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:19,490
I keep it till like the
same group of artists.

274
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:23,030
So it's always like Elliot Smith and um,

275
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,580
Saligoe Soundgarden,
just a nineties,

276
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,060
nineties classics heavy, a lot
of heavy music. Awesome. Um,

277
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:35,930
I've been trying to listen to some books
on tape, but it's hard to say a week,

278
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:40,910
so it's not a good thing to do while
driving, but I still try to do it anyways.

279
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,720
And then if you fall asleep,
I get listening today in bed and you're,

280
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,250
you don't retain any of it. So still
trying to figure out books on tape.

281
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,030
It'll be there for you.
There'll be waiting.

282
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,060
How that,
how that works.

283
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,080
Awesome. Well, you know,

284
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,400
I just wanted to kind of spend some time
to kind of like share your pass and you

285
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:01,150
hear where you're coming from.
I'm like, why you're here today.

286
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:04,480
Like maybe now it'll be a good time
to treat everyone with their patients.

287
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,540
Will see a few tracks and then maybe a

Good

Oh my goodness. If I go, I would
hate to say something too old.

333
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,740
I would hate to not, I've had four
today stuck in my head for a minute.

334
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,200
I don't want to hear that. If
you would, I would not. Yeah,

335
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,090
I would do that for you.
Goodness. All right. Yes,

336
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,660
please. It is. It's going back
pretty fun. That's best for Nathan

337
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,820

Goodness. Thank you guys.

338
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,260
Hm?

339
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,093
Yeah.

340
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,303
Oh,

341
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,620
the sky.

342
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,400
So you miss me.

343
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,103
No.

344
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,630
Swoons masons.

345
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,910
Sweet. Ah, Kay.

346
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,790
Kay.
So batch

347
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,303

say please.

349
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,980
Close to fun.

350
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,090
So home

351
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,993
this

352
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,260
situation

353
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,533
clean.

354
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,970
Um,
so

355
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,410
the word to say the phone,

356
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,570
because there's nothing to say.

357
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,233
Yeah.

358
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,850
Say

359
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,400
the same thing.

360
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,940
Ah,

361
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,540
Yay.

362
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,660
Nay

363
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,930
say

364
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,930
close to fun.

365
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,660
Oh,

366
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,920
thank you for keeping that in my
head for the next week or two.

367
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,830
What do you think? She was a little
break for us in the Q and. A.

368
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,390
You want to keep it? You want me to
play more? Do you have more questions?

369
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,520
I kind of ran through my questions.

370
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:08,630
Maybe we can do a little Q and a then it
some more songs. Yeah, totally beautiful.

371
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,890
I could play a song. Why you asked
me a question? Yeah, let's do it.

372
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,560
This just started asking me,
come up with something.

373
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,340
There was a microphone in the back of the
room for those of us who would like to

374
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:26,060
ask Jessica some questions.
Okay. Now Watch me awkwardly
dancing around the stage.

375
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,630
Hi.
Hello.

376
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,130
Well you sound great.

377
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,600
I wanted to ask, uh, what you
find most gratifying about your,

378
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,711
your career?

379
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:46,711
Is it making music and touring or is it
putting an album out or meeting super

380
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:48,220
fans?
Like anything.

381
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,010
Those are all great points.

382
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,300
I think there's something
too about it can be, it's,

383
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,360
it's interesting to,

384
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,420
I really liked the personal process of
writing songs and then I feel like the

385
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,700
process of sharing them
almost goes against what it
is because it's definitely a

386
00:30:10,771 --> 00:30:12,810
really private,
uh,

387
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:17,700
collection of feelings and then I
go out and share them with everyone.

388
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:20,850
So there's kind of those two
different aspects, which I,

389
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,260
I like getting, you know, to
have to have the contrast.

390
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,120
Wow.

391
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,600
Thank you. Yeah. Did you
share them? Whites worst.

392
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,520
Ooh. Um, I'm kind of weird like that.

393
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:40,150
So if I'm gonna work on it with someone,
then I would play it for them. Otherwise,

394
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:41,590
if I'm just working on something,

395
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:45,250
I might just play it at a
show and see what happens.

396
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:50,251
And I try it once and if I don't like
it then I'm just never play it again.

397
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,850
Otherwise,
if I liked something about it,

398
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:58,930
then it might make it's way
into something eventually.

399
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,040
Yeah. Red. Thank you.

400
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:12,180
Hi, mixed. No, I'm just kidding. On A,

401
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,700
we'll waive its subject of have a
new groups here for songwriters,

402
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,500
producers and musicians.

403
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,590
And a topic that frequently comes up
is the difficulties of the songwriting

404
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,030
process and finishing what you start.
Uh,

405
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:35,290
I'm wondering what you can share
with us about your own process and

406
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,920
difficulties you might even still have.
Yeah,

407
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,080
I think that it's, um, it's easier,

408
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:48,250
it's easy to realize that something might
not be that great of an idea if you're

409
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:52,050
having a really hard time finishing it.
So I think the,

410
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:57,060
the thing about that is to make sure
you were excited enough by the idea to

411
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:02,020
follow through. And that's something I've
learned is if that's not how you feel,

412
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,620
then make yourself feel that way if you,
cause if I,

413
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,630
if I'm not wanting to follow through
on an idea, I have to ask myself,

414
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:11,890
why am I procrastinating
on it? And just like, oh,

415
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:15,010
because I'm not that passionate about it.

416
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:20,550
So I think for me that's his main thing
is to just keep finding ways to stay

417
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:25,060
excited about what you're working on.
Thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you.

418
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,830
That's like a weird city hall.

419
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:36,340
It's just big on actually no,
we are building the road.

420
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,520
I am building the shooting range next
to the playground. I'm just kidding.

421
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,220
All right.
Hi.

422
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,200
So on that same topic,
I'm wondering,

423
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:51,500
do you write your lyrics first
and the music or vice versa?

424
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,020
That changes, you know,
something I go through phases.

425
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:01,410
She usually lyrics first and sometimes
I'll come up with a melody that I really

426
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:07,261
like and I'll hate the lyrics and then
I'll put lyrics that I wrote previously

427
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:10,990
to that.
But it's definitely two different things.

428
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:15,991
I'll write something and either I'll
really like the lyrics or the melody and

429
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:21,310
then work from there. Decide what is
it about that that I liked? Was it the,

430
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,290
the way I was it, was it the word service
of the way that I was saying the words

431
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,550
you have someone who you collaborate with,
how do we get a little bit?

432
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,913
MMM,

433
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:32,500
yeah.

434
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,340
No, I mean I don't collaborate
that, that often as far as,

435
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,470
I'm kind of bad about that with song
writing and if I do, I just have to, um,

436
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,480
a lot of times it's give a song to
someone else and leave them alone with it.

437
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:51,481
I definitely can't watch while
someone else tears it apart.

438
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,990
It's hard to be open minded to, you have
to, once you hear someone else's idea,

439
00:33:55,991 --> 00:34:00,460
it's hard to immediately not just be
like, I hate it. It's not my idea.

440
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,490
You have to actually try to see what,

441
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:09,550
what could be good about it, you know,
just because it's someone else's idea.

442
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,430
Yeah.
You're welcome.

443
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,070
These are good for thanks again
for a performance this afternoon.

444
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,043
Thank you.

445
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,440
You mentioned you've,
uh,

446
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,100
you've had like a whole life and
career in the music industry and uh,

447
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:29,190
you started out the corners shows
and mean back to the family.

448
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,390
You've seen a lot of the music industry
change over the years as well. Um,

449
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:35,040
and I'm wondering if you could share,

450
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:39,360
if you have any chronic sort of like
gripes with where the music industry is

451
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:42,990
today, where you might see
improvements in the future,

452
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,100
kind of what you'd like to see
in the future for the music industry.

453
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:53,720
Interesting. Yeah. It's
weird. It's Kinda like,

454
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,760
I don't really have unnecessary
like an idea to fix it,

455
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,790
but you can see what's happening and
it's been happening for most of my life.

456
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:05,990
I mean,
I can look back to

457
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,520
music being free when I was 10,

458
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:12,981
11,

459
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:17,981
12 and in remembering like Napster and
all this stuff and seeing that even as

460
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,000
we're kind of watching that happen and
watching people that you said to make

461
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:26,391
money,

462
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:30,320
doing something that having people not
really want to invest in it anymore.

463
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,420
And I guess that's something that I'm,
I've kind of seen,

464
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:40,270
seemed the way things have
changed. It's just not, I dunno,

465
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:43,950
but I didn't really see the way
things were at the same time too.

466
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:46,280
So it's an interesting,
um,

467
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,580
I'm really curious to see where it goes,

468
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:54,780
but I have no idea how I
could even imagine that
because who knows what's going

469
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,370
to keep changing.

470
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,880
Yeah. Yeah. You're welcome. Thank you.

471
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,080
I was looking for advice
on how not to lose this.

472
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,010
So specifically that was
when you were in love. Okay.

473
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,890
And when you read a lot of solid and
it's a great song and then you break up,

474
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,910
what do you do with that love song that
reminds you of that person to lose it?

475
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,330
Right. Do you have a way of taking
it back and the two years ago?

476
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:27,750
Oh yeah. You just, you keep
singing it and new definitely. Um,

477
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,680
apply it to something
else. I don't know. It's

478
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,520
try,
I mean give it some time if you have too,

479
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,650
but I mean if you, especially
if you really liked the
song and just be like, hey,

480
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:41,310
you know what,

481
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:46,200
the one cool thing I got out
of this was this red sung,

482
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,440
you know,
we got it that way.

483
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:54,441
Like just kind of instead of
thinking about her or whatever,

484
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,300
whoever it is

485
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,533
like,

486
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,980
yeah, definitely. I mean, I,

487
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,670
I'm kind of a relationship writer too,

488
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:12,320
so it's, I definitely write about
every relationship that I've been in.

489
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:17,240
And then eventually it goes
back to when I was a teenager.

490
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:22,040
So there's a lot of teenage breakup
set I still ended up singing about,

491
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:27,041
and I think that's ridiculous as
this is part of my life and career,

492
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:31,160
but it's, you know, it's like, hey,

493
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,450
at least they got the part of my life
and career out of this relationship.

494
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:36,284
So cool.

495
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,250
Awesome.

496
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,870
Thank you guys.
Cool.

497
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,140
How do you feel choir music?
I could do more music.

498
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,833
Hi.

499
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,860

500
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,503

507
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,393

no.

517
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,250
Okay.

518
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,630
Yeah. Everyone's going
to pay you. Yeah. Cool.

519
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:16,670

can get back to your life and those,

520
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,220

be sitting here like this.

many thanks to Jessica for finding time
in between tourism and shows and drive

547
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:59,710
in life to come stop by with us.
So another round of applause for justice.

Gotcha.
