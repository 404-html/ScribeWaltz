1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,180

Yes,
I am a Japanese old amazing consultant.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,090
I usually visit

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,540
the home and you haul
one to one organizing.

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,540
Listen,
there's a mean on this.

7
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,370
Gated the mall and let
us know cause I'm a no.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,150
So first of all, let me start, um,
how I usually work with my clients.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,870
Ah,

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,430
so this is the first example.

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,983
Yes.

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,060
Come on.
Do I need your name and just say this?

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,600
So she is the lady who lives in this room.

14
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:54,670
She is in the uh,
in her 20s.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,970
[inaudible] I'm a big,

16
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,250
they bit the look there anymore.
You cannot stand him up one over here.

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,430
You already see in this picture that
she has full of stuff on my bed.

18
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:11,130
Actually that's actually of bat. But
you might not see it. And she also,

19
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,860
how a lot of stuff on the floor.

20
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,150
It, C'mon [inaudible] they thought
of the day, all they see on it.

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,130
And she first told me that, don't you
think the bedroom is just like a storage?

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,430
They can Nigel die this time.

23
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,050
So when she comes home after work,

24
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,990
she never ever feel relaxing in her room.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,273
But

26
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,780
Holly Ball,
I'll stop my lesson.

27
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,660
It does look so neat and clean.

28
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,420
Of course,
nothing is on the floor.

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,313
Okay?

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,070
Tonto,
Zuni easier to look at the mouth.

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,290
So, uh, my job is to consult
how to organize. And Amit, I,

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,750
I've been doing this job
for more than 10 years.

33
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,093
Okay.

34
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,800
Characteristics or [inaudible] it's,

35
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,650
that's my client.
Never go back to the mess

36
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,220
because they have been transformative
to the [inaudible] person.

37
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,870
Today I going to tell you

38
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,820
how to make a hawk,
have to make your house.

39
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,580
He ordered Ela.

40
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,300
That's when you change your life forever.

41
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,090
It's a booster
post

42
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,210
about the snow. Mistletoe. No, Katie.

43
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,030
So before I start telling
you what to do, let me, um,

44
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,130
let me tell you how I start my job,
how I discovered this method.

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,890
Okay,

46
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,920
well let's take a look at
those again. You told me this,

47
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,980
I was only five years old when I got very
interested in how to organize things.

48
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,760
So let's look you gotta [inaudible] data

49
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,090
it organizing Duchesnay it home
[inaudible] and the [inaudible].

50
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,200
So I was already a picking
up every single issue. Oh,

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,640
the magazine that my mother
was subscribing and the
magazine was about how to

52
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,680
organize the house.
Well,

53
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:53,690
let's take a home cook the Turkey days.

54
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,250
So when I turned 15 years old,

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,280
I start at a serious consultation to
how to organize things if he posey

56
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,890
stereo digits
hasn't been time.

57
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,740
There was a best seller book in Japan.
Title,

58
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,690
how to add the, a technique to
technique to get rid of things.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,790
And I read that book and I
discovered the method, the cut.

60
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,060
Those are going to get good data.
Nine

61
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,873
[inaudible] [inaudible]

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,560
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] so you probably wouldn't,

63
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,260
uh, you would probably wonder what I
started, how I started researching,

64
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,240
organizing things.
First I started weeding every single book,

65
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,510
publishing Japan on organizing at the Wa
[inaudible] and I also keep organizing

66
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:59,550
thing. I worked every single
day organizing things today,

67
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,750
my own Dube next day,
my brothas room,

68
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,030
Nick's the date next to the next two day.

69
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,050
My sister's room for
all the by the kitchen,

70
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,270
living room, bathroom, my friend's
room, friends, room, friends room,

71
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,170
my classmate, classroom, classroom,

72
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,840
classroom or with a [inaudible] and again,

73
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,480
be down to my own
mine.

74
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,570
It's got a Mustang.

75
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,980
So I spend most of my teenage years
organizing things just like that.

76
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,220
Let's see
this.

77
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,900
And I started organizing,

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,960
organizing consultant
consultation business when I
was 19 plus the [inaudible]

79
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,730
Hidatsa King Sweetie. I also picked
this topic in my thesis at College.

80
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,550
It's this your,

81
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,530
you look at it so safe to assume that

82
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,760
I am la crazy hiding part,
not the

83
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,450
budget base.
So you,

84
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,480
you were perfect to think that I'm
a fanatic organizer at this point.

85
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,340
Yes.
They look at their

86
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,620
whole kill up [inaudible] or site.

87
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,990
So I'd like to present Calmeri method,

88
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,420
which I discovered to
everybody here today,

89
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,140
Heidi Musto. So let me start
called mighty missile to one.

90
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,680
So number one of come Mary Method Heidi
in one shot as quickly as possible.

91
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,533
Okay.

92
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,760
Kayla [inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

93
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,900
[inaudible] [inaudible]

94
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,410
[inaudible] [inaudible]

95
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,090
[inaudible] [inaudible]

96
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,110
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] if you think you have to tidy

97
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,490
around you every day,
gradually, little by little,

98
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,200
that's completely wrong.
Nothing that up.

99
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Mostly Anna de [inaudible]

100
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,060
Marico Tokai the small shop cook.

101
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,110
I say you still got this because you
need a shock that change your mind into

102
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,970
tidying your thing.

103
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,950
I rotate the tongue.

104
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,820
So you want to finish it in
very short period of time. Oh,

105
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,700
the muscle it's about has made guys number
cause you to go to this.

106
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,050
So the first important thing is
to set the deadline of organizing.

107
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,210
No,
it's [inaudible]. [inaudible]

108
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,760
[inaudible] [inaudible] can we can,
okay.

109
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,560
This of course you can sit
the deadline in one week.

110
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,660
Assuming that you're going to do that
every day or you decide to do every

111
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,850
weekend and set the,
set the deadline in three months

112
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,340
as it,
what's it

113
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,740
[inaudible] muscle?

114
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,830
How does a killer Matsiti
special event nowadays?

115
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,020
So don't think about tiding is
everyday event. It's a special event.

116
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,300
Just like a festival.
It's about dies in Ecuador.

117
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,410
It's one of the iPhone eight has him.
He made him, you might want to say no,

118
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,880
you know,
call me Miss [inaudible] name.

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,920
So the number one number two item and
can marry method is how are you going to

120
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:05,754
do it?

121
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,763
Okay.

122
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,810
Fault by category,
not by location.

123
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,180
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] today's,

124
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,480
it's very common to make this mistake.

125
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:32,200
If you try to organize things
in a specific location,

126
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,480
it's like [inaudible], [inaudible],

127
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,840
[inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible]

128
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,110
it's short.
It never ends.

129
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,170
If you try to tidy up and just one portion
of the closet or one portion of the

130
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:54,044
living room.

131
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,470
[inaudible] mono category e catastrophe.

132
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,430
Take play a couple of these.

133
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,260
The right way to do is to organize
by category and do it quickly.

134
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,480
It's my little daughter though.

135
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,290
What's your
[inaudible] [inaudible]

136
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,940
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

137
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:19,970
[inaudible] [inaudible] Yoga

138
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,100
cods well, for example, if you decide
to organize your clothes first,

139
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,420
take out all of the clothes
in your house in one spot.

140
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,280
Make a big pile of all of the
clothes you have in newer house. Dot.

141
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,813
Kale.

142
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,040
Yes. Your yet. Anatta
No. Who slipped it dusty.

143
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,630
It doesn't yet. Smitty
[inaudible] then. No.

144
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,320
Yes. So it just, in the same way, if
you decide to organize your books,

145
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,180
take out all your books from your bookcase
and pile them up in one location in

146
00:10:57,181 --> 00:11:01,200
there, in the house. I, he's
will they sit with me? Both the,

147
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,370
I still thought, I know. It looks hard.

148
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,000
It's really messy.
I'll tell you why you need to do this.

149
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,200
[inaudible] [inaudible]

150
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,320
[inaudible] [inaudible] they'll know.
Maybe that's comical.

151
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
If you bring out all your stuff,
books,

152
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,110
clothes in one location,

153
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,240
you visually realize how much books,
how much clothes, how many closes,

154
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,500
how many books you have.

155
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,723
Well, that's, that's what

156
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,970
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

157
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,130
on a daily life. We rarely understand
how much stuff we have around us.

158
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,650
Hey,
the wall called [inaudible] [inaudible]

159
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,520
[inaudible] [inaudible] get d'amico.

160
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,100
Nominal book pushed seal number. No. Oh,

161
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,430
okay.
This,

162
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,550
so it is a great opportunity if you
bring out everything in one spot,

163
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,530
we allies how much stuff you have,

164
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:13,060
how many books do you have so that you
can decide which one you want to keep,

165
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:16,510
which one you really need to keep,
and which way you can get rid of.

166
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,510
Talk to [inaudible] [inaudible]

167
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,130
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

168
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,620
[inaudible] [inaudible]

169
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,410
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible].

170
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,490
So from,
from this point,

171
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,370
the next step you have to take
is to sort them, you know,

172
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,940
separate them,

173
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,340
separate them between your nest ad that
thinks you need and things you don't.

174
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,640
And the criteria of this method cracked.

175
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,710
The criteria I recommend in my
method is a little bit unique.

176
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,470
So de la [inaudible],
that's number three.

177
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,400
[inaudible] method.
Septic shock.

178
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,120
Does it spark joy

179
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,670
cookie Nikki spark joy this.

180
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,300
So it's,
does it spark joy?

181
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,360
This is the keyword [inaudible] I know,

182
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:31,260
I definitely feel weird air in
this room right now. Don't worry.

183
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,670
I used to did the action of the ods.
That's it.

184
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:39,900
This is a really common
reaction in my seminar.

185
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,933
[inaudible] [inaudible]

186
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,300
[inaudible] [inaudible]

187
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,170
[inaudible] [inaudible]

188
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,670
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

189
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,230
so what I mean by saying spark joy,

190
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,770
I can explain exactly what it is.

191
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,420
So if you look at one thing,
you should question yourself.

192
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,900
If that thing makes you happy
as a make you impressed,

193
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,150
it's a
sleep state in one on it,

194
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:33,940
on this man. Got To this.

195
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,480
If they,
although Arabic Dyson,

196
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,210
Anondi's Benny people
always think first what,

197
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,530
which one to get widow.

198
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,980
But it is much more important
to think which one to keep,

199
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,420
which one you want to keep and
lived together from now on.

200
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,580
Does so it's looking like come on.
No intimate point though.

201
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,660
They're not just saying oh slash mass.

202
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,980
So I will tell you that how to make it
the surgeon point the law come out as a

203
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:10,770
solo mono Salado Cotto so

204
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,530
point number one,
make sure you touch it.

205
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,610
[inaudible] [inaudible]

206
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,200
take every single item you can
think of in your hand on your hand.

207
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,600
Well, no, well no, no.

208
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,780
And Imagine how your body
reacts to that moment. How you,

209
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,440
how you feel when you touch the touch.
The item

210
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,690
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
kind of like a door handle.

211
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,930
SUNOCO
spark joy.

212
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,440
So sparks Joey.
This is,

213
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,780
this is that we action from your body
that we action you feel from your body.

214
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:56,880
When you touched the item,
you should keep

215
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,670
cool. Now Helen, it's like that.

216
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Even most hype

217
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,210
can't see this.

218
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,990
You feel everything single part of your
body faces up when you touch the item.

219
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,130
That's the right feeling.

220
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Jacqueline [inaudible]
Dharma conceal certain Oka.

221
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,590
So on the other hand, if the item
doesn't give you any inspiration,

222
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,760
for example,
this one,

223
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,340
you start at feeling down

224
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,180
even though kind of squashed it.
Soccer.

225
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,720
Oh,
body stride at feeling down.

226
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,950
[inaudible]
quite a lot.

227
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,720
Am I mean that's hunger data issue.
[inaudible] [inaudible]

228
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,860
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
I know you are skeptical,

229
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,230
but if you really tried to do this,

230
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,230
you realize how your body really reacts.

231
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,010
It's [inaudible] definitely
after the seminar

232
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,580
when you go home tonight.
Tried part of it.

233
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,150
Yeah.

234
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,140
Well that's in the Ho Ho Ho Ho,
isn't it?

235
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,830
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

236
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,380
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

237
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,680
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
it's not mistletoe. This,

238
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,820
let me go over my three basic methods.

239
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,390
Do we quickly in short amount of time
and so by category and find the item if

240
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,000
the item sparks joy

241
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,580
ultimo [inaudible] life changing magic
of tiding up when [inaudible] mass at

242
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,640
mass. So this is my book, and if
you need to know more about it,

243
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:11,520
if you would like to know more about it,
please pick up this book.

244
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,250
Quit [inaudible] Miss [inaudible].

245
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,940
So I definitely want every
one of you two week my book,

246
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,190
but I will give you one more

247
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,203
technique.

248
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,140
Catholiccare no.
Tadashi Jen Baum this.

249
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,380
So this is the right order of organizing

250
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,390
you thought.
[inaudible] [inaudible]

251
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,780
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

252
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,210
[inaudible] [inaudible] boundaries.

253
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,670
There's definitely the right
order when you organize stuff,

254
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,690
and this is how it goes.
Stuff from clothes, books,

255
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,980
document miscellaneous items.
Then mementos.

256
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,800
Hello,
Jim bow.

257
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,400
Make sure you follow this order.

258
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,300
That's an on the scale of the mall.
And those was hashing this

259
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,330
[inaudible]

260
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,090
it's Jonathan couples.
Get,

261
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,190
am I saying it often happens when
you are going through old photos.

262
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,160
Oh, the mentors, the items
you were given from my mother.

263
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,520
It always stops you from organizing.

264
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,690
[inaudible] [inaudible]

265
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,870
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

266
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,190
that's why I definitely recommend you
this order because this order gives you

267
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:57,280
the sense of spark,
joy feeling.

268
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,250
You'd definitely learn that
feeling with your body.

269
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,670
[inaudible] [inaudible]

270
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,300
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

271
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,670
[inaudible], [inaudible]
[inaudible] or nothing.

272
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,653
Okay.

273
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,760
So in this order,

274
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:19,830
while you start with close
your body and your mind,

275
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,520
get trained with spark, joy feeling. And,

276
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:26,190
but by the time you reach to mementos,

277
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,610
you're already good at how to do you
already know how to go through momentos.

278
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,760
Sure.
Or Teen Kaytra Chico state.

279
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,540
I'd like you to try my
method with this order.

280
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,130
Hopefully tonight.

281
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,490
This coal mine always

282
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,080
works.
I hope you

283
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,610
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

284
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,100
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] I know

285
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,130
what the mass,
so I explain all my message

286
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,420
to you right now by now.

287
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,520
So I would like to open the floor
for Q and a session. Please.

288
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,800
Kinda tunnel.
Should we say thank you to Josh?

289
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,210
So there's two mikes.

290
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:27,970
There's one Mike over there and
there's one Mike over there.

291
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,230
If you'd like to line up,
um, I'll get it started.

292
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,300
Um,
just cause I'm right here.

293
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,460
So I wanted to know how do you
deal with somebody who has a child,

294
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:42,280
like a one year old child
and there's toys everywhere?

295
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,220
Hmm.

296
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,220
They buy [inaudible] advice.

297
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,243
I did initial,
yeah.

298
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,100
Well think the content is now,

299
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,380
well this isn't right.

300
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,110
Difficult. It depends on
the child's age. But, um,

301
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,280
I have two different methods
depending on the Child Age. The, uh,

302
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,870
the borderline is about three years old.

303
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,030
Did come up.
What are some on the Boeing,

304
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,040
you are on the mall or the
Bible or Carson [inaudible]

305
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,960
because if the child is
younger than three years old,

306
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,810
most of the cases parents just
organize their stuff. Yeah.

307
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,560
Stay. The more, not the eternal,
the Ariba Ocado is going to escape.

308
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
They're not, they didn't, isn't it?

309
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,920
But if the child is over two years old,
older than three years old,

310
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,800
it's time to train them how to organize
things and they're capable of it. Okay.

311
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,020
It's [inaudible] dot
com as it one more time.

312
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,890
[inaudible] day you'll.

313
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,320
Yes.

314
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,320
And the important thing at this point
is do not tell them to organize a toys.

315
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,790
Tell them to organize the clothes.
That's important.

316
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,210
[inaudible] oil.

317
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,973
[inaudible] [inaudible]

318
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,250
[inaudible] [inaudible]

319
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,620
well,
I'll tell you why.

320
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,320
Because clothing is something
you always put on every day.

321
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,520
So if you learn how to fold the clothes
that you always put on and put it back

322
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:39,900
into the clothing, the right spot,
that's the best way that they learn.

323
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,740
We they need to organize and
importance of organizing things.

324
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,680
That's the point of this name.

325
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,610
So a number one key is to
teach then how to, how to,

326
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:58,500
how to fold the clothes.
Okay. Next question.

327
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:00,800
So I,

328
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,240
I understand your method in terms of
getting yourself into a mindset where you

329
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:06,740
only have to do this once,

330
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,280
but I was curious how you deal
with things that we acquire.

331
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,930
Either things that we acquire ourselves
or things like gifts that come in to the

332
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:15,710
house.

333
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,820
Do you do an inventory annually or do you
just not let them come into the house?

334
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,100
Wow,
look all

335
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,380
I know you didn't [inaudible] [inaudible]

336
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,610
[inaudible] [inaudible]

337
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,820
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

338
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,820
these all say about this in
the bite mark at the nineties

339
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,900
you know, in her case she doesn't
really have any criteria, any order,

340
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,460
any rules for that,

341
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,773
those sticker

342
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,480
Ikea kitchen.

343
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:02,550
Because her method is completely
based on if you were impressed,

344
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,750
if you get inspired by the item.
Okay.

345
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,893
Oh

346
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,350
Steve Staiger

347
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,970
because it depends on the person,

348
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:22,080
how often you want to organize or how
much stuff you need to keep a wound

349
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:22,914
yourself.

350
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,863
Hello?

351
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,330
[inaudible] [inaudible]

352
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,660
[inaudible] [inaudible]

353
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,040
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

354
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,670
because my method again and again, it's
based on if you get inspired, you know,

355
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,110
if you get,
you know,

356
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:54,111
at the sparks joy feeling that doesn't
really bring it back to the crowd were

357
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:55,950
cratering situation.

358
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,110
It's not really depending on how often
you should acquire or how you get the

359
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:05,710
stuff. Yeah. In your room.
Thank you. Thank you.

360
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:06,544
A question.

361
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,790
Hi. Thank you so much for coming. Um,

362
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,290
the question is I have a
lot of things that I need,

363
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,560
but I don't like what
they don't inspire joy.

364
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,330
How do I find the balance between
keeping versus discarding them?

365
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,490
I all [inaudible] morning.

366
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:29,414
Can you start? Well, you

367
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,670
on this card

368
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,970
for example,

369
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,140
what kind of like item g mat study books
and like very old kitchen utensils that

370
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,633
I haven't been please.

371
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,270
They do.
Oh God.

372
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:51,660
Ah, we'll see. Talk to me tonight.
We're still not there yet.

373
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,191
I'm not only,

374
00:26:56,191 --> 00:27:01,191
I couldn't talk to [inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

375
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:03,700
is your name.

376
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,510
If you judge, those items are
necessary for you right now.

377
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,630
That means those items
to our making you happy.

378
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,380
Hold on.
This email,

379
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,630
we're still almost won the law.
Get someone to stop [inaudible] milk.

380
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,780
So even if you're not
inspired by those item items,

381
00:27:22,781 --> 00:27:26,780
but if they are necessary to you
right now, you should keep them. Okay.

382
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,090
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

383
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,070
got it.

384
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,840
So when recommendation recommendation I
can give you is that if the item doesn't

385
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:47,190
inspire you, if you don't get
the special feeling, you know,

386
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:51,510
try to try to talk it into
it. Try, try to, you know,

387
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:54,300
convince it. Convince yourself
that this is a good thing.

388
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:55,350
This is a good thing for you.

389
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,100
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

390
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,580
[inaudible] [inaudible]

391
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,280
keep doing it.
Even if the item doesn't inspire you,

392
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,580
you started getting
positive feeling about it.

393
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,650
MMM [inaudible]

394
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,150
so in this way, you probably find
all the items you have in your house.

395
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,750
Inspiring. I see. Thank you. I
was thinking, I was like, man,

396
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,313
next question.

397
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,990
Um, have you ever encountered
like in some of your clients,

398
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,590
uh, I think my question is basically
about there's shared spaces.

399
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,030
If you are sharing like a living
room or the kitchen with somebody,

400
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:46,600
maybe you want to keep it clean.
Are the things that are important for you?

401
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,990
Um,
I know that many,

402
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,830
but the things that are important
to the other person or they,

403
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,490
most of them and they're just all
over the place. So is there like, um,

404
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,560
a way to make it work? So I'm like dios
how your space like from this and how,

405
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,150
how does this,

406
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,060
okay. Can you, can you speak
up? I'm sorry, I didn't catch
the whole question. Okay.

407
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:04,960
Um,

408
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,960
I'm just curious about how to deal when,

409
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:14,650
how to deal with the case when most of
the stuff actually does not belong to you.

410
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:16,690
So it's not your decision to keep it

411
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,430
all hell. She had, I stayed at the

412
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,590
[inaudible] food by I

413
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,140
oh,
you up?

414
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,010
No. Are belonging to
someone else. Correct. Yep.

415
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,870
That's all sort of, the
muscle has made it. Okay.

416
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,140
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] isn't it?

417
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,320
You should prioritize to organize your
own items before you started thinking

418
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:53,320
about someone else.

419
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,920
[inaudible] they

420
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:01,923
go

421
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,630
[inaudible]

422
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,310
can I say from my experience,
you know,

423
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:13,880
in the past 10 plus years of my career,
um,

424
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,140
I've definitely seen a several
clients who keeps saying that, oh,

425
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:21,310
I tried to tidy up my brand,
but my husband does incorporate,

426
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,820
my kids don't relate corporate.

427
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:27,680
But if you look at clients saying
something like that, they're,

428
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:29,990
the women food are not
tedding up correctly.

429
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,600
They had lots of what you want.
Let just name

430
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,500
this is true de

431
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:46,150
[inaudible] Toyota
[inaudible] so I'm not sure.

432
00:30:48,321 --> 00:30:50,110
No Basho so they're just on the space.

433
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,060
They are not [inaudible] Schmidt,

434
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,590
the committee smile [inaudible] candies.

435
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,280
I know you'll have to
organize stuff no matter what.

436
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,050
So the important thing is you organize
your strap and put them in newer space.

437
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:09,051
So separate the space with other people
so you take care of your stuff in your

438
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:13,630
space and leave the other stuff and
other spaces to the out of people.

439
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,830
Magical one. Obama didn't. Scott

440
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,290
[inaudible] [inaudible]

441
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,250
she didn't worry about this
space allocated to other
people because that's up to

442
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:32,670
them. That's their own business. How
do you use them? How to organize them?

443
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,970
Oh, what's wrong with
Donald? Hello? Hello, hello.

444
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,020
[inaudible]

445
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,060
of course you can set up rules. A few
rules like you shouldn't really, you know,

446
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,680
anything shouldn't leak out or you
know anything. She'd be exposed,

447
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,070
stuff like that.
But that's,

448
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,610
that's the best way to do without
the people think was that company.

449
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,643
Good luck.

450
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,380
Hi. Um, thank you for coming. I was,

451
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,130
since you talk here about how to initially
kind of purge the items you have,

452
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,930
just sorting into what to keep and not,

453
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,460
do you also have recommendations for then
how you go about organizing the items

454
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:14,090
that you decide to keep or do you
leave that up to the individual person

455
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,490
day?
Bye.

456
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:21,060
[inaudible] hello?

457
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,960
Hi. Yes, there is a clear rule.

458
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,710
What's it on?
The whole thing.

459
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,010
So make sure to organize the same
cat items in the same category.

460
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,174
In the same spot.

461
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,970
Did you sang?
[inaudible] [inaudible]

462
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,560
[inaudible] [inaudible]

463
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,650
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

464
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,400
it's funny,

465
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,400
I often see at people's houses the same
I the items in the same category here

466
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,090
and there.
They're kind of scattered around.

467
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,870
So my point is to put all of
them together in one spot.

468
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,553
Okay.

469
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,590
[inaudible] guys,

470
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,630
it's not otherwise you'll

471
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,900
[inaudible]

472
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,580
yes. So as I showed you earlier, um,

473
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,640
organizing by category is very important
and another important things I can

474
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:43,540
definitely tell you is how to fold the
clothes. That's definitely a big key.

475
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,300
Great. Thank you. Thank you.

476
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,350
Hey, uh, thanks for coming here and thanks
for taking the time to write a book. Um,

477
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,840
I have a friend who, um, is, uh, you know,

478
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,020
pretty serious hoarder with
lots of stuff and uh, you know,

479
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:04,830
when you ask him, you know, do you need
this stuff? Can you throw this stuff away?

480
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:07,690
The answer is, Oh, I might
need it later. Or, you know,

481
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,290
I have this grand plan to
use this in such a way,

482
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,860
but of course that never happens and
you know, stuff just keep accumulating.

483
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,820
I wonder if you have worked with clients
like that and you know what you say to

484
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:20,340
them and you know what the outcome is.
Hm.

485
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,860
I know what the more that then a mom at
the mall at the day [inaudible] so we

486
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,930
stayed at [inaudible] Michelle,

487
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,990
that's the kid cannot otherwise

488
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:45,310
probably you were asking me the Fys
to somebody food don't even bother

489
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:46,780
organizing.
Okay.

490
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:51,170
No actually is pretty organized.
You know, he can find things.

491
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:53,080
He's just a huge amount of stuff that,

492
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,490
oh say it's not cluttered,
but he has a lot of items.

493
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,040
Is, is a lot of items and is
kind of creeping into day.
Cora. Dot. Space and so on.

494
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,650
You kind of walk around in the House

495
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,740
[inaudible]

496
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,490
not,
we'll see.

497
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,090
Um,
what's

498
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,690
[inaudible]

499
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,870
he is my client.

500
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,960
I don't think it's important for
me if he has too many items or not.

501
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,900
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

502
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,710
they will do this.
I it is much,

503
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,740
much more important to figure out if
that person is happy with that amount of

504
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:43,674
items.

505
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,700
Well,
the [inaudible] what the sealer and Muslim

506
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,780
[inaudible] [inaudible]

507
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:56,910
so I would probably recommend that person
to imagine the ideal lifestyle for the

508
00:35:58,691 --> 00:35:59,524
person.

509
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,010
Do you go out the Legal Nolan?
Could I say [inaudible] [inaudible]

510
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,950
[inaudible] [inaudible]

511
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,360
[inaudible] [inaudible]

512
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,350
[inaudible] [inaudible]

513
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,060
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

514
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,470
I think your friend need to figure out
what kind of lifestyle he or she wants.

515
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:40,420
You know, what kind of, uh,
what's the realistic life,

516
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,111
you know,

517
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:46,111
your friend wants so that he or she can
figure out how much stuff to keep or

518
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,420
what to keep, what not to keep, et cetera.

519
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,460
And this is very efficient
way of mindset for anybody.

520
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:57,790
If you would have somebody like that
in your family members, you know,

521
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:01,960
friends around you, this is really
highly recommend it. Okay. Thank you.

522
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,590
So we have time for one more question.

523
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,700
Those of you that were lucky enough
to get here early and got a book, uh,

524
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,390
Maria will sign them in the
back afterwards. Okay. Oh, neat.

525
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,460
Um, uh, yeah,

526
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:20,840
my question is related to something
that as engineers to be thinking that

527
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,460
sometimes a, be too much. That how
frequently some we should run this task.

528
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,020
They should have,
we done it in an online,

529
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:29,780
think about it all the joining all the
time. It should be done in a batch.

530
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,610
So what do you think about organizing?

531
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,100
What's the ideal
frequency that you advise?

532
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:38,160
Like should we think always be running in
our mind? Oh I just picked up a pen. Uh,

533
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,730
it's probably not that useful anymore.
So,

534
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,340
and should we always be thinking
about how should we do it?

535
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:45,890
Something like at the extreme
end would be like once in a year,

536
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:49,310
which is what I do typically like at
the end of the year in December I think.

537
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:50,060
All right,
let's,

538
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,890
this is a bag for goodwill does the bag
to throw and that's like the minimum

539
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,560
that would be due.
So what's when and when should we do that?

540
00:37:57,561 --> 00:38:00,860
Like should we do it like end of the year
she will do the every end of the day.

541
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,420
I should be constantly be thinking about
every time we encounter thinking on how

542
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:06,770
Sarah at workplace.

543
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,850
Oh good.
I know him.

544
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,550
Thank
otherwise.

545
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:26,630
Is Kai dad about okay.
This, well Mike Answer is,

546
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,870
the only answer is just do it one time.

547
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,080
It's sad about Anulka Toyota.

548
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,240
It's the noisiest [inaudible]
the wall [inaudible]

549
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,250
talking about when you should do,
my answer is right now,

550
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,100
it can be any time. But who, wait now

551
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,990
if you cut that [inaudible] Mondays.
Well,

552
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:04,660
the reason is it's not
for tidying up your house,

553
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:06,280
tidying up your living space.

554
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:11,440
It's all about how you want to spend
the rest of your life from now on.

555
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,200
Let me, I'm all day.
No. [inaudible] awesome.

556
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,200
So my,

557
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,690
I highly recommend you
to do it right now asap.

558
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,660
Good luck.
Okay.

559
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,780
Any closing comments or anything else that

560
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,533
those

561
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:43,400
get hold to [inaudible]

562
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,480
I know the, uh, the topic is kind of
puzzling. It's very unusual, but um,

563
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,820
you know, as a conclusion, I
would like to tell you why the

564
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,150
crested I started.

565
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,620
So I know every one of
us has so many items.

566
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:19,510
There are so many items in our life,

567
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,900
but figuring out what items do you or
how right now is figuring out how you are

568
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:28,270
going to live your life.

569
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,100
It's like you're not listening.
So it

570
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,723
stage.

571
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:50,510
So my method is telling you to examine
every single item in New York life.

572
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,680
That means you will examine,
you,

573
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:58,070
assess your lifestyle and the life
you want to leave from. No one

574
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,543
no

575
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,780
that, no that, that Daca,

576
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,563
Daca.

577
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,610
So once you find out the inspiration
from every item you have,

578
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:29,860
you probably learned inspiration on how
you want to live, how you want to work,

579
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:33,140
how, how you want to
be succeeded, um, how,

580
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,370
how you want to make
friendship, et cetera. Come on.

581
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,570
I need to get the [inaudible].

582
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:47,770
So find out your own inspiration point
with item and with your lifestyle.

583
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,100
Oh, okay. Cool.

584
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,860
Sorry.
Am I see it?

585
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,160
Thank you for listening to
come marry method. And please,

586
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:09,190
please touch one each item you have
and feel the inspiration from them.

587
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,620
Thank you very much today.
