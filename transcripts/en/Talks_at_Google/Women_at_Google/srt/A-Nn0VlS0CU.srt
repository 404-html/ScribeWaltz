1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,970
Thank you all for being here.
And let's begin. So first off,

2
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:11,460
Judith,

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,460
we just want to start with that with
beginning with what exactly is an empath.

4
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:17,930
If you could speak upon that.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,430
That's what I just want to say,
how excited I am to be here.

6
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:24,850
The energy here is so incredible.
It's so beautiful.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,650
And I as an empath,

8
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:31,540
I'm an emotional sponge and I tend to
absorb other people's emotions or even

9
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,810
physical symptoms or the energy,
a place and to my own body.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,350
But when it's an and when it's like this,
it's sort of true pleasure.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,000
I know it's a beautiful work environment.
So I'm very grateful to be here.

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,840
I'm a psychiatrist in Santa
Monica and I'm also an empath.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,200
And so I combine traditional psychiatric
skills with my ability to intuit what's

14
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:55,780
going on in the environment
and being an empath,

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,550
somebody who is very sensitive,
very intuitive, very open,

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,210
but they tend to take on the stress of
the world because they don't have the

17
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:07,020
same filters that other people have.
Um,

18
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:11,410
and so I feel everything now,
which can be a plus and a minus.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,910
And so I wanted to write the empath
survival guide to give people skills,

20
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,550
how not to absorb the stress of others.
You know,

21
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:21,610
particularly in the work environment.
If you're next to people,

22
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,960
perhaps you're uncomfortable with how
to just hold the space for them but not

23
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:30,130
take it on because [inaudible] take
it on and as a result, you know,

24
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:34,070
I can get exhausted or what I was a child,
I couldn't go into shopping.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,080
Malls are crowded places because I go
in fine and then I walk out with an ache

26
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:44,161
or pain or anxiety or exhaustion that I
didn't have before and I didn't realize

27
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:50,161
then as a little girl that I was picking
up the energy and the emotions of other

28
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:55,990
people, that the whole phenomena of
emotional contagion that can happen,

29
00:01:55,991 --> 00:02:00,910
that we know so much now that for
instance, if you're in a children's ward,

30
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:03,460
a baby ward in the hospital,
if one baby starts crying,

31
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:05,390
the rest of them start crying in.

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,090
Or if you're in a work environment and
somebody you know has very negative

33
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:14,740
energy and as a down or it can spread
to the rest of the people like a virus.

34
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,280
And so as an empath,
that's particularly intense.

35
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,790
And so I want to say that the, this
is a gift and we need to learn how to,

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,100
to manage it as well.

37
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,220
So I think you sort of answered part
of my second question or the second

38
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,840
question that we've put together,

39
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,950
but it was how did you become involved
in studying empathy and then because this

40
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:46,960
group is a very curious
and science minded,

41
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:51,640
I wondered if you could speak about the
science that has come out about empathy.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,600
Yeah, the science behind
empathy as fascinating. Um,

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,600
it's believed that there's a spectrum
of empathy, whereas ordinary empathy,

44
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,560
which is so beautiful,

45
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:06,160
this where you can feel something for
someone else as they're going through it,

46
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,100
but you don't actually take
it on in your own body.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,400
So up higher on the spectrum or the highly
sensitive people who have sensitivity

48
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,730
to light sound noise like to be alone,
like to be in nature,

49
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,020
a replenish themselves by themselves
rather than in crowds of people are going

50
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:24,994
to parties.

51
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,060
And then on the high end is the MPA impath
who absorbs energy from other people

52
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,670
and is extremely empathic and the
science behind it includes mirror neuron

53
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:39,820
research where it's thought that
with people with extreme empathy,

54
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:44,820
the mirror neurons, the compassion
neurons of the brain are hyperactive,

55
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,270
where they're just working on over time
where we feel compassion for everything

56
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,630
and everybody and the world.
And it could get to be too much,

57
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,910
but it's thought that the mirror neurons
are really working overtime as compared

58
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:01,440
to let's say a narcissist or
a sociopath who are thought,

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,730
who have empathy deficient disorder,

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,370
meaning they don't really
have empathy as we know it.

61
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,820
There are mirror neurons are
thought to be hypoactive,

62
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,120
meaning they're not really
functioning at full tilt.

63
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,050
And then there's the whole
phenomena of emotional contagion,

64
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:22,051
which I mentioned is that emotions can
be catchy and we are sensitive to how

65
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,760
people are around us.

66
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:28,750
Their emotions affect us even if
we're not in path that somebody else's

67
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,291
emotions.

68
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:33,460
If they come into your work environment
and there a drama queen or there are

69
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:38,461
chronic talker or they're a victim
where they always want to talk about

70
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:42,010
themselves and their victim status,
it brings you down.

71
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,330
If you're an openhearted person, you know,
if you're open and you feel all this,

72
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,560
your energy goes down,

73
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,780
so it's important to understand emotional
contagion and also the concept of

74
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:57,781
dopamine or dopamine is the pleasure
hormone and it's thought that impasse need

75
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:01,090
a smaller amount of dopamine to feel good.

76
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,590
Then let's say extroverts who get their
dopamine fakes from going out, you know,

77
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:08,590
with big parties and big
events and football games,

78
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:12,520
and you get a large
dopamine hit with that,

79
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,200
but empaths get satisfied by very
little interaction. For instance,

80
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:22,030
as an Empath, I love one-to-one
interactions. I really enjoy them.

81
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,820
But when it gets to be a lot of people,
it gets overwhelming.

82
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,160
For me as I love to connect.

83
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,760
And in too many people on a
personal level is hard for me.

84
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:34,600
I speak to large groups and that's a
bit different. But on a personal level,

85
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,500
I prefer to have small
gatherings and it could be, um,

86
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,200
the dopamine explanation and
research because it just,

87
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,180
I require very little. I get
filled very easily, buy happiness,

88
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,590
and I get drained. If I stay in
a social situation for too long,

89
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:55,480
it's too much for me because
I get overstimulated and
too much is coming in too

90
00:05:55,481 --> 00:06:00,290
fast with sensory overload. So if you're
an empath or you're a sensitive person,

91
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,310
it's good to look at the science
behind it. I know. And it's,

92
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:09,080
it's not also the electromagnetic energy
from the heart and the brain gives off

93
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,060
information. And so we're transmitting
information and if you're sensitive,

94
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm like, you're an empath.
You can feel all this,

95
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:20,120
but the problem has empass don't
know how to manage all of this.

96
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:24,230
And I think if you break down the science
and you begin to look at the various

97
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:26,630
aspects of the science,
um,

98
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,460
it's very useful in terms of explaining
what you're feeling and why you're

99
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,294
feeling it.

100
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,920
Thank you Judith.
Um,

101
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,640
in relation to some of the things you
have talked about with the science behind

102
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:44,930
it and some of the terminologies that
you've used with regards to extroverts and

103
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:49,010
introverts, um, that is a
question sort of that when he,

104
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,640
and I haven't read the book had talked
a lot about because in the book,

105
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,640
and it feels as if you have,
you know,

106
00:06:55,641 --> 00:07:00,560
given your story as an introverted empath,
as some of you may know,

107
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:04,730
I'm extremely extroverted and I'm so,

108
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:06,920
I'm more of an extrovert,
empath.

109
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:11,921
And so could you talk to us a little
bit about these differences in terms of,

110
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,273
you know,
I,

111
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I do love going to parties and I do love
talking to people and being out there

112
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:22,790
and d and that fills me
up versus if I'm alone,

113
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:27,791
all the energies that I've picked out
tend to make me really feel just more

114
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:32,480
alone. I can't get out of the
loop. So can you speak on,

115
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,070
yeah. Um, they're both introverted
and pass an extroverted empath.

116
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,680
I happened to be introverted.
What, what are you,

117
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,400
I am definitely the introverted
type of empath. Yeah.

118
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,080
And Heather is extroverted and
most analysts are introverted,

119
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,030
but some are extroverted. And by
introverted, I mean I like to be alone.

120
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,080
You know, I, I'm a writer and I
liked it to be in my room alone.

121
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,160
I know with my own energy,
just allowing the creative flow to happen.

122
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,210
I enjoy that. That's like the epitome of
my life experience, you know, at that,

123
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,250
at that moment.
But extroverts,

124
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,150
they tend to go out more and I go out,

125
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:15,260
but I don't go out that much and that's
okay with me. I'd rather be in nature.

126
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,870
I'd rather be in quiet tranquil
environments, um, or one to one.

127
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,290
But you're an extroverted and passed,
so you go out into environments.

128
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:28,640
But my guess is you need to decompress
afterwards is that, you know,

129
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,480
at some point.
Yeah.

130
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,670
I think one of the things that I sleep
really deeply and I have a feeling that

131
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:38,550
part of the reason that I
sleep deeply is because I have,

132
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,230
I process it in my sleep versus
out in the about in the world.

133
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,440
And I mean I just felt that,
um,

134
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,100
some of the things in the
book talked about, um,

135
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,380
some things to help an extrovert empath,

136
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:57,381
if any of you can relate to that is
to meetings with other people who also

137
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,410
experience it because then
you're amongst other people.

138
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,770
Cause that was my big thing is I,
I just,

139
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,140
I can't function to take it all in
and be by myself taking it all in.

140
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,750
Okay.

141
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,860
Well it just varies.

142
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:17,861
I mean you might identify with various
levels of this and so it just depends how

143
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,370
you process things.

144
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,850
And I just want everyone to know
if you identify with any of this,

145
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:26,210
you're not neurotic, you're not
crazy. There's nothing wrong with you.

146
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,530
It's a sensitivity level that I
believe is important to develop.

147
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,990
And certainly in massage therapy,
you know,

148
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:35,390
you're feeling what's
going on in other people.

149
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,430
And so the sensitivity is there. And we
need more empathy in our world today.

150
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:40,911
You know,

151
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:45,911
desperately I be in places like
Google to have empathy for each other,

152
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,641
you know,

153
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:50,490
and to make your work environment really
positive and caring I think is, uh,

154
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,020
a wonderful thing.
And to have empathy for you know,

155
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:58,910
the world and to bring that in. And it
was something I'm really passionate about.

156
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,131
Thanks Judith.

157
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:07,131
I feel very privileged to be in this
company because there is such a spirit of

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,250
inclusion and respect for diversity.

159
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,800
And I also know that I have, you know, my,

160
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,020
my own characteristics,
um,

161
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,950
where I get frustrated or feel victimized
by things that happened to me and my

162
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:31,120
day. And so when I was
reading I thought, yeah,

163
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,363
yeah,

164
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,270
I wonder sometimes if I'm
also an energy vampire,

165
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,720
like do I flip between these two things?
What if I'm the source of,

166
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,720
of drain for somebody else?
And how do I reconcile that with,

167
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,790
with also being an empath?
Because once I get through my mood,

168
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,540
um, I'm kind of back to
my, to myself, but I'm,

169
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,570
one of my goals for
this year is meditation.

170
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:58,690
Okay.

171
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,690
And I've, I've done a good job
and I feel like it's helping me,

172
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:06,360
but I really don't want to be
that to other people. So how,

173
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,690
how do I work on that?

174
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:12,691
And how does an empath reconcile also
sometimes being the energy vampire?

175
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,550
Great question. It's a very
humble question actually,
if we can all ask that. Um,

176
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,140
there's a chapter on the book on combating
narcissists and other energy vampires.

177
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,120
And it's important if you're sensitive
to identify who are the drainers,

178
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,800
especially in the work environment,

179
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,420
you can have a lot of different
kinds of drainers. No,

180
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,950
from the drama queen to the chronic
talker, to the narcissist, um,

181
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,890
to the passive aggressive person.

182
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,330
So there are many kinds of
energy vampires and yes,

183
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:46,960
we can all be drainers.
We can all be energy vampires.

184
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:51,420
So not to think about is that Oh, them
or him or her. But when we, you know,

185
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,050
get in to are kind of lower
selves and we get, um, no,

186
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:59,290
our buttons are pushed and we're triggered
and we're tired and we're not in our

187
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,830
best selves, then you know,
we can be victims, you know,

188
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:06,340
or we can be talkers or we can be,
you know,

189
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:10,390
just people who will bring others
down and so it, that's okay.

190
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,140
I mean that's part of being human and
it's great to recognize it in yourself.

191
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:17,650
I mean, that's so great that you
asked that question and you know,

192
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,620
it's wonderful also because
you can catch yourself in a,

193
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:24,550
with the awareness when you start getting
into those energy vampires states,

194
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,150
you can say, okay, you know,
or if your coworker, you know,

195
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:32,290
I hope has the freedom to point it out.
You know, it's a little touchy subject,

196
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,470
but to say, you know, I love
you or I, I respect you so much,

197
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:38,710
I love working with you,
but you're complaining a lot today.

198
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,390
I don't know if you have the freedom

199
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,403
to you.

200
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,590
Yeah,

201
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,610
well Googlers tend to be extremely kind.

202
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,780
Yeah.

203
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,440
There. I'm sure there are conversations
like that, that are done, you know, very,

204
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,780
I don't know what the watch
fully tactfully. Thank you.

205
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,250
I'd say I think that's true. People
here are very kind and have a lot of um,

206
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,610
exhibit a lot of tolerance and attacked
and we always need to work on feeling

207
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:18,050
like we can, uh, bring up a
challenging situation and,

208
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,280
and discuss it in a nonthreatening
way with people. So yeah,

209
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,680
I hope that that's the case and it
because somebody who is rolling with there

210
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,530
being an energy vampire, it can really
bring down the work environment.

211
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,570
So it's really a toxic influence.
Um,

212
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,940
and so I feel that that
needs to be addressed as you
say it compassionately and

213
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:40,300
lovingly.
Um,

214
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,430
because sometimes we don't know when we
get into those states and it could just

215
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:47,940
go on and on and on. And you don't
want that in a work environment.

216
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:51,510
You optionally want positive
energy in your work environment.

217
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:55,710
You want it to be easy and fun so your
mind can just go to creative places,

218
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,150
you know, and really envision, you
know, the amazing things for yourself.

219
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,710
And an energy vampire is important to
identify because they could bring it down.

220
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,690
And so to address it, not punitively
but lovingly, you know, I hope I don't,

221
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,860
I hope that there's a way to do that
here and to recognize, you know,

222
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:17,280
not to get angry at the person,
but that they need understanding

223
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,960
nine,
10 tells money they're an energy vampire.

224
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,463
So,
um,

225
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,550
and moving on with the questions.
Um,

226
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,100
we wanted to ask sort of
related to that a person who,

227
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,270
um,

228
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,270
may be not just in a phase in
that moment as an energy vampire,

229
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:43,120
but that's their personality.
They're like full on,

230
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:46,850
complete like a narcissist
or something lacking. Um,

231
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,880
neural plasticity teaches that our brains
neuro circuitry is malleable and the

232
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:56,210
studies have shown that mindfulness
meditation that includes loving kindness

233
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,520
that you talked about
can rewire the brain.

234
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,970
So is it possible that somebody who
could possibly have a full blown on low

235
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:11,210
empath, narcissist trait
personality change with that?

236
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,170
Um, it's very hard for
narcissists to change. However,

237
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:20,190
I just want to say narcissist can be
really creative and productive and have

238
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:23,250
great ideas and be very intuitive.
So they're,

239
00:15:23,251 --> 00:15:26,460
they're not all negative
in the work environment.

240
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,870
It's just the problem comes in personally
or you interact with that because they

241
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:34,710
just think of themselves and they don't
really care about what you're feeling

242
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:35,880
because they lack empathy.

243
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,080
The full blown narcissist now who are
self absorbed and they become cold

244
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:43,470
withholding and punishing when
you don't do things their way.

245
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:46,980
So it doesn't make for a
great management style.

246
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,170
It really doesn't. And so, you know,
hopefully they're not too many here,

247
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,800
you know, in terms of narcissist,
because it doesn't foster creativity.

248
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:56,850
It shuts people off.

249
00:15:56,851 --> 00:16:01,750
It makes people feel small and damaged
and not heard and not listen to. And,

250
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,550
and it's so important. If you're
sensitive and you're an empath, you know,

251
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:06,990
you care,
you know,

252
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:10,200
you really care about others and
you don't want to be shut off.

253
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,810
But if you do have narcissist here,
you know,

254
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:17,730
just take advantage of all their
strengths as nobody's all bad. You know,

255
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:21,090
the, there's a Buddha and
a demon inside everybody.

256
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,680
It just depends on what we feed. We want
to feed the best parts of ourselves.

257
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,760
I know the most sensitive, the most
loving, the most compassionate, you know,

258
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:32,370
and then understand that
we can be energy vampires.

259
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:35,970
Sometimes we can be a get
go through a bad period. Uh,

260
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:37,230
so I think with a narcissist,

261
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:40,650
if you look at what they can give to a
work environment and not expect them to

262
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:43,830
be your best friend,
it's a lot of patients who come to me,

263
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:48,240
I have narcissistic bosses and that's
really hard because you really have to

264
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:52,980
frame things in terms of how it will
serve them for them to be on your side.

265
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,020
And it's tedious, Ego stroking
and as hard for sensitive people.

266
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,970
But if you want to have a vacation,
let's say you don't say, I'm so tired,

267
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:06,030
I really need a break now
they won't give it to you.

268
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:10,620
But if you say this will
serve the business, um, then
a narcissist was like, oh,

269
00:17:10,621 --> 00:17:15,150
okay, how, and so then it would make
more sense to give you a vacation then.

270
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,530
So ideally you don't have to do that,
but in case you're ever faced with it,

271
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,380
now that's one tactic that will work.

272
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,300
I think that leads really nicely
into the next part of our questions,

273
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:35,301
which really involve how do we work
with these tendencies in a workplace?

274
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,360
What are some solutions when we're
faced with small personal space,

275
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,090
a lots going on,
lots of distractions and,

276
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:49,980
and

277
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,220
then we want to,
uh,

278
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,120
be able to be as creative as possible
and work at our highest level.

279
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,310
So what can we do as,

280
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,410
as empaths to foster that?
Alright. Right. Well,

281
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,620
one thing I noticed here, Google
is the high ceilings. I mean,

282
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:12,621
that helps to have a feeling of
space and it's very beautiful to me.

283
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,840
I feel like I could breathe here. I
don't feel claustrophobic. I don't,

284
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:19,440
everywhere I look, it's high ceilings.
So I'm not, do you have low ceilings,

285
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,190
other places here? Not so many. No. Yeah.

286
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:26,850
So that helps with the
feeling of spaciousness. Um,

287
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,020
but in terms of techniques to use,
um,

288
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,450
I really suggest meditation.
There's a four,

289
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:37,800
a three minute meditation where you can
just check in with yourself for three

290
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:41,820
minutes, close your eyes,
focus on your heart,

291
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:46,821
focused on something really positive
in your life and breathe out stress and

292
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:49,680
focus on the positive.

293
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:54,750
And during those three minutes you can
recalibrate yourself and you could come

294
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:59,190
back to your center B as part of the skill
of being an empath and an environment

295
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:00,600
is learning how to come back.

296
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:04,620
When you start to swirl or when somebody
pushes your button and you're triggered

297
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,690
or you're disappointed by something,

298
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:10,500
or if something happens in your personal
life and suddenly you go down, you know,

299
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:15,501
to recenter yourself through med at this
three minute quick meditation is a a

300
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,280
form of coming back to you that a lot
of people don't know how to do that.

301
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,770
You know, once you swirl,
they just start swirling.

302
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:28,190
And so learning how to breathe the breath
is very powerful because the breath,

303
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:33,531
you can breathe out stress and you
can breathe in clarity or calm,

304
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,080
peacefulness.
But to breathe out stress.

305
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:42,000
The breath actually carries the
stress out of you, out of your body,

306
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:45,780
which is what you want.
So these regular meditation breaks,

307
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,880
I really suggest,
you know,

308
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:51,750
to help you feel better and to help
you reconnect with your creativity.

309
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:55,140
I keep coming back to that
with this audience. Um,

310
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:59,890
that creativity is so important for you
to be able to really play up here and,

311
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,290
and to play and to feel comfortable.
You have to be in a good environment.

312
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:09,120
And you mentioned that you have a close
environment and some places that there

313
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:13,590
are a lot of people in a, in a small
space, lots of people in a small space.

314
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,530
Um,
how much room do you have between you?

315
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,030
I'm not the best person to
speak to that because I used to,

316
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,180
I work in a spacious place. That mushroom.
Okay. All right. That's not much room.

317
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,740
All right. And so you need to
create your own personal space.

318
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:32,220
At least you have that much of them.
It is an open space environment. Okay.

319
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,550
All right. That's particularly
challenging for sensitive people.

320
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,010
And so you have to make your desk,

321
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,030
your spiritual station and
know your energy station.

322
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:46,860
However you can be comfortable
there with pictures of people. Um,

323
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,980
I wear the Kleinian around my neck,
who's the goddess of compassion.

324
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,910
If she really sets a tone of compassion.
Um,

325
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,940
sometimes gemstones are important to
put around the desk or whatever is it

326
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:04,210
centers you. It could be anything. It
doesn't have to be spiritual objects.

327
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:09,211
It could be anything that you love to
create a circle of safety around your desk

328
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,190
and like a bubble of invisibility, you
know, if you feel like being invisible.

329
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,890
And visualization is
very important for that.

330
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:22,720
If you have an open space environment
to visualize a protective bubble around

331
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:23,560
your environment.

332
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:27,400
And although you see other people and
you hear them talking and they're moving,

333
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,170
you're in your safe place.

334
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,550
And so what you're doing is somebody
in your own inner power to create a

335
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:37,690
visualization for yourself.
You're not helpless in this environment.

336
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,810
And when you begin to experience that,

337
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,680
you'll feel incredible relief. So then
you can focus. You know, it's, um,

338
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,100
when I learned to meditate,

339
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,090
I learned how to do it in a room
where next store they were having,

340
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:55,900
it was a Sunday and they were having
meetings, prayer meetings with songs.

341
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,700
And so when I was learning
how to meditate, I had a lot
of external distractions,

342
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:05,530
which was really helpful for me because
I wa I learned how not to be thrown off.

343
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:10,090
And that's part of this path of empowering
sensitivity is how do you learn to

344
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:14,080
center yourself, admits
distraction and chaos. You see?

345
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:18,520
And so you can look at it as a fun
challenge. And I don't know if, um,

346
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,470
can you hear other people talking next
to you? You can hear them. All right.

347
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,510
Are you allowed to wear earbuds here?
Okay, well sometimes that's helpful. The,

348
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,250
and playing nice music so you can
use, you know, these techniques,

349
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:38,251
but most important energetically you
want to just focus on your own energy,

350
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:41,680
your own space,
your own creativity and not on the,

351
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,870
somebody cracking their gum next to you

352
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,750
as empaths are very sensitive to
that, like coughing, cracking of gum,

353
00:22:49,751 --> 00:22:53,710
clearing of the throat. Um, you
know, all that like, you know, just,

354
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,280
it's important to,

355
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,340
to focus on yourself so that you can
screen out external distractions and you

356
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:02,500
could be in your best place.

357
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,120
So on that note,

358
00:23:05,121 --> 00:23:09,530
talking about the things that
we can do in our workplace. Um,

359
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,560
like one thing that I have told kinds
that I know that they find their peace on

360
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,150
weekends out in nature.
I've told them go, you know,

361
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,670
get a picture of that and put it in your
work space so that when you're feeling

362
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:27,671
that overwhelmingness and your mind's
just racing and everything's distracting,

363
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:32,770
you look at that picture to
sort of calm that down. Um,

364
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,530
and on that note, talking about
the different types of impacts,

365
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,080
you do speak of that in your book,

366
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:42,950
would you like to sort of go
over a few of those for people?

367
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,010
Because once you sort of
recognize this is what I took

368
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,580
away from the book,
what type of empath that you are,

369
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,500
there's going to be different tools,

370
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:55,550
obviously that will work for you better
than for a different type of empath.

371
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,081
Yeah,

372
00:23:57,081 --> 00:24:00,980
there are different types of impasse
and some impasse or emotional and paths

373
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:05,210
where you're especially sensitive to
other people's emotions. For instance,

374
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:09,650
if somebody is angry and they come
into work angry, you take it on. No.

375
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,090
Or if somebody is depressed,

376
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:14,570
you can be sitting next to somebody and
suddenly your energy is going down and

377
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:19,160
you're starting to feel a little
depressed and you pick up their emotions.

378
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,170
And so empath are sensitive to emotions
and some are even sensitive to physical

379
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,180
issues where you can pick up,

380
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:30,710
let's say your coworker has back pain
and suddenly you're back begins to egg.

381
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,330
So it's just something to
watch out for in yourself. Um,

382
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,480
and then there's impact
called intuitive empath.

383
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,510
And these impacts are very
open to their intuition.

384
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,850
Now really tuned into intuition.

385
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,880
I personally feel as a psychiatrist and
an empath that is so vital to listen to

386
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:53,420
that inner voice and impasse have a,
you know,

387
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,280
a little bit more open than other people,

388
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:58,130
but everybody can connect
to their intuition.

389
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,380
And that's the still small inner voice
that comes through gut feelings or the

390
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:08,381
enteric nervous system in the gut has
actual neurotransmitters that convey

391
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:10,760
information like the brain.

392
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,050
So what's going on in your
gut can convey information.

393
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,420
And so as an intuitive empath,

394
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,380
you can train yourself to listen to
your gut feelings about somebody.

395
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,420
Let's say you're hiring somebody and
they, oh, they look totally good on paper,

396
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,780
they look amazing,
but when you're sitting across from them,

397
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,440
your energy is going down. Now what
is that telling you? You know it.

398
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:39,441
It could be that this isn't a good match
for your particular environment as you

399
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:44,540
want to have people who are energetically
harmonious and when you hire people

400
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:48,050
and when you interview people,
when you're an intuitive empath,

401
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:52,610
you can develop intuitive skills in
terms of you look at what they present on

402
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:53,091
paper,

403
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:58,091
but you also can feel what's going on
in them is these are you listen to your

404
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:00,380
gut feeling,
you listen to a hunch.

405
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,890
You listened to an Aha knowing that it
can be waves of goosebumps that say,

406
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:08,780
yes, this person is
right. This is exciting.

407
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:13,760
This is going to be a great match or you
can, you know, feel a kind of a downward,

408
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,170
the mud, you know, or a wall
or something that's unpleasant.

409
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:22,700
But when you train yourself as an empath
and as a human being to listen to your

410
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:25,970
intuition,
it can give you extra information.

411
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,460
And so that's really essential.

412
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,940
But what happens is sometimes people
don't listen to their intuition and they

413
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:36,530
second guess themselves. You know,
particularly in a very linear environment,

414
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,970
you know, where you're given information
but something doesn't feel right. Um,

415
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,380
I really encourage you to weigh that.

416
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,810
No in your relationship choices and
in how you do with your coworkers.

417
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:52,650
Because it will tell you, maybe I should
stay away from this coworker today.

418
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,510
Maybe they need a bit more space and
it's a gift to give them that, you know,

419
00:26:57,511 --> 00:26:59,820
and to honor that they seem
to be in their own world.

420
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:02,490
They seem to want to go into
a cave. All right, fine.

421
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:06,030
I'll give that to them and I won't talk
to them that much if possible. You see,

422
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:11,031
so you can really have deep compassion
for your coworkers and for others by

423
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,340
developing this skill of intuition that
many empath having some of the specific

424
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,290
types,
some impasse or animal empath.

425
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,870
I see there's a doggy on
here that's a great, um,

426
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,710
that you're allowed to bring dogs here.
Oh, that's amazing. Being dawn concert,

427
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,170
you are
and,

428
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,030
and pass have a communing with
animals, with dogs, with cats,

429
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:39,030
with wild animals, you
know, with birds that they,

430
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:42,950
some feel a very deep
connection to animals. Um,

431
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,770
and some have a deep connection
to the natural world and plants,

432
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:51,540
they love to have plans. They
love to garden. Um, and some
have of you, as you said,

433
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:53,250
a connection to their dream life.

434
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,720
And there were some impasse or dreamers
and they could tune in to their dreams

435
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:01,110
to get guidance in the morning
by remembering your dreams.

436
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,230
So these are all intuitive outlets that
you can really explore and play with,

437
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,590
you know, as a sensitive
person as opposed to being a,

438
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,600
a disembodied head who's just a linear
person who lives up from here up.

439
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,130
Um,

440
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:22,130
I'm really advocating being your
mind and reasoning and in the body.

441
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,910
I'm listening to your intuition and
your sensitivities as you can be both.

442
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,350
And sometimes, um, there's a
bias against men doing this.

443
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:36,770
And I have a Facebook empath group and
it's over 11,000 people and it maybe 85%

444
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:43,200
men, I mean women and 15% men. So no,

445
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:46,190
it's harder sometimes for men.
I don't know how it is.

446
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:50,130
So there are a lot of men in this
audience, which is fantastic. Um,

447
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,540
if it's harder to come out and salmon,
intuitive feeling person.

448
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,600
And I'm also really intelligent and
smart and creative and grounded.

449
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,170
So to balance everything for both
men and women who are empath.

450
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,090
So there was one other empath that I
wanted to ask you about and I'm also kind

451
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:16,410
of looking at time and want to make sure
that we leave some time for people who

452
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:20,880
have questions out there.
So you had spoken about being in nature,

453
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:22,070
actually I think it was you,
Heather,

454
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,080
but it came up again when Judith was
speaking and you speak about earthing or,

455
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,610
or write about earthing in your book.

456
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,300
And I often will tell my clients
after their session, you know,

457
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:35,130
you may want to take a few minutes,

458
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:39,510
we're close to the beach or find a
patch of grass and take your shoes off.

459
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,160
Stick your feet in it.
Can you speak to how

460
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,420
that helps us?

461
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,060
That's so helps us in so many ways now
to get out in nature and take your shoes

462
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:51,760
off and go barefoot in the grass.

463
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:56,560
I go barefoot on the ocean and just feel
yourself what that feels like and just

464
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,890
the freedom and an often reminds
you of how you were as a child,

465
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,070
if you had the opportunity
to be in nature as a child.

466
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,370
And to reclaim that and to just
go play and feel what's coming up.

467
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:11,200
The electronics change with the earth.

468
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,800
I mean I have very strong feelings
about the earth and preserving our

469
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:19,801
environments and how we connect to
our environment and how our bodies are

470
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:22,390
intimately connected to the earth.

471
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:25,000
So of course we're going to
feel if the earth is harmed.

472
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,980
And so the mission of helping the earth,

473
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,890
these to be number one above all
things as far as I'm concerned. And um,

474
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,411
you know,

475
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:36,280
it's difficult for impasse in this day
in time with the support of the earth not

476
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:40,810
really being there and our
social environments, it's
just devastating. You know,

477
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:45,570
for me, when I hear about certain
ravages of the earth, however, you know,

478
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,500
you can go out and connect.

479
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,200
You'll see people aren't
trained to connect to the earth.

480
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:53,560
And if you stay in an office for too
long or it's not actually an office is an

481
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:57,040
open air environment.
But if you stay closed up too long,

482
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,930
if you stay at your computer too long,

483
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,020
you can get kind of sealed off from
the world and you want to connect.

484
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,480
You want to take a break from the
computer and your work and go out.

485
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:08,620
You're so close to the beach.

486
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,810
You could take a walk and go down to the
ocean and see all the c goals and you

487
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:16,750
know, get into your child again.
You know, I know you, you know,

488
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:20,860
you're adults and you work at
Google and you have very, you know,

489
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,750
important jobs and you're,
you know,

490
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:25,060
you really are playing a
role in bettering the world.

491
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:29,410
But it's good to also let that
down, you know, and go and play.

492
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,560
You know, if you can't, it's
go and connect to the earth.

493
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:35,020
And you could lie on the earth.
You could climb a tree,

494
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,840
you could meditate by a tree. No, but,
but to have that playfulness, you know,

495
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,860
not impasse tend to get overly
serious and life is chart.

496
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,690
So you want to have as much playfulness
as you possibly can to remind yourself

497
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:51,910
of that because you deserve it.
You know,

498
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:56,530
I kind of live with the philosophy of
this is the day I'm given the eternal now

499
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,020
and I don't know about
tomorrow necessarily.

500
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:03,040
I know about today and I want
to make it the best possible.

501
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,360
And that isn't just work,
work,

502
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:07,970
work all the time though I've
always been a workaholic and a,

503
00:32:07,971 --> 00:32:11,770
I've always loved to work. When I
was a little girl, my report card,

504
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,860
the teacher said, you know, I need
to take the pressure off myself.

505
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,990
Like I'm seven years old.
My parents didn't give me that.

506
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,420
I was born that way. And so, you know,

507
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:26,140
it's important for me to find the
balance because I could get lost in my,

508
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:30,660
in writing and patients and
what's, you know, face, you know,

509
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,230
in the Internet, you know, going on
Google and googling things all the time.

510
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,190
And so it's important. Dance,
dance is a good way to,

511
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,050
to sort of get your body moving
so you're in your body. Yeah,

512
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,260
yeah. But just moving and, you know,

513
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:52,940
being in the body as an
important way to balance and, um,

514
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,140
but I just want to acknowledge
the, this environment, you know,

515
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:02,030
how creative it is and you know,
what an opportunity you have here,

516
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,190
you know, as employees of
Google, um, to really, you know,

517
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:11,780
create and change the world. It feels
like and changing the world is here.

518
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,400
It just feels so important to be here.

519
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,270
So you brought up children and I know
there's a section in your book about that.

520
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,781
And I,

521
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:27,770
I guess part of changing the world is
also making sure that we influence our

522
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:32,771
children to be good human beings as
they impact the world themselves.

523
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:39,100
So it's so important to support the
sensitivities and our children as they're

524
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:45,560
going to save the world. And now they
need to be raised in a way where,

525
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,470
you know, you look at them
and you say you're sensitive,

526
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:52,430
you're open and that's beautiful and
there's nothing to be ashamed of.

527
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:56,480
And just because you may not want to be
on the football team and you may want to

528
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:59,120
go into the forest and meditate,
you know,

529
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:02,120
that makes you unique and beautiful will,

530
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:04,490
you don't have to fit these children,

531
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:08,690
these sensitive children
or indigo children is new
children that have a certain

532
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:10,520
consciousness coming into the world.

533
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,880
You don't want to fit them
into some arbitrary mold.

534
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,100
You want to really help them and support
them. And a lot of times as children,

535
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:23,930
you might not have been supported, you
know, in your sensitivities or intuition.

536
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,730
And that hurts because I know as an empath
child and I had to physician parents

537
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,100
and 25 physicians in my family,

538
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,280
so I came from this long lineage of
scientific thinkers and I was a feeler.

539
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,980
I would feel things, I would
know things. I would, you know,

540
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:43,800
process it differently than a
traditionally scientific personal.

541
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:46,930
Although I did go through medical
school and I conquered, you know,

542
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,440
that to balance both the intuitive
and the, you know, the scientific.

543
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:53,630
But it wasn't how I was born.

544
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,890
And so I've had to reclaim that
as a psychiatrist and as an adult.

545
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,230
And that's what I'm
inviting you all to do,

546
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,580
is to be as linear as you want
to be as inventive in your minds,

547
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:06,200
but also,
you know,

548
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,060
reclaim your sensitivity and your
openness and your playfulness and your

549
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:13,700
connection to the earth.
We can be everything.

550
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,040
Okay.

551
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,310
I love that. Yeah. Shall we surround the,

552
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,920
so we have about 10 minutes or so.
If people have questions,

553
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,090
just go ahead and raise your hand
and we'll be glad to throw you.

554
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,770
Are you good at catching?
I'm not usually,

555
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,980
I mean even that's so creative.

556
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,920
She's through the mic and
a little box over to him.

557
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,980
Um, hi. Uh, I had a question.

558
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,990
I noticed in your bio it mentioned energy
awareness. Um, and through my process,

559
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,650
understanding the human energy system
and how to work with it has been really

560
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,170
valuable for me.
I did it through medical Chigong.

561
00:35:56,171 --> 00:36:00,610
I'm just curious what kind of energy
awareness a little bit. All right.

562
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:03,040
And just curious what kind of energy
awareness techniques he used in your

563
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:03,874
practice.

564
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,370
Can you repeat that for me?

565
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,740
And so he wanted to know what kind of
energy awareness techniques that Judith

566
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:16,480
uses in her practice in. He
found it through, um, I'm sorry.

567
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,850
Was it and she gone,
she gone.

568
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,661
She Gong.

569
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:25,890
It's a wonderful way to center your
energy as a movement where you center your

570
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:29,850
energy and you feel the
universal energies in your body.

571
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:32,720
And that's a beautiful energy technique.
Any,

572
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,250
I mean you could even do a cheek on here,
you know,

573
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:39,960
to go out somewhere in practice, you
know, here and just do a few movements.

574
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,170
What I use in my practice is that I teach
people to meditate and I also work on

575
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:51,681
them energetically or I put my hands
over their various shockers to balance it

576
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,590
and teach them to open up their hearts.

577
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,280
Shameless plug. We offer, um, ty gene,

578
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:03,570
which has Chigong elements in it weekly.
So

579
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,780
yeah, so I, I'm brought in instructor,

580
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,050
we weekly for a,
and you can join us at the,

581
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:18,051
I'm lax techy group and emails and I in
some Mondays from four 30 to five 30 and

582
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:24,750
there is a cost because I brought in the
instructor but we meet over in the bin

583
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:29,700
five courtyard or inside the bunker
when it's called. That's fantastic.

584
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,060
Lot of people who are not
empathetic. Right? Uh,

585
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,390
they might be kind,
they might be changing the world and not,

586
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:44,391
might not be necessarily now
cystic is there some tool,

587
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,390
some kind of Myers Briggs personality
test kind of thing so that they recognize

588
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,080
that they are not empathic? Yeah, no.

589
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,880
And if there is one and then we know
what do we do with it once we have one,

590
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,220
three,
now the person is not the empathic.

591
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,370
What are the actions
apart from meditation,

592
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,300
can a person take to sort of develop that?

593
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,630
That's a great question. Um, once you,

594
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,260
how do you identify if somebody doesn't
have empathy and then how do you deal

595
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:17,270
with it? Okay. Um,

596
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,690
the best way is to provoke
a small conflict because
if you provoke a conflict,

597
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:26,300
you can see how they deal
with it as if they have.

598
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,240
Why are you laughing? Conflict, conflict.

599
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:38,560
Oh, it'd be really fast for that
little conflict. Let's say they say,

600
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,310
let's meet today at 10. And you
say, well, I can't do it at 10,

601
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:46,230
but we'll do it at 11. I mean, even just
a little, little thing like that. Um,

602
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,150
somebody who doesn't have empathy is
going to become cold, withholding,

603
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,990
judgmental,
punishing and change.

604
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:55,630
They're very nice personality
and to a different one.

605
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,040
And so narcissists who don't have empathy,
um,

606
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,530
don't like it when you
don't do things their way.

607
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,600
All right. Have you met
people like that? No,

608
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:09,800
I just meant to say that an mean maybe
there's another classification out there

609
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:13,480
which is basically kind people,
not necessarily people,

610
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,500
but they are not empathic.

611
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:20,180
They have don't have the mirror mirror
neurons as to say they do not understand

612
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:24,780
what are you going through. So
did you cannot relate to you. Uh,

613
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,970
in general they sympathetic
but not empathic. All right.

614
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,340
They're very kind people that
love data but they are not,

615
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,750
they cannot understand what you're going
through your emotions and will state

616
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,490
this that you come in and you, you look
very sad and you don't want to work.

617
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:42,260
But let's say as a
manager or somebody else,

618
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,430
but he doesn't recognize that I knew was
thinking why does he not recognize that?

619
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,380
So they are lack empathy.

620
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:52,490
Just it don't know but they're
trampling over somebody.

621
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,850
Yes. Let me make the
distinction of lacking empathy
versus someone just being in

622
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:57,684
their heads.

623
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,590
Because sometimes people are self
absorbed or in their heads and they're not

624
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:04,100
tuning in.
Emotionally happens.

625
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,920
But that doesn't necessarily make them
a narcissist and they could be the

626
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:12,270
kindest person, but they can also be
out of touch with their feelings. Yes,

627
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,330
exactly. That, that they could be.

628
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:19,370
When I see a lot of people in general
are very kind to bed on Tinder word,

629
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,640
but when it comes to personal
relationship, because they
are very smart and then,

630
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:28,520
and brains, right, they did. They don't
tune in today. Empathic centers are,

631
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:32,270
they not have the Blob tempurpedic center.
So they just relate to to your brain.

632
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,810
Yes, yes. But they're kind people.

633
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,180
They find people didn't want to
harm anybody. They don't want to,

634
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,500
but they do not understand the actions.
In fact,

635
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,180
other human beings.

636
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,950
Okay. Do you, do you find that that's
common? That's common really. Okay.

637
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:50,640
Well that's, yeah. Not narcissist
necessarily rate. Right. Well,

638
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:55,130
I mean that leaves an opening on emotional
training and intuitive training for

639
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:56,870
people here.
You know,

640
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,830
it's something that's really important
to train in a safe environment.

641
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,850
And if that's the case, a lot of
times it's something that think about,

642
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,400
but in terms of your expectations of them,

643
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:11,080
you could come in with a broken heart
and they probably won't see it. Yeah.

644
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,690
And to not take that personally.

645
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,880
Yeah. Yeah. I understand about it,
but take it a is a, is a way I was,

646
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,450
I was thinking more in terms of uh,
in Myers Briggs test,

647
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:27,451
you go take an online test and it tells
you what letters you are ENTP I STP,

648
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:32,050
whichever it might be the
case. So is there an online
test? I can go and say, hey,

649
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:33,920
you're not empathic.
You is

650
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,760
out one,
230 or 20.

651
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,250
So that we know and we
can say to each other, oh,

652
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:44,810
we had pointy hundred so we know
each other in some objective way.

653
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,210
I know an objective way.
All right.

654
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:50,310
And that would be in well and you
would want to pass that around and have

655
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:51,120
everyone take it.

656
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,970
Yeah, that will be, that will
be the Google way of doing it.

657
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,541
All right.
Well,

658
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:59,720
I mean there's certainly a self assessment
test at the beginning of this book

659
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:04,130
with 20 questions that people can take
and determine where they are on the

660
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:07,610
empathy scale. Um, but you
know, there could be other,

661
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:11,490
other ways to do it too in terms
of creating more formal um,

662
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,910
tests and scores. But that's,
that's a good idea. Um,

663
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:20,330
but I think the goal would be really to
help people recognize that that's right.

664
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,760
Yeah.
Cause the more empathy you have,

665
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,180
the better your work environment is
going to be because you're going to feel

666
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:30,170
safe. You don't want to lose it. You
don't want to overdo it. You know,

667
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:32,480
cause sometimes impasse can be,
you know,

668
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,240
help too much and they give too much.

669
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,210
They want to be too compassionate and
they're looking at you in the eyes too

670
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:42,020
deeply so it feels intrusive. You
know, that, that kind of thing.

671
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:45,890
You don't want to become that, but
you want to become smart, intuitive,

672
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,900
caring and blend it all.

673
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:51,590
And that takes some training sometimes
to do it and hopefully the book will do

674
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,090
it.
But trainings can help

675
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,670
but proposed you who recognize it.

676
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:58,060
At least you can narrow that this
person's at least like that. It's okay.

677
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,240
Absolutely.

678
00:43:00,241 --> 00:43:04,170
But you know also to recognize that being
a good person is the best thing anyone

679
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:08,850
could do. And even though, you know,
they might lack other, you know,

680
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:12,960
abilities. If you're a good person,
that's a beautiful, beautiful thing.

681
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,210
You know, it really is. So to recognize
that in each other and you know,

682
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:22,080
to affirm that, you know, Nama stay,
I respect the spirit within you.

683
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,310
I know to be able to say
that to each other even, you
know, with all your faults,

684
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,400
you know, we have tons of faults,
all of us, we're not perfect.

685
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,350
But if we do the best we can
and we're loving people, no,

686
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,700
give people credit where credit is due.
And when you can affirm that and others,

687
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:42,840
the whole environment in
the work environment can
just increase the vibration,

688
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:45,090
increased the frequency when you do that,

689
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:47,700
as opposed to looking at all
the negatives and someone,

690
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,310
it's much easier to look at the negatives,
you know,

691
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,320
and criticize them and
what they're doing wrong.

692
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,240
But the shift in consciousness in terms
of awareness of empathy is trying to see

693
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:59,940
the best in people you know,
not their worst.

694
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:01,710
You want to bring out the best in people.

695
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,770
When we talk about empathy,

696
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,980
normally we're talking about
social with other people.

697
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:11,520
So I thought kind of separate
question a little different.

698
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,430
Here we are.
I'm an engineer.

699
00:44:14,431 --> 00:44:19,020
I think a lots of other engineers
and even Judith yourself,

700
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:23,460
you are Saudi.
You like to work like writing by yourself.

701
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,140
Sometimes I feel the stress
actually from the work,

702
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:31,580
not with interacting with other people.
Uh,

703
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,450
when you have something
difficult, something you
don't understand for a while,

704
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,790
especially later of the
day you of tired Rio,

705
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,110
a cognitive capability can,
tends to be done.

706
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,250
And my personal experience sometimes
in that situation I started,

707
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:55,251
you'd have self doubt and it's
kind of become a downward spiral.

708
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:01,190
And that's an active energy can I can
bring with me home even though I'm already

709
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:08,160
out of work, I still think
about it. But maybe after night,

710
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,850
the Max day I look at it again,
I can't figure it out.

711
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,460
It seems so simple.

712
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,960
So what can you suggest to do to prevent,
you know,

713
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:23,961
just to bring that negative frustration
out of work when you want to not think

714
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:28,530
about it at that time.

715
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,610
Very good question. How do you not
take the work energy home basically?

716
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,140
And you mentioned self doubt. Yes.
Did you mentioned self doubt? Yep.

717
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,280
Because you know, I can figure this
out. Maybe I was not good enough.

718
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,381
All right,

719
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:49,381
well I'm a big believer in affirmations
and so it's important to really affirm

720
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:52,310
every day what you did well.
No.

721
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,270
And at the end of the day you could
make that a ritual to just say,

722
00:45:55,271 --> 00:45:57,640
what did I do well today?
What did I contribute?

723
00:45:57,641 --> 00:46:00,970
And it could be the tiniest thing. It
could be a big thing. It doesn't matter.

724
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,150
But instead of you know,
the self doubt, no one,

725
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:07,160
I talk about the demon
and the Buddha inside. Um,

726
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,330
the self doubt comes from more
the demons side. You know,

727
00:46:10,331 --> 00:46:15,250
where you have to work with it. Everybody
has self doubt. We all have self doubt.

728
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,880
When you affirm I did this well today,

729
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,750
I did that well today and I brought,
I was breathing today.

730
00:46:22,751 --> 00:46:26,890
I was walking into today, I came to work,
I had a day of life, you know, really,

731
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,640
I mean, you can just get, always get back
to that, you know, to uh, to affirm that.

732
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:35,560
And also to have a closure meditation
when you are ready to leave work to

733
00:46:35,561 --> 00:46:39,610
actually sit, close your
eyes, breathe center yourself,

734
00:46:39,611 --> 00:46:43,570
say thank you for this opportunity
of work today and now I'm leaving.

735
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,200
And so to have an official ritual of
closure and to let go of what happened at

736
00:46:51,581 --> 00:46:56,480
work and that will help you. I don't,
when I'm finished with my patients, no.

737
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,700
Usually I forget about it. I know
I go onto the next thing, you know,

738
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:03,220
unless there's something in
particular that I, you know,

739
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:06,430
that I need to think about a
little bit more. But I go on,

740
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:10,840
I'm 100% present when I'm working.
Like with here, I'm 100% present,

741
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:14,650
but when I go on, I want to
grab the next moment, you know,

742
00:47:14,651 --> 00:47:16,090
and inhabit the next moment.

743
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:21,510
So it's good as a sensitive person to
be present in the moment and then keep

744
00:47:21,821 --> 00:47:25,420
moving. And I was like the warrior,
your make your yell and then you move,

745
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,160
you know,
and that's it.

746
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:31,420
And so we know that that's to
think about to be in the moment.

747
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:34,990
And how do you be in the moment now
you can have a mantra even, you know,

748
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:38,530
let it be no, I'm being
in the now, you know,

749
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:42,220
and to bring your mind back cause
we have control over our thoughts,

750
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:46,600
our attitudes and our mind. And so when
we go into self doubt, you'll go, ah,

751
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:50,890
Sam left out. I know you all right.
Instead I'm going to breathe,

752
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:55,280
I'm going to focus on my heart and I'm
going to look at what I did well and

753
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,010
let's say I need improvement in something.
I will work on that. And we all,

754
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,500
you know,
are constantly works in progress.

755
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:06,790
And so to have a lot of compassion
for yourself every day and what you go

756
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:11,320
through, we all go through
so much. You know, all, you
know, as a psychiatrist, they,

757
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,240
I know well how much we all go through.
And so just,

758
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,780
you know, give people a break,
see the best in them and you know,

759
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:22,600
try and be empathic for
what they go through,

760
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,470
even if it's not something
maybe you can relate to,

761
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,210
but if you're empathic and your heart
goes out, no, that's a good thing.

762
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,510
It's really a beautiful thing to
relate to one another in that way.

763
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:38,390
Hello.
I'm kind of along those same lines.

764
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:42,530
I find what's really emotional draining
for me as being constantly connected, um,

765
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,800
via my phone or social media,
things like that.

766
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,720
Do you find that it's important for,

767
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,020
especially for sensitive people
to have that time to disconnect?

768
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:52,820
Maybe have a day without their phone,

769
00:48:52,821 --> 00:48:55,400
like is their tips and
tools that you'd recommend?

770
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:00,190
I think it's important to
have a technology fast, um,

771
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,240
and not go on social media and turn off
your phone and leave your phone at home

772
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:11,160
and go for a walk on the beach so
that you're not tethered to the phone.

773
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:15,390
I mean, even in the gym, sometimes I bring
my phone and I put it on the, you know,

774
00:49:15,391 --> 00:49:19,920
the treadmill and I have to talk to
myself. Just leave it in the locker,

775
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,220
tell, bring it, you know, your
world can exist, you know,

776
00:49:23,221 --> 00:49:26,490
for a short period of time
without that phone. But you know,

777
00:49:26,491 --> 00:49:30,510
it's very addictive technology and so
you have to really make that extra effort

778
00:49:30,511 --> 00:49:32,490
to say no to it.

779
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,690
And it makes me feel so much better
when I'm not near anything. You know,

780
00:49:36,691 --> 00:49:40,580
there's a, um, a monastery
that we go to sometimes in the,

781
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:44,190
in retreat Tassa horror monastery.
They don't even have electricity.

782
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,120
They have no cell phone coverage,
they have no electricity,

783
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:53,110
kerosene lamps. So you're forced into,
you know, a beautiful retreat of,

784
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:54,940
you know,
without technology.

785
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:57,810
So I think that makes you
better when you come to work,

786
00:49:57,811 --> 00:50:02,190
when you have those breaks as if you
keep checking and checking and checking.

787
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,750
It puts you in a Zombie like
state and that's not in the body.

788
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,920
And so to put it down a little
bit and go dance, I think dancing,

789
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:15,000
you know what you mentioned or movement,
any kind of movement,

790
00:50:15,001 --> 00:50:19,080
the Xi Gong Movement, dancing, walking,

791
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,230
exercising,
looking up at the stars and the sun.

792
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:27,231
It just replenishing is very
important without technology and just

793
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,570
want to add one thing and that is when
we talked about the children and what

794
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,870
we're teaching our kids
that our future is,

795
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:40,100
we're teaching them this importance of a,
how much our phones are.

796
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,110
And they will say, what do you
mean you, you, you lost your phone.

797
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:46,130
What are you going to do?

798
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:51,560
Like even they as young as
five are picking up on our
attachments to our phones.

799
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,740
So

800
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,311
my daughter,

801
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,850
very worried one night because my husband
went out for a walk and didn't have

802
00:50:56,851 --> 00:51:01,800
his phone. And I thought, oh this,
this is a day without a phone.

803
00:51:01,801 --> 00:51:04,050
I think it's a new g.
Did she class?

804
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,770
And thank you both Heather and Wendy
for half a my hair and thank you all for

805
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:11,604
coming.

806
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,840
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.
