1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,820
Uh, we have a very, very
special guest with us today. Um,

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,370
I remember reading,
uh,

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,210
Charlie monger saying that he didn't
know a smart man who didn't read all the

4
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:15,260
time and he has characterized
Warren buffet as a learning machine.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,330
The inspiration from there is how does
one become a very effective learner?

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,100
What is the science of learning
and a reading Barb's book.

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,000
That is exactly what the
book seems to be teaching us.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,290
And I have loved reading her book.
Not only love reading her book,

9
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:37,760
I could identify that the voice in
that book is the voice of a teacher.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,730
And that resonated a
lot with me personally.

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,110
So I'm very glad Barbara is here with
us today. So without further Ado,

12
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:48,380
ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in welcoming Barb Oakley.

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,580
It's such a pleasure to be here and I'd
like to begin by telling you a little

14
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:01,750
story. Another one. Uh,

15
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,040
this story is about,
well,

16
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:09,600
I think all of us love to
watch all the people, right?

17
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:14,370
To tell some greater or lesser extent.
And I love people watching.

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,440
And so I have to tell you about this one
guy who was one of the most interesting

19
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,330
people I've ever watched.

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,920
And this was when I was working down
in Antartica at Mcmurdo station.

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,320
And this guy's name was Neil.

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,470
And Neil was this thin wispy little guy
with kind of a high pitch voice and he

23
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:38,040
had a big head. So we look like the
sort of upside down exclamation point.

24
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,990
And he would kneel,

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,020
used to like to do is he liked to pick
up the phone and answer it with a perfect

26
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:51,231
imitation of the six foot eight
gorilla of a station manager or Brown.

27
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,810
So one day phone rings, you know,
picks it up as you real, hello,

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,640
this is art brown speaking,

29
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,990
and it was art brown on
the other end of the line.

30
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,250
So art says,
who the heck is this?

31
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:12,690
Or more unprintable words
to that effect at Neil says,

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,740
why aren't you,
wow,

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,850
I'm so glad you've finally
gotten in touch with yourself.

34
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,540
And so that's actually what we're going
to do here today is to help you to get

35
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,900
more in touch with yourself and what
you're doing when you're doing one of the

36
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:36,450
most important things you
can do as a human being.

37
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,890
And that is to learn new things.
Now to start,

38
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,480
I have to tell you a little bit
about my background and growing up,

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,710
I grew up moving all over the place.

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,510
By the time I'd hit 10th grade,
I lived in 10 different places.

41
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,020
Now moving around a lot like this has
some benefits but also has some drawbacks

42
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,450
or potential drawbacks.

43
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,050
And one of the things for me was math is
a very sequential topic and if you miss

44
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,780
it anywhere along the line,
right?

45
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,450
Somebody who's a little bit further ahead
and you're at us from a school where

46
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:17,590
it was a little behind,

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,040
all of a sudden you can actually fall off
the bandwagon and then you fallen off.

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,330
It's hard to get back on. And that's
what happened to me early on. I,

49
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,560
I fell off the map bandwagon,
just said, I can't do this.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,580
I hate it. I really want
nothing to do with it at all.

51
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,410
Science is the same way.

52
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:42,940
And so I basically flunked my
way through elementary, middle,

53
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,800
and high school math and science.

54
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,550
And it's really funny
thinking back on it now,

55
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:53,551
because I'm a professor of engineering
and I publish well in some of the top

56
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,790
journals,
so I do very well as an engineer.

57
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,390
But one day one of my students found out
about my sordid past as a math flunky

58
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,000
and he asked me, he said, how do
it, how would you change your brain?

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,460
And I thought, you know, how did I
do it? I mean, looking back on it,

60
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:21,330
I was just as little kid and I
love animals and I like fluffy,

61
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,750
furry things.
I like to knit and I,

62
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,590
I loved language and studying language.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,230
And at that time it wasn't,

64
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,470
there weren't college loans that were
relatively straightforward to get in.

65
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,790
So I really wanted to learn a language
and I couldn't afford to go to school.

66
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:47,110
And so how could I study language if
you know, in that kind of situation.

67
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,230
And there was one way I could do it.

68
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:54,550
I could actually go and learn a language
and get paid for it while I was doing

69
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:58,840
it. And that was to join the
army. And so that's what I did.

70
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,530
I joined the army and there you see me
looking re incredibly nervous about to

71
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:06,280
throw a hand grenade.
And I did learn a language.

72
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:11,050
I learned Russian and I ended up
working out on Russian trawlers,

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,300
a severe trawlers up in the Bering sea.

74
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,570
And that's me standing on
a bunch of fish there. Uh,

75
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,440
I can still swear quite well in Russian,

76
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,640
although the rest of the
Russians a little rusty.

77
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,610
But I loved getting,

78
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,360
having adventures and
gaining new perspectives.

79
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,600
And so I also ended up at the South Pole
station in Antarctica and that's where

80
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,540
I met my husband.

81
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,740
So I always say I had to go to the
end of the earth to meet that man.

82
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,730
And I did so, so the, the thing is though,

83
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,700
what I, what, what was going
on was I began to realize that,

84
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,510
you know, I was always interested
in these new perspectives,

85
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,260
but they're always sort of perspectives
that I was kind of comfortable with.

86
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,160
Somehow. You know, and having adventures,
that's sort of a comfortable thing,

87
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,700
but I wasn't actually kind of stretching
myself to really have a totally new

88
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:10,520
perspective.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,870
I thought back on the engineers
that I've worked with,

90
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:19,871
west point engineers who who were in
the military and I realized that their

91
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:24,920
problem solving skills were
in many ways exceptional.

92
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,570
They could think in a way that I couldn't
think. And I thought, you know what,

93
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:34,250
if I can read these kinds of equations,
like they could read equations.

94
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,520
What if I could in some sense learn the
language that they were able to speak?

95
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,190
Could I actually change my brain to learn
in that way to learn what these people

96
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,124
knew?

97
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,550
And so as I began to try to
answer that student's question,

98
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,560
how did you change your brain?

99
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,010
I started working on a book to kind of
describe what some of these key ideas

100
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:04,490
work.
And while I was working on this book I,

101
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,380
I did things like I,

102
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,030
I went to rate my professors.com probably
a few of you have been in schools,

103
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,730
realize that that's a pretty good website.
And I,

104
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,970
I looked to see who are the top professors
worldwide teaching subjects like

105
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,900
engineering, math, chemistry,
physics, economics,

106
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,230
a lot of really difficult subjects and
a lot of very relevant subjects as well,

107
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,910
like psychology,
even English.

108
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,160
How did they teach so people could
learn and how did they learn themselves?

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I also reached out to top cognitive
psychologists and neuroscientists.

110
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,360
And my own background also informed this,

111
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:52,361
I've taught for several decades is an
engineering professor done active research

112
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,140
in active learning.

113
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,040
And so all of these things
kind of combined together.

114
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,350
And what I found that I thought was very
interesting was when I reached out to

115
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:08,270
all these professors, a lot of the ones
in the stem disciplines in particular,

116
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,440
science,
technology,

117
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:14,441
engineering and math use these
approaches that might involve things like

118
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:17,120
metaphor or analogy.

119
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:22,220
But they were very embarrassed to say
that because other professors would kind

120
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:25,190
of be like, oh, you're
dumbing things down.

121
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,710
But it was actually something that all
of these top professors used to more

122
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,240
easily communicate the ideas.
It was like this shared handshake.

123
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,180
They all knew how to do it,

124
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:40,910
but they didn't realize
these other top professors,

125
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,680
we're using the same approaches.

126
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,460
So what I'm going to tell you now is
I'm going to give you some insight.

127
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,820
This,

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
these are the key ideas related to
learning that all of these people have

129
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,280
discovered.
So first off,

130
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,390
we know that the brain
is really complicated.

131
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,320
So what we're going to do is simplify
it and you can simplify the brain's

132
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,850
operation.
It did two fundamentally different modes.

133
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,500
First one is what I'll call focus mode.

134
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,600
And the second is what I'll call the
diffuse mode. And this is actually,

135
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,730
it relates to the default mode
network and other related,

136
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:30,810
there's some 24 or 25 so far,
uh,

137
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,350
neural resting states
that have been detected.

138
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,640
And so these,
all of these states all together,

139
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,700
I'll just call the diffuse
mode and what can happen.

140
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,211
I mean,

141
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:49,860
our best way to really understand these
two different modes as to use a metaphor

142
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,250
and the metaphor we're going to use is
that of a pinball machine and a pinball

143
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:59,790
machine. You all know how it
works. You just take a, uh, um,

144
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,980
the pinball and you pull back on the
rubber boots are on the plunger and a ball

145
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:09,480
goes blinking around on the, on the rubber
bumpers. And that's how you get points.

146
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,740
And what we're gonna do is we're going
to take that pinball machine and we're

147
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:18,690
going to super impose it on the brain.
And you see the brain right here.

148
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,620
Here's a, you know, uh, the little
ears and there's the nose right there.

149
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,800
And what we're going to do,
we're going to take that pinball machine,

150
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,630
we're gonna put it right on the brain.
And there you go.

151
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,940
There's the pinball machine on the brain,

152
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,690
and you can see how you can
pull back on the plunger there.

153
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,740
And you've got all these little pinballs
in their fridge or the rubber bumpers,

154
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:40,710
and they're all very close together.
So,

155
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,580
so what happens is in
focus mode type thinking,

156
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:46,230
like what I'm showing right here,

157
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,450
I've got these close together bumpers
and you often have patterns that are

158
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,760
already there.
For example,

159
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,840
if you've already learned how to
multiply and you're trying to do a

160
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:59,460
multiplication problem,

161
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,290
you would sit in focus mode and you've
got these patterns that are already there

162
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:09,291
and you think a thought and it takes off
and it moves roughly around the rubber

163
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:11,610
bumpers along the pathways.

164
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,640
It's already been in before that you've
developed as a consequence of previous

165
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:18,264
learning.

166
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,520
But what if the pattern you're
trying to think is something new?

167
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,000
What if you already know
about multiplication,

168
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,520
but you've never
encountered division before,

169
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,560
so you're trying to understand this idea
with the concept of limits in Calculus.

170
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,890
How do you go at a completely new idea
that you've never encountered before?

171
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,801
Well,

172
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:45,801
that's where this other way the brain
works in diffuse mode thinking can

173
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,140
actually be a benefit. Now,
take a look. Here's the diffuse,

174
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,710
the representative of the diffuse mode,
and it's just an analogy,

175
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:59,320
but it's a very good one
that helps us understand,

176
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,380
look at how far apart
those rubber bumpers are.

177
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,590
When you think a thought in diffuse mode,

178
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,040
the thoughts can range much more widely.

179
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,580
Now you can't think in a tight grain
fashion to actually solve the particulars

180
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:15,454
of a problem,

181
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,760
but you can at least get to a new sort
of way of thinking about things that you

182
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,590
couldn't have gotten if you were
just in the focus mode. In fact,

183
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,250
sometimes when you're trying to
solve a really difficult problem,

184
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,050
the worst thing you can do is just keep
sitting there and focusing and focusing

185
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:39,850
on it because you can be up on that
part of the brain, so to speak.

186
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,060
And yet you need to be in a
completely different place.

187
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,950
So the best thing to do when you're really
stuck and frustrated on a problem is

188
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:50,050
not to keep focusing on it.

189
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,100
You actually need to get in a
very different mode of thinking.

190
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,660
And that's what, uh, that's,
that's what's represented here.

191
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,190
And so what this means practically
for you is you're sitting there,

192
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:06,820
you're working, hey,
get out, go for a run,

193
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,030
go down and have a go take a shower if
you need to or do something that really

194
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:17,740
gets your mind totally off it.
Because when you're in this mode,

195
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,920
as long as your attention
is focused on that problem,

196
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,660
you're still in this mode and you can't
get to this way of solving things.

197
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,213
So,

198
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,570
so how can this play out for people?

199
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,700
If you look at this guy right here,
he was Salvador Dali.

200
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,070
He, uh, one of the most brilliant of the
surrealist painters of the 20th century.

201
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,190
He shown here with his pet ocelot Babu.

202
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,430
And what dollar used to do is this,

203
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,080
you'd sit in a chair when he had a
kind of a intractable problem with his

204
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,340
paintings to solve.

205
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,300
You'd sit and he'd relax and relax who ae.

206
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,280
And just as he relax so much, you know,
kind of letting his mind run free,

207
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,700
he have a key in his hand and just as
he'd relax so much that he falls asleep,

208
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,950
the key would fall from his hand.
The clatter would wake him up and off.

209
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:19,330
He'd go with this new idea
from the diffuse mode,

210
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,340
taking it back to the focus mode where
he could refine and really use them.

211
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,930
So you might think, well, you know,
that's just great for artists.

212
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:34,150
But what if you're an engineer?
If you're looking at this guy right here,

213
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:38,590
this was Thomas Edison.
And what Edison used to do,

214
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,970
at least according to legend,

215
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,450
was he'd sit in a chair with ball bearings
in his hand and he'd relax and relax.

216
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:50,050
And then finally when he'd fall asleep,

217
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:53,810
the ball bearings would fall from either
his hand and whatever he had in his

218
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,790
very relaxed way,
been thinking about,

219
00:14:55,791 --> 00:15:00,290
he'd be able to take some of those ideas
from that mode and bring them back with

220
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,620
him to the focus mode
where he could refine it,

221
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,220
analyze and come up with some
of those brilliant inventions.

222
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,990
So the lesson for us out
of all of this is this,

223
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,500
the, I'm giving some exemplary
innovators in various fields,

224
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,920
but whenever you're solving a problem,

225
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,320
even if it's a problem that thousands
or even millions of other people have

226
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:29,570
solved before for you,

227
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,900
it's the very first time that
you've solved that problem.

228
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,960
And you need to use some of these same
creative approaches that these other

229
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,480
brilliant thinkers have used.
And what you want to do,

230
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,780
be aware of is that you can be in focus
mode or you can be in diffuse smoke,

231
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,300
but you can't really,
as far as we know,

232
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:52,610
unless you're an exceptionally
well trained to monk,

233
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,340
be in both modes at the same time,

234
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,940
so focused or diffuse and you
want to develop both modes.

235
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,380
Diffuse thinking is often not conscious,

236
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,840
but it is also learning.

237
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,990
And so that's why that relaxation
process can also be very important.

238
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,630
Now I just wanted to give
you a quick image here.

239
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,810
This shows some of the brilliant uh,

240
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,350
connectivity of the default mode network.

241
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,700
See all these connections here
between various aspects of the brain.

242
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,170
This is a web for one mode of working,

243
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,500
but focus mode has a very different web.

244
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,170
So if you're only focusing,

245
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,560
you're not making access or getting access
to a lot of the different connections

246
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,940
that are available for you.

247
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,330
That's why going back and forth
between modes can be so very important.

248
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,930
Now it takes time to do
this. You, you, you can't.

249
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,340
That's why you can't sit down and just
solve a difficult problem immediately.

250
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:05,960
You often have to go back and
forth between the modes and it.

251
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,831
In some sense,

252
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:11,780
you could almost think of it like this
is a weight lifter and a weightlifter is

253
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,510
take.

254
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,510
He does centrally cram the night before
a big meet and build muscles like that.

255
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,530
It takes time to develop
those muscles in the same way.

256
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,560
It takes time to develop
the neural scaffold that is
involved in learning and in

257
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,480
new thinking processes.

258
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,960
But I know what you're really thinking.

259
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,450
You may be thinking,
I'm a procrastinator,

260
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,940
I wait. Sometimes I don't like
have time to do stuff. Right?

261
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,860
And so let's talk a little
bit about procrastination.

262
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:52,861
And sometimes you can be a
really effective human being,

263
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:57,060
but still procrastinate about some things.
And so in that sense,

264
00:17:57,061 --> 00:18:01,890
there are things to learn to help
improve your productivity and your

265
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,570
effectiveness in what you do.

266
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,920
So procrastination arises
in a very interesting way.

267
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,360
Studies have shown that if you
look at something you don't like,

268
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,620
the pain centers of your
brain actually activate.

269
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,760
So if you look at a book for
a subject you don't like,

270
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,680
you can actually feel a twinge and we
can see it in the brain if you're being

271
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:30,450
imaged. So, so what do you do
when you feel pain? I mean,

272
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:34,740
it's the same pain as when you
hammer your thumb with a hammer.

273
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,250
Well, you have two different
ways of handling it.

274
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,760
The first way is you can work through it
like 20 minutes or so and the pain will

275
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:48,480
gradually disappear.
But if you're like most people,

276
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,020
what you'll do is you'll just
kind of turn your attention away.

277
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,580
Just something more pleasant. And guess
what? You'll feel better immediately,

278
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,370
right?
And so in some sense,

279
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,230
procrastination can actually be
a little bit like an addiction.

280
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,430
You do it once, you do it
twice. It's not that big a deal.

281
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,480
You do it a lot of times though,
and it actually can be very,

282
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:17,110
very detrimental for your
life. So I'm an engineer. I'm,

283
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,800
I believe in totally practical,
useful things.

284
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:22,050
So what I'm going to do is cut
right to the chase and say,

285
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:25,980
here's the most effective way to
help you deal with procrastination.

286
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,110
And it is simply to use,
uh, the pomodoro technique.

287
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,990
And this is a technique that
was developed by Francesco city,

288
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:37,530
a low in the 1980s and it involves,

289
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,180
he called it the pomodoro technique
because he had a tomato shaped timer and

290
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,210
Pomodoro is Italian for tomato.

291
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,050
And what he would do is he would,
he,

292
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,830
he recommends you set
a timer for 25 minutes.

293
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,860
Actually you can have different
times, different things, uh,

294
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,640
are used different time lengths are,
are useful for different people,

295
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,970
but you set it in general for 25 minutes
and then you turn off everything else.

296
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,510
So no alarms,
no instant messages,

297
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,620
anything that can can
disturb your concentration,

298
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,890
you turn that off and then you work with
is careful of focused attention as you

299
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:22,980
can for those 25 minutes. Now sometimes
I'll be working away and I'll think,

300
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,570
am I really focusing as hard as I can?
And then I think,

301
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:31,290
well obviously not because I just got
distracted and I'm wondering whether I'm

302
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,410
focusing instead of actually
working. And so, so,

303
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:39,411
but I let that thought just drift
by and then I get back to my work,

304
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:44,880
right? And that's what you're doing in
this technique. You want to just get,

305
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:46,110
keep your mind on your work.

306
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,440
And what happens is because you're only
focusing on the task and the time and

307
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:56,320
not the pain of,
I must complete this task,

308
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,870
it's somehow makes it so much
easier to do. I mean anybody,

309
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,400
virtually anybody can sit
for 25 minutes and work. Uh,

310
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,860
and then when you're done,
reward yourself.

311
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:12,190
And that reward is actually very important
because what you're doing is you're

312
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:14,110
focusing during the focus mode,

313
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,560
but then you want to train yourself
to relax and enjoy and do something

314
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:23,520
different. Just, you know, surf the
web, do you know, go out for all day,

315
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,260
whatever floats your boat,
you go off and do that.

316
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,800
And this actually is important because
we know that some aspects of learning

317
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,100
take place during this relaxed process.
So you're,

318
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:42,250
you're Tencent tendency is to think
I'm not working when I'm not focusing,

319
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,720
but you actually are.

320
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,670
So it kind of gives you a little bit of
a feeling of relief and accomplishment

321
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,950
that it is okay to relax.

322
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,030
So a couple of little little pointers.
First,

323
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,940
don't sit down and do a pomodoro and say,
you know,

324
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:02,140
I'm going to finish off my work.
Don't focus on the task,

325
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,450
only focus on the time.

326
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,790
And that's the trick to this technique
because I get you past that pain in the

327
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:14,791
brain and allows you to just relax
comfortably and get into the flow of the

328
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,310
task. The other thing
is don't like say, okay,

329
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:22,810
I'm going to do 20 pomodoros today and
and think that you're going to beat

330
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:25,780
yourself into more productivity that way.

331
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,370
I want to just gradually you start getting
used to this technique and you'll see

332
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:31,930
that it works very,
very well.

333
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,710
Now another aspect that's really important
related to learning is we've often

334
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:43,270
been told, hey, sleep's really important
before a big test or something like that.

335
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,690
Actually sleep is important
in a lot of different ways.

336
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,760
And I'm going to talk to you.
I just mentioned a little bit of one of,

337
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,970
one of the primary important reasons
that sleep's important for learning.

338
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,960
We've found that if you look at the cells,

339
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,410
these little circles here represent cells,
neurons in the brain.

340
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,630
And what happens when you go
to sleep is this, that well,

341
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,910
when you're awake first when you're awake,

342
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,720
these metabolites will come
out and they'll go in between,

343
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,880
you know the junctions and they kind of
sit out there and they're essentially

344
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:22,330
toxins in your brain.
So when you're awake,

345
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,870
these toxins are gradually accumulating
in your brain and they affect your

346
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:33,790
judgment. That's why when you stay awake
a longer and longer time, it's difficult.

347
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:38,710
It's more and more difficult to think
clearly. So when you go to sleep though,

348
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:43,480
here's what happens. Now, watch very
carefully to what happens to those cells.

349
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,100
Go to sleep.
They shrink.

350
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,550
I'll do that again cause I
just have some fun doing this.

351
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,960
See they shrink when you go to sleep.
And because they shrink,

352
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,080
what that does is that allows fluids
to wash by the cells and wash these

353
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,450
metabolites out.

354
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,810
So a very important part of
sleep is just the housekeeping,

355
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:12,470
the cleaning that takes place that allows
your brain to function so much more

356
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:14,210
effectively.
Now,

357
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,080
another very important aspect of
learning or of sleep relates to neural.

358
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,410
A synoptic growth in this
wonderful paper by Guang Young,

359
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:27,860
uh,

360
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,860
she's out of Llangollen is if
you look at the top picture,

361
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,530
you can see here what's going on.

362
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,150
This is the same neuron
at the top and the bottom,

363
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,760
the top neuron is before
learning and before sleep.

364
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,530
The bottom neuron is after
learning and after sleep,

365
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,840
all of these little triangles
are new synoptic connections.

366
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,680
And so when you learn
something and you go to sleep,

367
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,710
that's when the new synoptic
connections are forming.

368
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,250
And this is what's going
on when you're learning.

369
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,200
So that's why it's very important when
you're learning something new. Again,

370
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,240
you don't want to cram at the last minute.

371
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:19,610
You want to have many short
learning periods, sleep, learning,

372
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:20,444
sleep.

373
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,660
And that's helping you build that neuro
scaffold that helps you learn so much

374
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:30,440
better. So there's another
thing, aspect of learning.

375
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:34,970
And people often think this is so
completely disconnected from real learning

376
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:35,750
that they,

377
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:40,660
they even are taking away recess
from kids because they're like, God,

378
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,480
that doesn't help them learn only when
they're sitting in front of us learning

379
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:47,840
from us. That's when they really
learned. But that's not true at all.

380
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:53,410
We're now finding how incredibly important
exercise is to the learning process.

381
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,370
Now, if you'll look here,
this, uh, study, uh,

382
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:04,150
was of a mouse and there were training
this mouse to differentiate between two

383
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:08,540
different symbols.
And if you look in the background,

384
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,900
what's happening is all of these
blue blobs are old neurons.

385
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,400
Now, we used to think you are born
with all the neurons that you have,

386
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,820
and that's what you got for the
rest of your life. Well, of course,

387
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:24,410
now we know that's not true,

388
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:29,030
but it was wisdom received
wisdom for many decades.

389
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,770
And so what they found was see these new,

390
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:37,580
this red,
these red lines here,

391
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:42,581
those are actually the new neurons that
are being born every day in all of us,

392
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:46,830
as well as in the smells
in the hippocampus.

393
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,890
And that is how those are absolutely
essential to our ability to learn and

394
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,590
remember new information.

395
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,930
There's two ways to allow these
new neurons to grow and survive.

396
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,200
One is you have you,

397
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,450
you get exposed to new environments.
That's what travel can be so good.

398
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:13,710
That's what you're learning
can be effective and these
kinds of things can help

399
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:15,030
those new neurons survive.

400
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,110
But the other way of helping
these new neurons survive,

401
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,440
that's just as powerful as
learning is simply to exercise.

402
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,330
So exercise is profoundly
important, and I'm not talking, hey,

403
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:34,350
I've got to be an Olympic
weightlifter or be a marathon runner.

404
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,060
Even simple walking can be very,
very effective in help.

405
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:40,950
And I'm sure you've
all had the experience,

406
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,690
you're all mazy brained and then you go
out for a walk and it clears up your way

407
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:46,524
of thinking.

408
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,490
But even a few days of an exercise
program is doing much more than that.

409
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,550
It's actually enhancing the ability
of your neurons to grow and survive.

410
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,090
Now, if you look, there's a name
right here, Terence and I'll ski.

411
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,350
He was on one of the original papers,
it doing this original research.

412
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,060
He's the Francis Crick professor at
the Salk Institute and he's also my

413
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:14,061
colleague in doing the massive
open online course that's based on,

414
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,020
uh, based on the book. And Terry is,

415
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,090
he's a remarkable guy and it was really
a lot of fun making them massive open

416
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:28,980
online course with him. And so, so we
went and we did some filming together.

417
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:31,980
And so then I asked and I
said, well, Terry, you know,

418
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,250
you're talking all this stuff
about the importance of exercise.

419
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:39,300
Do you exercise what you do? And
he's like, dude, why you exercise?

420
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,610
And what he does is he, he goes and, uh,

421
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,940
every day or every few days he goes down,

422
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,360
he's like a mountain goat. The Guy 65
means like climbs down and you know,

423
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm scrambling after him and he goes,
you know,

424
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,310
running on the beach just like you see
here. And this is how he gets his access.

425
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,860
I love how he finishes here. Watch
this, look at that. Yeah. So,

426
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,870
so he is a legend in neuroscience and
I'm convinced that part of it is because

427
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:15,321
he uses some of these ideas that he's
found in his research to help him really

428
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:19,530
keep his edge intellectually.
Now.

429
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,660
So let's just talk a little bit about
something called working memory.

430
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,130
Working memory is how you
keep a brief thought in mind.

431
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,600
It used to be thought that you had seven
slots in working memory and that's why

432
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:36,090
you could hold a phone
number of seven numbers.

433
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,770
But now we're kind of realizing it's
more like maybe there's four slots in

434
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:44,900
working memory. So maybe for me
it's like two slots and right.

435
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,660
But anyway, so you have four
slots and it's in your prefer.

436
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,750
You can kind of think of
it as your working memory.

437
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:55,330
You're holding things in
your prefrontal cortex.

438
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:58,960
So I've got to kind of symbolize right
there as you're forced lots of working

439
00:29:58,961 --> 00:29:59,710
memory.

440
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,710
So when you are remembering something
or thinking about something with working

441
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:06,790
memory,

442
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:11,790
you can think of it symbolically at
least as something like an octopus,

443
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,580
the octopus of attention that reaches
through those slots of working memory and

444
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:22,180
makes connections between different ideas.

445
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,040
And that's why you can't hold too many
ideas at once in your brain before you

446
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,200
get all confused.
But,

447
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,190
but what happens if you're multitasking,
right?

448
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:37,390
What happens if you're kinda got a
little bit of an eye out here on some,

449
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,670
you know,
am I getting an instant message?

450
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,520
In some sense that's like taking one
of those tentacles away of your working

451
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:48,190
memory.
You don't have a lot of tentacles.

452
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,730
So it really is kind of actually making
whatever intellectual heft you have,

453
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,070
you're kind of losing some of it.

454
00:30:57,071 --> 00:31:00,040
You're getting a little stupider
when you're multitasking.

455
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,400
So that's why careful focused
attention is so incredibly important,

456
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,100
especially when you're working on
something that's rather difficult. Now,

457
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:13,210
I'd just like to contrast
this with the diffuse mode.

458
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,380
The diffuse mode is it's,
it's a lot of connections,

459
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:20,860
but they're much more random
in how they take place.

460
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,520
So how do you take something from
working memory into long term memory,

461
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:31,480
which is more distributed
around in your brain? Well,

462
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,320
the best way is through practice.

463
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,000
Practice makes in some sense permanent.
The more you practice,

464
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,550
the more the broader that
little neural pathway the uh,

465
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,880
becomes and the more
deeply embedded it becomes.

466
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,300
So if you're learning something and you
practice those patterns get deeper and

467
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:56,020
deeper,

468
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:01,020
and that's how you can learn something
and draw it from working memory or from

469
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:06,400
longterm memory into working memory.
If you don't practice,

470
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:11,110
what's going to happen is you've got
those neurons and it's almost like you've

471
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:13,240
got these little metabolic vampires,

472
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:17,290
it just come and they suck those patterns
away before they can get deepened.

473
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,780
And so that's why sometimes you can
learn something from a professor.

474
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,940
You even understand it. You've had that
great stroke of insight. You walk away,

475
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:29,830
you don't look at it for a few days,

476
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,870
and those little metabolic fat
vampires just suck that pattern away.

477
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,530
And you can't really remember
or understand what you
had learned previously.

478
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,020
So the best way to get patterns,
well embedded in your longterm memory,

479
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,990
it's the practice through
spaced repetition.

480
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,700
So you might practice Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, maybe at again on Friday.

481
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,640
And and by spacing things out,

482
00:32:55,641 --> 00:33:00,140
you realize now that you're getting those
new synoptic connections growing every

483
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:02,390
time you learn a little
and then you sleep on it.

484
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,380
What you don't want to do is this kind
of thing where you're just kind of

485
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:11,381
cramming like crazy and then look that
metabolic vampire just kind of sucks it

486
00:33:12,471 --> 00:33:16,070
all away and you're left with very little.

487
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,280
It's hard to remember
what you were learning.

488
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,970
A good way to think about this is
just the analogy of a of a wall.

489
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,260
If you're building a brick wall and you
give yourself time between layers of

490
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:34,820
mortar, it can set and you can
build a solid, sturdy wall.

491
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,350
But if you don't,

492
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,420
it's all kind of a jumble and it doesn't
turn into a really good structure that

493
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:42,770
you can actually use.

494
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,400
So let's go back again and we're going
to talk a little bit more quickly about

495
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,710
attention and how it affects working and
the relationship with working memory.

496
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,910
Now if you look here,

497
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:04,270
you can see you've got one slot in your
working memory that's filled when you

498
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:08,540
have one slot filled. You could put
other things in your working memory,

499
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,500
but,
but here's the trick.

500
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,500
How do you get things into just one slot?

501
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,970
It turns out that if you create a chunk,

502
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,010
one chunk of the material,

503
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:27,410
it's easy to pull into working memory.
So here's what I mean by that.

504
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,200
If you look at here, here's a, a
raw pattern of information, right?

505
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,940
It's a puzzle. It's hard to figure
out. It looked like a mad scramble,

506
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,660
but once and look what's going
on in your working memory,

507
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,320
it's kind of going a little crazy
trying to figure things out. In fact,

508
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:47,020
recent research,
uh,

509
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:51,470
at Stanford has shown children who
are trying to learn math facts.

510
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,860
It's their low prefrontal cortexes
are going crazy as they try to,

511
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,260
uh,
assimilate and master the material.

512
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,210
But once they've got those
math facts down, this relaxes.

513
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,250
What's actually happening is this,

514
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,520
they've got the essential idea and this
what that essential idea is like is one

515
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,690
smooth single ribbon.

516
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,490
They can easily pull into working
memory when they need to in order to

517
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:27,491
understand and make connections with
other problems that they're trying to

518
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:28,634
solve.

519
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,660
Now if you just memorize and you're not
understanding what you're memorizing,

520
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,470
it's like creating that little
circle there and, and Eh,

521
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,950
you can see it, you've got
it. It really is a chunk,

522
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,740
but you can't fit it very
well with other chunks.

523
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,270
So there's another important idea
about chunking and that's this.

524
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,660
Once you've compressed and idea,

525
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:55,350
that's one of the most brilliant
mathematicians was mentioning,

526
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,380
one of the great aspects of math is
simply that idea that you can compress it

527
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,150
when you grapple,
grapple,

528
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:06,180
grapple and all of a sudden it
clicks and you've got to compress.

529
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,010
Once you've got a compressed in a chunk,
there's actually,

530
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,320
you can make that chunk bigger,
right?

531
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,050
And just like learning
a little piece of song,

532
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,870
you can actually learn another
piece and join them together.

533
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:23,871
And you've got a bigger chunk or you
can also learn similar chunks of other

534
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:31,110
disciplines and it's very, very
helpful. That's an idea of transfer.

535
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,270
But what you're really doing when you're
learning and mastering a topic is you

536
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:41,271
are in some sense creating a library of
chunks and you can draw on that library

537
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,250
and make connections between things.
And that's how great creative,

538
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,290
uh, creativity arises, is making
connections with those chunks.

539
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,620
So true experts often have
enormous libraries of chunks
that they've developed.

540
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,690
Now when you're learning,
there's sort of a,

541
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,370
you can think of it as there's
a top down approach. So if,

542
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,620
if you're learning a new topic,
you can almost think of it like,

543
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:14,280
look at,

544
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,280
there's a chunk there that's that tire
and here's a chunk fits the man's face

545
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,520
and another tire.

546
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:25,230
So you're learning all these chunks and
when you get them all kind of learned,

547
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,410
it forms the big picture of the material.

548
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,810
Even if you're missing a
few pieces here and there,

549
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:32,550
you still got that big picture.

550
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,330
But if you don't practice and repeat
and really master your chunks,

551
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,780
it's like this.

552
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:43,470
It's like you're trying to put together
the big picture with chunks that are

553
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:48,330
faint and it's much harder to put together
the big picture with that in mind.

554
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,300
So again,
as I was saying,

555
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:54,690
you've got a one ribbon right of thought.

556
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:57,810
That's a chunk here is uh,

557
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,480
another chunk in another field,

558
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:05,280
but it's of a similar shape and
that's the idea of transfer.

559
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,890
So if you're a physicist,

560
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:12,540
you may be able to learn economics more
easily because some of the chunks are

561
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,670
really similar in their shape.

562
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,180
If you are a language learner and
you're learning math and science,

563
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,300
there are medic chunks available.
For example,

564
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:29,190
that idea of practice and repetition for
language also applies in learning math

565
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:31,080
and science.
So,

566
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,520
so let's go to some other aspect
I think relates to learning.

567
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,950
Some of you may say, ah, some of you
may have wonderful memories here,

568
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,960
but some of you may wish you
had better memories. Well,

569
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:51,610
let me kind of give you a little
awareness where you think maybe a negative

570
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:56,050
attribute actually can be a very,
very positive attribute.

571
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,710
It turns out that when you
have a poor working memory,

572
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:05,500
what that really means is you can't
hold things in mind very well, right?

573
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,030
So you're looking at your colleague who
can remember all this different stuff.

574
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,650
They can hold it in their working memory,
turn somersaults with it,

575
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:18,940
and come up with new ideas really quickly
and you're lucky to remember what they

576
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:22,840
were even talking about.
But here's the thing.

577
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,100
Research has shown that if you
have a poor working memory,

578
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,920
you'll near four slots
are like pretty weak.

579
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,610
Other stuff is already
s always slipping in.

580
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:36,490
That's why you can't hold
ideas very well in your mind,

581
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,610
but because the other
stuff is slipping in,

582
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,080
you're actually more
creative and it should.

583
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:48,090
Research show has shown that if you
have attention deficit disorder or your

584
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:54,250
attention wanders, oh, shiny,
then then what happened?

585
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:59,251
What that means is you have much
more potential for being creative.

586
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,150
Do you have to work harder than some
other people in order to make up for that?

587
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,530
Yeah,
you do.

588
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,150
But that that comes with the trade off,

589
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,390
that you are highly
creative so you can be very,

590
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:18,391
very valuable in your job even though
you may have to work harder sometimes to

591
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:21,790
have that, uh, achievement.
Now you may say,

592
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:27,250
well that's all well and good, but
I'm actually a slow thinker, right?

593
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:31,270
I see these other people and they've
got like a super race car brain.

594
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:36,271
They can pick up these ideas so fast
and I kind of move along more slowly.

595
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,030
Well, one of my heroes in, um,

596
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,310
in the history of science is the Nobel
Prize winners, Santiago Ramonica Hall,

597
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:48,820
who's known as the father
of modern neuroscience.

598
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,770
Ramonica hall was not a genius
and he said, so himself,

599
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,540
part of what he did was he
worked hard and was persistent,

600
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,260
but he said these people
with race car brains,

601
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,340
which he was not often race along,

602
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,660
and they jump to conclusions
that he didn't miss.

603
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,670
He would see them and he was
more flexible in his thinking.

604
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:20,080
When he'd see a mistake,
he would go, wait a minute.

605
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,970
Whereas the race car driver is so
used to being right and being fast,

606
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:30,330
that they're much less able
to be persistent and to
flexibly change in the light

607
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:36,930
of contradictory data.
So if you have a, um,

608
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,610
you know, a slow brain,
think of it like this,

609
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,490
there's the person with
the race car brain, great,

610
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,780
but you're the hiker and your
experience is completely different.

611
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,040
You walk along, you can see the little
rabbit trails that they've missed.

612
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,170
You can reach out and touch the pine
needles, you can smell the pine forests.

613
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,170
All of this is missed
by the race car driver.

614
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,700
So your way of thinking can be
exceptionally valuable as well.

615
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:09,410
In fact,
Miriam Merce cause Amir's a Connie was,

616
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,800
she won the fields medal, which is
the top award in mathematics, uh,

617
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,460
the equivalent for mathematics
of the Nobel prize.

618
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,010
And she was told as a young person,

619
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,810
you think too slowly to be a
mathematician. Well guess what?

620
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,700
She's one of the most
creative mathematicians alive.
So if you think slowly,

621
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,070
more power to you,
yeah, you're doing good.

622
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,000
Now I also want to bring up another uh,

623
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:39,440
aspect and that is the aspect
of the imposter syndrome.

624
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,240
This is so important. It's so
common that and, and what it is,

625
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:48,800
it's a feeling like you're
the fake in the room, right?

626
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,360
I'm working here,

627
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,550
maybe I'm working at Google and I'm really
not as good as they say that I am and

628
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,600
I, I'm kind of an imposter here and
people feel this all over the world.

629
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,260
No matter what they're doing. You're a
professor, oh wait a minute. You know,

630
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:07,940
they're going to find out what the real
truth is. I took a test and I did well,

631
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,540
but next time I'm not going to fail it
because I know they'll find out what the

632
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:15,380
real truth is. Really,
really common feeling.

633
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,620
And the best way to address the imposter
syndrome is to just be aware how common

634
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:23,960
it is.
So next time you have a thought,

635
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:26,630
like I don't really not
as good as they say. I am.

636
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,320
Remember that the imposter syndrome
talking and the probably one of the most

637
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:36,860
important things that I could bring up.

638
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:42,310
And so that's why I'm doing it towards
the end here is this idea of illusions of

639
00:43:42,681 --> 00:43:45,440
competence in learning.
Now,

640
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:51,580
let's say that suddenly for some reason
a bear came hurdling out of this screen

641
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,900
and rampaging through the room,

642
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,420
would you feel a surge of adrenaline
and nervous energy? I mean,

643
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,680
suddenly you're,

644
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:08,730
your body would react physiologically
to this feeling of intense fear as you

645
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:14,210
realize that the bear was actually
in front of you. But the thing is,

646
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,620
when you think about learning situations,

647
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,390
we often say, students will
come up and say, you know,

648
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,010
I have test anxiety.
That's why I didn't do well on this test.

649
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,920
But for a lot of students,
sadly,

650
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:36,030
sitting down and looking at a test
is like, there's a bear there.

651
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:41,570
They just realized at that moment that
they really didn't know the material even

652
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:44,870
though they thought they did. So, uh,

653
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:49,890
students and people can fool themselves
that they're learning something when

654
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:52,020
they're actually not learning something.

655
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,460
So I'll give you some of the best
ways for truly learning something.

656
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,880
First off,
tess are the best.

657
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,730
Test yourself on everything all the time,

658
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:07,950
the same hour spent testing as
opposed to that hours spent studying.

659
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,160
You will learn far more by
taking a test and use flashcards.

660
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,010
Flashcards are not just for
language learners, right? Why?

661
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:22,070
Why let them have all the fun flashcards
or for ordinary for learning in math

662
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:26,100
and science. For example,
if you talk to great poets,

663
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:31,101
what great poets will tell you is
memorize the poem because you'll feel the

664
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:36,240
passion and the power of
the poem much more deeply.

665
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,740
Why should mathematicians not
be able to share in this fun?

666
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,770
How about engineers?
When we have equations,

667
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:48,830
if you memorize the equation and really
look at what does it mean while you're

668
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:50,184
doing that,

669
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,570
it actually can bring out the
richness of what you're learning.

670
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,430
And another thing is when you're
having homework, homework,

671
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:02,690
a lot of times people make the
mistake of thinking, Hey, you know, I,

672
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:07,410
I did my homework problem and it's like
saying I'm learning the piano and I

673
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:12,030
played this piano piece one time
and uh, and so I've got it. Well,

674
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,030
nobody does that when they're
learning a musical instrument.

675
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,250
And in the same way when you're studying,

676
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:20,340
you don't want to just do
a homework problem once,

677
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,690
you don't have time to do all of them
and kind of repeat them, the pig,

678
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:29,430
some of the key ones and
see if you can do it again,

679
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,940
like practice it and
maybe do it in your mind.

680
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,890
Can you step through all the steps?

681
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,360
If you can play it almost
like a song in your mind,

682
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,710
you've really got it.

683
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,120
You've got it down as a chunk and
that can help build things now, uh,

684
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,610
build your knowledge of the material.
Now,

685
00:46:47,611 --> 00:46:52,611
probably the most valuable technique
when you're learned trying to really

686
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:55,410
understand something difficult is simple.

687
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:59,310
Recall when you're reading
material on a page,

688
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:04,530
you read away and your tendency is to,
well, I'm going to underline it right?

689
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,230
Because when your hand
is moving on the page,

690
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,070
you think it's moving it into your
brain somehow. But it actually is not.

691
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,450
So resist the urge.
You can do a little bit of a underlining,

692
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:20,070
but it's better to write it because
you're helping to neurally encode these

693
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:23,820
ideas.
And then when you read the page,

694
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,540
simply look away and
see what you can recall.

695
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,380
That as it turns out,

696
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,650
is very powerful in building
your understanding of the
material in a way that

697
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,100
other techniques,
including mine mapping and rereading,

698
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,710
they're not nearly as good as recall.

699
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,270
So if,
uh,

700
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,300
another very important aspect is simply
to study judiciously with other people

701
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,330
or talk about what you're trying
to understand with other people.

702
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:59,530
Now this has to be done judiciously.
Obviously you don't,

703
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,130
all learning does not take
place in a cooperative fashion.

704
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,630
Sometimes you have to go off,

705
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,740
but when you're learning
something sort of in focus mode,

706
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,480
there's a part in parcel of that focus
mode and that is a feeling that what

707
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:16,720
you've just learned is correct,
right?

708
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:18,700
This sort of rightness feeling.

709
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:24,060
And the only way you can really disabuse
yourself sometimes is to go off and

710
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:30,691
bounce your ideas off of other people
and they can almost serve like a greater

711
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:36,241
kind of diffuse mode to help disabuse
you when you do make mistakes.

712
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,780
So judicious studying with friends and,

713
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,450
and conversation with colleagues
can be incredibly helpful.

714
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:49,230
Also explain in a way that a
10 year old can understand.

715
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:52,720
So frequently we explain electricity,

716
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:57,340
the flow of electricity as water,
the flow of water. It's an analogy,

717
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:00,580
it breaks down all analogies breakdown.
But,

718
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,680
but Richard Fineman,

719
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:07,450
the Nobel prize winning physicist
used to go around and challenge top

720
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:11,410
mathematicians in the world
to explain in a silly way,

721
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,700
like in a way that their grandmothers
could understand what they were doing and

722
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:17,560
you know what they could.

723
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,000
So this means that no matter how difficult
that problem is that you're working

724
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,700
on,
if you find a way to explain it,

725
00:49:24,701 --> 00:49:28,540
simply you'll be able to
understand it much more deeply.

726
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,380
One thing to do is insert yourself
into whatever the problem is.

727
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,060
Like here I am in a a a
copper matrix, right? Uh,

728
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,650
if Barbara Mcclintock the,
uh,

729
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
the Nobel prize winning a geneticist
used to kind of imagine herself down at a

730
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:53,260
genetic level so she could understand
and see how the genes might actually be

731
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:57,550
operating. So that's a trick that's often
used by some of the greatest thinkers.

732
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:02,470
Try to find a way to get yourself into a,
almost like a play,

733
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,540
whatever you're trying to understand.

734
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:09,100
If you want some more information about
what the, what I've talked about here,

735
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:14,101
there's much more in the book of mine
for numbers and there's a lot more and

736
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:19,771
it's all free in the massive open online
course for Coursera through Uc San

737
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,810
Diego.
Learning how to learn.

738
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,250
And that is the key,

739
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,690
except for one thing,
like to leave you with this last thought.

740
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,880
We're often thought told
that follow your passion,

741
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,310
that is the key to everything.

742
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:44,420
Just follow your passion and your life
will really be a better place for it.

743
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:49,610
We're told that,
but some things,

744
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:55,150
your passion develops about what you're
really good at and some things take much

745
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,310
longer to get good at.

746
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:02,240
So don't just follow your passions,

747
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:07,750
broaden your passions and your
lives will be greatly enriched.

748
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,500
Thank you very much.

749
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:15,360
[inaudible]

750
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,160
now we'll open it up for a
few questions for bar. Uh,

751
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,270
please raise your hand if
you have a question and I'll
bring the mic over to you.

752
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,850
So one of the questions I had
was that, um, I, you know, when,

753
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:31,570
whenever learning things and tackling
tough problems, people always say, well,

754
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:36,100
we'll break it down into smaller
parts that you know how to do.

755
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,360
And so I wondered how that fits into
the focus and diffuse mode because that

756
00:51:40,361 --> 00:51:45,361
seems kind of like breaking a diffuse
problem into a bunch of focus problems.

757
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:53,730
It actually, what that really
relates to is that idea of chunks.

758
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:59,660
So remember that you've got
four slots and working memory.

759
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:05,970
The more you can understand
one simple part of it, right?

760
00:52:05,971 --> 00:52:10,971
And make it into a chunk and then another
little aspect of it and make that into

761
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:13,650
a chunk and then another one.

762
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,010
And then so you're focusing to do that.

763
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,440
And then in diffuse mode,

764
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:24,530
you're reaching up above and making the
connection randomly when you're sleeping

765
00:52:25,021 --> 00:52:29,100
out for a walk, taking a shower,
all these kinds of things. So, uh,

766
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:30,720
so they all are related.

767
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:36,000
But actually that's great advice if
you try and learn it all at once,

768
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:37,440
it's so overwhelming.

769
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:40,380
It's like you're a little prefrontal
cortex is scrambling madly,

770
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:41,430
but it's overwhelmed.

771
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:45,390
So you want to just get a piece of it
so you can draw that up as a ribbon.

772
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:47,370
Very good question.

773
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,260
A chunk requires understanding. So when
there was a chunk where there is a,

774
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,750
that means that there was an experience
of understanding that led to that.

775
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:01,130
Not necessarily you can learn a word
in a language and you can not know what

776
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:04,171
that word means.

777
00:53:04,171 --> 00:53:08,220
And you can learn a lot of words in a
language but not know what that means.

778
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:12,180
So,
but if you do know what they mean,

779
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:17,100
it actually can make it easier to remember
that word and easier to chunk that

780
00:53:17,101 --> 00:53:22,101
word and easier to use those
chunks to put together sentences.

781
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,700
So,
uh,

782
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:28,910
so for the most part we always want
chunking to involve understanding as well.

783
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:35,250
But technically, no, you don't
have to have understanding.

784
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:38,780
It's just the understanding helps
to kind of knit things together, uh,

785
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,600
so that you can remember them more easily.
For example,

786
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:47,130
if I'm trying to learn the
word doc as Pato in Spanish,

787
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,260
um, Kay, if I'm just going Pato,

788
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:53,700
I'm trying to remember that word.

789
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,450
I don't have any understanding of what it
means. It's kind of harder to remember.

790
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,060
But if I know the Pato means doc,

791
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:05,390
I can say what if I'm trying to remember
read by having a little Pato that my

792
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:11,331
duck is floating in and that can help
serve as that understanding helps serve as

793
00:54:11,701 --> 00:54:15,990
a bridge to get it into my mind.
So that very,

794
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:19,950
that's a really good question because
people often think, oh, you build a chunk.

795
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:23,450
It's automatic that you understand it.
Not necessarily a,

796
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,040
but it's a very good thing
to have for the most part.

797
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,340
Okay.
I went to ask you,

798
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,250
you mentioned that people who've mastered
one area can find it easier to learn

799
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,170
another area because
they are related chunks.

800
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:41,510
It depending on how close theory is,
if you learn Icelandic,

801
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:45,740
you're probably going to be able to
learn German more easily. But, uh, it's,

802
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,000
it may help a little bit with some of
the metacognitive skills as far as when

803
00:54:50,001 --> 00:54:53,430
you're learning Chinese,
but they're so very different that um,

804
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:58,680
it's only those metacognitive sort
of things that might help, uh,

805
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:02,840
with Martinez stole a little
bit of an aspect of fundamental,

806
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:07,790
how do you structure a language that I
think is common to all languages? Um, so,

807
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:11,690
uh,
so it depends on how close things are.

808
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:16,691
But what's I think is fascinating
is that you never know.

809
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:23,030
That's why it's so important to have
people coming from one field to a very

810
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:25,040
different field. Right? You,

811
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,280
you're a deep sea diver and you go into
nursing and you actually can bring so

812
00:55:31,011 --> 00:55:36,011
really good ideas and the best ideas are
often developed by two different types

813
00:55:36,411 --> 00:55:39,620
of people.
One is someone who's very young,

814
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,250
so they haven't been sort of
indoctrinated into this is how you think.

815
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,130
But the other is outsiders,

816
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:51,190
people who are trained in a different
discipline who come and take an initial

817
00:55:51,861 --> 00:55:54,590
look and have fresh eyes
at what they're seeing.

818
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,620
So good questions.
Thanks.

819
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:00,730
Maybe a more practical thing,
I'm curious about your opinion.

820
00:56:00,731 --> 00:56:04,780
If you're familiar with that, with a,
the effort everyday math curriculum,

821
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:08,020
which a lot of schools are teaching
now, which, uh, for example,

822
00:56:08,021 --> 00:56:11,290
my kids take and uh, it, for
example, when they teach math,

823
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:13,960
they emphasize getting a sort of,

824
00:56:13,961 --> 00:56:17,440
almost like a number theory feel like
they learn like four different ways to

825
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:21,220
multiply instead of one, you know,
the way we learned it. So for example,

826
00:56:21,221 --> 00:56:24,760
with my kids,
they're incredibly by this,

827
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,340
I'm just wondering if you're familiar
with it. If you have a, you know,

828
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:31,510
how does it fit into this? And like
if you think that's it have opinions.

829
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,490
It's, it's different in
different parts of the country.

830
00:56:35,491 --> 00:56:38,730
And so I'm out in Michigan,
we have different techniques.

831
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,230
It depends,
I think it depends on the kids.

832
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:48,650
For some kids it's great to learn all
these different techniques for other kids,

833
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,090
you know,

834
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:55,090
just get one method down really well
and then you can climb up from there.

835
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:02,030
My own personal opinion is one of the
best math supplement programs is simply

836
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:08,560
Kumon mathematics. And I'm
not a paid spokesperson for
coming in mathematics. So,

837
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,320
but what they,
um,

838
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:15,150
what they do is they have simple
methods of practice and repetition.

839
00:57:15,151 --> 00:57:20,151
They help build mastery in your learning
of mathematics and they don't give you

840
00:57:21,511 --> 00:57:25,100
a bunch of different methods. They just
make sure you know how to multiply,

841
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,360
you know,
how to divide and uh,

842
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:31,230
and you really know
how to do these things.

843
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:36,620
So I guess my godsons and I haven't
really encountered that question before,

844
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:41,901
is I think I prefer to see someone
really learn it well using one technique.

845
00:57:42,121 --> 00:57:45,390
When you're older you can see other ways,

846
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,460
but if you've got that
one way really good,

847
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,240
you got it and you can move up. Uh,
but if you're learning too many,

848
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:55,620
it can be quite confusing.

849
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,440
I suppose it would be the equivalent
of your growing up morning,

850
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:04,260
eight languages at once. You
know, some kids can handle it,

851
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,820
but for one kid said,

852
00:58:05,821 --> 00:58:10,680
might be a little bit confusing to
have too much going on at one time,

853
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,950
especially about one thing.
Okay.

854
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:17,760
Have a question around reading,
um, and not like math or something.

855
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:22,320
But if I'm reading say a philosophy
book by Nietzsche Heidegger for example,

856
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:27,321
which is 400 pages long and I'm a slow
reader and I'm assuming I'm a very

857
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:32,550
focused reader because I do grasp and
retain what I have read pretty well,

858
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,200
but I'm incredibly slow.

859
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:39,680
So do you have any methods to figure out
how to be a fast reader but at the same

860
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,190
day and be able to retain and
deeply grasp what I'm reading?

861
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:46,960
Um,
the short answer is no.

862
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:53,280
Research has lately shown that our
techniques for speed reading or actually

863
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,810
they're a little bit,

864
00:58:56,110 --> 00:59:00,880
it seems somewhat spurious or
to read anything difficult,

865
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:04,450
more deeply simply takes time.
My,

866
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,640
I always think in the back of my mind,
stem disciplines, science, technology,

867
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:13,240
engineering, math is, is really
difficult for a lot of people.

868
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:18,241
But then there's philosophy that's I
think one of the hardest things in general

869
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:23,780
for people to really,
it's incredibly important,

870
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:24,950
but it's difficult.

871
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:29,420
And I think just having a
little understanding and
compassion for yourself that

872
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:34,070
you're actually tackling among
humankind's most difficult topics.

873
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,510
And if it's slow,
uh,

874
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,470
well you're doing fantastic.

875
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:42,830
Cause I would be the same way and I
think a lot of people are really the same

876
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:43,250
way.

877
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:47,750
There's some probably super fast Maserati
brain thinkers who could buzz right

878
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,840
through that stuff, but they would
miss things that you would see.

879
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:55,630
I've been wondering how your techniques
actually apply more generally to kits

880
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:58,860
and you briefly touched
actually on a previous question,
practice and repetition,

881
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:01,360
practice and repetition,
but more concretely,

882
01:00:01,361 --> 01:00:04,870
how do you get actually kids interested
in mathematics so that they keep on

883
01:00:04,871 --> 01:00:05,704
practicing?

884
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:10,950
The way that we've been teaching kids is
it's like let's get them introduced to

885
01:00:11,081 --> 01:00:12,160
the fun stuff.

886
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,760
We're going to have them hands on and
we're going to have him dropping eggs and

887
01:00:15,761 --> 01:00:19,690
doing all this exciting stuff and then
they get to college and they hit calculus

888
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,660
and it's like the death march,
right?

889
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:26,390
They start dropping like flies
because they're not used to that.

890
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:28,360
Everything's always been fun,
right?

891
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,710
So we don't do that when we're
teaching things like music.

892
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,890
We don't do that when we're
teaching foreign languages,

893
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:41,220
but students fall in love with those
subjects because they can gain the

894
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:46,261
expertise in part through some drudging
through practice and repetition.

895
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,840
So I think part of the reason that we
have so many kids in this country fall off

896
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:57,040
the bandwagon is we try to make
everything really exciting and really fun.

897
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:02,310
And we forget the lessons that language
learners and musicians and sports people

898
01:01:03,131 --> 01:01:07,030
in sports dance instructors,
they'll know their practice.

899
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,030
And repetition is part
of gaining expertise.

900
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,950
And when we get that incorporated
back into the curriculum, it's there,

901
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:19,480
but it's not nearly as sound as
it is in many other countries,

902
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:24,720
which is why I think we see so many
people coming to this country with a love

903
01:01:25,211 --> 01:01:30,211
and a mastery of learning in science
and in mathematics that is not growing

904
01:01:31,931 --> 01:01:36,931
organically because we're not introducing
kids in the United States to some of

905
01:01:37,421 --> 01:01:42,010
these ideas of the, also the supplemental
importance of practice and repetition.

906
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:46,330
Um, so those are my thoughts.
We do do a little bit of it,

907
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,840
but really not enough
because for a long time,

908
01:01:49,841 --> 01:01:54,120
sadly there's been this feeling that
too much practice and repetition of

909
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:57,880
mathematics will kill your
creativity instead of the reality,

910
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:02,881
which is every great expert has to
have practice and repetition with what

911
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:08,080
they're learning. So, uh, so
those are my thoughts on that.

912
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,503
Thank you.

913
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:15,180
So understanding is important
and conduct is important.

914
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,420
And speaking of that,
uh,

915
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:22,050
so is there a could be like top down
approach and [inaudible] approach.

916
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:24,900
Uh,
so what do you think is better?

917
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:29,930
Is it better to understand the big picture
and then try to like study subject or

918
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:36,471
it's better to like study this small
chunks and build this understanding like

919
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,830
from,
or maybe we have to mix it.

920
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,610
You've got it exactly right.

921
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,870
You don't want to be just doing small
things all the time and you don't want to

922
01:02:47,871 --> 01:02:51,830
be perched overhead all the time.
You want to be, it's hard to get.

923
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:53,570
What is the big picture when you're,

924
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:56,750
you learn one little chunk and
you learn another little chunk,

925
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,200
but you want to start piecing that into
the big picture as much as you can and,

926
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,990
and so, so you want to be
kind of going back and forth.

927
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,160
One of the techniques that I didn't talk
about that's very important is that of

928
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:14,510
interleaving. And a lot of times
when you're learning, for example,

929
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:19,760
um, some new technique and
capitalists, you'll do 10 problems,

930
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,710
uh, uh, pretty much the same, uh,

931
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:26,570
in learning that
technique and in Calculus.

932
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,150
But you don't want to do that.

933
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,850
You want to do one or two
problems using that technique,

934
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:36,410
flip to another section of the book.
Do that problem kind of compare,

935
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:40,340
wait a minute, why am I using this
technique here and that technique here?

936
01:03:40,341 --> 01:03:45,150
Why are those different?
Flip back, do another one of
the first technique is look,

937
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,990
do a different,
we're not training people,

938
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:52,700
we don't even have our books set up to
interleave and we need to start doing

939
01:03:52,701 --> 01:03:57,500
that because that's what actually it's
practicing repetition but mixed with

940
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:00,200
interleaving the bills,
flexibility.

941
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,740
So those are my thoughts on that.
Good question.

942
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:07,730
Like when I was in high school and college
and taking math, I was perfectly fine.

943
01:04:07,731 --> 01:04:09,890
Like, you know, I did well
and did well on the test,

944
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:13,250
but my problem was always trying to
apply it outside that environment,

945
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,700
like trying to use it practically or in
everyday life or whatever it was that I

946
01:04:16,701 --> 01:04:19,850
needed certain math skills for.
I just could never do it.

947
01:04:19,851 --> 01:04:24,800
And I was wondering if you had any sort
of technique or strategy or ideas about

948
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:29,890
how there's a way to take math from the
school and sort of be able to apply it

949
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,980
in regular life or just outside of school?

950
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:39,000
So that's a very good question.
One of the,

951
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,160
what are the things that
people do when they're there?

952
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:46,620
They look at math and they say, how
am I ever gonna use this? In fact,

953
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:51,010
I remember one was called
into the principal's office
in eighth grade. And uh,

954
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:54,480
because I wasn't doing my math,
I was actually reading a book.

955
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:59,370
And so I Rehmann stay straight in with
the principals saying that there was no

956
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:03,800
real use for it. I would never use it.
And you know, and they gave up on me that,

957
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:07,740
that point. But it's kind of
like this when you're, um,

958
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:13,610
when you're at the gym and you're lifting
a specific type of weight or are you

959
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:15,030
ever going to go to the,
uh,

960
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:19,480
go into the outside world and lift
that kind of weight? Of course not.

961
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:24,840
But you're actually using muscles that
you might use related muscles when you're

962
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:30,250
lifting up, uh, uh, your luggage to
get in and put it in the airline,

963
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,390
our compartment.

964
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:37,020
So what you're doing when you're learning
something in math and science is your

965
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:40,540
developing sort of neural pathways.

966
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,210
You may not use exactly that one,

967
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:48,040
but in surprising ways they can shape
how you're thinking about things.

968
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:53,170
So an example is this, they did
a study and they found, you know,

969
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:54,690
there's some kids who,

970
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:59,750
who go through all the way through college
and you can kind of take courses that

971
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:05,560
have almost no math really involved,
you know,

972
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:07,620
math for poets or you know,

973
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,970
these kinds of courses and
you go all the way through.

974
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:15,490
But people who have this kind of
background where they've had very little

975
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:16,031
exposure,

976
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:21,031
when you control for all aspects of
what's going on that you can reasonably

977
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:26,701
control for the ones who have no real
background in math are far more likely to

978
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:32,950
default on their home mortgages.
So you don't think about that,

979
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,930
but it's actually you're able to think
more intelligently. Now what about,

980
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:43,280
um, you're really concerned
about the environment. So, uh,

981
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:47,890
so someone comes up and says, well,
we've got to have electric cars. Um,

982
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:51,840
sounds really good. Right?
But if you're trained you,

983
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:55,270
you've got some kind of background,
you could go, yeah, but wait a minute.

984
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:59,710
What about the effective batteries
on the environment? Right?

985
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,770
Do they actually make more pollution?
In fact,

986
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:07,830
does that transfer of energy create more
harm for the environment than a regular

987
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:09,610
gasoline engine?

988
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
If you're taught to think a little bit
more rationally and carefully about

989
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:16,990
things,
you can actually,

990
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:21,250
you're using those intellectual muscles
in ways that you haven't really,

991
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,430
you don't really realize how
important that actually is.

992
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,630
So w one way though,
uh,

993
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,370
just reflecting just a little
bit of a different way.

994
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:33,820
Cause your questions very deep.
When you're learning a language,

995
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,640
one of the things you do is you're,
you're learning, you're practicing AI.

996
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:43,650
It can be really tough to actually go
and meet somebody and talk with them,

997
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:45,640
right?
Who speaks that language.

998
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:51,640
But that real life experience is what
brings the language alive and what

999
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:54,340
nourishes the desire to learn it.

1000
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:57,400
So I think finding ways,

1001
01:07:57,401 --> 01:08:00,910
when you're walking around and you're
thinking about something you just learned

1002
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:01,744
mathematically,

1003
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:07,740
look around and try and bring it into
the environment you're in a and think

1004
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:12,040
about trying to think about it in those
ways. That's such a great question, uh,

1005
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,070
because it,
it helps us be aware,

1006
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:17,330
the richness of life around us.

1007
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,330
And so I think trying to
bring some of his ideas,

1008
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:24,030
you're learning into
the life around us is,

1009
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:28,010
is a brilliant thing to do
in a great attitude to have.

1010
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:31,490
So I thank you so very
much for having me here.

1011
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:35,890
Fantastic talk. Thank
you so much. Thank you.

1012
01:08:35,891 --> 01:08:40,290
[inaudible].
