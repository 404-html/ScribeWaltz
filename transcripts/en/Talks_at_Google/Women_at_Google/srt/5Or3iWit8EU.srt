1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,790
I'm excited to open up our talk today
and to introduce you to two incredible

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:13,370
leaders and let's start with this.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,990
How do real people succeed
in the real world of work?

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,650
Kind of a loaded question, but how do
they do it? What is their secret sauce?

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,030
That's the question that bestselling
author Joanna Barsh sets out to answer,

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,060
but not by talking to well established
CEOs or motivational gurus.

7
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,391
Instead,

8
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:35,960
she dives into the trenches with some
of today's brightest and boldest up and

9
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:40,640
coming leaders with 30 years over 30
years at Mckinsey and Company and three

10
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:44,060
bucks to her name.
We really have a lot to learn from Joanna.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,420
She's here to distill the stories of over
200 rising leaders from 120 companies

12
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:51,260
around the globe,

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,640
all with the aim to help millennials grow
through the challenges we face at work.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,770
We're also joined by Amy Yuri,

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,210
who was a 15 year veteran of Google and
I sell multiple leadership roles on the

16
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:03,890
advertising side of the business.

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,910
Amy currently oversee developing
video ad products for Google marketing

18
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:08,990
solutions globally.

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,730
She is also a founding member of the women
at Google Leadership Board and hosted

20
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:18,230
Joanna back in 2012 at one of the first
women at Google leadership summits.

21
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,260
Without further ado, I'm going to bring
Joanna and Amy up to the stage. Um,

22
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,600
Joanna is going to dig into some of
the key learnings from her recent book

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,330
before being joined by
Amy for a fireside chat.

24
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,540
I just ask that you make sure
you're sitting next to someone.

25
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,100
I'm as there's an activity
that will take place, um,

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,020
during Joanna's talk and it's
important that you've got a buddy. Um,

27
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,290
and without further ado,
let's give Joanna a warm welcome.

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,940
Well thank you.
And I could see the gentleman over there.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,070
You sit next to that Nice Lady, right?
Right. Uh, one and I'm, I'm here.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,010
Yeah, yeah. You're sitting by
yourself, just squeegee over,

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,720
which is a technical term for sitting
next to somebody and the two of you are

32
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:07,740
like back to back, front to back. Now
you should sit on this, sit together.

33
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:12,060
Come on it. This won't be
painful and it won't take much,

34
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,240
much time cause I've only
been given 10 to 15 minutes.

35
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,360
So I'm going to talk
like a New Yorker really,

36
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:23,361
really quickly and see if I can
get you curious about yourself,

37
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,330
about the challenges that you're
facing at work. And you know,

38
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:30,030
maybe we can have a conversation
about that very, very shortly.

39
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:34,650
So let's start with the first risk, which
is you, you're here. You took a risk,

40
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,450
today was a big day in New York and we're
proving that terrorism is nothing to

41
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,560
New Yorkers.
So we've already jumped off a cliff.

42
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,440
What does it feel like?
What about your work?

43
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,130
Think about the risks that you could be
taking at work and you may be thinking

44
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:53,370
about or avoiding.

45
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:58,371
So what risk are you taking today given
that the subways are now working again?

46
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,560
So that's no longer a risk that you
couldn't get here. Think about it. Uh,

47
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,090
during this talk,

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,960
I started out in 2015 after 30
something years as Taylor said it,

49
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:15,040
Mckinsey, to actually talk to younger
people. Why? Because, you know,

50
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,870
it's really awful talking
to CEOs who have made it.

51
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,570
They have their stories,
men and women alike,

52
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,250
and they've been media trained and so
it's very hard to actually get to know

53
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:31,930
them. Younger people don't have their
stories finished yet. It's very exciting.

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,980
Like you don't know how it's gonna
turn out after you've interviewed them.

55
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,380
So I thought it was a feminist idea.

56
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,590
I reached out to a
hundred or so companies.

57
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,860
There are about 15 startups in the group.

58
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,270
There are also individuals who
are actors, artists, scientists,

59
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,850
not your norm, lawyers, doctors,

60
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,030
not your normal big company employees.

61
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,280
Every single one of these people was
considered by the person that recommended

62
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,430
them to be high performing high potential.
So that's the base.

63
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,170
And also talked to another of
55 HR professionals about them,

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,060
which was very enjoyable. And we'll see
what came out of that and in a moment.

65
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,790
And I basically said,
what defines you?

66
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,380
Let's talk about your childhood and how
you grew up and what you think of now.

67
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:24,460
What's coming to you now. It's kind
of a deep psychological interview,

68
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,580
which worked pretty and it's got some
interesting things out about people.

69
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,840
And then I asked them about what is a
high point at work or a low point at work

70
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:35,830
in the last year. And it just
collected those and got those stories,

71
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,830
which are amazing. Oh,
ah. I also asked people,

72
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,390
what do you think about millennials?
And I got an ear full.

73
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,260
What do you think about
women? Interesting. Why did,

74
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,300
we could talk about that later.
Why asked that question?

75
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:50,140
What do you think about women?

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,310
And I meant it in a truly collegial
way and what do you think about work?

77
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,520
So we have a whole battery of what
millennials think and it is mythbusting.

78
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,810
But first the weird thing happened
that this group of people,

79
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,430
which I had not thought about,

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,500
turns out to be the most diverse group
of people ever that I think have appeared

81
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,320
in a book.
So they're from all over the world.

82
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,050
Are People working in the u s
from 80 different countries?

83
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:21,790
I'm sure in this room we have a similar
dispersion of where people come from.

84
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,200
And what experiences you've had in life
already. And that's part of diversity.

85
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,210
They also, I met, uh, married
people, single people,
single people with children,

86
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:34,780
married people with children. People
work in every function. You can imagine.

87
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:39,490
People who didn't go to college, people
went to premier colleges. You name men.

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,540
I met those people.

89
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:45,541
So that to me says we've got an
interest in pool of experiences.

90
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:50,200
What can we learn from them? Well,
here's the first thing we learn.

91
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,030
Uh, a lot of people make their living off
of talking about millennials. I do not,

92
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,430
first of all, I don't really make
a living anymore. But secondly,

93
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,150
when I talked to people,
I generally talk about leadership.

94
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,990
So you probably recognize these words
that people talk about when they talk

95
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:13,070
about millennials. Uh, my favorite
being the trophy hunter. Uh,

96
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:17,750
but as one millennial told me,
hmm, let's just think about lazy.

97
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm sure in the baby boomer generation,
there are plenty of lazy people as well.

98
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,450
So before we cast a dispersion
on millennials, let's
look at every generation.

99
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,010
So I did, and this is what
I learned as well about uh,

100
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:32,930
older people,
myself included.

101
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,200
And you know I like the slow because I
am a little bit slower these days at 64.

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,300
But nonetheless,
this is complete bullshit.

103
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,230
So you already knew that I haven't
touched you anything new yet,

104
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:49,850
so I'm going to keep going. This
is what they told me. To me,

105
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,010
if you think about your life in
these terms, it's pretty scary,

106
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:55,610
right?

107
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,610
You're at a place and you've just made
a mistake and you know that mistakes are

108
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:05,090
not an option here or that
you wake up every day and say,

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,980
I don't even know I'm working here
because work has no passion for me.

110
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:12,830
And everybody says I should have passion.
What about pressure?

111
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,810
You all have deadlines. Pressure is
the kind of thing that destroys health.

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,530
It boils over and then you
lose sight of what it is.

113
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:22,610
It's really important to you.

114
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,870
What if you are working with bullies
and Villian villains, and I have,

115
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:30,110
I wrote tough characters, but come on
for the record. We know who they are,

116
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:32,150
they're assholes.
What are you working for them?

117
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,980
What if everybody says you have to have
a sponsor and you know in your heart

118
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:41,060
there is no sponsor and and the people
around you and you don't know how to get

119
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,360
one. You're not even sure you want
one. You just got a bad review,

120
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,900
literally whack you over the head and
then the person giving you the reus says,

121
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,540
well what do you, what do you
think about that? It's like, what?

122
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,060
What do I think about that? Then you're
given an assignment, you're a superhero,

123
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,690
you feel really good about yourself and
it turns out it's mission impossible and

124
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:01,340
nobody's ever succeeded doing that before.

125
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,880
But you've got the job and
my favorite of all favorites,

126
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,260
you wake up and everything sucks.
What does everything sucks.

127
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,870
That's a military term by the way.
It comes from the army.

128
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,820
What this means is that
your job is going badly.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,760
Your relationship just exploded.

130
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,380
You have been gaining weight at a
steady pace as your badly eating's since

131
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:28,880
you're not sleeping enough and then
finally even your mother calls you up to

132
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:33,110
yell at you, right? So everything
sucks. In that scenario.

133
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,070
And then the final chapter
of this book is worth work.

134
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:41,810
Just as if you have passion but not
for this work doesn't feel worth it.

135
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:45,650
What do you do? Do you go or do you
stay? Do you wait it out or not?

136
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,340
So those are all the challenges
that are in this book.

137
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,520
And every story in this book is if
you would instant experience for you.

138
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,010
So you don't need to be 64 years old and
thinking about your whole life deeply

139
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,610
as the other training that I do for
Google. You can just read the story.

140
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,900
So I give you the story of Greg.
Let's meet Greg. He's a sports writer.

141
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,120
He has a dream job writing
for a famous magazine.

142
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,520
He's what a he. He likes to
call a bro. So Greg's Bro,

143
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,540
very bright one, and Lo and
behold, six months into his job,

144
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:29,541
his father is hospitalized with a
failing heart and probably will die.

145
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,640
So Greg quits his job.
Doesn't mean, think about it.

146
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:37,020
He moves into the hospital to help
his father run his finance business.

147
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,000
The father needs a heart,

148
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,680
but he is not very high up on the
donor list and time is running out.

149
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,530
So what does Greg do?
Greg says,

150
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:51,531
I'm going to find out about donations
and see if I can solve this issue.

151
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,430
And that's what he did.

152
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,490
He got into it and then he realizes the
entire industry of donations is an old

153
00:09:58,621 --> 00:09:59,370
boys' club.

154
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,600
None of the CEOs of any
of these businesses want
anything to do with Greg was a

155
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,250
26 year old guy.

156
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:09,990
He says he looks like he's 12 so
he doesn't have a lot of Gravitas.

157
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,560
Um,
but he comes out of this situation.

158
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,900
There is good news here and
I'll get to it in a minute.

159
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,640
He comes out of this situation,
able to change his job,

160
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,540
help his father and start a new business,
which we'll talk about.

161
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,660
But before I get to the
punchline of that story,

162
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,260
one of the tools that
comes out of this chapter,

163
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,270
which is bringing others on board is
something that I learned from Greg.

164
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,910
And so I want to, I want to
test it out on you. Is it?

165
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,090
Are you okay being Guinea pigs for
like the next two minutes? Okay.

166
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,410
The guy in the back says fine,
so the rest of you please come along.

167
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,350
Here's what we're going to do.

168
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,770
Pair up and if you're a trio then one
of you can be the observer and just sort

169
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:58,500
of Doctor Freud like just sit there
like this. During the next two minutes,

170
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,720
one of you will be a speaker, one of
you will be a listener and if again,

171
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:04,530
as I said,

172
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,070
you don't want to do this exercise
listening to somebody who's doing it,

173
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,270
you'll learn a lot speakers,
you know who you are.

174
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,580
You are the one who's willing to talk
to the guy or lady next to you about

175
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,400
something that seriously
is important to you.

176
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,770
It probably is bothering you right now,

177
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,470
so you're going to get two
minutes of free coaching listener.

178
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,570
There is only one thing you have
to do, which is listen. Okay,

179
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,960
that's it. Everybody ready
you? You got your pears go.

180
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,270
I should hear noise now.

181
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,343
It

182
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,370
sure.

183
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,293
Okay.

184
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,930
Who amongst the listeners
said something spoke,

185
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,670
said anything like,
ah yeah that happened to me or yeah.

186
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,180
How did it feel to listen without
saying anything to anybody?

187
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:14,920
Succeed. Succeed in the, in the two
minutes she did. So what did it feel like?

188
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,263
Just shout it out.

189
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,610
It feels like
relating to their advice.

190
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,700
It's hard not to say something.
That's interesting.

191
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,980
Did anybody who was among the speakers,
did you find,

192
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,480
what did you, what did you find speaking
for two minutes, having the floor.

193
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,080
Does anybody have the floor for
the whole two minutes? Yeah.

194
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,100
What did it feel like? Weird. I love that.

195
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,180
Weird. It felt weird. What was weird
about it? There was no response. Yeah.

196
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,350
Yeah. It's like, it's very
hard to talk for two minutes,

197
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,350
but did anybody have a
different experience too?

198
00:12:56,351 --> 00:13:01,300
You got to talk for two minutes
and I have a lot to say. Yes.

199
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,403
Yeah.

200
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Isn't it wonderful that somebody is
listening for do friggin minutes?

201
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,730
You felt the same way

202
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,290
and have somebody hear you and see you?

203
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,930
So I have done this experiment,
uh,

204
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,220
last week in Dubai and I found that
half the room thought it was weird and

205
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:29,050
really hard to fill two minutes and
the other half thought it was like 10

206
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:33,460
seconds. It just flew by. So
there's a right answer here,

207
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,820
but the act of listening is the most
powerful leadership skill you can develop.

208
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:45,220
So if you have a team and you
truly can listen with your heart,

209
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,460
not from our normal stance of listening,

210
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,520
which is I wonder if that
person's right or wrong.

211
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,220
I wonder if I'm learning
something I didn't already know.

212
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,760
What I'm going to say to that
person is where you stop listening.

213
00:13:57,761 --> 00:14:01,570
The minute you use the voice in your
head starts, you are no longer listening.

214
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,650
Even if you think you are.

215
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,720
So learning to just
listen from their stance,

216
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,620
not from yours is a huge skill.
So that's,

217
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,790
that's the tool. What,
what happens to Greg? Well,

218
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,550
you notice the Greg is
no longer a sportswriter.

219
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,030
He is now a founder
and CEO of a nonprofit,

220
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,040
which is called organize of
course, right? Organs donating,

221
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,300
organize.
There you go.

222
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,870
And it turns out as Greg's dad was on
the way to the hospital with his wife to

223
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:39,790
have an end of life counseling session,

224
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,780
a 26 year old in Massachusetts,

225
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,170
died in a car accident
or a motorcycle accident.

226
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,640
And while he was HPV positive, his
heart was in good shape. And therefore,

227
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,540
uh, Greg's father was the next
person on the list at this hospital,

228
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,890
got the heart and survived,
which is pretty amazing.

229
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,510
But that's actually not the story.

230
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,170
The story is that Greg learned as he
started up organize to listen and stop

231
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,340
selling his ideas.

232
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,770
And he shifted from telling
people to asking people.

233
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,300
And that made all the difference
to the donors that came on board.

234
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,540
What he learned is that if you actually
engage people with the problem,

235
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,860
I have this really hard problem I'm
trying to solve. Can you help me?

236
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:39,370
People's brains get engaged so fast they
can't stop thinking about your problem.

237
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,700
And now they're on board and it
turns out the money is the easy part.

238
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,610
So that is what Greg learned.

239
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:51,611
And he managed to bring a guy named Al
Roth onboard who won a Nobel prize for a

240
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:57,350
designing markets. He teach, he was
teaching at the time at Harvard.

241
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,290
He's now somewhere else. I don't,
I haven't tracked him down,

242
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,280
but this is a very cool story to bring
someone like that on board to a startup.

243
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:07,400
So Greg learned that,
that lesson.

244
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,550
So now you've got listing
and you've got to asking,

245
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:15,020
but what else could you do if bringing
people on board is your challenge of the

246
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:19,010
day.
Start with your intention started.

247
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,820
You go into a meeting or you go
talk to members of your team.

248
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,470
What is it you really want to create?
If you have that squared away,

249
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,620
then everything will
fit into that framework.

250
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,800
It's most of us don't start with that.
Most of us just start with,

251
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,900
I'm just here and let's see what happens.
Stand in the other person's shoes,

252
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:43,010
which you know how to do.
The hard part is to to let go of judgment.

253
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,150
We always stand in their shoes and then
we judge them because we're human beings.

254
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,050
Everybody does that.

255
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,060
But if you can learn to stop judging
and get curious about that person,

256
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,410
you will actually create a
connection that is very strong. You,

257
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,260
you don't have to love them,
you just have to try to understand them,

258
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,690
listen from their center,

259
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,770
not your own center and
ask really good questions.

260
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,690
A good question is a question
that doesn't just have a yes,

261
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:12,524
no answer.

262
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,040
Free often does not start with the
word why and opens up possibilities for

263
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:20,984
solutions.

264
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,650
So what are you trying to create is a
great question to somebody who you might

265
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,860
be having a conflict with. Tell me more
about what you're trying to create.

266
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,590
Be present, not dominant. What does that
mean? Well we know a dominant means.

267
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:39,770
It means like I am the smartest person
in the room so I'm just going to keep

268
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:43,760
talking and being present means I'm
alert and focus and here with you,

269
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,020
which is better if you want to
connect to people, it's pretty clear.

270
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,350
Being present is going to get you a lot
more connections then big dominant and

271
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,860
the final to do is to
use silence as a tool.

272
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,450
Silence is really uncomfortable.

273
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,960
It is also weird and all of us fill it.

274
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,440
If you learn to not fill it,

275
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,240
the good thing is somebody on your team
will fill it and they might tell you

276
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:20,300
something you didn't know or
have a really, really good idea.

277
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,000
So practice silence.

278
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,090
And if someones asks you a
question in a big meeting,

279
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,960
you silence it will cause everybody
to listen harder if you use it.

280
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,780
So those are my thoughts. We, I was
told it's t did we do 10 minutes?

281
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,610
Come on up Amy, because at this point
I am becoming dominant, not present.

282
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:44,444
So

283
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,570
I give it to you please.
Uh, everybody gives Joanna.

284
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,970
Oh actually I want to go one more

285
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,420
Diogo you'll help me one more.

286
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,540
So this is the big,

287
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,170
so what Amy went through training
and centered leadership. Uh, with me,

288
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:01,891
I was really,

289
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:06,270
really honored to have people from Google
as part of our training when I was at

290
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,140
a Mckinsey and shaping it.
This is the big, so what?

291
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,300
You're an iceberg.

292
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,010
We all see what you say and what you do,

293
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,200
what you don't say, what you don't do.
That's what we see. That's all we see.

294
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,040
And that's what we judge.
And you are so much more than that.

295
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,200
Underneath that is everything
you're thinking and feeling
and you're never going

296
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:36,120
to disclose.
And underneath that is your really,

297
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,130
uh, thinking about what matters to you,
what you believe, what your values are.

298
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:45,210
Sometimes you don't even know what's,
that's what's driving your behavior.

299
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,050
And underneath that is your human needs.

300
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,300
Often people talk about it as fear,
but actually it's what is your deepest,

301
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:56,460
deepest need as a human being.

302
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,560
And that is what drives all of the
behavior, everything that's down there.

303
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,920
So you start to think of yourself
in that way without judgment,

304
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,000
you're going to learn a lot. And as you
read through other people's stories,

305
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,780
you can put yourself in them
and accelerate your own growth.

306
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,110
That's what I had to say.
Thank you.

307
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,550
Yeah, no. Um, it's, it's an honor
to have you back at Google and, uh,

308
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,630
and yes,

309
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:26,631
I do remember many of these exercises as
part of the central leadership program.

310
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,133
Um,

311
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,370
and specifically some of
the young childhood memory,

312
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,540
um,

313
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,650
exercises where you asked us to look back
and talk about experiences that shaped

314
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:40,280
us. Um, so, uh, it's,

315
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:44,580
it's an honor to have you back and thank
you for coming off of a trip from Dubai.

316
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:49,020
Um, Joanna has been traveling
around the world talking about, uh,

317
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,530
this book and obviously centered
leadership. Um, and you mentioned,

318
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,550
uh, you know, that your first book,
uh, how remarkable women lead, um,

319
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,290
was focused on what you'd call
the more experienced works at.

320
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,860
So what drove you to say,
all right,

321
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,960
maybe I shouldn't gain new perspective.
What,

322
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,490
what created that sense of curiosity
for you? Show it and action

323
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,550
started with this young ladies in
the room, um, in the front row.

324
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,380
Who doesn't work at Google? Well, my, um,

325
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,100
she said, I think your
a book is boring. Um,

326
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,720
and she was my, she's my daughter. She's
allowed to say that. And so it's actually,

327
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,210
it's really okay. And W I asked her what
she meant and she said, they're so old,

328
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,050
the, these leaders, I can't be them,
I'm not even sure I want to be them.

329
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,230
And so how do I get there from
here is, is a mystery to me. Uh,

330
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,740
and I began to think about, well,
what about people under the age of 40,

331
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,560
what w w what is happening to them?

332
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,920
And is it different today than
it was 40 years ago? I mean,

333
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:58,390
some of the people I interviewed were 80,
and you know,

334
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,900
I was like on the edge of my seat to
make sure they made it through the

335
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:07,220
interview.
They were amazing people,

336
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,510
but they lived in a different
environment and a different situation.

337
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,260
And today, uh, I'm impressed.

338
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,390
I'm in awe of millennials.

339
00:22:17,391 --> 00:22:22,240
So I thought it would be really cool
as I was retiring from Mckinsey, uh,

340
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,390
to hang out with a bunch of people who
actually had a lot of hope for life.

341
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,900
And was it, it was, it wasn't.
I'm still interviewing people,

342
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:32,930
so if anybody wants to be interviewed,
just let me know. In fact,

343
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:34,280
somebody in this room was interviewed,

344
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:37,250
but I'm not going to tell you who it
is because everybody's confidential.

345
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,220
Um,
so what did you,

346
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:46,310
what was the epiphany for you in terms
of what red would resonate in the way

347
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:51,750
that it changed the way you wrote this
book? I, I've obviously read both and,

348
00:22:51,751 --> 00:22:52,501
and the style,

349
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:56,850
how remarkable women lead versus
the story is a little bit different.

350
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,650
Can you talk about what changed that?

351
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:03,800
So a one interviewee said,
I'm through with school,

352
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,240
I just don't need to be taught anymore.
And adults learn by doing.

353
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,740
And uh, the adults that I'm trying
to reach for everybody in this room,

354
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,490
you don't have that much experience.
You might have six years,

355
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:20,480
10 years of experience and a jor
experience has really important.

356
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,490
But wouldn't it be really cool to have
like infinite experience of all these

357
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:28,670
other people who face the
challenge that you're now facing,

358
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,860
but they did it differently than you.

359
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,930
So at least they'll give you
something to think about.

360
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,280
So that's what I wanted to do. I want
it to collect the tapestry of stories.

361
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,030
Now the Internet is full of people with
stories and I started to look at them

362
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:44,690
and they're fake.
It's like Susan had an issue.

363
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,170
And then it gives you like one paragraph
and then in the second paragraph she

364
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:50,750
solves the issue and gets promoted.

365
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,680
So or she doesn't solve the issue.
And then the author says,

366
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,330
[inaudible] it had Susan only
asked a question she would have,

367
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:02,000
you know,
whatever gotten the brass ring.

368
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,460
So I wanted to write stories
that you would go like,

369
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:07,700
what's really going to happen?
And the answer is I don't know,

370
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,330
because they haven't lived their whole
life yet. Will that person becomes famous?

371
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,900
I don't know. But there, to me,
they became very, very interesting.

372
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,320
The second thing I wanted
to do is make it real.

373
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,640
And you could argue with me that it's
not real enough for you and that may

374
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,300
indeed be the truth. But I
didn't want to sort of say, Amy,

375
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,650
just I want to leave you with thinking
about why you're so uncomfortable about

376
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,990
that question. Instead say, Amy,

377
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,580
why don't you go meet that person over
there and have a discussion about what

378
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:38,450
gets them excited?

379
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,280
That's something you could actually
do as opposed to go home and go,

380
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,380
what did she say? So that, that
was my goal. You, you did a, um,

381
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,770
something at the end of every chapter
as well to try to give kind of a toolkit

382
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,030
for folks to think about how
to solve the challenge. Um,

383
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,380
how did you think about creating the
different solutions that you did and,

384
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,800
and is there any order in which
you could go through and, uh,

385
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,120
solving these, these work
challenges? And, you know,

386
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:10,100
every buddies challenge is different.

387
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,510
And I became quite humble.
I don't,

388
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,570
could only put in the original book had
it was like 400 pages and it had 120

389
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:22,340
stories in it. And now it's 75 stories
and you may still find it too long.

390
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,360
But nonetheless, I went through
all the stories, bottoms up,

391
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,590
kind of like a Google data
mining exercise. So though
I was an English major,

392
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,330
I apologize. And uh, and I, uh,
found what these people did.

393
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,630
And then through my own experience of
centered leadership and being at Mckinsey

394
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:42,350
and Bain consultant and on and on,
I put them into a structure,

395
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,240
which is first one, a CEO once said
to me, just tell me what to do first,

396
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:49,700
second,
third in that order.

397
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:54,910
So I tried to order the actions at the
end of each chapter based on if you don't

398
00:25:55,191 --> 00:25:58,340
know where you are, start at the
top and have you already done that.

399
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:01,820
Go to the place where it's
now news for you. Great.

400
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,620
Um, I know that I am managing people.
People always say, well, okay,

401
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:08,300
well where do I start?
How do I do this?

402
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:10,970
So I appreciate you giving
that specific advice. Um,

403
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,350
I love that the titles of the
challenges, um, and you know,

404
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:18,920
you went through all of
them upfront. Uh, you know,

405
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:23,060
some of them definitely probably
hit closer to home for Googlers. Um,

406
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,110
including, uh, the, what do
you do after a poor review?

407
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:29,480
Because we just had our,
uh, peripheral view cycle,

408
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:33,470
so everybody's just got their annual
feedback and might still be digesting and

409
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:37,850
thinking, okay, not what it,
what do I do next? Um, uh,

410
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,170
I also love, uh, you know, the, the,

411
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,320
some of the titles including when you
have to be a superhero because you know,

412
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,340
working for a company like Google, I
know people feel like, you know, the,

413
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,720
the bar keeps moving higher and
the task keeps getting bigger.

414
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:59,160
And to your point, I have to
solve a problem that nobody's
ever solved before. Um,

415
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,490
uh, I personally love when a risk taking
feels like jumping off a cliff. Um,

416
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:07,770
and for some of us we either enjoy
jumping off cliffs where or are afraid of

417
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:10,800
heights. Um, what is your
favorite challenge in the book?

418
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,910
When I woke up this morning,
I,

419
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,860
for some reason I was thinking because
of that jump off the cliff of cliff

420
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:21,330
divers, which I woke up with
like, oh, a semi heart attack.

421
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,040
I don't want to do that.

422
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,430
So my favorite chapters to actually win
everything socks because the came from a

423
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:32,640
military story of a woman who
had been to Afghanistan. And uh,

424
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,330
she taught me some things that I
had really never thought about it.

425
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:38,880
I don't know if anybody has
military experience in the room,

426
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,360
but it's completely different
than anything in life.

427
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:46,140
So I put her in the book for
that reason. Uh, ended. Um,

428
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,470
there were other people where
everything sucks. For example,

429
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:54,810
a woman who started up a really cool
business with her friends from her prior

430
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:57,400
work and uh,

431
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,450
she was kicked out by those friends and
on her own one June morning and had to

432
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:05,070
restart herself.

433
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,610
So there are all kinds of situations
where you find a man who worked in an

434
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:15,270
automotive company, uh, who, um,
his marriage started falling apart.

435
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,500
He was working on the most exciting thing,
renewable energy in cars.

436
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,250
He was totally committed to this.
And then they shut his project down,

437
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,880
which I'm sure happens at Google,
you know, once in a while.

438
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,690
And he just imploded. And
somebody said to him, he didn't.

439
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,460
One day you'll tell your grandchildren
about this project. And he was thinking,

440
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,810
I don't have a job be,
I'm not gonna have any grandchildren.

441
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:44,430
So he had to pull himself together. So
why, that's why I liked that, the chapter.

442
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,730
But what it does is it helps you prepare
for something that hopefully you'll

443
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:55,030
never be in, but I'm sure you will
cause, um, work ends up, you know,

444
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,410
after a great week, the next week,
it sucks and you didn't ask for it.

445
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,690
And the first thing you do to
prepare is, uh, to be mentally,

446
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:08,040
physically, emotionally and spiritually
resilient, which I hadn't thought about,

447
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,120
which is why the military forces
people to go through physical training.

448
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,360
That's awful because you develop stamina
and resistance and alertness in the

449
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,570
midst of the unexpected.

450
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,080
So resilience, curiosity, bravery.

451
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,711
What are,

452
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:33,270
what are some of these attributes that
if you look at the collection of stories

453
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,720
and the people that you've seen,
obviously their stories are not complete,

454
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,880
but what are some of the
attributes that you've seen, um,

455
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,990
are common amongst those that have learned
how to overcome challenges and even

456
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:50,170
reframe challenges as
opportunities? The, so people, uh,

457
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,630
you know, we, you remember that
first slide was stereotypes.

458
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:56,740
People think of millennials is waiting
for someone to hand them the answer.

459
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,390
And I didn't find that at all.

460
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,630
I found the strongest element
to be curiosity and bravery.

461
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,130
So a challenge is something you
really don't want to face, uh,

462
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,510
because you know, it's not going to be
fun and it might actually be painful.

463
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:14,710
Um,

464
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,710
and yet the people who faced
these challenges did so
because they were driven by

465
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:24,640
a desire to grow. Uh, and some
of them were driven by fear.

466
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,840
So a fear that if they didn't grow,
they would fall behind.

467
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:31,870
And in this generation,
if there's one theme that I didn't know,

468
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:35,330
I would find it is that, uh, you're, you,

469
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:39,950
you are growing up with uncertainty.
Um, and when I grew up, uh,

470
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,470
in, in the 50s, it was like
fake on Sir. Fakes are empty,

471
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:46,030
but it was certain,
you know,

472
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:49,660
you lived in a house and your dad came
home at night and you never saw him,

473
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:53,020
but you knew he was working and
everything was cool and you played.

474
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,770
And that was your job just to
play every day. Whereas today,

475
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,360
I think people from the Internet,
from being global citizens of the world,

476
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,820
from having, you know, parents
who've lost their jobs, you,

477
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,290
you grew up with uncertainty.

478
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:11,291
And that means that you gotta be growing
wherever you work because you're in

479
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,440
charge of you.
You already know that.

480
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,900
Now it's up to older people who manage
you to realize that that's what's driving

481
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:22,960
you.
And once you're an owner of your future,

482
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,130
then you basically measure
everything in terms of am I growing?

483
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,870
And challenges are the best way to grow.
So the people in this book,

484
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:36,040
they didn't all succeed, but they
all sort of took the challenge on,

485
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:43,360
um, in, uh, in looking at the,

486
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:48,160
at the stories of people, um, and
those that are continuously growing.

487
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:52,600
Did you find any differences in terms
of the stories from men or women?

488
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,580
So I counter programmed the
book, uh, because there, um,

489
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,830
there was no theme that I found,
maybe you could prove me wrong,

490
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:08,020
uh, but, uh, men told me that women
were more aggressive, more driven,

491
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,580
more goal driven.
Uh,

492
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:14,581
we're really kicking ass and women
told me that men were more courageous,

493
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,810
willing to take a chance and
kicking ass. So, you know, it was,

494
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,010
and there are all kinds of people in the
book. So I put in men who were afraid,

495
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,840
men who made mistakes and
had to live through it. Uh,

496
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,230
and I put in women who are
totally, uh, you know, bold,

497
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,930
aggressive because that's what I heard.
And then I,

498
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:38,950
and then I put the opposite in as
well. So there are, for example,

499
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,640
a quiet people in the book were
very introverted and still heroes.

500
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,530
And then there are a noisy,
noisy people in the book too,

501
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:53,531
who are very outgoing and able to
lead through their social skills.

502
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,280
So I have a couple of more questions,

503
00:32:57,281 --> 00:33:01,990
but I wanna give you guys a chance
to ask Joanna some questions, uh,

504
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,630
about centered leadership, about women's
leadership, about grow or you work, uh,

505
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,540
about life challenges, uh, uh, about, uh,

506
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,510
bringing your daughter
with you along the journey.

507
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,080
And so on that I just will ask one more
question and turn it over to you guys.

508
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,850
Um, you know, what do you hope, obviously
you, you've mentioned, um, you know,

509
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:23,620
Gabby and she's part of the

510
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,940
trove, this of this in terms of the
impetus for, for writing this book. Um,

511
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,820
what beyond, um, you're on family.

512
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:35,260
What do you hope people will take
away from this book? I, I, um,

513
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,060
I'm passing the baton, so I'm,
I'm 64 years old. I worked my,

514
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:40,841
not my whole life.

515
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:45,750
I worked in the movie business and some
other things before a Mckinsey. Uh,

516
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,720
but you were the future. Uh,
millennials are our future.

517
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:54,721
So my hope is that this book accelerates
enough people to take on challenges

518
00:33:56,171 --> 00:34:00,360
and, uh, and become leaders
at very early ages. Um,

519
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,170
and maybe you already are all leaders
who are in this room or, and by leader,

520
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:07,920
I don't mean somebody who runs
like a company with a million app,

521
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,320
employees leader meaning somebody who
sees something and makes it happen because

522
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:19,090
you believe it should happen.
It should be the way reality is.

523
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,350
Um, a person with vision,
a person with a drive,

524
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,070
some kind of purpose. And if you
don't have any of that right now,

525
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:32,340
I hope this book will help you on your
journey to find it because it took me 50

526
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:39,091
years to realize that meaning is for
me the most important thing in life.

527
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,350
Uh, and it's sort of beats all else
clearly loving having friends you love,

528
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,300
having family love, um, helps you
along that journey. But I discovered,

529
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:50,763
at least for me,

530
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:55,660
that it wasn't enough that you needed
to be able to help people be part of

531
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,330
something bigger than you
and that that's what this is.

532
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,480
I want you to take action based on
the challenges that you're facing.

533
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,840
That's what I want.
I'm going to turn it over to you guys.

534
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:10,540
If you have a a couple of questions,

535
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,050
they're stupefied
God kick us off.

536
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,890
So that, yeah, in the B

537
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,090
dangerous question to take us off track a
little bit, but I, I, I'm dying to know.

538
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,250
How would you think about the challenges
that you framed in the book for

539
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:34,190
millennials compared to Gen x and,
uh,

540
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,550
does it matter if you're in
the gen x working at Google?

541
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,350
Um, what, what, what do you, how do you
see that dividing over for, you know,

542
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:48,420
just kidding. I'm worrying
about that chapter. Yeah.

543
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,973
And um,

544
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,340
there are a couple of you in the room
who may consider yourselves more gen x

545
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:54,120
then,
um,

546
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,120
millennial gen x ers told me that they
were raised to suck it up until they

547
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:05,580
reached the goal that
they wanted. That, uh,

548
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:10,581
for some reason they felt the loyalty
of the company that if they were to wait

549
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:14,580
it out and gain the skills that they
would get where they wanted to go.

550
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,620
And millennials basically said, I'm out
of time. I can't wait that long. In fact,

551
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,200
maybe I can wait a year.
So that's the, to me,

552
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:25,790
that was the fundamental difference
between the two. If you, you know, and an,

553
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:29,940
and as Sheryl Sandberg Admonish
me, uh, just a few weeks ago,

554
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,420
never say all because it's
not true of all people.

555
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,970
It's always true of some
people but not all people.

556
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,960
So genexers I think can
learn a lot from millennials,

557
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:44,850
which is what are you waiting
for? Do it now as, take the risk.

558
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:48,960
Now ask the question now. And if
somebody says no, they say no,

559
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,510
you will have learned from the experience.

560
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:55,080
And I said something a few minutes
ago that a lot of the people,

561
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:59,220
the book took on challenges and quote
unquote did not succeed in the normal

562
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:00,060
scheme of things.
Right?

563
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:04,290
They didn't get the promotion or the gold
ring or whatever you were hoping they

564
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:08,040
would get, but they learned
something. So in that sense,

565
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:11,790
they succeeded through every
challenge that they met.

566
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,730
There was a story of a woman
who got a bad review. Actually.

567
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:18,660
It was a pretty good review. She worked
for a tech company, not yours. And, uh,

568
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,340
she, uh, was an African woman set
very high standards for herself.

569
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,750
And so she didn't like the review she
got and people didn't like her apparently

570
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:30,210
that was in the review
as well, that, you know,

571
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:34,260
she's pushy and she set the bar high
and she couldn't stand mediocrity.

572
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,530
Does this sound familiar? And everybody
around her was mediocre and her mind.

573
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,580
So she quit and I had the
conversation with her.

574
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:45,040
I'm sure that company was sad
that she quit, but she said, I,

575
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,250
this is not the culture
I want to be a part of.

576
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,590
I don't want to fit in and have harmony.

577
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,860
I like reaching for perfection.

578
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,550
And so the only thing
that saddened me with her,

579
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,100
and I call her EFA in the book,
If you read the book,

580
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,420
is that she was striving for perfection
because she felt she had to make it.

581
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,380
It's one thing to strive for
perfection because it motivates you.

582
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,780
It's another thing to actually think you
have to achieve perfection because that

583
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,840
ain't gonna happen. So in
that sense, if it made me sad,

584
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,070
but I kept in touch with her,

585
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,610
she ended up in a startup and
she's really happy doing, you know,

586
00:38:20,611 --> 00:38:25,140
striving for perfection and creating
software that the world needs.

587
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:30,710
So you just said the differences act
now versus a wait a little bit later and

588
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:36,610
one of the, well the first
chapter hit me personally, uh,

589
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,200
because uh,

590
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:43,210
I just lost a longtime colleague who said,
I just have,

591
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:45,890
I don't have passion in what
I'm doing here any longer. Um,

592
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,080
and you mentioned in the book
though that you say, you know,

593
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:53,620
as part of the toolkit, maybe wait a
year before you actually make a move.

594
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:58,090
So how do you think about the, there's
a lot you can do in that year. Yeah,

595
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,870
I mean so do you,

596
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,650
I mean cause you're saying millennials
want to act now and you are giving more

597
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,200
that invite advice that I would say is,
you know,

598
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,100
take a little bit of time before you
make, just make that, um, act action.

599
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,750
And that was the same advice I gave her.
I said,

600
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,540
just stick it out for
another couple of months.

601
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:16,990
Try to do this with your job
differently. Do this. And, and she just,

602
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,430
she came back to me after, uh, taking a
little short leave and just said, I can't,

603
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,720
I just, I, I, I'm no longer my heads nod.
My head and heart are no longer in this.

604
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,500
First of all, the good news is you may
have lost her, but the world didn't lose.

605
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,190
No, I know. And I'm helping. I'm helping
her find something else. So, so, so, uh,

606
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,250
let me rephrase.
Um,

607
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,720
she was probably pretty busy while those
few months were going by in which she

608
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:42,760
was meditating on her decision.

609
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,680
So let's say you're in a job you don't
want to be in, and I'm telling you, uh,

610
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,720
maybe you should wait a year
because it's a brand new job.

611
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,330
You will not have seen the whole business
cycle if you leave in three months.

612
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:55,630
Because if it's a really bad fit, you'll
know it and you should leave right away.

613
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,050
If in fact, you just uncomfortable,
you're not learning fast enough,

614
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,940
you feel sadness, then what are you do?
Well, you talked to a lot of people,

615
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,000
so you take that time to learn
as you go learn something else,

616
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,450
do something outside of work
that expands your horizons.

617
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,350
So don't wait as in, okay, I guess.

618
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:16,450
So cycle starts in five hours.

619
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:20,650
So I guess I'll just hang out here and
go there tonight and see if I can pick my

620
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:24,590
spirits up instead.
You really just network like crazy.

621
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,720
You're introverted.

622
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:30,430
Absolutely network like crazy and
go ask people what their jobs are.

623
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,490
Learn how to do to ask your boss.
I want to do more.

624
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,020
I'm bored to tears for God's sakes.

625
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:40,021
Amy gimme something else to do and Amy
will dream it up and give it to you and

626
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:44,710
you and you won't get paid more, but you
will love learn. So during that year,

627
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:49,960
be busy growing and there are very
concrete things you can do to do that.

628
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,780
I see this gentleman.
Yeah, patient as can be.

629
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,840
Thank you for coming the
bunking millennials yet again.

630
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,240
Got It. Quick question
for either one of you. Um,

631
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,350
if you guys have a story or anecdote
from kind of early on in your careers.

632
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,200
The first time that you maybe did have
this impactful leader and kind of maybe

633
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:10,380
what it looks like to you or how it
did influence your kind of career going

634
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:11,214
forward.

635
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:16,090
Take it away. Um, the question is,

636
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,210
did I have an impactful leader?

637
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,540
Yeah. Early on in your career, was
there anybody that stood out and really,

638
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:24,870
you kind of recognized, oh,
this is a, you know, um,

639
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,320
an obvious great leader and there,

640
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:28,630
or really bad and they're helping
me in this way, or, you know,

641
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,590
kind of push you to, to do something,
maybe challenge you in some way.

642
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,250
Okay. Um, so, yes, on both sides,

643
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,030
right? Um, those that were not as, um,

644
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:42,050
those that you don't admire and you
observe very carefully for all the things

645
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:46,460
that you make along mental list of the
things that you'll never do when you're a

646
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:51,270
manager. Um, and then, um,
I love, um, actually, um,

647
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,650
I lean notten is somebody that
endorsed, um, Joanna as buck.

648
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:01,090
And I lean started in the New York
office long time ago when I was here.

649
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,790
And she sat,
uh,

650
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,850
one cube away from me and became somebody
that I helped her figure out how to,

651
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:12,470
uh, navigate Google because
she'd come from timing. And, um,

652
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,250
so I helped her figure out Google. She
helped me then learn a lot about, uh,

653
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,800
leadership, women's
leadership and we became, um,

654
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,490
a longtime friends.

655
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,620
She's obviously gone on to be a
mini different roles within Google,

656
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:31,110
um, and most recently is now our
head of people operations. Um,

657
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,930
and I had the opportunity to see her
last week. Um, and one of the things,

658
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,670
uh, she, she had this,

659
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,040
did a talk on leadership a long
time ago and um, you know, she said,

660
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,380
be a snob for talent,
meaning higher are really amazing people,

661
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:49,130
people that are better from you.
That was one of the things. And, um,

662
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,750
and she also gave me a lot
of permission early on to,

663
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,670
um,
to not always be thinking about

664
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,180
vertically climbing,

665
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:03,380
but the importance of horizontal and as
Cheryl Wofford's to edge climbing the

666
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,630
jumbled jungle gym to kind of,
you know,

667
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:09,500
have lots of different experiences and
having somebody like her who had done

668
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:13,790
that in her career, she's moved and
now you see, even within Google, um,

669
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,730
to lots of different roles
and functions kind of gave me

670
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,490
permission to think about doing the same.

671
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,390
Sometimes villains can actually
teach you as much as great leaders.

672
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:25,140
So early in my career I
worked in retail and uh,

673
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,940
there was a woman who was my height,

674
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,410
which means that she was height
challenged and Mrs Wilner,

675
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:35,760
uh, and she, uh, tour people
down. She actually enjoyed it.

676
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,800
So I think she was on the spectrum of
a sociopath close to close to the edge.

677
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:45,210
And I developed, I'm a bloody nose.
I would come, uh, unpredictably,

678
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:50,390
I was running some shops in a retailer
and I did all kinds of cool things in

679
00:43:51,691 --> 00:43:55,830
those shops to get people to actually
stop and buy things. Or even just look.

680
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:00,450
So I had everything up ended and looked
all like it would fall apart in a second.

681
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,480
And she took the whole team to the
shop and in front of all the customers

682
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,610
screamed at me till I was in tears.

683
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:13,050
So that was my earliest
memory of uh, what, uh,

684
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,630
it's really like to work for a villain.
Um,

685
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,660
and so I switched retailers and I ended
up with a taller blonder version of the

686
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:26,160
same woman and worked for
her. And, uh, she, uh,

687
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,970
did similar things that taught me.
Uh,

688
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,490
essentially if the doesn't
want you to succeed,

689
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,720
there are a billion things that you have
to get right into your job and you will

690
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:39,540
get something wrong and they will find it.

691
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,280
So I learned that I couldn't be perfect.
Uh,

692
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,610
that it was really embarrassing when I
had a bloody nose in front of customers.

693
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,860
Uh, and, uh,

694
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:54,660
it gave me the impetus to go to business
school and completely changed my career.

695
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:58,830
So I went from retail to consulting
where people, only clients yelled at me,

696
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,530
Oh, got a lot better,
another improvement part.

697
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:09,030
Another important lesson that I give, uh,
and, and have tried to follow, which is,

698
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,920
you know, once you work for
a terrible boss, you kind of
say, okay, cut your losses.

699
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,780
Yeah, fine, great bosses.

700
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,380
So I opened up your book,
I'm on an airplane and I
think it was in the forward,

701
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:24,920
but I was reading that what I really
love about it is it's designed to,

702
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:27,920
you can read any chapter, you don't have
to go chapter one, two, three, four, five.

703
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,020
Um, and I think that's a
really unique approach.

704
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:32,780
And I went straight to the table of
contents and was looking at like, hmm.

705
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,320
Like what do I want to
start with your first, um,

706
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,770
wanted to ask you why you made that choice
and if that was based on some of your

707
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:42,950
interviews with people that you
met with, um, based on, you know,

708
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:46,200
what books are available
in the marketplace and how
they're structured, um,

709
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,260
or what led you to make that decision?

710
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,090
Um,
the,

711
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,970
the simple answer is I did structure
it in a way that I thought,

712
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,050
uh, people on average
would evolve. However, uh,

713
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,760
you're going to be only interested
in the challenge that you're facing.

714
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:07,690
So you should start with that challenge
and get into it and see if you can get

715
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:10,310
value from it. Um, I, uh,

716
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,890
enjoyed all the chapters and I spent
a lot of time thinking about where,

717
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,250
where they should go. So
it turns out that, uh,

718
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:20,820
there are a couple of basic
themes in the book. Uh,

719
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:25,150
one is about fear and that's,
uh, shows up in pressure,

720
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:28,950
it shows up in superheroes, uh, and uh,

721
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:32,830
it shows up and taking risk or
speaking up, daring to challenge.

722
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,770
Another one is caring,

723
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:40,240
meaning purpose that shows up in
the first and the last chapter, uh,

724
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,840
and feeling purposeful. And then
there's a third theme around people.

725
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,670
And so, uh, I put all those guys
together, bringing people on board,

726
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:49,780
even when you just like,

727
00:46:49,781 --> 00:46:53,590
wish you could just tell him what to do
and make them do it and they just won't

728
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:58,040
do it. Uh, or working with creeps or, uh,

729
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:01,000
or trying to get a sponsor. So
those, those kind of fit together.

730
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:05,470
But you're going to have the best
experience of the book if you start with

731
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,310
what's what matters to
you. Thank you. All right,

732
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,600
time for Tim or questions.

733
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,230
I know we're running a little
over for folks that have to leave.

734
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:19,610
Hi. So I guess after listening to you,
I fall in the millennial category.

735
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:24,470
I thought it was a gen x, um, that
I have noticed I'm a millennial too,

736
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:28,760
even though I'm an old one
and it's something I've
noticed in train and network

737
00:47:28,761 --> 00:47:30,910
or new conversations

738
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,910
is that often it's really hard to get
on the connecting side with people as

739
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:40,420
often. I find that because of
whatever perceptions they have,

740
00:47:40,421 --> 00:47:42,790
they want to other you instead.

741
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,560
And so I know that listening to them is
a good strategy to try and bring them

742
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:51,970
back, but it's always like, how
do you get to that listening side?

743
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:56,740
Like how you ask questions that will
help open them up or what are things that

744
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,750
you can,
strategies that you can do,

745
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:03,700
like getting to that part or in that
process to kind of maybe open them up,

746
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:08,340
maybe bring them back. That's a
really good question. So there's,

747
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,530
there's a couple of things for
you to think about. What is,

748
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:15,340
who do you admire and as you
reach out to people you admire,

749
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:20,380
actually tell them why you admire them
specifically, not generically. Uh,

750
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,850
there was a woman in the book whose
name is now escaping me, jet lag,

751
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,110
let's blame it on that or
my age. But anyway, she, uh,

752
00:48:29,111 --> 00:48:34,111
she always starts with specific praise
that is genuine and people love to hear

753
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,560
about themselves.
So if you start with that,

754
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:42,280
you've now opened them up and then ask
a question of what's important to you.

755
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:43,114
For example,

756
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,420
Amy is an extraordinary marketer and
you tell her that and then you say,

757
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:52,990
I would really like to learn more about
the skills that you developed early on.

758
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,760
Is there a way that I could,

759
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:59,200
without taking any of your time
learn from you? And she might say,

760
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:04,000
just walk with me here or just come to
this meeting with me that, so there,

761
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,920
there is that sort of, that way of
saying don't. Um, instead of saying,

762
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:12,970
will you be my mentor? Which the
only answer is no because I'm really,

763
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,810
I'm a re everybody is really busy.
But to say,

764
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,520
could I just, you know, walk
with you down in the elevator.

765
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,230
I have one question for you.

766
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,550
That's one way to do it and you've got
to have the questions that matter to you

767
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:32,230
that you think will better to that person.
The other thing that Sheryl taught me,

768
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,190
uh,

769
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:38,190
and we've interacted now since 2013
because of our shared passion for women is

770
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:44,460
a, the offer to help has to be specific.
So you might say as a younger person,

771
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:48,250
and I really want to help you and that's,
that's a burden.

772
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,030
So you think about I by helping you,

773
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,840
what I'd like to do for you is,
uh,

774
00:49:55,870 --> 00:50:00,250
look at all the research that we have
access to and then I'm going to call Carla

775
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,900
correlated for you or do something.

776
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:06,100
So the specific help that you offer,

777
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,720
then I could just say yes or no. I
could probably would say, oh my God,

778
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:13,180
you're such a doll.
Would you please do that for me?

779
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:17,530
That was how I ended up becoming
better friends with Eileen.

780
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:20,710
And the early days when she was starting
women out here in New York. And I said,

781
00:50:20,711 --> 00:50:24,160
well, let me just comment. I'll take notes
and follow through on the action items.

782
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:25,570
And she was like,
great.

783
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,370
But it was an exam very specific
with how I could help, um,

784
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,130
with something that was important to her.
But very tactical and specific.

785
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,430
So last question, or we have to, we,

786
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,320
you guys want to fire them away.

787
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:45,750
I wanted to ask about the slide where
you had perceptions of new leaders,

788
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:50,890
the to old leaders and what you think
will prevent the new leaders from ending

789
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:53,400
up like the old leaders.

790
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:58,260
Do you think that it's the company's
culture or something with millennials that

791
00:50:58,261 --> 00:51:00,600
will end up changing
things for the future?

792
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:03,780
Or will we sort of see how things
are happening from the old leader's

793
00:51:03,781 --> 00:51:05,940
perspective and say,
we've got to get in line.

794
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:11,000
So there's this psychological
research that was done on monkeys. Um,

795
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,950
and it was, I'm trying to remember,
I think Adam Grant wrote it up, uh,

796
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,650
in the book option B, but Oh,
Mckenzie uses it a lot as well.

797
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:23,270
So this is notion that there are a bunch
of monkeys. They're in a a pen and they,

798
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:28,040
there's a beautiful bunch of bananas up
these stairs and the first monkey goes

799
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,350
up to get it and he gets doused with,
you know,

800
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,820
water like really horrible hose.
He falls down.

801
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:40,010
So the second monkey goes, I can do
better. I can do this. It goes up water.

802
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:40,963
Third Monkey.

803
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,100
After a while the monkeys stop going up
the ladder to get the bananas because

804
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,750
they know what's coming.
The monkeys died sad,

805
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:53,840
but it happens. They take the monkey
out, they put a new monkey in.

806
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,800
The monkey doesn't go up the ladder,
the new monkey.

807
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:01,790
And why is that happening?
Because the older monkeys are saying,

808
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,900
you go up the ladder,
you're going to get like shot with water.

809
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:07,490
It's a horrible experience.
Don't do it.

810
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,730
Now obviously they do that and
monkey talk, but they figure out,

811
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:15,110
they literally hold that young monkey
from doing that thing. That's my fear.

812
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:20,830
My fear is that cultures tend
to show us how to be successful.

813
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:21,941
And the people,

814
00:52:21,941 --> 00:52:26,900
the young people who are the most
successful in the cultures definition will

815
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:31,490
mold to look like the leaders.
And this is one of the many,

816
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:36,050
many reasons why it's harder for women
than men because men are more capable of

817
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,840
mirroring the man at
the top that they see.

818
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:40,460
It's much harder for women to do that.

819
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:45,080
The second thing that happens
to people as you get successful,

820
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:49,540
so you're a young person
and you're getting success
in this formula that you're

821
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,880
you, that you didn't even know you have,
but it becomes a formula pretty quickly.

822
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,240
And then you just repeat it.
And as you are successful,

823
00:52:56,241 --> 00:53:00,500
your mind starts to shut down. You
like, I'm successful doing this,

824
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:03,170
this is efficient. I'm going to do it
again. I'm going to do it again and again.

825
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:06,740
Make all this money and be famous
and all those things. And um,

826
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,090
you close yourself down.

827
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,330
And so one of the things I
noticed when I interviewed older,

828
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:15,800
very successful leaders is they
weren't that curious. They had it,

829
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:20,180
they knew the story, they delivered
the story and they were done. Um,

830
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:24,860
so those are the two like giant rocks
that are threatening to crush you as you

831
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,010
go through the ladder.

832
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,400
And I think what you could
do to avoid it is one,

833
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:31,860
as a community shifts the culture,

834
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,940
which can actually be done pretty quickly.
The leaders have to want to do it,

835
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,100
they have to role model it. And the
second is to ask yourself all the time,

836
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:44,670
what can I learn here? She just
start with that. I'm successful.

837
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,900
What can I learn here?
It'll help.

838
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,720
I learned a lot. Um, I always
did from your Joanna. Okay,

839
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:58,360
I'll be here. Uh, wonderful.
Uh, thank you for joining us.

840
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:02,500
Stay curious. And, uh, we will, uh,

841
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,380
do our best to grow and continue to
grow while we work here at Google.

842
00:54:05,381 --> 00:54:06,340
So everybody thinks,

843
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:06,900
okay.
