1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,790
I have the great pleasure of introducing
a friend as well as one of the most

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,850
prominent figures in the community.
Uh,

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,120
Sujin Quan Soojin is the managing director
of the MBA admissions and the overall

4
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:19,160
program at Michigan's
Ross School of business.

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,060
She's also an adjunct lecturer in
business communications at Ross.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,260
Previous in her life, she was also
a manager at delight consulting,

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,820
an analyst with the U S Senate Budget
Committee and a presidential management

8
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:35,510
fellow with the White House Appropriations
Committee and Department of Commerce.

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,520
She holds an Mba from Ross,

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,870
a masters in public policy from Harvard's
Kennedy School of government and a Ba

11
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:44,000
in economics and political
science from Yale.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,170
She's clearly not very accomplished.
Um,

13
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,170
we're thrilled to have Sujin here
to share perspective on her career,

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,183
her path,

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,910
and then a little bit about what's
happening in the Mba world for all of you.

16
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:57,560
So Sujin welcome and thank you for coming.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,800
Thank you.
Thank you

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,460
for having me. When I'm Dong and
an angel asked me to do this,

19
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:11,120
I was thrilled then and the context they
gave me was there are a lot of Googlers

20
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:14,690
out there who are interested in thinking
about the next step in their career and

21
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:17,870
we thought it might be useful
for you to share your own path.

22
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:22,190
And so I'm going to start from way back
from when I was a child and when all of

23
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:24,770
us start to think about what do
you want to do when you grow up?

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,570
How many of you have thought about
that question since childhood? Right?

25
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,690
So when I was really young,
before I went to grade school,

26
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:36,650
I thought I would it be a cashier because
I thought you got to take home all the

27
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:38,300
money that you collected
at the end of the day.

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,730
And then I got a little bit older,

29
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:45,260
I got a little bit wiser and I saw
my parents working really hard.

30
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,240
My parents are immigrants from Korea
and my dad was an engineer and my mom

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,910
worked at nights fixing phones.
Um,

32
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:56,030
so she could be home while
we were home from school.

33
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,810
And they were constantly working and
taking care of us around the clock.

34
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:04,700
And I thought, wow, that is hard. All
I want to do when I grow up is retire.

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,670
My parents said, no,
you've got to first work.

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,470
So then as I went through
grade school and middle school,

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,720
I was one of a handful of Asian kids and
a very white community right outside of

38
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,560
Ann Arbor actually.

39
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
And I grew up with a lot of physical
and personal challenges to who I was

40
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:29,270
because of how I looked
and right or wrong,

41
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,320
I happen to watch the movie, the
Godfather with my dad when I was young.

42
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:37,730
And I thought, when I grow up, I want
to be the godfather because you can say,

43
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:42,200
take a hit out on that person. They've
crushed me. And my parents said,

44
00:02:42,201 --> 00:02:43,910
so you didn't know.
That's not the way to get ahead.

45
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,150
So then when I got to high school,

46
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,240
what I saw was still my parents working
really hard and trying to make ends meet

47
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:55,730
and our ends met.
But we had things that we needed,

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,710
not always the things that I wanted.
And I thought,

49
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,320
what I want back to my childhood is money.
I need to go work in business.

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,780
So, um, I,

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,530
I also grew up playing the piano
quite well a long time ago.

52
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,930
And I had a decision to make
when I got into college.

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,730
I gotten into Michigan for music and
gotten a scholarship to study music.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,760
But I also got into Yale,
not for music,

55
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,430
but for a liberal arts education.

56
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,640
And I chose the wind wind solution,

57
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,700
which was to go to Yale
because my parents are Asian.

58
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,210
They have a desire to
have bragging rights.

59
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,640
And Gail gave them bragging rights
with all their friends, um, that,

60
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,950
that we grew up with. And for me,
it was a ticket out of Michigan and,

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,910
and ticket to seeing more of the world,

62
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,450
learning with other people
who are not from Michigan.

63
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:50,890
And that really appealed to me. So
I thought, finally, I'll be free.

64
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,910
I can do whatever I want to do.
Except that my parents said, well,

65
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:57,790
you got to do something that's going to
get you a job and the thing that's going

66
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:02,740
to get you a job as a degree that's
going to lead to either another degree or

67
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:03,574
business.

68
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,170
So you're either going to do
premed or engineering or pre law,

69
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:12,490
something like that. I didn't want to
do any of those things, but they said,

70
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:14,920
if you want us to pay for
college or at least part of it,

71
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,140
you're going to have to major in
something that gets you a job.

72
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,490
So my compromise was economics
and political science.

73
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,660
I thought that's going to set me up to
potentially apply to law school because

74
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,610
that will lead to a profession.

75
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,710
Something that my parents could say
Soojin is now a lawyer or a doctor or

76
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:37,570
engineer. So it was something very clear
and it was something that was familiar.

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,740
It's something that I learned
about on TV back then.

78
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:45,190
Before there was Google back before
there was internet and Linkedin.

79
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,330
The only way you could know what career
paths were available were by the people

80
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,880
around you,
your parents,

81
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,780
their family and friends
and things you saw on TV.

82
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,790
So to give you another example,

83
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:02,650
my husband is a dentist and he knew he
wanted to be a dentist from a young age

84
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,010
because he saw the show
Rudolph the red nose reindeer.

85
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,340
How could that have led to
wanting to be a dentist?

86
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,290
There is a character on there.

87
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,170
How many have you seen Rudolph
the red nose reindeer? Okay,

88
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,680
so there are a bunch of elves and
there's one else Hermie who says,

89
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,750
I want to be a dentist. And the head
office says, no, you're a toy maker is,

90
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:25,270
but I'm really interested
in moles and things.

91
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,140
And so when he saw that
my husband Jim said,

92
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,610
I want to do something that makes me
different to the other thing that made him

93
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,970
realize he wanted to be
a dentist was growing up.

94
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,660
He had gone to his dentist and he was
always singing and whistling and this guy

95
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:44,050
was always happy and he thought when I
grow up I want to career where I'm really

96
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:47,200
happy and fulfilled in my career.
So that's what I want to do.

97
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,440
Even though we ended up
in very different places.

98
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:55,120
What drove us to our decision was that
we were influenced by the things that we

99
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,460
knew the people around us,
what we were exposed to,

100
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,090
and back before the Internet
it was really limited.

101
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,290
So most people followed in the footsteps
of their parents or their parents'

102
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,124
friends.

103
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,040
So fast forward to college and my senior
year at Yale I had to decide what am I

104
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,920
going to do next?
The obvious thing was to go to law school,

105
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:20,540
so to make my parents happy and be a good
Asian kid, I did apply to law school,

106
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,250
but what I really wanted to do after
taking a constitutional law class was work

107
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,700
on policies that would impact a
lot of people for the greater good.

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,480
And I discovered in the career office at
Yale public policy school and so I sent

109
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,930
away for information for that,

110
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:40,931
not telling my parents that I was doing
that and I got in and when it came time

111
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:46,040
to make a decision, my parents said, what
the heck is this thing called an Mpp?

112
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,850
What are you going to do when you
grow up after getting that degree?

113
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,390
Does it lead to a job and how
much will you make? I don't know.

114
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,950
I'm just going to take it on faith
that it will work out and so it did.

115
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,850
I did get a job.

116
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,440
I became a presidential management fellow
and what that program does is it gives

117
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:06,950
you leadership training as well as
rotational opportunities throughout the

118
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,210
executive and legislative branches and
that's what I did for a number of years

119
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,070
and it was great fun to be in the
middle of what was making news.

120
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,990
It's still making new stuff that happens
in DC, makes the news. It felt exciting.

121
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,130
It felt current.

122
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:27,131
It felt sexy until I realized I am just
one little cog in this big machine that

123
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:31,340
isn't having an impact on things
that really change the world.

124
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,020
And so I felt pretty useless and I thought
I need to do something else because

125
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:40,250
my heart is isn't really in it.
It was in it for the right reasons,

126
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,100
but I wasn't feeling like
I could have that impact.

127
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,000
So the next step was private sector.

128
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,010
At least there I can feel like I'm
working on something where I can impact

129
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,080
change pretty quickly, where I can see
the results of my brain power, my effort,

130
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,910
my working with other people. So I
said consulting. That's a thing for me.

131
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,860
It'll allow me to use my brain power.
It allow me to work with different people,

132
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,430
work on different projects. It'll
be exciting. There'll be sexy.

133
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,690
We're all in search of
sexy to some extent. Um,

134
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,410
so I threw a bunch of letters out their
cover letters to all the top consulting

135
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,240
firms.
I got nothing.

136
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,660
I thought I have a Yale
degree and a Harvard degree.

137
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,310
Surely that's going to get me
a job. Guess what? It doesn't.

138
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,810
It didn't cause I didn't know
how to apply for a job like that.

139
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,760
I didn't really know what it was.

140
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,610
I didn't know how to talk about
what I would bring to the table.

141
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,760
I didn't know how to talk
about their organizations.

142
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,490
I hadn't done my homework and
I didn't really know myself.

143
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,860
So I went back to the drawing board.

144
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,190
The answer is always school when
you don't know what to do next.

145
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,200
School is always a good thing.

146
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,220
So I decided to get my Mba because
still had in my mind that I wanted to do

147
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:57,054
consulting.

148
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,890
I went to the Michigan Ross School of
business right here in Ann Arbor and spent

149
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:06,150
the next two years doing things that
would set me up to be able to get a

150
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:08,280
consulting job.
And I did.

151
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,880
I landed a job at Deloitte consulting
and did that for about five years and it

152
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:18,210
gave me some of the things
that I was looking for,

153
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:23,010
which was using my brain power to make
change in an organization that I could

154
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,760
see. But after a number of
years of doing that, again,

155
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:28,770
I felt my heart saying
I need something more.

156
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,490
So I had to think about what is
that more that I'm looking for?

157
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,310
And that more was personal,

158
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:39,270
meaning where I'm having an impact on
something that makes somebody else's life

159
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,840
better, where it's getting
someone more opportunities.

160
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,740
That's about all I knew about
what I wanted to do next.

161
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,720
And so I had to really think about what
are the jobs out there that could give

162
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:56,060
me that,
where I can use my skills and get the,

163
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,300
the kind of the feeling that I want in my,
in my gut,

164
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,640
in my soul about having impact.

165
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,430
So I just started talking
to a lot of people,

166
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,060
people who do different things in their
careers and learning, what do they do,

167
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,810
what is it all about?
And as it turns out,

168
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,260
one of my conversations was with the
woman who had recruited me to come work at

169
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:20,430
Deloitte. She was a manager at the time.
And as soon as I took the offer, she said,

170
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,410
guess what? Sujin I'm leaving. I'm so
glad you signed. You made me look good,

171
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:27,420
but I'm going to go do something
else. I was like, what the heck?

172
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,750
I joined because I wanted to
work with you. As it turned out,

173
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:34,980
she went to go be the admissions director
at the Ross School of business and

174
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,020
over the next five years
that I worked at Deloitte,

175
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,050
I kept in touch with her and having those
conversations with her helped lead me

176
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,110
to my current job at the
Ross School of business.

177
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,930
We talked about what do I like doing,

178
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,670
what is it about some of the rules
that I've had that really excited me,

179
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:54,690
brought me joy,

180
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:58,620
made me feel like I was having the kind
of impact that I wanted and it was a

181
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:01,500
number of things.
One was in my free time.

182
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,660
I am an alumni interviewer
for Yale undergrad and one
of the things I love about

183
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:11,040
that is understanding people,
what motivates them, their dreams,

184
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,040
and is there a good fit
between what they want to do,

185
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,520
what they've done and what
that school can offer.

186
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,810
So that was one thing.
Another thing I realized was it Deloitte.

187
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,140
I really enjoyed recruiting new Mbas
because it was an avenue to opportunities.

188
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,250
It was promoting an organization that I
really loved and then I also liked using

189
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:38,040
my analytical skills in consulting,

190
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,630
figuring out how do I make something work
better? How do I get more of something?

191
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,910
How do I make it as good a process and
experience for people who engage with my

192
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:51,900
organization,
whether it's Deloitte or Yale or Michigan,

193
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,990
how do I make those things happen? And
so when I describe these things to her,

194
00:11:55,991 --> 00:12:00,991
it became obvious to her Antony that
recruiting at Michigan might be a good fit

195
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,310
and opportunity happened to present
itself. She had an open slot there.

196
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,730
That's how I got here 13 years ago and
I haven't looked back because the things

197
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:17,170
that keep me here are some of the same
things I was looking for in a job.

198
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,510
Feeling like I have an impact on people's
lives and that helped them have better

199
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:27,340
opportunities in their own lives.
Getting to use my analytical skills,

200
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,900
the things that I learned in
the MBA program and working
in an organization that

201
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:36,901
I feel is mission driven and helps other
people and is doing really exciting

202
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:37,720
things.

203
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,800
It's sexy to work on leadership and
innovation and entrepreneurship and all

204
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:46,060
those things, and I'm surrounded by
faculty, students and alumni who do that.

205
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,640
And so when people ask me, what's next, I
say, why should there be a, what's next?

206
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,880
If I'm learning and I'm growing and I
love what I do because ultimately isn't

207
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:00,970
that what we're looking for?
At least one of those three things.

208
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,110
But if you have all three of those things,
you kind of have that trifecta.

209
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,080
So as I think about advice to people
who are early in their career,

210
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,160
how can you find the thing
that will make your heart sing?

211
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,980
I have a few things.
One is to research and explore.

212
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,950
Really talk to a lot of people.

213
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,780
Every person that you meet is going
to be able to teach you something.

214
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,030
I met Davon maybe seven, eight
years ago, not professionally,

215
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:38,680
but through an alumni event.
We're planting flowers. We
planted flowers together.

216
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,170
He and his wife in downtown Ann Arbor.

217
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,320
We were all doing volunteer work
that day and we happen to develop a

218
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:49,321
relationship that over the last seven
years I've watched him have two kids.

219
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:50,980
He seen my kids grow up.

220
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,570
I'm here now largely because of him and
meeting angel. Are you still in here?

221
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:56,404
Angel?

222
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,060
I met her at divine's house and we had
a great conversation about some of the

223
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:05,980
things that she did in Undergrad that I
was really inspired about her initiative

224
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,840
and her drive for creating a Ted
talk series at her institution.

225
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,270
I was really excited to hear things that
people do and it makes me want to know

226
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:20,200
them and know other people.
The other thing,

227
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,540
the second thing is to reflect on what's
important to you and where you are in

228
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,630
your life.
What's right for you,

229
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:33,340
really depends on where you are in
your stage of life. Who's in your life?

230
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,720
Who Do you need to take care of?
Do you have a significant other?

231
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,310
Do you have children?

232
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,870
Do you have parents who need to be taken
care of or can you right now focus on

233
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:47,890
yourself that should influence
the choices that you make.

234
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,760
And the other thing is what do you
need to do in your life right now?

235
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,220
Do you have a lot of other obligations?

236
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,650
Do you have personal goals
that you want to fit in?

237
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,710
Or can you really focus on career?

238
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,170
Those things can help you figure
out what is the next career for me.

239
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,650
Because at different times in your life,
those things are going to change.

240
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,180
And the last thing I would encourage
you to do is to stop and reflect.

241
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,780
Reflect on what have I
done so far in my life?

242
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:24,770
What have I learned with the
people that I've talked to?

243
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,590
What seems really interesting?
How did they get there?

244
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,530
What can I learn from them
or about how to get there?

245
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,300
And if you don't do this already,
I would encourage you to keep a journal.

246
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,150
And I know it can be hard,
I find it hard myself,

247
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,330
but keep a journal of the things that
you learn about yourself of the things

248
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:47,660
that were hard.
How you've tackled some of those problems,

249
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,260
things you want to change about
how you might approach something,

250
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,790
goals that you have,

251
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,150
but taking quiet time to sit down and
reflect about those things that can help

252
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:01,850
you also narrowed down what
what it is you want to do.

253
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,960
You guys are really lucky that
you work in a great place,

254
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,560
that you live in a time when you can
find out information about anything,

255
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,240
about anyone, anywhere in the world
and you can connect with them.

256
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,130
You were only a few degrees of separation
away from someone who may want to meet.

257
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,920
In some ways that might be harder
because that makes it seem overwhelming.

258
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,810
All those opportunities
that you could have,

259
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,680
but if you do those three things that I
suggested research and talk to people,

260
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,000
think about where you are in your life
right now and sitting down and reflecting

261
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,170
on what's important to you,

262
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:44,171
what you've done and who you want to be
that can help narrow your focus a bit.

263
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,700
One of the most exciting things about
meeting new people for me is thinking

264
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:52,160
about new ways of doing
things and new ways.

265
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,250
New things to do and some
people may call that networking.

266
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,690
I really call it getting to know people.

267
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:04,460
It's a really valuable skill and I have
to put in a plug of course for getting

268
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:07,250
an MBA and here's why,

269
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,840
because I will contend that
more than any other degree,

270
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,920
that's going to open up a
broader range of opportunities.

271
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,740
It can be opportunities,
financially, opportunities, industry,

272
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,970
function-wise opportunities
to meet different people.

273
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,190
If you were a dentist or
a doctor or an attorney,

274
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,620
you're career is that it will be almost
invariably that for the rest of your

275
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,410
life.
But when you get an Mba,

276
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,270
there's so many things you can do that
may or may not be related to business.

277
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,860
What it teaches you are ways to
think about things, problem solve,

278
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,590
and to work with other people and that's
what you're going to have to do any

279
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:53,424
field.

280
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,780
And so I contend that an MBA
is the most valuable degree,

281
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,310
the most flexible degree you can have
out there. And if you're going to do one,

282
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,750
you should get it at Michigan.

283
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,440
I'll stop there and turn
it over to the phone.

284
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,530
Well, first of all, thank you. Uh,

285
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:13,350
it's incredibly insightful
to hear about your journey.

286
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,180
More insightful to hear about how you've
made decisions at every stage in your

287
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,420
life. I'll start with a handful of
questions and as I'm asking questions,

288
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:24,450
I'll ask all the folks in the room to
also start thinking about questions or

289
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,660
jotting them down.
Um,

290
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,520
but let's start with one of the things
that really struck me is how you made

291
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:34,020
decisions at every stage in your life
based on a little bit of something that

292
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:36,000
felt uneasy,
something in your gut,

293
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,960
something that meant that you needed to
think about this itch that was kind of

294
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:41,910
happening and a change that you needed.

295
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,900
So I'd love for you to kind of talk about
how you thought about those decisions

296
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:47,610
and then ultimately any sort of guidance.

297
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,870
A lot of the folks in this room are
either in their first job or their second

298
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:55,380
job out of school and will soon be
coming to those points of inflection.

299
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:57,150
So any guidance you can
provide there would be useful.

300
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,273
Okay.

301
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,410
So there were many things that made
making these decisions challenging for me

302
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:07,640
along the way.
Part of it is my own culture and heritage,

303
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,440
wanting to being Asian,

304
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,440
obviously wanting to please my
parents and make them proud.

305
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:17,441
That is something that even now as I'm
approaching 50 is it looms really large

306
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:20,480
in my head.
The decisions that I make.

307
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,700
And so what I wanted to do wasn't
always what they wanted me to do and

308
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:28,070
reconciling that was really hard.

309
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,970
The other was reconciling kind of my
background and what I want to do is this,

310
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:41,471
the career path of someone who went to
Yale and Harvard to be an admissions

311
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,050
director who grows up wanting to do that,

312
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,640
getting an MBA and then
being an admissions director
eventually who grows up

313
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:53,240
wanting to do that.
So it felt like a very nontraditional,

314
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,410
unconventional decision to make.
And I'll be honest,

315
00:19:57,411 --> 00:20:02,060
I have a lot of pride. Like
I want people to say, wow,

316
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:06,020
she's done something really great with
her life. She is accomplishing a lot.

317
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,110
And given the path that I was on,

318
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:14,410
it wasn't always clear to me that the
choice that I've made in this role was an

319
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,670
obvious one.
It takes a lot of courage to say,

320
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,080
but you know what? I
love this. I'm learning,

321
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,110
I'm contributing,
I'm making an impact.

322
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,890
I can make change and I'm
meeting really great people.

323
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,130
It took a lot of courage to me.

324
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,200
For me to say those things outweigh all
the other image related things that I

325
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:43,380
was. So it's so mired in, um,

326
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,410
and probably at a younger age,

327
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,730
it's harder to do that because you feel
there are things that you need to do,

328
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,480
maybe things that you need to prove either
to your family or to your friends or

329
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:57,220
to yourself. But at the end of the day,
what I've come to conclude and I can,

330
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,680
because I'm further in my career now,

331
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,770
is unless it's really making you thrive,

332
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:06,820
unless you feel like my heart is
singing, doing this, I'm learning,

333
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,940
I'm growing,
I'm doing things that matter to me,

334
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,700
then you're just spinning wheels.

335
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,750
Then it's just a job and nobody
wants to have just a job.

336
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,270
You want to have something
that makes you get up and say,

337
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,600
I can't wait to do this again.
I love the people I work with.

338
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,430
I love the things that I get to do.

339
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,330
I can't wait to do more of this
and when you stopped doing that,

340
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,380
when you stop learning,

341
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,650
when you stop growing and when you
stop being able to feel like you're

342
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,600
contributing, that's the time to
rethink what's the next thing?

343
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,290
Thanks Jen.
One more question along the same lines,

344
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,800
as the folks in this room are
thinking about their next steps,

345
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,340
I think often in the conversations
I've had and I've heard happening,

346
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,900
there's this almost conflict of do I
pursue something I'm really passionate

347
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:57,710
about versus going to get an Mba
and what role they both play?

348
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,770
How would you guide the folks in this
room to think about that conflict?

349
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,533
Okay.

350
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,360
I guess it comes down to a timing thing,
right?

351
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:10,190
If they think an MBA is in your future,
when is the right time to do it?

352
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,170
There really isn't a wrong time because
now there are so many different items in

353
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:16,460
your career that you can get it.

354
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,240
The Standard Path is with the
full time MBA coming out of uh,

355
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,220
out of Undergrad working for a number of
years and then going back to get your,

356
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,530
your MBA before you're 30.

357
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,230
There are also programs like at Ross
where you can do it part time while you're

358
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:37,220
working full time and then
there are programs like it Ross,

359
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:40,910
where you can get it when you've been
working for 10 or more years as an

360
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:44,090
executive Mba and it's at a
different level that you'll get it.

361
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,920
So there's never a wrong time. If you
have a great professional opportunity,

362
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,443
don't give it up.

363
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,960
If you feel like you're continuing to
do something where you're learning and

364
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:58,961
you're growing and if you took yourself
off that path to go get an Mba at that

365
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:01,220
point,
then wait a year.

366
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,860
But if you feel like there are skills
that I can gain now that only the Mba

367
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:09,110
could provide and my current job can't,

368
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,570
that might be the right
time to get it as well.

369
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,530
Thanks. It's a good transition to
thinking about like Mbas in general.

370
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:20,040
How would you describe Ross and what
you think makes [inaudible] unique?

371
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:26,510
One of the things that attracted me to
Ross almost 20 years ago and still holds

372
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:31,511
true today is that it's really focused
on allowing you to do things hands on,

373
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,250
not just sitting in class and learning
about theories and applying frameworks to

374
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:38,084
simulations,

375
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,260
but really getting out and doing
things that you might want to do,

376
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,500
whether it's consulting or managing
a fund or starting up a business.

377
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,170
All of those things you can do at Ross
while you're a student with faculty and

378
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:58,010
alumni advisers with
resources that are not yours.

379
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:02,480
It's you're putting at risk with the
help of classmates who have done some of

380
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:03,920
the things that you may want to do,

381
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,600
and so it's an incredible place where if
you want to actually do things and not

382
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:11,910
just learn the theory behind it,
you'll get that too raw.

383
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,570
There is no better place
to do that than at Ross.

384
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,330
Thanks.

385
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:21,330
When you think about the role of an MBA
in context of a person's career path or

386
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,580
life path, how has that changed
over the last 10 or 20 years?

387
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
I'd say it's changed quite a bit.

388
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,290
If you look at the industries
that students go into,

389
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,420
the recruiters that come to campus,

390
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:39,110
the choices that students make students
make about their careers post Mba,

391
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,400
it's just exploded 25 years ago.

392
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,050
People used to take pretty
standard pass banking, marketing,

393
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,700
consulting. Those were really the
three buckets that people went into.

394
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,200
Now people are doing all kinds of things,
are starting up their own businesses.

395
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,790
There are so many different kinds
of tech jobs, as you guys know. Um,

396
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,610
there are still students who go into
consulting and finance and marketing,

397
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,640
but those are not as
big as they used to be.

398
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:12,290
And it's no longer a career for life as
so many people who've got Mbas back in

399
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,910
the day.
Used to be.

400
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:19,270
It's you do one thing for a few years and
then you may pivot your career in any,

401
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,750
any number of ways.

402
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:26,110
And the beauty of the MBA now is it's
giving you the skills and the access to

403
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:28,460
pivot your career multiple times,

404
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:32,600
which students now are going to be doing
much more than even students from my

405
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:33,434
generation.

406
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,180
So I think that's one observation I have.

407
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,510
I've been in the workforce for 20
years and when I started candidly,

408
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:43,650
I would think getting a job
meant a job for life, right?

409
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:48,240
And now people are changing careers
quite frequently and probably five to 10

410
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:50,430
times over the course of their,
their entire careers.

411
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,210
What advice do you have in context of
careers and when people are thinking about

412
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:55,044
making those switches?

413
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,673
Okay.

414
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,280
The advice I'd give is to learn from
every role that you have learned,

415
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:03,720
not just the skills that are,
uh,

416
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,280
required for the position that you're in,
but also learn about yourself.

417
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:12,210
What motivates you, what about
that particular role at that time?

418
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:17,040
Really interested you so that you can
get closer to what it is that's going to

419
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:21,090
make, be your nirvana. And
it may change over time too.

420
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,553
Um,

421
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,780
I never knew that I would
love speaking as much as I do,

422
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,120
frankly.
Um,

423
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,450
it used to scare the heck out of me and
you could never get me to be the person

424
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:38,160
to stand in front of a class or
a large group to, to volunteer,

425
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:43,161
to speak and now through this role because
I had to because I've it quite a bit

426
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:48,090
and because I enjoy um,
sharing what I know,

427
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,590
I've learned that I love something that
I never would have imagined that I love.

428
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,600
So it's exposing yourself to different
things and getting good at everything

429
00:26:57,601 --> 00:27:01,740
even if you don't love it because you
may find eventually you do love it and

430
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:05,400
that's the thing that makes you say,
this is so fun.

431
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,780
I can't wait to do it again.

432
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,470
Is there,
in your role,

433
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,460
you obviously shaped both admissions and
what the class looks like and you also

434
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:17,900
shape what the program looks like.
I'd love to hear from your perspective,

435
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:22,790
what are some of the biggest mistakes
applicant's make and then also in context

436
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:25,550
of students who are actually
pursuing an already in the program,

437
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,500
what are those mistakes? What are the
things people should be looking out for?

438
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,830
I think the biggest mistakes both as an
applicant and as a student are quite the

439
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:37,110
same.
It's inauthenticity.

440
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,120
It's trying to be someone that you're
not trying to make yourself at the

441
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:47,121
applicant stage look like
the quintessential Mba
applicant rather than really

442
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:52,380
just talking about yourself as you are
and what you want to do these days,

443
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,010
unlike 20 or more years ago,
there is no cookie cutter.

444
00:27:56,011 --> 00:28:00,540
There is no traditional Mba candidate.
They are so different.

445
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,500
We have people coming from the Peace
Corps and from teach for America and from

446
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:08,940
the military, um, from
nonprofits, from medicine.

447
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,850
This wasn't standard when
20, 30 years ago. We,

448
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,430
um, my classmates and before
me were going to school.

449
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,970
I was a nontraditional student going
to business school at that time.

450
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,630
Most of my classmates had come
from some kind of business role.

451
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,750
I came from Capitol Hill.
I felt like a fish out of water.

452
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,210
But that's not uncommon anymore.

453
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,640
Students are coming with
really different backgrounds.

454
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,110
Yet a lot of Africans think they have
to look like the perfect business school

455
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:40,410
applicant. Same thing for when
students are in the program.

456
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,780
They get sucked into the,
Oh,

457
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:45,390
I should do consultant because everybody
else is doing consulting where I should

458
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,890
do finance because everybody
else is doing finance does this.

459
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:53,891
School is an opportunity to learn what's
out there and to learn what really

460
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:58,941
motivates you and then really
jumping into learning those things.

461
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:04,910
So you shouldn't have to feel like
you need to be this quintessential Mba

462
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:07,800
student either or post Mba.

463
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,900
You don't need to do the career paths
at all of your classmates are doing the,

464
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:16,470
the beauty of the degree is it's giving
you options to do different things.

465
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,940
And so I would encourage you guys to
have the courage to do really different

466
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:21,774
things.

467
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,760
Thank you. One more question
about the program in the class.

468
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,900
How are you thinking about
creating a diverse environment,

469
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,010
both from a perspective of the content
but also the program makeup in the

470
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:38,160
students and creating an
environment that's inclusive.

471
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,310
Okay.

472
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,100
I can't tell you how
important diversity is

473
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,590
to us. To me personally, um,

474
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,610
this year I'm really proud that our women
numbers are at a record high at 43% in

475
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:53,950
the MBA class.
I would love that to be 50,

476
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:58,000
50 more in line with what you
see at the Undergrad level.

477
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,430
Um, we truly believe that
without a diverse a class,

478
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,640
you're not going to learn as much without
people from different backgrounds with

479
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,600
different experiences.

480
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:09,790
We're going to make you think
about things in a different way.

481
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,480
You're just going to be thinking
the same way that you were before.

482
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,140
And the whole point of school is to
learn different ways of thinking about

483
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:21,010
things, about how your mind works and
how you approach situations and problems.

484
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,610
And if everyone comes from the same
industry or the same life circumstances,

485
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,380
you're not going to grow.

486
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,240
Our job is to give you an environment
where you were going to grow the most and

487
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:37,630
that is in large part through
the classmates that you have.

488
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,580
So we are so focused on making sure that
the student body, it looks very diverse,

489
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,810
not just in terms of gender,
but color, nationality,

490
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,900
backgrounds, geographies, career goals,

491
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:53,290
all those things matter because we
want you to learn from people who are

492
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,740
different from you. That's
great. Last question.

493
00:30:57,741 --> 00:31:00,020
This is one to be a little
more playful and fun.

494
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,850
You're applying for an MBA program? Yes.
I'm, I told you I am a holding to it.

495
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,180
You're applying to an MBA program.
You can't apply to Ross.

496
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:09,800
What other program do you apply to?

497
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,720
Okay, I will give a nod to you
just because he's the cohost here.

498
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,040
Devonne went to Yale School of
management. Um, and that's my undergrad.

499
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:27,290
So it does have a special
place in my heart and that's
how I got to meet him. Um,

500
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,620
but I'm not endorsing it.

501
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,100
I'll tell you where we have the most
overlaps in applications because we have

502
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,470
visibility into that
from g mat test takers.

503
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,690
And then as we overlap largely
with Kellogg, with Duke,

504
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,550
with Wharton, Berkeley, Yale Talk,

505
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,400
all of those are great schools.
The thing is,

506
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,410
any of those schools
are going to be great.

507
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:56,310
It's about you making the most of the
opportunities that you have wherever you

508
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:59,800
are. But of course I'm pretty
partial to, Michigan has, uh,

509
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,830
the student body and the ex the,
um,

510
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,920
opportunity to do action based learning.

511
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,670
It's really different from all
the other schools. In my opinion.

512
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,890
But I encourage you to
check it out yourself.

513
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,430
If you're thinking about business school,
talk to students,

514
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:16,980
talk to alarms in every school
that you're considering.

515
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,580
Go visit because you're going to get
a feel for the school and for the vibe

516
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:21,300
there.

517
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,680
Cause that's gonna make the difference
between whether you get an Mba or he had

518
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:29,180
this great springboard for ideas and,

519
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,330
and opportunities. So it's about
finding the right place for you.

520
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:35,370
And you'll hear every
admissions director say that,

521
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,620
thank you for the authentic
answer. And it, it's very true.

522
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,990
I think your perspective on,
you know,

523
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:46,130
when you make that decision to go pursue
a degree, it's not just about the NBA,

524
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,550
it's about changing the way you think
and it can have a profound impact.

525
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,300
So thank you.
