1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,250
Thank you for coming.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,280
We have a really important topic
here today for the talks at Google.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,400
It's my pleasure to be able to introduce
and mc the next hour with Kyra Kyle's.

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,390
She's here to talk to us
about a very important topic.

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,650
One of my colleagues actually heard
her speak at a conference and we felt

6
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:30,230
compelled to really help
broadcast the message,

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,290
diversify or die,

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,890
why news media need to
reflect their audience.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,260
What we'll do is we'll hear
from Cara, speak for, uh,
go through the presentation.

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,690
We'll have a discussion,
I'll ask a few questions.

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,440
We have some open mics
for a lively Q and a.

12
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,870
To tell you a little bit about Kira is,

13
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:55,010
she is the co founder of
Mith lab entertainment.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,690
She founded this company with her sister.
It's a multicultural agency,

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,800
multi-platform.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,940
She's also the former editor
and chief of Ebony magazine.

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,790
So without further ado,
please welcome Kara Kyle's

18
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,523
okay.

19
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,160
Yeah.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,670
Good morning everyone. How
are you? Good. Wonderful.

21
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:24,840
So thank you so much for the
warm introduction and it's
really great to be here.

22
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:29,070
I really appreciate people coming out
to talk about a topic that is extremely

23
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,740
important to me. Um, as
Natalie mentioned, you,

24
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:36,090
I've been in the journalism industry
for about 20 years and it's interesting

25
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:38,280
that the industry has
changed in so many ways,

26
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:41,580
especially as it pertains to
technology and the advertising models.

27
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,990
But there's one area where I feel that
it's woefully behind and that's why I'm

28
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:49,740
here with the dawning title to diversify
or die because sometimes you have to

29
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:52,380
scare people in order to
make them make a change.

30
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,290
So we're going to go with
the minority report now.

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,290
So just to give you a little
bit more detail about me,

32
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:02,160
I did work at Ebony magazine where I
was the editor and chief and also the

33
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:04,380
senior vice president
of digital editorial.

34
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,850
And honestly that is the first black
owned company that I worked for.

35
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,110
And Ebony is an interesting story because
this is a 70 plus year old company.

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,550
And the reason it was started is because
even back then of course there was a

37
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:22,050
dearth of positive news or affirming
news or even just factual news about

38
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:23,650
African Americans.
And it's,

39
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:27,090
it's sad to me in a way that
something like that is needed.

40
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:30,450
I mean we obviously love it and we're
excited about that and other black owned

41
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:34,320
and black run media entities. But
the fact is this problem, you know,

42
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,710
has his predates most of
us and it still continues.

43
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:41,790
So I also have had the benefit of working
with a lot of mainstream outlets and

44
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,240
that's what gives me some perspective
in terms of, I came from Tribune,

45
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,740
I worked with the Sun Times,

46
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,950
I've worked with vibe.com
work with a number of dailies.

47
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,950
And even in college it was already
obvious to me that there was a majority of

48
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,190
white males to be honest at, at
these places. And because of that,

49
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,580
there was a certain perspective.
None of this I think is malicious.

50
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,950
I don't think it's done to x anyone out.

51
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,140
But there were just certain
factors that are affecting us.

52
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,560
And I think we have to be cognizant
about it, not only as participants,

53
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,810
like someone like me, but
our audience. You know,

54
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,630
someone like you and that you're
empowered here at Google to be able to do

55
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,380
something about it because you're such a
huge factor, uh, with the media industry.

56
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,440
So I'll tell you a little personal story
about how I figured out really that I

57
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:30,690
could never, never, never
leave the journalism industry
because, I don't know, I,

58
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,500
it was like,
there are so few of us,

59
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:36,130
we feel compelled to remain within it
even though it can be very brutal in

60
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:39,280
punishing at times. You know,
we were losing ad revenue,

61
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:43,270
we're losing people many times. But
there, this is one of the reasons why.

62
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,680
So Hurricane Katrina,
um,

63
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,790
I was in the newsroom at the time and I
was one of a handful of African American

64
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:54,520
journalists where I worked most of
the black people to be quite frank,

65
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:59,470
that worked there were, um, in the
secretarial pool, administrative security.

66
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,180
There were not very
many black journalists.

67
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:04,180
So one day I was called down to
the big board room, you know,

68
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,180
and I was kind of intimidated because
I'm thinking typically, you know,

69
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,660
the big editors don't call down like
an editor or a reporter at the time.

70
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:13,300
I was a column is what on Earth did I do?
So I'm thinking,

71
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,730
did I write something wrong in a story?
You know,

72
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,900
was there like a bunch of people with
pitchforks waiting for me outside of like

73
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,220
what happened that they're
calling me into this room?

74
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,660
And what happened is it was
hurricane Katrina had hit a,

75
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,490
everybody was scrambling to do coverage.

76
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,320
And so these editors called me down to
this big board room with these, you know,

77
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,230
all these books and leather
bound books and couches.

78
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:40,231
And what they wanted to ask me is if
I thought it was okay if they refer to

79
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:45,250
those effected by Hurricane Katrina
as refugees. So it was like,

80
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,980
okay. Um hmm. First of all,

81
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:52,360
let me tell you that I cannot exonerate
you no matter what you do. I, you know,

82
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,690
I like to think of myself as very regal,
but I'm not the queen of blackness.

83
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:58,780
There's nothing, you know,
no one I can wave and say,

84
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,180
this is what you should do
and you won't get in trouble.

85
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,670
But I will answer your
question with a question.

86
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,750
If something happened in Iowa
or Idaho or here in Chicago,

87
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:12,520
would you refer to the people affected as
refugees? And they immediately said no.

88
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,470
So I think I'm glad they asked. I'm not
grateful that they asked. They should ask,

89
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,980
but I'm glad that they asked and that
I was there to talk to them about this

90
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:22,900
because it could have
been a very big misstep.

91
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,650
But I think that that's what brings us
here today is that because there were so

92
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:30,610
few people there up in those top
higher echelons, they honestly,

93
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,340
we're going to go with that. Had I not
said anything and they had an occurred,

94
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,200
it did occur to them to ask,
which is important.

95
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,890
But the fact is that they couldn't come
up with a consensus without asking me is

96
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:42,190
another issue.
So you might recognize this for him.

97
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,020
So media is definitely failing.

98
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,540
It's multicultural audiences
and this is dear white people,

99
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,630
which by the way is very good on Netflix
if you haven't seen the show. And um,

100
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,700
I don't think that this is a point
that the, we can go over too much.

101
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,700
I think people believe sometimes that
there's just like this small descending

102
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:03,110
minority people who want to see all
this positive news about multicultural

103
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,820
groups.
And I really don't think that's true.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,420
I think people just want to see factual,
accurate reporting.

105
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,740
They want to see nuance.

106
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:13,400
They want to see stories that are not
just crime or stories that are not just

107
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:14,630
about race or politics.

108
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,630
They want to see stories that
reflect the American population.

109
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,560
So when I say that to people,
sometimes they think, well, you know,

110
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:22,760
there's been some progress,

111
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:26,290
but the fact of the matter is there
hasn't been enough progress compared

112
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,390
considering the American population,
which I'll go into.

113
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,440
So what I've done with the presentation
is I have put some factoids in here

114
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,500
because I think, you know, when you,
when you're telling personal stories,

115
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,550
people kind of get it. But I think if you
see numbers than people totally get it.

116
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,250
So this one is don't sleep. And
for obvious reasons, you know,

117
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,170
we, I think we take a lot
of things for granted,

118
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:52,880
especially in America regarding our
population. But in just five years,

119
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:56,970
about 50.2% of children born in
the United States will be minority.

120
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:00,310
So the whole definition of
minority is changing. Uh,

121
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,740
in 2020 white children will be the
minority in the United States and this is

122
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:07,700
according to the census. And then
in 2016, this is really jarring.

123
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:11,300
62% of the population
that identifies as white,

124
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:14,210
we'll drop all the way down to about 44%.

125
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,890
So when you see these newsrooms and
things are changing in certain areas,

126
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:22,760
but when you go to a lot of traditional
newsrooms, what you will see is, you know,

127
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:26,510
white, older males and that does
not at all reflect the population.

128
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,900
So there are issues and things that are
lost in translation because of that.

129
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,070
So,
and I know this as well as anyone,

130
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,820
you would love to believe that maybe
media coverage will change because people

131
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:39,650
are just awesome and people are awesome,

132
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:43,550
but it's not just altruism that's
going to get us to this next area.

133
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,780
So I think it's important for people
to realize what the potential of this

134
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,950
market is. And so I'll just go over a
couple of the stats that I have here,

135
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,160
but for example, magazines. I
came from the magazine industry.

136
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,880
We all know that print magazines are
not doing very well just because the

137
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:02,900
advertising model has shifted so much,
but of the mainstream population,

138
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:04,970
which 55% are reading magazines,

139
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,800
minority populations read 65%.
So there's an overindex there.

140
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,360
In terms of radio,
you know,

141
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:14,300
everybody talks about the death
of radio when you've got podcasts.

142
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,760
We've got all these technologies
coming out. However,

143
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,790
minority communities are listening to
20 hours of radio a week compared to 10

144
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:26,420
hours for just the mainstream
population. Um, in terms of apps,

145
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:29,800
watching videos, which is another really
important area also for advertising's,

146
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,530
people are always slipping those little
videos in there. 56 hours a month.

147
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,270
That's what black, uh, citizen's
alone are watching on their apps,

148
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,660
their 81% more likely to
show support for a brand,

149
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:45,050
which is super important because we
always talk about brand influencers and

150
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,960
people that can tout your brand,
especially in a crowded marketplace.

151
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,750
And this is extremely important to note.

152
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,980
76% will share their opinions, you
know, on some of the social media.

153
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,070
So I think that's important to think
about because when things don't go right,

154
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,500
you know, it can, it can
be an ugly situation.

155
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:05,400
I'm sure we've all heard the term
black Twitter and we've all heard about

156
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,430
dragging and it is a real
thing. You know, I've,

157
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:10,320
I've only been kind of dragged
ones like just a light tug,

158
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,260
but I can promise you that I
don't want any more of that.

159
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,750
So I definitely advise
against being dragged. Um,

160
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,820
that another reason that African American
audience is important is that it's

161
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:24,510
becoming much a more educated community.
Um,

162
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,770
household income is increasing I think
because we see so many of these stories

163
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:31,800
and headlines that talk about
what isn't going right. You know,

164
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:36,660
the crime rates or um, issues with
black lives matters because of that.

165
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,440
There's a sort of almost like a blind
spot with the mainstream media when it

166
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:41,790
comes to this population.

167
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:46,080
And that is why I believe there are so
much like story ideation around these

168
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:50,790
negative developments.
And I do Miss President Obama,

169
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,200
sorry I had to say that I
know everyone's gone. So 75%,

170
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,370
I think this is horrible.

171
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,570
75% of African Americans distrust
of the media that they read.

172
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,760
So if you think about it,

173
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:06,480
and that's insulting to me actually as
somebody who went to school for this

174
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,890
worked hard on fact checking for me
to be writing something. And you know,

175
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:12,690
when I was maybe in more
of a mainstream outlet,

176
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,240
I don't think I experienced this as
much when I was at a black owned pub

177
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,133
publication.

178
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,760
For somebody to be giving me the side
eye to the rate of 75% that is extremely

179
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:21,031
high.

180
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:24,960
And I think that demonstrates that this
is not a problem that is just among a

181
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:27,570
small group of people.
This is widespread.

182
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,500
And I'll tell you why.
You know and I have some examples.

183
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,250
The funny thing is whenever
I talk about this topic,

184
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,860
it takes me two seconds
to find a new example.

185
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,970
I wish I could bring you an
example from 2016 and say, Oh,

186
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:44,310
this is back in the bad old days.
No,

187
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,150
I have a very fresh example for you so
I won't go through all of these cause I

188
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:51,900
really do want to get to talking to
everybody about this issue and what your

189
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,000
thoughts are on it.
But I'll just highlight a few.

190
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:58,050
The ones that make me the most physically
ill, we'll start with Ms Kardashians.

191
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:01,500
No shade to their cardiac and clan.
They are doing their thing. However,

192
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,010
Kim Kardashians,
by no means invented corn rows.

193
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,720
The fact that a magazine would put out
a story saying that she created this

194
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:11,340
trend called boxer braids,

195
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:14,070
which basically is the way my mother
used to braid my hair when I would swim

196
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:17,100
when I was like seven years old. I
was like, this is a slap. I mean,

197
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:21,000
did you do any research? Did you ask
anyone? Have you ever been anywhere?

198
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:24,840
Because that to me it was just so galling
and I think it really offends, um,

199
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,260
individuals. I have in the
audience here today, Wendy Wilson,

200
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:31,950
who was one of my colleagues from Ebony
and we talked about that in the fashion

201
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:35,280
industry in particular,
it seems like there is just this,

202
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,150
this blindness towards black women.
And this is an example of it.

203
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,840
Here's another one that made me irate
when I'm the New York Times referred to

204
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:46,740
Viola Davis is not classically beautiful
according to who did they not see her

205
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,650
at the Golden Globes when she was
serving with her yellow dress.

206
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,620
I mean it was just the, the
nerve of someone to come up
with something like that.

207
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:57,910
And when you say classically beautiful,
you understand what the implication is,

208
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:01,060
what does that mean? That she's not
blonde, that she's not, you know,

209
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,190
what are you saying when
you talk about that? No,

210
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:06,670
she does not necessarily look like
scarlet Johannson but is there not room in

211
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:10,480
the spectrum for her to be
considered beautiful as well? Um,

212
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,020
the Mike Brown situation,
uh, when in Ferguson,

213
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,110
when the news outlets and I, again,
I don't think this was purposeful.

214
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,690
I think it was because they
were racing against the clock.

215
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,010
You're trying to get new information,

216
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:26,011
but a lot of the stories showed the
image on the left if you can see it where

217
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:29,740
he's putting up his hand and I don't
necessarily think it is a gang symbol or

218
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:34,000
something, but there's some what of an
implication there. And then on the right,

219
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:34,181
you know,

220
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:37,450
you see him just living his life or you
could have used the graduation picture,

221
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,650
it could have used something else.
The bottom line is it,

222
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:43,510
a lot of media outlets hit back and said,
hey, we were under time crunch. We got,

223
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:46,360
this is the picture that we had.
We had to run with it. However,

224
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:50,300
I think it's obvious that in many cases
when there's a story about a white team,

225
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:53,490
even in a similar situation,
they will get a graduation picture,

226
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,440
a picture with family,

227
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,880
something that doesn't have any
sort of a negative connotation.

228
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,840
And people notice that.

229
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,560
And it actually started a trending topic
on if the aforementioned black Twitter

230
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:05,920
of what photo will they use when I
die, because any one of us, you know,

231
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:08,590
it's taken a picture that we might
not necessarily want to see again.

232
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,880
And to use that as the photo,
it does definitely sway public opinion.

233
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,490
And I can admit to you the
outlet that I was working with,

234
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,060
we were in the same position.
We did use that photo because honestly,

235
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:22,030
when I looked at it, I didn't see
it as being in any way nefarious.

236
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:25,570
But once the public said, hey
guys, this picture is bad,

237
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,360
please take this down or
find something else. We did.

238
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,890
The issue is when people say something
or when the public speaks out and then no

239
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:37,600
one, no one responds. And
then this is my fave. Oh boy.

240
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:41,740
So we recently had the revelation that,
um,

241
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,540
how to show natural hairstyles.

242
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,550
So I don't know if you could see
the picture on the bottom right.

243
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,880
They had a story about how to rock
natural hairstyles in pop sugar and every

244
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,200
single woman in this story was white.

245
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,760
Now I understand that all hair is natural
when it comes down to it, you know,

246
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,980
unless you're growing some kind
of acrylic out of your head,

247
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:00,880
everything is natural.

248
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,890
But black women have clearly taken this
term and we're using it for the purpose

249
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:10,420
that we have not traditionally been able
to wear our hair as it grows out of our

250
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:11,050
heads.

251
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,350
In a traditional workplace mean there's
still legislation that allows you to

252
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:18,550
fire someone if they have locks.
So we're not at a place where we can,

253
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,740
you know, all lives matter of hair, you
know. So when this publication did this,

254
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,880
the retribution was swift. But my question
was, why did you ever do this? You know,

255
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,170
if you had just had somebody around
somebody's diverse in your circle,

256
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,250
this never would have happened.

257
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,370
Some of these things are totally
avoidable and that's the issue.

258
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,800
And the last one I'll point out,
and this is because again,

259
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't think this is malicious,

260
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:44,710
but extremely hurtful that cosmo
did a lineup of trends that were,

261
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,000
you know, dad like rip, goodbye, you
ugly trend. And then they had hello,

262
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:54,001
gorgeous and they were ushering in the
new beautiful trends and about 90% of the

263
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,370
goodbye ugly trend. We're black women
and models Joanne smalls like it.

264
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:03,140
It was terrible, but I don't think,
again, it was not done deliberately but,

265
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,790
and they apologize for it,

266
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,890
but the fact is no one looked
at this lineup and thought
this could be a problem.

267
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,840
You know that that is the problem. So
again, sad that the examples continue.

268
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,510
So what are we looking for? You
know, Naomi's clapping it up for us.

269
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,510
We are looking for fair representation.

270
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:23,720
No one is looking for to be
treated better than anyone.

271
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:25,700
Just like you don't want to
be treated worse than anyone.

272
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,380
What we're looking for is even
simple issues. Stock Art. I,

273
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:33,050
and I had this happen, I will
not name the agency, but one day,

274
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,250
just out of curiosity,

275
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,140
I decided to do a search in this popular
stock art agencies collection and I put

276
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:42,050
in the word ghetto.
If I didn't get back,

277
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,460
every black person known to
man that was in their catalog,

278
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,080
I could not believe it. I mean
in this happened in 2016, um,

279
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,830
most of the images are
of people of non color.

280
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:57,920
It's very hard to find any sort
of minority in the stock art.

281
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,570
So I think the issue is that, and it's
being remedied, um, within the community.

282
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,730
I know several women,
for example,

283
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,360
who started agencies where they take
pictures and they make it available to the

284
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:12,470
media is used so that there are these,
these different images out there.

285
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,050
But the sad fact is that
in these major agencies,

286
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:18,410
there's only a very tiny and microscopic
selection you have to choose from.

287
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,670
And that's why if you look,

288
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:22,940
you'll notice that you kind of see the
same feature images and a lot of stories.

289
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,660
And that is why, because there just are
not a lot of images of people of color,

290
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:29,070
period, not just African Americans. Um,

291
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,750
I think asking people to be part
of stories that are not about race,

292
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,970
that are not about class,
that are not about politics.

293
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,720
Asking people questions about riding
bikes. You know, I ride bikes somewhat,

294
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,190
you know, not very well.
But I do, you know, I,

295
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,770
I would like to be interviewed for stories
that don't necessarily base upon the

296
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,590
way that I look. You know, as a
person, like we're all humans,

297
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,930
we're all Americans and we're
all peak global citizens.

298
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:53,890
Why shouldn't we be included
in other stories? Um,

299
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,880
being authentic and showing people,
you know, just because it's cool,

300
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,180
you know, for example, um,

301
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:05,430
I think sometimes like people fixate on
a certain pop culture citizen, like, uh,

302
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,590
you know, this is an unpopular topic
right now, but a black China for example,

303
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:12,110
or something like that, and the people
just discovered who this is. It's like,

304
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:13,190
come on now,
you know,

305
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,850
and they go all in and they give them
covers and they give them this and it just

306
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,630
rings false because it's obvious that
you're not interested in anyone else.

307
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:25,070
You're just interested in specific black
people that are undeniably popular at

308
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:26,630
the moment.
And otherwise,

309
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,660
this wouldn't be something that
you would work very hard at.

310
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,460
So that can be a huge problem.
Um,

311
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:35,270
I think even what I learned when I was
in school that the professors always told

312
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:39,320
us, um, interviewing a lawyer,
interviewing a professor, make an effort,

313
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,850
especially if it's not a story based
around race to talk to people of different

314
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,480
areas of the spectrum because
you want to mirror the populace.

315
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:50,370
And I think that unfortunately because
people are in a rush and they have these

316
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:54,510
circles of people that they talk to,
they just want to continue in that vein.

317
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:58,530
But I think we just really have to
ask ourselves to expand and there are

318
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:01,770
publications that are doing a much better
job because I don't like to keep it

319
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:04,590
all negative. You know, I want to
talk about some good success stories.

320
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:08,070
Washington Post has been doing an
incredible job. I'm Huffington Post,

321
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:11,310
black voices does a great
job with a small staff.

322
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:14,250
They're able to cover a lot of issues.
They have a lot of op eds,

323
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:17,360
but they also do really good
investigative reporting. There's,

324
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,720
they stress the importance of covering
black community across the diaspora.

325
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,950
Buzzfeed is doing a really good job and
what I really want to commend them for

326
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,520
is transparency. What
what I've run into, um,

327
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,670
as a member of the National Association
of black journalists is that news

328
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,720
outlets don't want to tell you who
they have there. They like we're,

329
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,580
we're a group of people that
are always asking questions,

330
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:43,770
but this is a question that
we don't want to answer.

331
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,150
So you don't know what the proportions
are. Even when they do surveys,

332
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,980
there's a low return of,
of, of organizations that
will provide background.

333
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,100
So buzzfeed did that, you know, they
talk about how many people they have,

334
00:18:56,101 --> 00:19:00,210
they talk about black and they talk
about Asian, they talk about women,

335
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,640
they let people know what they're doing.
And yes,

336
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,100
you open yourself up to criticism.
Someone could look at that and say,

337
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:05,970
well that's not enough.

338
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:09,630
But the bottom line is I think that if
you open yourself up to that criticism,

339
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:12,330
it shows that you are willing to fix it.
And when you hide it,

340
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:14,970
it makes it seem like you want
to keep things in the status quo.

341
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,980
And I think another important
question for us to ask, you know,

342
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,240
I know that as I said,
Google is extremely important,

343
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:24,420
but even just as individuals
we can do things, you know,

344
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,570
something that I just did recently and I
was just using my own example because I

345
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:30,450
don't want to put anyone else out
there on front street necessarily,

346
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:35,451
but a friend of a friend of a friend of
mine went into a seven 11 in Chicago.

347
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,620
She, she, she was a mother. She sent
her two boys that were teenagers,

348
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:44,070
like very young boys into the store
to pick up food for their lunch.

349
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,220
And within minutes they were
back outside with nothing.

350
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:50,400
And she asked him what happened and the
little boys, they just said, you know,

351
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:53,460
it's no problem. He just didn't want us
in there cause we're black. It's okay.

352
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,180
And she's like, wait a
minute, what that is not okay.

353
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,860
She took them back in the store.

354
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,600
She asked the clerk what he did and I
think he told on himself because he,

355
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,920
when asked about it, what he say, he said
something to her to the effect of, well,

356
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,730
I'm an American. Like
what do you, what is this?

357
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:10,920
An immigration office as a
seven 11 you know what I mean?

358
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,500
Like what does living in America
have to do with anything?

359
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,100
But that little video of her encountering
this man and really confronting him

360
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:19,410
about what he did to her sons.
I posted it.

361
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:22,830
I encourage a lot of other people to
post it. News outlets got into it.

362
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,710
And from what I understand,
he was removed from that store.

363
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,190
So there are things that we as individuals
can do with the power of smartphones,

364
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,260
with the power of social media.
If we see things that we don't like,

365
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:37,200
there's something that we can
do in response. Back in the day,

366
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,650
there was the letter to the editor that
could take months to surface and you

367
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:43,620
know, the reaction would be
equally slow, very glacial.

368
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,650
But now I think there's an immediate
reaction and you don't want to the gun.

369
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:49,630
Everything is not a racial situation.

370
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,990
But I think it is extremely important
that we take our voices and that we

371
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:57,490
channel those into positive change.
Because the bottom line is that as I said,

372
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:01,600
the demographic is changing, the country
is changing, the globe is changing.

373
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,960
And the last thing we want to do is
have the media that's supposed to be a

374
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:07,540
catalyst for revolution.
You know,

375
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,810
be the one that's kind of putting
down the revolution. So that's,

376
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,540
that's pretty much everything
that I wanted to, to say to you.

377
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,580
And I'd love to hear what you
have to say to me about the topic.

378
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:20,200
I know it can be hot button and sometimes
people can be a little fearful about

379
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:21,910
bringing up the, the, the issues.

380
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:24,670
But I think that's the only way
that we'll ever come to a solution.

381
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,890
So thank you so much for your attention.
I appreciate

382
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,210
[inaudible].

383
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,470
Thank you so much, Kyra. This is,

384
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:39,030
you have a powerful voice in such
a strong message and you know,

385
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,710
it is a tough topic. But with, with
staggering statistics like this,

386
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,660
we have to bring change and it doesn't
come quick. It doesn't come easy.

387
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,140
It's been a long time coming.
But um,

388
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,640
by having this conversation here today
and the impact that you've had in the

389
00:21:56,641 --> 00:22:01,170
industry, um, it's a start and there
are ways that we can also take action.

390
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,720
I'd like to just start learning a
little bit more about you. You just,

391
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:11,721
how did you get an industry
had an accelerated master's
program at Northwestern,

392
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,840
dove right into journalism,
right? What sparked that interest?

393
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,410
No, I've always been interested in
writing ever since I was a little kid.

394
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:24,400
I often tell the story that my mom used
to occupy my time when I was a child by

395
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,030
putting me in front of a dressing room
mirror and I would sit there and do these

396
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:30,220
little broadcast so she
could shop, shop, shop,

397
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,670
and I would be doing the weather
and talking about the news.

398
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,630
I even had a Barbie magazine with my
sister that we forced my poor father to

399
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:40,990
read. He'd come home from work exhausted
and have this terrible magazine,

400
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:42,970
you know,
printed out and ready for him to read.

401
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,140
So it's funny because oftentimes people
say they want to be something when

402
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:49,930
they're little and then that
doesn't materialize. So in my case,

403
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:51,250
that is exactly what happened.

404
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,680
Amazing. And you, you, you
veered into the print media,

405
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,800
you also, you're heavily
involved in multi-platform. Um,

406
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,380
and you've kind of dabbled in each form,
if you will, on this topic of diversity.

407
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,000
And in the topic of media,

408
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,690
are there some sub verticals that
are doing it better than others,

409
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:15,010
whether it's broadcast, prime
time, newspapers, digital?

410
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:15,970
I would

411
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,930
they just by design,
because digital typically is,

412
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,160
it's a younger workforce.
It's, um, more malleable.

413
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,030
There aren't these entrenched employees
and entrenched ways of doing things.

414
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,180
Digital seems to be leading the way.
For example,

415
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:35,890
I believe it's about double the number
of women working for some of these online

416
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,830
outlets compared to your
traditional dailies.

417
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,410
So they are far and
beyond leading the way.

418
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:45,500
And I think they've actually worked
collectively to bring up the statistics of

419
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:49,760
the number of minorities in media when
added with these traditional outlets.

420
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,350
TV, I believe is among the
slowest, if I'm not mistaken,

421
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,500
and I, and that's probably
because it's a visual medium,

422
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,540
like we still have situations.
I don't know if,

423
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:03,710
if most of you saw the story about
the woman who does the weather,

424
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:06,710
who she got all these nasty viewer notes
because she was wearing her natural

425
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,544
hair on air.

426
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,460
And I mean the things that people said
you would have thought we'd climb into a

427
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,170
time machine and gone back,
you know,

428
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,440
the 1950s or sixties because
it's a visual medium,

429
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:19,250
it may be harder to adjust and to embrace
those trends. And viewers are older,

430
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,870
so they're used to seeing certain things.

431
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,380
So if they wake up and they see someone
that doesn't look like what they're used

432
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:29,120
to, they'll turn it off. And because
it's such a delicate situation,

433
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,710
they need that advertising model.

434
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:34,700
They still continue to follow
the audience in that way.

435
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,850
So I think unless you had a lot of young
people tuning in and voicing concerns

436
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:41,060
about what they're seeing,

437
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,030
that one is one that will
continue to be kind of stagnant.

438
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,550
And also behind the scenes
is extremely important.

439
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,940
A lot of people see people on the front
lines, they don't see the directors,

440
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:54,620
the producers, the writers
behind the scenes on TV. That
is also not very diverse.

441
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,890
And in newspapers you can kind of
tell a little bit more. But again,

442
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,370
you don't necessarily know the background
of, of people that you're reading.

443
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:04,100
But just statistically speaking,
as I understand it,

444
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:09,101
it's about 17% of the total news workforce
of those who responded are minorities

445
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:11,540
at this moment.
People of color.

446
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,250
So how with with such low numbers,

447
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,240
how can we bring change? Does
it, it counts just being, um,

448
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,270
I'll share a little bit about
the Google practices because we,

449
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,750
it's not just at the hiring stage,
it's also in the inclusion.

450
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,740
Diversity and inclusion is something
that's one of our pillars and values at

451
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:32,950
this company. Work to be done. And,

452
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:35,990
and that's because also in working
on the pipeline of applicants,

453
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,590
so there's another pillar that's
really critical to Google,

454
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:44,591
which is an education inspiring the next
generation and thinking about computer

455
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:47,720
science.
And the last pillar is our community.

456
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:51,530
How do we make sure that we bring
access to everyone, training SMB,

457
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,550
small and medium size businesses or others
so that they have the tools to grow,

458
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,140
um,
where,

459
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,670
how do we start bringing more diverse
voices into the world of journalism?

460
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,840
Is it in the schools? Is it h how would
you think about that approach? Yeah,

461
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,703
I definitely,
yeah,

462
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,870
I think education is a
critical piece because you,

463
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,700
you do need that training in order to
go into journalism though nowadays,

464
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:17,840
some of these sites you
might question that. But, um,

465
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I think one really important thing is
that it's still kind of a privilege to

466
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:27,180
work in journalism.
People expect you to work for free.

467
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:31,020
Some people can't afford to do that,
especially somebody, a person of color,

468
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:34,140
maybe somebody who hasn't
inherited familial wealth.

469
00:26:34,141 --> 00:26:36,420
They can't afford to do a free internship.

470
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:40,230
I've had situations when I was working
with ebony where someone was working in

471
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,700
retail and also coming in,

472
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,000
but they didn't have enough hours to
really make a significant difference.

473
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:50,070
I think that paying interns a decent
amount would help because that would give

474
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:54,240
them impetus to join the field and to be
trained the right way and also to then

475
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,660
get advocates from within the industry
that can reach back and say, Hey,

476
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:01,740
I had this really great intern. Here's
the role that this person could fill. Um,

477
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,660
people always hire from
within their circle. I think
that's across the industry.

478
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,830
And if you don't know people,

479
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:11,370
you cannot hire them if you've never
met them because they've had to work a

480
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:14,860
regular job because they can't afford
to work for free. You know, it's a,

481
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,790
it's a moot point to talk about diversity
if you're not doing those things.

482
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,580
And that goes across the board.
Even in Hollywood,

483
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,090
you people can't afford to work for
free for agents and that kind of thing.

484
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:27,120
And that's the reason why you see some
of the white washing that people talk

485
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:30,000
about in the movies.
I think also it's the audience.

486
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:31,890
I think the audience has to demand better.

487
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,900
I think they have to call
people on the carpet.

488
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:38,490
I recently saw I horrible industry article
was a review of the movie girls trip.

489
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,160
It,
I don't know what happened here.

490
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,850
It was just really
pointed and really biased.

491
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,910
And instead of evaluating it
like you would bridesmaids,

492
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,780
this author decided to compare this movie
that has nothing to do with anything

493
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,790
to um,
Tyler Perry's movies.

494
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,150
And I think it was because that was
his frame of reference, you know,

495
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:59,880
and that that would be like comparing
the Coen brothers to Seth macfarlane.

496
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:04,320
It doesn't make sense. Right. So, um,
you know, I think it is about exposure.

497
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:08,430
It's about audience driving
change and it is about, you know,

498
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,360
supporting journalists of color when you
see them and they're doing great work,

499
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:14,760
support them on social
media, follow them, you know,

500
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:18,120
get more familiar with their work so
that they can be touted. You know,

501
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:20,880
we've had several journalists who have
gotten the kind of treatment and it

502
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:25,020
really helps, um, you know,
and, and I think we just have
to continue in that vein.

503
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:27,390
It's,
it's not one bullet solution.

504
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:29,880
It's like a comprehensive change
that we're going to have to see.

505
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,880
Beautiful. You mentioned, I mean that the,

506
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,920
the need to have stronger and
more inclusive journalism voices.

507
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,910
I think there was a stat on your side
about 75% of African Americans actually

508
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,060
trust the source of news that they
don't write, don't trust. Right.

509
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,510
What happens is they're just,
um,

510
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,230
no more readership or do they turn
to different sources? What, I mean,

511
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,320
I think the people,

512
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,340
I think people continue to read
because this is the information,

513
00:28:58,341 --> 00:29:02,720
but I think they take it with a huge
grain of salt. They think, okay,

514
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,210
the police are always right
in these stories that I read.

515
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,860
The person that's killed or hurt
or put in jail is always wrong. Um,

516
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:14,720
I think that there has also
been a proliferation of
blogs and different sites,

517
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:17,900
you know, and I would say for example,
like very smart brothers, the route,

518
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,950
you know,
they're in different areas,

519
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:23,300
some of our entertainment shadow and act
that have come to fill in these gaps.

520
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,880
And I think they're very successful,
but because they don't,

521
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,150
they still aren't the juggernauts and
some of these other sites are, you know,

522
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,950
bt has a huge audience. And so there are
news really infiltrates, but you know,

523
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:36,860
some of these smaller sites may be
aggregated, they have influenced,

524
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:40,460
but they're still not going to have the,
the half of say, the Tribune company,

525
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:43,770
which has all these different
affiliates. So, um, I,

526
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,330
I do believe it's
bringing forth new voices,

527
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,990
but I still think bringing
forward new voices is effective.

528
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:52,960
But it would be even more effective if
we could get some of those voices into

529
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:55,000
the traditional outlets
that people read the most.

530
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,330
And some of those people that read the
traditional outlets are the main ones

531
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:01,630
that need to read the new voices because
they're just kind of indoctrinated in

532
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:04,900
what they're accustomed to. And
sometimes that's very biased information.

533
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,440
It's uh, it's true. If we look at another
industry, the, the movies industry,

534
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,720
what happened with the Oscars last year,

535
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:17,370
it was pretty blatant terms of the lack
of diversity and one approach they took.

536
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:20,640
And I don't know if it's the right
one for other industries to look at,

537
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:25,530
but they said a number in terms of how
they wanted to elevate the number by 2020,

538
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:30,000
I think it was right, of women and
African American and Latino Writers.

539
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,890
What's your perspective on that?

540
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,930
I think that's a good step. Uh, I, again,

541
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:39,500
I do think it also has to
be within the rank and file.

542
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:44,150
It has to be the producers. It has to
be the script writers. It has to be,

543
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,630
there have to be more people
behind the scenes, the directors,

544
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:52,580
the cinematographers in order to really
make sure that we're seeing movies that

545
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:55,340
reflect the audience that's
sitting in front of it. I mean,

546
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,900
I'll say I've been reading recently
and I am a huge game of Thrones fan.

547
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,950
I once woke up with a person cause they
kept talking around the scenes. I'm like,

548
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:08,900
no, you're going to be quiet
or if we're done here. Um,

549
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,490
but I mean it is weird that in this
fantasy world where there are dragons and

550
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:17,870
white walkers and Zombie horses,
you can envision maybe three,

551
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:20,840
four people of color period.

552
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,910
And as weird to people,

553
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,840
I think you're coming into a time where
people are not willing to accept that.

554
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,620
And then on the reverse we have the Black
Panther trailers came out and people

555
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,450
lost their mind.
What is happening here?

556
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,710
Why wasn't there a role set aside for
Matt Damon? I'm not going to go see this.

557
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:37,610
And it's like,
listen,

558
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,090
Matt Damon had his term when he was
on the Great Wall of China for reasons

559
00:31:41,091 --> 00:31:43,460
unknown. You know, we're going
to, we're going to let that go.

560
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:46,910
We're going to let Matt Damon take
a bench on this one. But um, I,

561
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,640
I think that you,
it's got to come from everywhere.

562
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:53,390
Having the judges have more diversity,
which is what they did is great,

563
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,900
but if there aren't more movies,
it's still not going to solve anything.

564
00:31:56,901 --> 00:32:01,400
We need more movies out with people of
color behind as well as in front of the

565
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:01,671
scenes.

566
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:05,060
We do have good visibility in front of
the camera and that's getting better,

567
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:09,770
especially on TV. I think
television is really doing a
great job, but um, you know,

568
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:11,360
the industries are old and they show,

569
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,510
they're showing their age and I think
we're now starting to come up against a

570
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:17,390
generation that's not willing to just
accept that they're going to say, hey,

571
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,430
if you don't make it,
we'll go make it ourselves.

572
00:32:19,431 --> 00:32:21,890
That's why you saw the
success of get out that movie.

573
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:24,470
I don't think it could have been
made like five or six years ago.

574
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,270
And now because of the
response it's getting,

575
00:32:26,271 --> 00:32:30,530
you'll see more provocative
films like that, you know,
everything is not, you know,

576
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,020
I respect the Tyler Perry because
he's doing amazing things,

577
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,690
but everything is not Tyler Perry
and nor should it have to be.

578
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,770
And that shouldn't be the framework
by which movies with a black or black

579
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,010
executives is judged.
So though like it's a shared

580
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,070
responsibility from corporations to
also the talent producing the movies.

581
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:52,700
And he was a, a colleague of mine who
pointed out that Disney's Milan movie, um,

582
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,800
they were about to cast a,

583
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,620
a white male to be the of
the love interest and uh,

584
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,840
it was a petition of 90,000 folks,
which she signed it to,

585
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,570
to make a stop and then they
kind of changed the riders.

586
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,630
So there is a way to have a voice.

587
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,060
You're able to have an immediate boys and
I think that's important because there

588
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:14,850
used to be a time it had been a letter
writing campaign or something which is

589
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:16,710
very sluggish and ineffective.

590
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:19,560
The movie would have been in the theaters
by the time people knew about the

591
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:23,520
protests. I think that that as you point
out, that is a terrible thing to do.

592
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:24,840
Why would you do that?
There are,

593
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:29,730
and there really is a galling lack
of Asian representation in movies,

594
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:31,350
in pop culture in general.
You know,

595
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:33,690
you're starting to see more
of that but not enough.

596
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,760
They can't afford to
do that at this point.

597
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,090
And I'm so glad that people spoke out
and I hope that teaches them a lesson

598
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:40,680
cause I wanted to see ghost in the shell,

599
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,130
but I couldn't cause even though scarlet
Johannson is like one of my woman crush

600
00:33:44,131 --> 00:33:46,750
Wednesdays,
I could not do it because you know what,

601
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,840
it's such a huge
opportunity that you missed.

602
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:52,080
And I think people need to understand,
they may ignore a protest,

603
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:55,770
but when they see the box office numbers
drop, there's no way to ignore that.

604
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:57,960
And Hollywood is driven by money.
So as the media,

605
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,750
so if you speak with your
dollars and you don't invest,

606
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,990
they will figure out a different
way to do things they always have.

607
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,943
Hmm.

608
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,420
I'm going to ask you one last question
and then we'll open it up and we've got

609
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:10,111
some mikes here.

610
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:14,190
If he wants to start lining up with the
questions and you're dying to ask her

611
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,870
camera, but, um, it's a, a little,
a bit more about, you know,

612
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:22,820
we opened up with who are you?
I want to also ask you, um,

613
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,080
a topic that's come up and out of our
Anarbor office. And it is a series.

614
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,230
First Time I discovered I was black and
that was a Googler who thought of the

615
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,081
series,

616
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:39,081
create and produce a 30 minute video
segment inspired by what he'd seen on CNN

617
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,570
of the same title. Okay. When was the
first time you realized you were black?

618
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,940
It was a wonderful day. I can
remember that much. Um, you know,

619
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,950
I think I was exposed early.

620
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,650
I would say maybe the content,

621
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,850
the context of color and race and that
maybe when I was about four or five,

622
00:34:57,851 --> 00:35:02,470
because I grew up in a predominantly
Irish neighborhood and I didn't,

623
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,780
my mother really didn't have a choice.
You know,

624
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,860
there were children playing with the hair
and rubbing on the skin and I was like,

625
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:11,830
what are they doing? And they would ask
us, you know, why our dolls, where this,

626
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:15,790
cause my mother bought us black dolls
because she wanted to reinforce our beauty

627
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:20,560
ideal. So we had some beautiful black
dolls, like one look like Felicia Rashad.

628
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:23,470
They were so pretty. And the
fact that we had them, you know,

629
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:26,020
Austin cause questions from
the kids in the neighborhood.

630
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,280
So I believe as early as that, I figured
it out in the my mother, you know,

631
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:32,980
talk to us about it, you know,
talked about the differences,

632
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,880
talked about history to us in a way
that we can understand and consume.

633
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,490
So I felt luckier than some other children
when I went to school and they really

634
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:45,630
weren't aware of our history in that and
they seem to be more subject to being

635
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:48,240
like shamed for being different.
Whereas with me, I was like,

636
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:52,800
you're just mad because your hair does
it do this, you know? So, um, you know,

637
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:55,830
I had a different and much
more positive I, you know,

638
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:59,280
feeling about it then if I had come
in there and been surprised, you know,

639
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:03,600
you and I were talking earlier
today about the sports caster, who,

640
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,990
who said that,
you know,

641
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,310
he doesn't know what he is and race
doesn't matter anyway. And I mean,

642
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:11,080
I feel like this is a man that
he probably should not, you know,

643
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,760
at this point about 50 years old, he's,
if he's passed at least three mirrors,

644
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:17,560
he should, he should
know. But you know, I,

645
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,200
the fact that that's
still happening though,

646
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:23,160
that just tells you how
fraught with controversy,

647
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:27,000
the topic is identification
and I'm embracing your culture.

648
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:31,860
It's still something that is
not easy for anyone for sure.

649
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:35,040
But shouldn't you be able to hear the
voice that you had such a beautiful

650
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:38,970
narrative and growing up and hearing
that story and being able to project your

651
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:43,320
voice right and to read about likeminded
voices as well. Exactly. Right.

652
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:45,000
And I think that's extremely important.
You know,

653
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,600
in the black community and people
of color. I think there's a saying,

654
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:51,360
it's like you have to see it to be it,
you know,

655
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:55,470
seeing even President Barack
Obama ascend that way, you know,

656
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,830
kids my age probably didn't think that
that could happen just based on the way

657
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,510
that society is set up.

658
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,690
But there are generations of
children that for them that's a goal.

659
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,680
They don't even think twice about
it because they've seen it and it,

660
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:10,980
it's sad that we just need to see more
examples and then in people being free to

661
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:15,810
talk about them in, in various outlets
and in movies and TV and pop culture.

662
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,093
Absolutely.

663
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,810
You spark some ideas as well as to
how we can do that sponsorship and,

664
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,670
and others. Okay.
Wonderful. Well turn to um,

665
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,280
some live questions and pass it over.
Okay.

666
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,190
Thank you so much Carter. He'll come
in and speaking with us. Of course.

667
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:33,730
So we've heard a lot,
you know, for uh, women,

668
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:37,060
female executives of color come and
speak to us and share the experiences.

669
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,860
Some of them actually expressed that
they felt more discrimination as a woman

670
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:44,980
than as a person of color. So let's
get your experiences, you know,

671
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:48,740
does that align to your expectations and
your experiences and what you've seen,

672
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,420
the media industry or, or, or what,
yeah, what's the situation there?

673
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,860
No, for me personally, and again,
this is just for me personally,

674
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:01,070
I feel that blackness cannot be extracted
from my woman as I feel like they're

675
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,600
one thing.
Um,

676
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,040
black women in general are treated
differently than white women are treated.

677
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,980
And I don't have the statistics
with me at the moment,

678
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:15,660
but in just in terms of being in a
workplace and having internal advocates,

679
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,630
black women felt much less
supported than white women.

680
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:22,920
Now white women felt much less supported
than white men. So it's like they say,

681
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:26,490
you know, the old saying, it's like there
are levels to this. So I think that,

682
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,730
you know, when I come into
a room, people see a woman.

683
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:32,490
But I think first and foremost,
a lot of times they see a black woman.

684
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:37,100
I don't think I'm able to, you know,
I'm a woman now and no sort of like,

685
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,700
you know,
so I can only speak to mine.

686
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,510
But I think what I like it because
I think I find it empowering.

687
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:48,511
Like that's a double challenge that I'm
facing in society and for me to be able

688
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:52,120
to make it as far as I've made it be
able to sit here and address you all.

689
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:56,140
I mean, I think that that, I hope
that inspires other young black girls.

690
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:57,370
I hope that inspires people.

691
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,580
I don't want to make light of the
challenges that I face and say, oh no,

692
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:01,211
it's no problem.

693
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:04,240
Because I don't want other people who
are experiencing problems to think that

694
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:07,870
they, you know, are being singled
out. No, it's a problem usually.

695
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,110
But my hope is that by doing this
and by talking to more people,

696
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:15,130
it will be less of a problem until it's
not a problem at all. So that's the goal.

697
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:16,420
But that's an excellent question.

698
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,570
And I'm sure there are different people
that would answer it differently too.

699
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,040
There's,

700
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,480
there's this concept of allies I Google
because no matter how you identify,

701
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,520
right, you can have sponsors in the room
to make sure that your voice is heard.

702
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,330
And I think it's something that is work
in progress here and that we're also

703
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:38,910
trying to influence in the world. But, uh,
with the beautiful leaders, I mean, and I,

704
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:43,240
I love them that that's a priority because
I think sometimes we take for granted

705
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,820
that if you worked somewhere,
you'll get a mentor.

706
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:49,670
They'll just appear to you out of thin
air. No, people have to step up. Yeah.

707
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,230
And I think that that's great that
you're encouraging that. So that,

708
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:53,710
that's terrific.
Thank you.

709
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,120
Hi,
my name's Jonathan.

710
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,770
And first I just want to thank you
for taking the time to speak with us.

711
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,190
It's been a really powerful
message, uh, throughout your career.

712
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,970
You've had the opportunity to
work at a number of institutions,

713
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:08,840
large and small,
some that have gotten it right,

714
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,320
some that continued to get it wrong.

715
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:14,100
And you gave all those examples
earlier where it was almost like,

716
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,510
how could this happen?

717
00:40:15,511 --> 00:40:18,810
How could you get to this point in your
creative process or have you in your

718
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:19,644
execution?

719
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,910
And no one asks the question and the
checks and balances oftentimes came from

720
00:40:23,911 --> 00:40:27,390
the public. Uh, would love
to know, in your experience,

721
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,330
what are some of the hallmarks of
institutions that get it right?

722
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:34,380
And what are some of the checks and
balances they establish internally to make

723
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:39,030
sure that the product that they put out
is more reflective, is more diverse?

724
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,810
Well, that's a, that's a fantastic
question. And I'll say, to be fair,

725
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,180
obviously it's not just the
media industry. I mean, we
all saw that tone deaf. Um,

726
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,690
Kylie Jenner,

727
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,180
Pepsi ad where she solved black lives
matters issues with a carbonated beverage

728
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:58,530
and somebody bought space for that,
you know, and only until people said,

729
00:40:58,531 --> 00:41:02,000
what are you doing? Did they
pull the commercial? I've
never would have aired it.

730
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,100
You know, it was like a Saturday
night live sketch waiting to happen.

731
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:08,850
Like you did Lauren Michaels work
for him. Beyonce is black, right?

732
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,710
Yeah. So I well that wax figure, have you
seen that? They have her looking. Okay.

733
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:15,540
But anyway, we'll talk
about that later. But um,

734
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,840
I would say in terms
of checks and balances,

735
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:23,310
I think it's important to have people
of different backgrounds with different

736
00:41:23,311 --> 00:41:26,700
experiences in the room. Unfortunately,
especially in the United States,

737
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:31,590
I think we have a lot of segregation
at work and at home we have a lot of

738
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:33,680
segregation in terms of who we to.

739
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,440
So maybe some of these people didn't
have a friend that they could say, hey,

740
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:39,980
we're doing something at work and you
know, I, it's going to be pretty big.

741
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,500
I'd like to get your thoughts on it.
They may not have had that.

742
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:45,170
So if you don't have that in your friends
circle, you should have it at work.

743
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,570
And I think what you also need,
which is super important,

744
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,720
is you need to have people of color in
the leadership roles too because there

745
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,250
sometimes people in the room and
they're intimidated to speak.

746
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,310
Like when I got called in there for
that Hurricane Katrina conversation,

747
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:02,300
I did think they all seemingly have
made up their mind that it's okay to use

748
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:06,650
this term refugee. I might end up
getting in trouble and I might, you know,

749
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,940
I might jeopardize a promotion in the
future by being that girl that came in

750
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:12,590
here and told them what was what.

751
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,150
But my great grandmother marched with
Martin Luther King. I could not, you know,

752
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:20,210
and I'm not saying that like I'm
some martyr because guess what,

753
00:42:20,211 --> 00:42:21,860
I would have gotten another job I'm sure,

754
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:24,260
but I couldn't do it cause
I couldn't be the one.

755
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:27,350
I actually had readers call me when they
would see things wrong in the newspaper.

756
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,210
How did you sit up there
and let that happen?

757
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:32,590
So I also had that responsibility to
and I had to tell them, you know guys,

758
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,170
I can't control everything but I did
take my responsibility seriously.

759
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,510
Some of it is not only just
having people in the room,

760
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,950
empowering them to speak and also having
them at different levels of the company,

761
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,280
not just in the creative and out front
fields but in behind the scenes so that

762
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:48,410
they can stop it before it.
Even as you mentioned,

763
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:52,760
get so far up in the creative process
that you're already casting for Kylie's,

764
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:55,340
you know police officer,
she's going to hand the Pepsi too.

765
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,840
They should never have. No, that's a
number of happened honestly. No problem.

766
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:06,160
You mentioned fragmentation and how people
have like a great ability to control

767
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:07,930
what they see in her to interact with.

768
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,460
Do you think the media
landscape is getting a lot
more fragmented these days in

769
00:43:12,461 --> 00:43:17,170
terms of people being able to self select
more and more specific outlets and do

770
00:43:17,171 --> 00:43:20,080
you think that's going to present like
a big problem for the types of issues

771
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:20,840
we're talking about?

772
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,790
Well, I think it already
presented a big problem.

773
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:25,760
I think it has a lot to do with our
election results to be honest. I mean,

774
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:27,890
and not to get super political,

775
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:32,891
but there's proof that people
reading erroneous information,

776
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:37,430
people reading kind of
race baiting or just plain,

777
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,950
I'm not factual information had
an effect on the way people voted,

778
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,000
had an effect on the way
people came out to vote.

779
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:49,310
And I think we do live in a time where
you could be in a bubble if you want to,

780
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,900
if you decide to wake up and use one
news source for everything and only go to

781
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:55,160
those things that agree with you.

782
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:58,430
Like I'll admitted my in my
little circle of Facebook friends.

783
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,820
Most of us agree when someone doesn't,
it's really jarring,

784
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,510
but that's actually not a great
thing because then you're kind of,

785
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,240
you're being reinforced and you
think what you're doing is right.

786
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,450
You don't have any educated dissenter.
I'm not talking about a troll,

787
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:13,730
I'm talking about somebody who really
knows what they're talking about.

788
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,680
We are seeing more consolidation of
news entities teaming up and working

789
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:22,820
together because of a lack of resources.
They almost have to work together. But I,

790
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:26,600
I do think that's what I'm kind of
afraid of is that people will become so

791
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,230
disenchanted with the way
that the traditional media
is that they will just say,

792
00:44:30,231 --> 00:44:31,064
I'm not going to read that.

793
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,710
I'm just going to rely on this small blog
with like three people that don't have

794
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:37,710
enough people to do an investigative
bureau. And I'm going to do,

795
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,310
I'm going to go with whatever they say.
So I think it is a problem,

796
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:46,311
but we can head that off by bringing some
of those voices into the mainstream in

797
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:47,244
larger outlet.

798
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:52,750
Thank you. Thank you. You touched
on it on the issue with, uh,

799
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,910
the cost of journalism
and needing to be able to,

800
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,540
to sponsor and fund quality journalism.
Um,

801
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,740
but when we look at the
numbers and shifts, where in,

802
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:07,790
in terms of the minority will become the
majority at those ad dollars will need

803
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:10,010
to kind of be invested.

804
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,790
There was a question that came
in from one of the colleagues,

805
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,710
which was when you think of the
traditionally black publications, um,

806
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,720
their voice is really focused on,

807
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,470
on their audience with
this shift in demographics,

808
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,730
how do you see that?

809
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:30,000
Is that kind of evolution for those
publications to Ebony's jets in the world?

810
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,490
So that's a great question.
So

811
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,060
I can say from my personal experience
and what I observed and Wendy and Melissa

812
00:45:37,061 --> 00:45:41,800
yell out if I'm incorrect,
they worked with me, um, at
avenue when I was there. Uh,

813
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:47,220
sometimes advertisers seem to believe
that they can get advertising in these

814
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:51,550
black publications investing less than
they would for a mainstream outlet.

815
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,600
Even if they see that the numbers
that they're getting are very similar.

816
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,520
And I think that's another systemic issue.

817
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:01,090
The fact that you think you
should pay less for the same.

818
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:06,091
So that is a problem and it's hard to
really get hardcore with them because then

819
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:10,360
they can take their dollars and invest
digitally with some of these outlets that

820
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:14,200
may not be as established, but it
doesn't cost as much to invest that way.

821
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,440
But again, journalism does cost
money. Good journalism does.

822
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,770
You can't do investigations.
You can't be thorough. Sure.

823
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:24,400
You can write a lot of opinion pieces
that are based in existing fact,

824
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:27,730
but you can't do any deep digging
if you don't have money. So that,

825
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:28,660
that is an important thing.

826
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:32,170
And in one that I think
that the technology industry
could assist with if they

827
00:46:32,171 --> 00:46:34,870
could fund certain initiatives,
if they could help, um,

828
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:39,930
maybe invest in investigative arms or
invest in certain investigations period.

829
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,670
I think that that would
be helpful. Um, it's,

830
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:45,790
it's a very difficult question because
one would think that the shift in

831
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:48,400
demographics would mean a shift in budget,
but it hasn't.

832
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,860
And a lot of people point
to the fact that yes,

833
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:53,980
there are niche black publications.
But you know,

834
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:58,210
I grew up reading all of the different
magazines too. I even had a situation,

835
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:02,320
this was very recent where I went
to a car dealership, spoiler alert,

836
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:05,710
I did not buy the car cause I did not
like this guy's attitude. He said to me,

837
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:07,720
I told him where I worked
at the time it was ebony.

838
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,780
He came up with this wonderful anecdote,
you know, trying to relate to me.

839
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:13,180
He was like, you know what? You're going
to think this is funny. And I was like,

840
00:47:13,181 --> 00:47:14,270
oh my God,
I know I'm not going to.

841
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,310
He said to me that he loved
will Smith when he was a kid.

842
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,830
He would by will Smith on anything.
Didn't matter what it was.

843
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,580
He saw an avenue magazine with will Smith
on. He goes, so here I am, this kid.

844
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,680
I get up there and an Ebony magazine and
I'll be like, and the punchline is what?

845
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,710
And I was like,
every day that I buy a magazine,

846
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,880
these are not black magazines and no one,
the cashier has never stopped me. I, I'm,

847
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,410
I don't get the story.
You know,

848
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,320
why don't we just go back
to the dealership and then
I ended up buying a totally

849
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:42,820
different car.
But that's what I'm saying.

850
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:47,320
Like there's still this stigma and
thought that it'd be weird for a person

851
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:49,240
that's not black to buy this magazine.

852
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:53,500
But it's not weird for me
to buy a magazine that isn't
black owned and doesn't

853
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:57,850
have a black person on the cover. So,
and this happened last year, so it's not,

854
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,110
you know, some ancient tale I'm telling
and that says a lot about that situation.

855
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:06,970
Sound unfortunately it was for him
and it's failed to learn something.

856
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,020
You won't tell that story again. But hi.

857
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,160
Hi, my name is Latoya. I work on
a team called the news lab and um,

858
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,190
we are all about working with journalists
technologies to help build the future

859
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:23,720
of media. Um, I lead a piece of work on
the team call inclusive storytelling.

860
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,960
How do we elevate the voices that we
don't traditionally here in media?

861
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,220
I'm just going to point out one thing.

862
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:30,560
You mentioned that you need
sponsorships in dollars.

863
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,630
That's exactly what our tastes great.
Trying to, you know, increase. Uh,

864
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,980
we support the IDA B Wells
Society for instance,

865
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:40,970
which is about training journalists of
colors to be investigative journalist.

866
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:45,710
I wanted to ask you your thoughts on
what more technology companies can do.

867
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,521
If you think about,

868
00:48:46,521 --> 00:48:50,390
you made the point about Pepsi and
people of Color not having a seat at the

869
00:48:50,391 --> 00:48:53,930
table and not being in positions
of power to say something.

870
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,530
When we think about newsrooms, I think
we've seen the numbers, the leadership,

871
00:48:57,531 --> 00:49:02,420
I think it's 86% of editorial
directors, so on or white men. Right?

872
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,470
How do you change that? What does
it take to shake up the newsrooms?

873
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,620
Is it a matter of just hiring more people,
going to find them?

874
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,850
What's the role of technology company can
play and really inspiring that change?

875
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,300
It's something we think about. We don't
have the answers, but it seems to,

876
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,900
that change comes down to getting
more people with a seat at the table,

877
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:23,180
but how do we make that happen?

878
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:23,681
Well,

879
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:28,330
you know I I really liked
and was encouraged by what
Google is doing with Howard

880
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:32,680
University by creating this space where
people of the university and students

881
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:35,920
are interacting directly
with Google employees, seeing
what their future can be,

882
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:37,150
seeing what the potential is.

883
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:40,810
Something to that effect in the area
of journalism I think would be very

884
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:44,200
impactful. I do think like what
you mentioned, the Ida B wells,

885
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:45,190
that sounds amazing.

886
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:48,820
I also noted that Google is going to be
a partner in evaluating the number of

887
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:51,400
minorities in journalism for next year,
which is great.

888
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,610
Having that transparency is extremely
important because how can we fix the

889
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:57,130
problem if we don't even
know the full scope of it?

890
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:01,660
Maybe you using technology
tools to create, um,

891
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:06,930
job bank databases or
helping create programs or
fellowships that pay a stipend.

892
00:50:07,391 --> 00:50:07,991
As I mentioned,

893
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:12,130
the problem about news entities not
paying or paying below standard,

894
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,510
maybe in some way trying to help boost
that amount of pay so that people can

895
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:19,450
afford to enter the industry.
And then training.

896
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:23,440
So in Abj offers amazing training for
managers and people want to go into the

897
00:50:23,441 --> 00:50:27,470
management track supporting those efforts
so that you don't just have people who

898
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:31,190
are the writers and they get on CNN
and yeah, everybody knows them by name,

899
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:34,970
but they don't necessarily have as
much power behind the scenes as these

900
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:38,240
producers and these other people who are
telling them where to go and what to do

901
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:39,140
and what to focus on.

902
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:43,280
So I think that what you mentioned is
a great start and just continuing to do

903
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:47,150
that and also making it easier
to find people are candidates.

904
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:49,150
It would be important. I think, um,

905
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,390
technology is very helpful in that it
connects people that might not otherwise

906
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:54,140
be connected.

907
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,200
But what I find that it does a lot of
times is it just makes it easier to

908
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:58,730
connect with those you already know.

909
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,120
And I would love to see some
technologies that push you beyond that.

910
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,610
One of my mentors and former managers,

911
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:07,910
Jane Huert that worked at the Tribune
Redeye what I love about her is that she

912
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:10,490
would go out of her way to
go find people of color,

913
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:15,290
people representing different areas
of the gender spectrum. She did this,

914
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,630
you know, with a conscious
thought, this is what I'm doing.

915
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:22,010
And not in a way of this
is a token higher, but this
is a super talented person.

916
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,380
I'm going to work with this person.

917
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:26,690
I'm gonna make sure that they feel
welcome to make sure that their voices are

918
00:51:26,691 --> 00:51:29,180
heard. She will ask you, what do
you think about this? You know,

919
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:31,730
in a way that doesn't make it feel
like you're being pigeon holed.

920
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:32,270
And I think it's,

921
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:36,470
it's also that the manager mindset of
not bringing someone in so you can just

922
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,650
take a staff picture and look
like you're doing something,

923
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:43,130
but really making them part of the
process. And she did that really well.

924
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:47,750
So I bring her up as an example of what
I would love to see more managers do and

925
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:52,130
I'll be at nab and get to it. Okay. I'm
sure you will. New Orleans. All right.

926
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:01,410
So there's this photo on this screen
that I have to ask. What's the story?

927
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:06,910
I just liked the way I look
at it. No one's going to
fail. So I went on the real,

928
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:11,080
uh, I think it was wet in the, the
end of last year. Yeah. December, uh,

929
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,040
to talk about,

930
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:15,670
which is another important thing and
something that companies can support.

931
00:52:15,671 --> 00:52:19,630
It's like the root does their own
version of this. A lot of entities do.

932
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,490
The power 100,
uh,

933
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,090
for Ebony was a way to highlight
people that are doing great things,

934
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:27,820
not just entertainment and
celebrity that you see every day,

935
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,250
but people in technology,
people in nonprofit,

936
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,090
people in the business
world and initiatives like
that are important because

937
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:36,970
again,
it's that see it to be it mentality.

938
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,610
So I was really happy to go on
there and the ladies were lovely.

939
00:52:39,611 --> 00:52:42,820
They were very kind, you know, I didn't
get to drink whatever was in that mug.

940
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:46,090
I'm not sure what it is to
this day. But yeah, it was,

941
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:49,300
it was a great and empowering
experience. So I, I think we just,

942
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,040
we need more initiatives like that.

943
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:54,940
There are many people of color across
the globe doing terrific things.

944
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:58,720
It saddens me that sometimes those
people don't get the attention that they

945
00:52:58,721 --> 00:53:03,070
deserve. And I think that if we can work
on our media coverage work on our media

946
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:05,980
newsrooms,
we will see more of that.

947
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,920
And in the problem will
not vanish overnight,

948
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,050
but we will make a lot more progress.

949
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,420
We are strong believers.
Our CEO has even said it,

950
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:19,430
a mix of diverse perspective and ideas
and backgrounds will only lead to better

951
00:53:19,471 --> 00:53:24,150
products and better experiences.
Right. And I, I'm hopeful.

952
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,220
Um,
I guess as a

953
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,540
final question,

954
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:32,570
it would be what are you most excited
about for the next couple of years?

955
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,840
What I'm most excited about is two folds.

956
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:41,841
I'm excited by people of color deciding
that they will invest and create media

957
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:47,750
outlets,
show TV shows that they were showcased,

958
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:50,850
their talents and that they're doing
that and that they're getting a reception

959
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:53,160
for that. They're not waiting
around, they're not begging people,

960
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:55,500
please write me in or please cast me.

961
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,600
They're taking matters
into their own hands.

962
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:02,601
I think we're seeing a wave of content
creators of color that are making a big

963
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:04,200
splash.
It's not a niche thing.

964
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:06,420
It's not something that just a
handful of people are seeing.

965
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,260
You see that with Easter Ray. Um,
you see that with Donald Glover.

966
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,720
These are not people that
are just trying to be stars.

967
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:15,240
They're trying to make
opportunities for other people.

968
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:18,740
And I think that that's great. Jordan
Peele as well. Um, the other thing I,

969
00:54:18,741 --> 00:54:21,900
I'm a very excited about and some people
in the industry might disagree with me

970
00:54:21,901 --> 00:54:23,280
on this is the audience power.

971
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,990
I love that the audience can get you
right together really fast. You know,

972
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,280
I, I used to, when I was in the newsroom,

973
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,400
I know people used to hate
when the phone would ring.

974
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,840
They'd hate emails from the public.

975
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:36,090
I love them because that's
how I can do a better job.

976
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:39,270
How can I do a better job if I
have no idea what the reception is?

977
00:54:39,271 --> 00:54:42,300
There were some people who live in this
little ivory tower and they think that

978
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:45,870
the public doesn't have the savvy
to comment on what they're doing,

979
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:47,340
but you're doing it for them.

980
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:50,880
So why can't they have a two
way conversation with you?

981
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,640
I love the fact that people
get dragged on Twitter.

982
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:57,390
Sometimes it's funnier than others. I
think it's appropriate though. It's,

983
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:01,490
you're putting something out there.
You can't dictate to me what I'm going to,

984
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:05,850
to engage in or what I'm going
to like or hate. And I love that.

985
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:09,240
So I think we're seeing power
to the people. So to speak,

986
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,670
and also power to the creators.

987
00:55:11,671 --> 00:55:15,600
And that I think is exhilarating and
