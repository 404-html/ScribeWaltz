1
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,763
Yeah.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,890
Thank you all for coming today
for this talks at Google.

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,360
I'm on anxiety and kids,
um, where Dr Jana courts,

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,090
we'll be talking about her book,
Heroic Henrietta,

5
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:24,091
which is a children's book aimed at
helping kids and parents deal with anxiety

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,910
in our kids or for the
kids and themselves. Um,

7
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:32,530
so I want to introduce Dr Jana carts.
You rented her own practice in Boston,

8
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:36,760
asthma at psychology and Andy Hirsch
who is a teacher who helped with the

9
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:40,360
illustrations. So I will let them
come up and get the stock started.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,313
Thank you for coming.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,090
Okay.

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,730
Um, so like Danielle said,
my name is Dr Jana. Cora.

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,770
I am a licensed clinical psychologist and
I also specialize in treating children

14
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:58,270
adolescence. I own a boutique group
therapy practice that's in Cambridge,

15
00:00:58,271 --> 00:00:59,380
Boston and Nantucket.

16
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:03,760
And we have about 10 clinicians that
work for us and they treat children,

17
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:08,050
teenagers and adults both for therapy
and neuro psych and psych testing,

18
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:11,050
which I'll show you what we'll touch upon
a little bit later about what that is.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,400
Um, and this is Annie, so she'll
introduce herself in a second.

20
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:18,790
I just wanted to start by actually
telling the story of how we met,

21
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,970
which is sort of, which is
relevant to this conversation. Um,

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,690
so I had always wanted to
make a book like this. Um,

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,510
and actually we're turning it into a
series which I will also touch upon later

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,170
because anxiety is a really a big issue
for a lot of people and especially

25
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:34,240
children and it's very misunderstood.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,740
It's misdiagnosed and I thought it would
be really important to have an easy

27
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:42,250
access book where kids could understand
what was happening to them and also

28
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:44,470
parents could understand
and help their kids with it.

29
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,950
So I was taking a shower last summer.
It was very hot out. I was, you know,

30
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,670
getting ready to go to a dinner party.
And this book just came to my,

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,600
like just came to me and um,

32
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,290
a lot of the stanzas rhyme and it
was all flowing through my mind.

33
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,530
I was like really jazzed about
it. So I get a shower, I'm like,

34
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:05,250
we're going to be late for this thing.
And my husband was so mad and I was like,

35
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:07,900
just like dripping now. Like writing
it all down. It was really exciting.

36
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,050
So I'm like really excited about this
book and I can't wait to tell my friends

37
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:15,100
about it. So I, you know, I busted
into this dinner party super late. Um,

38
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,760
you know, and everyone's sort of looking
at me like a Kramer hindrance, you know,

39
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:21,960
and I'm like, I, I came up with this
book about this Unicorn that has anxiety,

40
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,430
it's for kids. And I came up with it
in the shower. Isn't that awesome?

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,900
And everyone just stared at me and was
very like sort of scattered, you know.

42
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,830
And except for Annie who had only met a
couple of times before who came up to me

43
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:35,140
and said it was really interested
in hearing more about it.

44
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:38,740
So I told her a little bit about my idea.
She read a stanza, she took my notebook,

45
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,930
she sketched out what you see behind you.
And she explained,

46
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,930
explained to me that she was a teacher
and she also felt this book was really

47
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:47,764
important.

48
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,570
And obviously we went for it and we have
another one coming out in a month or so.

49
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,750
And so I will let any doing a brief
introduction of herself and then we'll get

50
00:02:55,751 --> 00:03:00,500
going. So as Dan said, I'm Hirshhorn. Um,

51
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,770
I am here because I illustrated the buck.
Um,

52
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,830
but I also do come from the perspective
as Jana said of having taught for the

53
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:09,670
past seven years.

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,330
I taught in independent schools in
Seattle and then most recently spent three

55
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,740
years here in Boston teaching
in charter schools. Um,

56
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,870
so when we sort of get to the Q and, a,
which is often the most fun with kids,

57
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:24,430
at least, I'm sure it's adults too.
Um, I would love to talk about Antioch,

58
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,420
Austin's about illustrating,

59
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,170
but also I do have that perspective and
I'm going to share a bit about just sort

60
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:34,171
of what the teacher viewpoint is working
with kids who show symptoms of anxiety,

61
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,640
what it looks like working with parents.
Um,

62
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,480
and so if you have questions about that
as well. Yeah, and we're pretty informal,

63
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:43,390
so if you guys want to interrupt,
feel free and you can throw those.

64
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,240
Although I prefer if you just interrupted.
Um,

65
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:49,090
so the way we're going to work it today
is we will start and talk a little bit

66
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:52,150
about anxiety,
namely generalized anxiety disorder,

67
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:56,650
and we'll talk about symptoms both in
terms of cognitive and physical symptoms

68
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,484
of that.

69
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,510
We'll then talk about the treatments that
people will use or ways that they can

70
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:02,141
help themselves,

71
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,810
which will be told through Henry
on his journey and her book there.

72
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,600
So that's sort of the main
outline and obviously you guys,

73
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,060
if you have questions do interrupt.

74
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,240
So we also are going to focus mainly on
generalized anxiety disorder there and

75
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,110
we'll just call it Gad for short.
Um,

76
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,320
there are a lot of other kinds
of anxiety disorders that exist.

77
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,840
So things like social phobia,
OCD,

78
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,880
those are pretty popular
ones that people know about.

79
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,310
So we are not going to
touch upon that today.

80
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,770
So we're just going to really focus on
this because this is what the book is

81
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,250
about. And usually this is what
affects a lot of individuals.

82
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,220
I'll also say that we
talking about children,

83
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:38,140
but a lot of this applies
to adults as well.

84
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,450
You would just sort of
sophisticate the language. So,

85
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,570
I don't know if that will be relevant,
but I won't say that every time,

86
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,280
but just know it does
apply to adults as well.

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,120
And then this thing I wanted to
ask everyone, does everybody,

88
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,290
does anyone know what the DSM is? Have you
guys heard of that? You do? You do. Okay.

89
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,090
Um,
for those of you who don't,

90
00:04:55,091 --> 00:05:00,091
it is the book that lists all the
recognize psychological disorders and they

91
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:04,450
come out with a new one every couple
of years. And so this is the criteria.

92
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,470
They say, you know, the symptoms that you
must meet the coach have criteria for a,

93
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,670
for Gad. Um, one thing just
to keep in mind, just I think
it's kind of interesting.

94
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,670
So the book changes over time.
So people,

95
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,250
they will take in and out different
diagnosis. And the most common,

96
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,370
most popular one from the last
iteration of all this is Asperger's,

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,280
which is a really popular
diagnosis for quite some time.

98
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,840
But they actually took it out of this
most recent DSM and now those individuals

99
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:32,200
are supposed to be encompassed more
under autism spectrum or social

100
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,450
communication disorder.
So things vary over time.

101
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,360
But right now this is what,

102
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,450
what we're looking at and this is sort
of what a lot of the physicians and

103
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:43,720
psychologists recognize and think
about when they think about generalized

104
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,690
anxiety disorder.
So not surprisingly,

105
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:50,530
this is about excessive worry and
being unable to control that worry.

106
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,000
There's also a variety of other
symptoms that are pretty typical,

107
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,060
including really can read them
restlessness. I can't even read them.

108
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,320
Oh, being easily fatigued, right?
Concentration, irritability,

109
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,060
muscle tension and sleep disturbances.

110
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:06,980
That can also be appetite
problems as well.

111
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,340
And really it's sort of having these
things happen to you and also sort of

112
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
meeting the threshold of
impairing functioning.

113
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,710
So that's sort of the threshold
that psychologist also think about.

114
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,720
Does this impact you really put up quite
a bit to the point that social stuff is

115
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:27,230
very difficult. Occupational stuff's
very difficult school, things like that.

116
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:28,490
So that's kind of the threshold there.

117
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,760
And just relating to that,

118
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,320
this is sort of the beginning of
definitely where the psychologist and the

119
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,570
teachers and parents all come together.

120
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,560
We obviously can see a lot
of these at school. Um,

121
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,590
I found I was spending a lot more
hours with a lot of the kids,

122
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:49,670
then their parents, um, just naturally
how the hours of school go. So,

123
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,080
so of course we do see some of this.
Um,

124
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,570
but of course it's where it can really
important for us to be communicating that

125
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:00,380
to parents and also parents sort
of communicating with the AC to us.

126
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,410
Other symptoms are that are
pretty common or sematic symptoms,

127
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:05,820
which I'm sure a lot of you know about.

128
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:09,900
But basically sematic symptoms are
physical manifestations of psychological

129
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:13,950
difficulties and important to keep
in mind too is that these are pretty,

130
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:17,460
can be pretty severe and these are
things that people do experience.

131
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:20,940
So the example I like to give is I think
we've all had a time where maybe we've

132
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,880
had like the stomach flu or something
pretty gross like that and it's really

133
00:07:23,881 --> 00:07:25,800
painful and just knocks us out.

134
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,300
And so people who have anxiety can have
symptoms that severe but without sort of

135
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:34,200
the virus or the medical component.
So we'll see a lot of kids who come in,

136
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,850
they've been to four or five different
doctors and nobody can corner come up

137
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:41,430
with a reason why they might be having
stomach aches or headaches or something

138
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:42,120
like that.

139
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,750
And that's when they sort of get referred
to us for therapy because they think

140
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:48,150
that, you know, the mind body
connection there is pretty strong.

141
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,100
That's again,
a lot of this we will see at school,

142
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:56,120
kids ask them to put their head down,
no, I just feel tired. We noticed that,

143
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:56,450
you know,

144
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,870
they're regulated like not taking the
school lunch and not just because it looks

145
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:02,070
unappetizing there's like a real change.
Um,

146
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,230
and that's often a time where we do
sort of reach out to parents and, Hey,

147
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:07,100
have you noticed anything?

148
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:11,490
And we've found that sometimes
parents don't realize it's,

149
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,210
that it's good to communicate with
the school things like, oh yeah,

150
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,970
Bobby hasn't slept for three nights.
Like that might be part of it.

151
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:20,720
And we're like, Oh God, that would have
been really good to know. Um, that, that,

152
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:25,070
that makes sense. Um, so I
think we feel like, you know,

153
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,220
that it's a really important opportunity
where we share what we're seeing,

154
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,821
but really,

155
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:32,780
really helpful to the school when parents
give feedback and we start to get a

156
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:34,190
more complete picture.

157
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,040
And I think sometimes that can be
missed. Two, because kids have a lot of,

158
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,200
they're not necessarily sophisticated,

159
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,350
sophisticated enough to have the language
to speak very specifically about these

160
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:46,410
things. So it's sort of like,
you know, my, my body hurts.

161
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,210
I don't want to go to school.
Sort of crying,

162
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:50,130
not really being able to
articulate these things.

163
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,350
And I think that's sort of also
where, you know, school, um,

164
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,930
participation and things like that come
play. So here we go with Henrietta.

165
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,550
So the first,
well I would say as the first treatment,

166
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:06,210
what kind of treatment and technique
that we put in the book, um,

167
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,410
was partly cognitive behavioral therapy,
which is CBT for short.

168
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,900
I know a lot of you are
pretty familiar with CBT,

169
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:17,730
but basically the idea behind it is sort
of figure out how your cognitions are

170
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,710
affecting your actions,
behavior,

171
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:22,050
emotions and where that's
getting people into trouble.

172
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,590
And a lot of that's based in what we
call cognitive distortions, which,

173
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,230
I mean there are many of them,
but things like black and white thinking,

174
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,630
catastrophizing,
fortune telling,

175
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:33,960
which is sort of thinking you can predict
the future generalization and things

176
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:38,310
like that. So we kind of look at those
cognitions and then we say, okay, what,

177
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,350
what is the percentage
chances is going to happen?

178
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,310
What are alternative explanations and
is this really a risk factor for you?

179
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,790
So we'll take Henrietta
here for as an example.

180
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,440
So she's afraid she's going to get an f.
So you know, we see this a lot in kids,

181
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:56,430
but their train of thought is pretty
long and distorted and that, you know,

182
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:59,220
I'm gonna fail this test and then my
teacher is going to be mad at me and then

183
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:01,500
I'm not going to have any friends and
they're not be able to go to school and my

184
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:05,160
life will be over. And you know,
that's really how they feel.

185
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,580
And so what we do is we first try
to search for some facts, right?

186
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:12,360
And we wouldn't necessarily do this with
a kid who is not proficient at school,

187
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,420
but we'll just assume that Henrietta is
a good student. And we would say, okay,

188
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:19,740
like have you historically failed a lot
of tests? You know, what are your grades?

189
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,680
And sort of wondering about that in
terms of what you're afraid of is not

190
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:25,350
necessarily congruent to
what's happened to you before.

191
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,980
We might also talk about other things
that could happen, you know. Okay,

192
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:32,940
so you could get an a, you could fail,
but could you get a B? Could you get a c,

193
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,030
could you get a d? What does that
look like? Is there extra credit?

194
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,220
Like is the test cancel
because there's a fire alarm?

195
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,600
Like it could be a number of things.

196
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,050
And then we would look at sort of the
percentage chance of each of those things

197
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,630
happening. And with kids,
you know, who are younger,

198
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,050
you'd sort of modify the language but
they can kind of understand if you do like

199
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:52,290
pie charts and things like
that. And over time, you know,

200
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:56,250
you want to let them understand that
the percentage chance of these very

201
00:10:56,251 --> 00:11:00,540
individual things lining up to have this
catastrophic ending sure as possible

202
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,990
but probably not very likely.
And so how likely is it really?

203
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:07,050
And you would just sort of put percentages
based on those things to kind of get

204
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:11,340
a more realistic understanding of what
is going on. So Henry and is doing that,

205
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,950
just searching for facts.
She's doing a great job.

206
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,250
Deep breathing is another one that's
really popular, especially with kids. Um,

207
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,750
and as part of the mindfulness movement,

208
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,120
which I know a lot of people are also
familiar with and I will actually touch

209
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,500
upon that at the end.

210
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,390
So kids are actually really good at
this because a lot of kids as they're

211
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,570
younger, they breathe out of their
bellies instead of their chests.

212
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,860
And as we become adults,

213
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,910
we read more with our chest and
belly breathing actually triggers the

214
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:40,380
parasympathetic nervous system,

215
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:43,740
which is the nervous system
that's associated with resting.

216
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,920
And so they're already sort of
predisposed to be good at this.

217
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,760
And so we have them sort of lie down
oftentimes with younger kids will do the

218
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:53,800
visualization piece. So you
can see here at Henrietta, uh,

219
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,570
has her a little boat and
her island and um, yeah. And,

220
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,220
and the plane and you know, we have
kids lie down and they take, you know,

221
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,440
like beanie babies or whatever.
Kids have these days,

222
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,620
a little toys and you'd have them put it
on their stomach and they would try to

223
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:11,920
try to see if they could make the animal
go up and down and that sort of how you

224
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:13,960
teach it to them.
And it can be really helpful.

225
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:17,950
I think a lot of people may see it as a,
like a little hippy dippy,

226
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:20,590
but it does actually work.
There's a lot of research about that.

227
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:25,300
So we had Henrietta try that out, she's
killing it. And I find that adults,

228
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,060
when I have talked to them and show them
the book or like this is, this is me,

229
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,930
this is the one I liked the best.
This is my life.

230
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:36,640
So I find this is often a page that
adults identify with. Yeah. Yeah.

231
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:40,300
And like I said, a lot of it does
apply to adults. Um, and you know,

232
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,790
you can do it with or without
the visualization piece as well.

233
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,890
This is my favorite one.

234
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,670
So asking for help is actually something
that a lot of people don't consider

235
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:51,940
would be very difficult for kids,
but especially if they're anxious.

236
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,550
They like the idea of asking
for help and being exposed.

237
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:56,710
He's like horrifying to them.

238
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,900
So just making a plan of where they
get anxious the most. Who can they ask,

239
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,920
how can they ask, when do they ask?
And having a really concrete plan.

240
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,880
And that's really helpful because not
only do they feel better having the plan,

241
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,070
you know,
so that helps reduce their anxiety,

242
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,370
but they also feel comfortable that
the plan that they have is not going to

243
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,130
expose them in some way. Like the other
students aren't going to find out.

244
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,180
Maybe they have a code word
with the teachers, you know,

245
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:23,470
they can do it any which way.

246
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,550
But really making a solid plan for as
many scenarios as possible like throughout

247
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:30,550
their day or the activities is a really,
really good one.

248
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,490
And I mean it works obviously very well.

249
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,480
So I don't know if you ever had that at
school with you know, a little secret.

250
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,430
Yeah.

251
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,030
Just situations eating their timeout
and whether it was like a formal IEP

252
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,751
diagnosis,

253
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:46,690
if we were at that phase or it was just
sort of they were manifesting some of

254
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:51,310
these symptoms that yeah, there are ways
that we can work out to take that time.

255
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,720
Um, you know, for them to take that
time that they need. And I also,

256
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:59,030
I did a picture of a coach in this one.
I sort of um,

257
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,960
brainstorm with my own partner
and with Janet about, you know,

258
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,720
what is that support network looking like?

259
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:08,920
You just sort of a visual reminder
that like there are more than,

260
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:11,380
there's parents, there's
teachers, there's your doctors,

261
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:15,070
but there's also like you have other
adults and networks in your life.

262
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,830
And I think my partner spice
because he's a soccer coach,

263
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,040
he was like definitely a cut.

264
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,180
But the point being that maybe sometimes
we forget and especially kids like how

265
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:27,970
wide are network of support is.
Yeah, that's a really good point.

266
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,970
So worry time is also a really great one.
Um,

267
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,390
and this can be done
several different ways.

268
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:36,790
So obviously its little self explanatory,

269
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:41,140
but basically you give kids a certain
period of time during the day that they

270
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:45,070
can just let those thoughts run wild.
So whatever they want to worry about,

271
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,420
ruminate about,
that's fine.

272
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,830
Obviously you have to tailor that to kids
depending on how anxious they are and

273
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:51,920
who they are.
So you know,

274
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,740
two minutes and an anxious child
life is a really long time.

275
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:57,770
So you'd want to sort of work with
them to figure out what is actually

276
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,160
manageable. And it could be, you
know, 30 seconds, four times a day.

277
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:05,780
It really just depends. And they would
have this time to just let it all out.

278
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,220
And then the idea would be like,
okay,

279
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:10,100
now I'm gonna put it in this box and
I'm going to shelve it for later.

280
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,130
And this is helpful for a
lot of different reasons,

281
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:16,370
but there's also sort of like a
Meta anxiety that people have.

282
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:18,830
So not only are they anxious, but now
they're anxious if they're anxious.

283
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,090
And so there can be a lot of
additional worry about, you know,

284
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:24,710
if I don't think about
these things all the time,

285
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:27,470
I won't find out the solution
and won't be able to help myself.

286
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
And so knowing that you
have this time to do that,

287
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:32,200
it makes it actually easier to
not think about those things, uh,

288
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,840
over the course of the rest of the day.
And a lot of people will talk about like,

289
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:38,300
well, just don't think about it, think
about something else. But you know,

290
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:41,620
if someone tells you not to think
about a giant pink polar bear,

291
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,890
like just really don't think about that.

292
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:44,510
All you're gonna think
about is dry pink over.

293
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,070
So it's a really hard thing for kids
to do or anybody really. And um,

294
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,400
younger kids, well teenagers like
this, do they pretend they don't,

295
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:55,700
but they do is when you can actually
have a physical box where, you know,

296
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:58,550
kids will write down their worries and
put it in there and maybe the box has a

297
00:15:58,551 --> 00:15:59,384
lock on it.

298
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,800
And that's a way for them to really have
this concrete place where things are

299
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:06,200
actually held. And especially
for kids who have an imagination.

300
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,900
I mean they all have imaginations,
but kids who are really imaginative,

301
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,350
that's really helpful too because they
really do imagine it to hold these things

302
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,690
for them, which is really nice. Um,

303
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,600
and teenagers do like it as well.

304
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,400
So back to mindfulness. Um, again,

305
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,510
mindfulness is probably something
you guys are familiar with,

306
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,430
but the basic concept is trying
to keep your mind in the present.

307
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,300
And this is especially relevant to anxiety
because a lot of anxiety is based on

308
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:35,150
things that have happened in the past as
well as things that are going to happen

309
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,640
in the future and very
rarely as anxiety based.

310
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:39,320
And what is happening like right now.

311
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,470
So helping kids kind of focus
back to now it can be really,

312
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:44,720
really successful and
reducing their anxiety.

313
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,620
So bubbles isn't an easy way to
do that because it's an activity.

314
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:51,410
Kids really like it and you
can kind of try to get them to,

315
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,130
how big can it get before it pops
or how far can it go before it pops?

316
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,860
Or can you get four little
bubbles in one really big one.

317
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,190
And so they're focused on that and
that kind of allows them to become more

318
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:05,060
present in the moment. Other things, kids
love textures of all, they love food,

319
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:07,940
but textures of food is a great
way to also do mindfulness.

320
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:11,330
And I really like using raisins because
they're kind of weird on the outside

321
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,240
with the texture and the inside is
different. They're a little granular,

322
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:14,871
it's sweets.

323
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:18,290
You have kids really eat something and
then really explain what it is they are

324
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,860
eating and does the tastes change
over time in like immense detail.

325
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:26,480
And that can also be a
mindfulness activity. Observing
details kind of similar.

326
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,650
You live on a busy road,

327
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:31,610
you sit with them outside and you say
how many blue cars can you spot in six

328
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:35,690
minutes or whatever it
is. Um, yeah, so those,

329
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:37,850
those are really good activities.
I actually for adults,

330
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,150
and it was like to add this in, I did
not know that you can balance an egg.

331
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,730
I don't know everyone. I mean I
didn't know that until Grad school.

332
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,350
You can actually balance x like this way.

333
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,070
And so trying to get an act to
balance is actually really hard.

334
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,980
So that is also considered a mindfulness
activity because you're focusing on

335
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:55,860
these sort of various specific
movements of this egg. And so that's,

336
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:59,670
it can bring you back to the beginning.
We just wanted to touch upon medications.

337
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:02,160
I am not a psychiatrist,
I do not prescribe medications,

338
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:06,060
but I think a lot of people sort of
see anxiety and medication as one.

339
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,190
And this is just in the story,
you know,

340
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:11,550
Henrietta skills work really well so
she doesn't need to take any medication.

341
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,470
And that is just to point
out that sometimes it's
helpful, sometimes it's not.

342
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,980
And just to keep those different
possibilities in mind. Um, again,

343
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:22,920
they can be really helpful and really
necessary for a lot of people for a lot of

344
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:26,310
things. But sometimes just giving kids
just a little bit more coping skills and

345
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:29,760
different strategies is really
pretty effective. And it's enough.

346
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,170
And in teaching it's, I've
seen a wide range of, uh,

347
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,030
especially because I have
mostly taught sixth grade.

348
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,120
So the kids are really
coming in to middle school.

349
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:43,650
They're bodies are really
starting that change. So the
physical, emotional, social.

350
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:48,651
So it's a time when a lot of things like
anxiety might start to really manifest

351
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,030
at the same time. It's a time when
parents are not sure about medication,

352
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:56,850
they're concerned, they're just maybe
starting to talk to a pediatrician.

353
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,230
They relaxed and talk to a pediatrician.
Um,

354
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,030
and then sometimes when we
do have students who families
do you make the choice

355
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:05,030
to try medication.
Um,

356
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,970
it's another time where
it's really important for us
to be reporting what we're

357
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:11,640
seeing at school and then
to reporting back to us.

358
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,790
Maybe seeing a theme of what teachers
love when it comes to parents.

359
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:18,840
Like tell him this. But you see,
um, because it is a time, you know,

360
00:19:18,841 --> 00:19:23,670
I've seen students who are really assisted
in some ways the medication and at

361
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:26,750
the same time there are side effects
that are concerning. You know, they,

362
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,210
they're not eating, they're not showing
that same aspect of their personality.

363
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,090
And it's just an important conversation.

364
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,630
It can have a wide range of impacts
on a wide range of kids. And it's so,

365
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:40,340
so great when parents and teachers
can have that back and forth. Right.

366
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,040
So other considerations that we'll talk
about really briefly before the question

367
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,090
section, if you guys have
any, um, anxiety versus Adhd,

368
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:49,500
which is my favorite thing to talk about.

369
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,260
And also our role as caregivers and
some things to keep in mind if you are

370
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:56,010
having or you're around
kids were having anxiety.

371
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:02,450
So anxiety and ADHD especially in
children can look virtually the same.

372
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,480
So things like difficulty concentrating,
irritability, hard time sitting,

373
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:11,110
still not able to pay attention, not
able to remember anything those can eat.

374
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,360
Both of those fall into these
symptoms of anxiety or Adhd.

375
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,990
So our practice actually gets a ton
of referrals for neuropsych testing,

376
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:22,680
which is basically the standardized
measures that we give kids that help us

377
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,490
understand how their brain is working.
So things like verbal ability,

378
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,990
nonverbal ability,
processing speed,

379
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,680
all the things with executive functioning
that have to do with Adhd. So planning,

380
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,590
organization, impulsivity,
things like that.

381
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,320
And that's how you really get
a clear diagnosis of Adhd.

382
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,170
And a lot of now a lot of
psychiatrists won't actually prescribe,

383
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,240
especially to kids without that.
So we get,

384
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,540
we see a lot of that in our practice
of what's going on for this person.

385
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,440
And honestly,
more times than not,

386
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,310
we're taking away ADHD diagnoses because
it really is a lot of anxiety and we

387
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:54,940
actually have separate test to
test that to [inaudible]. Um,

388
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,030
and so we will kind of use both
of those tools to figure that out.

389
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,700
But kids in general,
you know,

390
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:04,360
they have like three or four symptoms
that they have no matter what's going on

391
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:07,630
for them. So they're externalizing, so
they're causing their behavioral problems.

392
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,760
They're causing a Ruckus,
they're internalizing,

393
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:13,690
so they're anxious or they're depressed
or they are just sort of not paying

394
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:16,090
attention.
And I wouldn't say dissociating,

395
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:19,120
but they're kind of in their own world.
They're kind of spacey. And over time,

396
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:22,000
all of those symptoms become more and
more specific and sort of blossom into

397
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:25,780
different things. So it often look,
things look very similar in the beginning.

398
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,390
So something to keep in mind. And then
also just as our role as caregivers, um,

399
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,990
you know, our own anxieties can be
transferred to children really easily.

400
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,550
They are very perceptive and they pick
up things that are amazing that you think

401
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:42,790
they would never pick up. And so,
and I know for like my own self,

402
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,370
like my mom grew up in the Bronx
and like a pretty bad neighborhood,

403
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:49,810
so she's really adamant about lock
checking. So doors, windows, cars,

404
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:52,780
even though we grew up in a neighborhood
where people have their doors open all

405
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:53,614
the time.

406
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,790
And so I now in anyone will tell you
yesterday I always shy even the lack

407
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:02,110
checkers, especially if the doors
as we two or three times. Yeah.

408
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,610
Just one more time.
Um,

409
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,880
and that's not because I really
think that it's not locked.

410
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,930
Just sort of this anxiety
I picked up from my mom,

411
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,040
so we can definitely do that to our
kids or other kids were taking care of,

412
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,990
and it's not our fault,
but just something to be mindful of.

413
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,340
So if we're able to sort of manage that
a little bit, we can. Um, also the,

414
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,380
the rule of reassurance, it was really
hard to negotiate because, you know,

415
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:25,480
when a kid comes to you and
they're distressed and you know,

416
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:28,390
they're wondering like, you know, is this
going to happen? Is that going to happen?

417
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:31,660
You always want to say like, no, it's
okay, these are going to be fine.

418
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,230
But the problem with that is if they are
coming too often and they're doing that

419
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,040
a lot,

420
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,950
then they're not actually learning how
to manage the anxiety of themselves and

421
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:43,180
then they're sort of relying more on
you and then that becomes a problem too

422
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:44,200
because you know,

423
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:46,570
you're not there all the time and
maybe they're in a classroom where the

424
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:49,660
teachers in doing that or maybe they're
just sleep over and no one can answer

425
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:53,560
that question for them and they have
a really hard time managing and,

426
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,360
and it kind of explodes and gets worse.

427
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,280
So it's kind of a funny line to find.
I don't necessarily know,

428
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,740
I don't have any specific
guidelines but where that line is,

429
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:05,890
but it's just something to think
about and also work with teachers and

430
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,040
technologist and alike.
Yes, that's my final plug.

431
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,510
I have found that with all these
things, you know, it's, it is really,

432
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:17,140
really great and important. Um, when
we're having that communication, you know,

433
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:19,990
parents telling us what they see if they
have concerns as being able to share

434
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:23,760
back. It's just like we pretty much
covered the whole day if we do that. Um,

435
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:27,860
and I think also parents being
able to share concerns, um,

436
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,290
make use of things like school
social worker, school counselor,

437
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,620
psychologist that said,

438
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:37,410
I've worked in a school that didn't have
any of those things. Um, and so, you know,

439
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,180
hoping that you all feel
empowered is parents of like,

440
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,090
if that's not something
that they had to say, like,

441
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,290
have you thought about networking
other places? Do you have, um,

442
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:52,310
an outside group that you bring in to be
advocating for your child of like what

443
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:58,070
an important thing that is tough
to have an offer to students? Yeah,

444
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,170
absolutely. And just along
those lines too, I mean we've
said this the whole time,

445
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:06,620
but just being mindful to monitor symptoms
and also see if there's some kind of

446
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:09,350
correlation between when
things are going on,

447
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,590
like in terms of symptoms and
also things going on in the world.

448
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,160
So the first thing that a psychologist
will ask you when you bring your kid to

449
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:20,150
therapy is to are those connections?
Do they exist, do you know about them?

450
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:22,940
And if not, then they have every
been start to monitor those anyway.

451
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,220
So things like time of day, exercise
level, you know, it could be anything,

452
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:31,400
seasons, food they ate
that day, et cetera.

453
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,280
It's important to keep
that in mind as well.

454
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,120
So that is mostly what
we have for you today.

455
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:42,650
In the back of the book there are two
worksheets which are just to help kids

456
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,460
checkoff and kind of have a behavior
chart of coping strategies that Henrietta

457
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:49,940
uses in the book. And so
that's in there too. Um,

458
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,300
if anyone has any questions about
getting help or anything about the

459
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:57,930
presentation. My cards are up here and
we do have a new book coming out soon.

460
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,731
It's called Dorky,

461
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:03,200
Dorky and he's a half an hour while half
Orca who social skills problems various,

462
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,770
he fell down the stairs.
Someone pushed him anyway.

463
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,730
It is sad but he's
becoming aware of his body.

464
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,820
So He's getting there. He gets
there more than that. He's great.

465
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,550
He's very popular at the anti,
has a lot of friends.

466
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,080
You find a support network and that's it.

467
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,470
So you had talked about the difference
that Adhd and anxiety can be confused.

468
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,330
I asked specifically because my son has
been diagnosed with Adhd and I'm curious

469
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,410
what those differences are and how
you see differences between them

470
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,420
in terms of the testing,
like how we would know that

471
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,740
or testing would be interesting.

472
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:45,670
I guess I'm also curious just what the
symptoms are or how they do get confused.

473
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,350
Okay,

474
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,183
sure.

475
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,930
So I think what can happen a lot of
times too is we get stuck on the symptom

476
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:54,240
that interferes with school
the most and that can,

477
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,520
and you know with both kids and anxiety,
right?

478
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,290
They're not necessarily concentrating,

479
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,210
they're not paying attention
or they're running around.

480
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,930
And so that's what we get stuck on and
that's a very clear symptom of ADHD and

481
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:04,764
so,

482
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,670
but it can also be part of anxiety and
if we take a step back and say what else

483
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:11,280
is going on,
what other things does this look like?

484
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,230
And kind of keep some
of these things in mind.

485
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:16,920
It helps us sort of decide one way or
another because when you start to pay

486
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:20,040
attention to the kids are doing
and like, as you know, right,

487
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:22,680
you can start to see like maybe
they are anxious about these things.

488
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:26,970
I never thought about the fact that he
was asking about the doors or whatever it

489
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:30,450
was or the coffee pot being on or the
oven being on. But now I think about it.

490
00:26:30,451 --> 00:26:33,270
That makes sense.
So this is like some observational piece.

491
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:37,350
The testing is also super helpful because
it just gives a cognitive outline of

492
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:41,310
how they're doing. And so even if you
don't do like the psych piece, let's say,

493
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,710
let's say you're just doing
the neuro sake, you know,

494
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,630
all of their executive
functions could be great.

495
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,020
They can like totally do so well
on the attentional measures.

496
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:52,560
So then it's something else and then
we wonder how we find out about the

497
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:56,610
something else. And so that's kind of
how we negotiate it, at least on our end.

498
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,680
I don't know if that
answers your question. Okay.

499
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,370
Um, I wonder if you can speak to the
differences that you might see in the,

500
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:10,250
in the, um, you know, the
treatment of boys versus girls. Um,

501
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,570
I have three daughters and one of
them has one I think is probably Gad.

502
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,730
So I'm just curious if, if you have
any idea about the gender differences.

503
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,000
Sure. When kids are pretty
young, they actually,

504
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:28,710
the gender difference just in general
is less than when they get older,

505
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:33,240
obviously. So a lot of what we're doing
for younger kids is pretty much the same,

506
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:34,980
I would say.
Um,

507
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,330
are you talking in terms of treatment or
just sort of how it manifest outwardly?

508
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,640
Oh, she's a tween, if you will.

509
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,200
Sure. Um, well it's hard
with girls too, right?

510
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,230
Because that's sort of how we are
at that age a little bit, right?

511
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:53,760
There's a lot of that
stuff that goes on anyway.

512
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:57,930
And so it's a little hard to differentiate
between what's normal developmentally

513
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,840
appropriate stuff and
what is something else.

514
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,370
So I think in terms of
what you see at that age,

515
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:09,600
you do see differences because girls
are unfortunately because of gender

516
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:10,800
stereotypes and things like that,

517
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:13,450
they are more likely to be talking
about their feelings or yeah.

518
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,310
Or at least expressing them, whether
they're telling you why or not, you know,

519
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:19,980
they're crying or yelling.
They slammed the door in your face.

520
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,040
They do all these things were got,

521
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,460
got like boys tend to be a little more
inward in that or they become sort of the

522
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,120
like all the way down the other
spectrum of sort of more explosive.

523
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,720
So there's less talking about feelings
and things like that. So they're either,

524
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,770
you know,

525
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:38,190
sometimes like beating up their brother
and sister or they're just isolating

526
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:39,330
themselves in their rooms.

527
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:42,750
But there's not a lot of discussion about
those things because that's not really

528
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:44,130
something that we,

529
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,460
unfortunately we don't really promote
that in our society for the most part.

530
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,400
So if you're talking about tween age,

531
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,670
that's kind of where that stuff
starts a little bit. As a treater,

532
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,440
we would be doing a
lot of the same things.

533
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,750
And the way in is just a
little bit different, you know,

534
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:00,330
cause the guys come in sometimes,
and it's true for women too,

535
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:04,440
but it tends to be the teenage boys come
in and they're made to come to therapy

536
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,940
and f you and I'm not doing this.

537
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:09,970
And so how you like connect with that
person is a lot different than someone

538
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,110
who's a little more tearful or who wants
to tell you at least something about

539
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,730
their day or something like that.

540
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:17,580
Which the girls tend to be a little bit
more like, at least in my experience,

541
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,020
I have a six year old boy and he's
acting like a teenager because he doesn't

542
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:25,570
want to tell us anything about his day.

543
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,630
And like sometimes things get
out like eh randomly like so,

544
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:37,030
um, and, and I think that things
are bothering him. Um, um,

545
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,810
I mean he used to talk about it
more when he was younger then it

546
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,851
shut down.

547
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:47,851
So what can you do to trigger or kids
to talk about their day and they're the

548
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,920
top a little bit more about what scares
them if they face anxiety during the

549
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,663
day.

550
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,810
Yes. That's a tricky one
because he's probably younger.
Half this is not so true,

551
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:01,630
but as kids get older or like they are
less interested in talking to their

552
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:05,700
parents and so a lot of efforts
to facilitate that stuff when,

553
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,800
especially when you
have teenagers goes on,

554
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,190
it is not very fruitful I guess
you're ever so tend to be fruitful.

555
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,840
And that's when I tend to say,
you know,

556
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:16,120
maybe it's worth at least
seeing if there's somebody else,

557
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,330
like a school counselor or a coach or a
therapist or somebody that could kind of

558
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:22,130
get involved if you think
that's something's going on. Um,

559
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,730
I'm trying to think of how to
answer that question as a parent,

560
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,990
the kid who's not, well, I mean, I again,

561
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,770
I speak on like from the perspective
of the teacher and um, I,

562
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,590
I don't know,
I know every school is different,

563
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:41,650
but just sort of asking if teachers
have seen something similar.

564
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:46,120
Is there a teacher or an aide or
whatever it is that they do talk to?

565
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,800
Are they seeing, um, because I,

566
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:51,430
I made a lot of plugs about
parents communicating to us,

567
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:53,050
but I know that at
least for me personally,

568
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,330
there were times when I definitely
could have communicated things better to

569
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,700
parents. And it's not till the
email that I'm like, Oh yeah,

570
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:59,950
I should have mentioned to them that like,
I've noticed,

571
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,510
particularly at lunchtime,
you know,

572
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,840
you say are really shuts down or she
doesn't want to go to the cafeteria.

573
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,970
She does want to go
outside. Um, so you know,

574
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:10,730
maybe seeing especially you
said that younger your son, um,

575
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,150
what are they seeing? Are they, you know,

576
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,530
having the time of their lives at school
and then kind of a little different at

577
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:21,070
home. My brother was
definitely that way. Um, there,

578
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,560
my parents thought their kindergarten
teacher was talking about like a different

579
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:25,630
child. They're like,
no, that's not our son.

580
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,750
The one who's like super happy at school.
Like it's not so that,

581
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,940
I mean they can be good resources. I know
some teachers do it better than others.

582
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,890
Well I would also add, just
to answer the question, um,

583
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,290
I think a lot of times kids also don't
know that they're able or not able to do

584
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:45,380
things. So, and they don't have
the vocabulary to do it either.

585
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:48,530
So a lot of what we do for younger
kids is sort of teaching them feelings,

586
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:53,531
words and h and also how like some tea
or feelings in their like body sensations

587
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:57,500
are correlated to emotions. Love.
Sometimes we get angry, we get really hot,

588
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:59,660
you know, we feel like we're
sweaty or whatever it is.

589
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:02,720
And having them start to be a little more
self aware about those things because

590
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,330
sort of similar to the sematic
symptoms we were talking about,

591
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,010
kids don't necessarily,

592
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:09,800
they just know that something's
wrong and they don't know,

593
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,740
like it's not really their stomach,
it's not really a headache,

594
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,210
but they don't want to go to schools.

595
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,950
They're upset and so
they don't necessarily,

596
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:17,720
it just that they don't
have the language for it.

597
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,630
So that's something that would might be
a good place to start is just sort of

598
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,750
making it known that he's
allowed to do these things.

599
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:26,930
Like talk about his feelings. Maybe you
can write them down or maybe you know,

600
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:28,880
maybe it's at this one time of day,

601
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:31,070
but also sort of helping them
figure out how to do that.

602
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,000
I think that tends to be a pretty good
place to start because that's mostly what

603
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,400
we ended up doing in the
beginning because kids just don't,

604
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,231
and it's not their fault,

605
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:41,320
it's just developmentally just haven't
learned that stuff yet or draw.

606
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,180
I definitely have kids. I mean
personally, that's my coping.

607
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:48,320
But like I have kids who sometimes they,
they won't write about it,

608
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:49,101
especially if they're a bit younger,

609
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:53,090
but like they'll draw about it or you
can just like draw how you're feeling and

610
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:53,420
yeah,

611
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,740
maybe they start tearing up the paper
and that can be very indicative and yeah.

612
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,250
So that can be one way for kids.
Yeah.

613
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,120
Anything is like a great starting
point for a conversation. So,

614
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,350
so when you were talking about
mindfulness and blowing bubbles, um,

615
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,300
what's your opinion on
video games for that?

616
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,420
My son loves to play Minecraft as sort of,
I think it's the,

617
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,620
forget everything else.

618
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,000
I think like everything in
moderation is important.

619
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,290
I can appreciate the technical
and interest of Minecraft. Um,

620
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,460
I also know that kids use it
as an escape mechanism often.

621
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,540
And so having something to focus
on and work on is one thing.

622
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:33,190
But then having it be kind of take over
other things or take over time where you

623
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:36,520
would be spending with your family or
interacting with friends outside or

624
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:40,030
playing outside or with
the dog or whatever it is,
they're sort of aligned there.

625
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:43,480
And I think finding where that is and
finding the reason behind like the

626
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:46,540
Minecraft because like a lot of kids find
it super interesting and I, I get that.

627
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:50,350
But there tends to be like sometimes
another component to it or it's a

628
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:53,320
distraction to put off doing homework
because they don't feel like they are good

629
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:55,930
at math or something like that.
Um,

630
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,330
and this is true for video games
in general and people kind of,

631
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,300
the newest thing is kind of talk about
kids who are addicted to video games.

632
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,080
And I like to think of it more as, you
know, not to say he's addicted to them,

633
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:08,620
but just as a concept, you know,
it's, there's a reason kids do things,

634
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:13,200
there's a reason we all do them. And Video
Games are great way to have, you know,

635
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,720
a world in which you can be successful
where you don't actually know anybody.

636
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,601
We sort of know that.

637
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:21,190
And we were like online friends that's
a little bit different and it's escapism

638
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,350
and you know,
a lot of kids who are depressed or,

639
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,420
or using it as a tool to sort of escape.

640
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,720
And so kind of wondering
about the utility of it,

641
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,990
I guess wouldn't be what I
would say about it. But it is a,

642
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,760
it's hard because it's also a social
thing where they're all doing it,

643
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:37,180
so you can't have them, not if they like
it, you don't want to say don't do it,

644
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:40,840
but you also don't want it to be what
they're doing. So, and Minecraft is,

645
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,210
I don't,
it's not for me,

646
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:46,240
but I get how it's really addictive
for other people in that way.

647
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:48,340
Like they're really into
it. Well, thank you.
