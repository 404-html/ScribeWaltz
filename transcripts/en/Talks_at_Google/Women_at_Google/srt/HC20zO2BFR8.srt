1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,810
All right, so please give me a hand in
welcoming to the stage. Jim letterer.

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,443
Hi,

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,430
I am Jen letterer and you are a unicorn.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,931
Now,

5
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:24,220
what just went through your mind when
you heard me say that when you heard I am

6
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:28,510
a Unicorn,
were you closer to the side of yes,

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,910
I am a unicorn.

8
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:35,911
Thank you for finally recognizing me or
were you to the side of like at best,

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,350
at best, you're skeptical. Now
other Unicorns in the room,

10
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,500
those of you who are
like totally embodying,

11
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:52,390
already knowing welcome,
really excited to have you.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,170
But the others,
the skeptic,

13
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:02,310
the ones who question what in the world
I could possibly be getting at with

14
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:05,920
that, the ones who may be rolled their
eyes a little bit when you heard it,

15
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:07,390
even if it was an internal role,

16
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,110
you are the ones that I'm really excited
to be with today because I have learned

17
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:21,151
that one of the fastest ways to grow is
by learning to ask the right questions

18
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,230
by having a critical mind and
by embracing that skeptic.

19
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,830
And it kind of likes to talk a lot
of games in the back of your mind.

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,293
So

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,520
don't shy away from the questions that
might come up today because everything

22
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:47,751
I'm here to share with you was
actually born out of my own skepticism,

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,960
my own questions and doubts about what
is being taught in regards to leadership.

24
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,920
There's all of these buzz
words around leadership, right?

25
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,490
Oh,
and your power be vulnerable.

26
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:13,020
Lean in, right? Just, Oh, your shadow.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,850
And here's the thing. I
agree with all of it. Okay.

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,850
I think it's great authenticity rock.

29
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,390
But the way I see it being talked
about can a lot of times lead to

30
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,630
misunderstanding,

31
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,890
pressure to be a certain way,

32
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,580
which when you're thinking about being
authentic just seems ridiculous and it

33
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:42,330
can lead to pain.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,070
Okay.

35
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,010
So here's an example of a scenario,

36
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:51,330
a conversation that I have
seen play out multiple times.

37
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,370
So someone says,
Hey,

38
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,700
I'm really ready to step into my power
and own my greatness and be a leader.

39
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,460
Where do I start?

40
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,490
Okay.

41
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,890
So all you have to do is be authentic.

42
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,620
Like really just like be yourself.

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:08,960
Okay.

44
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,760
Um, okay, got that. Really
appreciating that. Thank you so much.

45
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,730
But a quick followup question.
What do you mean?

46
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,950
Okay.

47
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,600
So like you just need to be your yourself.
Oh.

48
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:27,380
And your vulnerabilities puts
your shadows into the world.

49
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,650
Really show people that you have
overcome all of your battles and you are

50
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:35,210
stronger.

51
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:36,940
Okay.

52
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,510
Um, again, really
appreciating that advice.

53
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,200
One last followup question. No. Um,

54
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,730
if let's say I'm not a hundred percent
confident with what I have to say,

55
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:54,010
or I'm actually not even sure
I'm worthy of being a leader.

56
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:57,370
And then I don't even know what to say.
Like what Ben.

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,910
Oh, it sounds like you just need to
believe in yourself a little more.

58
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,550
Like have you tried positive affirmation?

59
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,350
Because I feel like once I really
started to believe in myself,

60
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,420
it was all good from there.

61
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,850
No, again, so much for that. Amazing. Um,

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,290
the mice and then you're left with,
okay,

63
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,170
I got it.
I got it.

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,590
The key to my success lies within.
Yeah,

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,230
but there's all this talk
about what you have to do,

66
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,780
the authentic be vulnerable,

67
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,930
but there's not a lot of talk about how
you are suppose to get there and what it

68
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:50,870
is really supposed to look like for you.

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,270
So much pressure on that
vulnerability piece. Right.

70
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,350
And I see this trip people up a lot.

71
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,820
They will say things like,
Jen, okay, so I have a story,

72
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:07,550
but I'm not really sure I'm
ready to share it with the world.

73
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:11,300
And is that honestly the only
way I can make a difference,

74
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,610
I have to expose my deepest,

75
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:16,670
darkest secrets to the
world can make a difference.

76
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,920
And then there's people who say

77
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,810
live the kind of blessed life.

78
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:26,630
I don't have this big terrible
thing that happened to me.

79
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:30,350
So does that mean that I'm
not as effective as a leader,

80
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,260
as someone who has been
through hell to get here?

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,520
And then there's this really weird message
about trying to be grateful for the

82
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:43,070
things that have happened,
right?

83
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:47,120
Trying to love the difficult
challenges in your life.

84
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,350
Now it may sound like I'm mocking some
of that advice because I am kind of

85
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,630
again,
all of that has a place.

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,930
You guys all have a positive effect.
Amazing laying in front of you right now,

87
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,400
you are limitless.
I believe in the power of a lot of this,

88
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,970
but only when it's used correctly.

89
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,270
Not from this place of pressuring yourself
to stretch out pride of your comfort

90
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:23,331
zone farther than you're ready for or
risk the safety of yourself in honor of

91
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,053
leadership.

92
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,210
So what is it not about the thing,
the story.

93
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,830
What if it's not about what
you're putting out into the world?

94
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,070
And it's more about how you are showing
up in the world being not doing.

95
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,300
Yeah.

96
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,300
So do you help me kind of explain this
journey of coming to conscious leadership

97
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,740
and how you can get there.
I brought some friends,

98
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,490
I brought some friends along with me and
these friends include a unicorn if you

99
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:14,170
didn't see it coming,
this Unicorn represents you and me,

100
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,600
but you as well.
So we have a unicorn.

101
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,840
We also have trolled off little
throwback sound maybe. Oh,

102
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:27,330
I know this guy represents your fear,
your self sabotage,

103
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,410
your ego,

104
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,650
all of the noise that gets in the way
right before you go and try and do

105
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,570
something great as this guy.
Okay.

106
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,510
And our stomping grounds for this journey.

107
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,740
Our belt out of rose quartz.
Okay.

108
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:48,560
So the first rose court is intuition.

109
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,440
The second row sport. I feel like
Vanna white at the moment. Excuse me,

110
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:58,030
let me step to the other side. Um,
the second round, sports and safety,

111
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,410
that's third.

112
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,050
Authenticity and the four impact.

113
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,730
Now, if it's not about, the thing
is, it's not about your story.

114
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:18,731
If it's not about clinging to a specific
identity of something that happened or

115
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:22,100
something you experienced or
something you feel that you are.

116
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,150
If it's not about that,
then what are we looking for

117
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,690
and what we're here to look for
and explore today is the lesson,

118
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,880
the lesson you learned because
of the thing that happened.

119
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,120
And if you're someone in here who has
lived a really blessed life and you're

120
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:45,800
like, oh you trust me, you picked
up some lessons along the way.

121
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,060
Living in this world,

122
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,900
the lessons that turn into pattern that
turn into beliefs that turned into a

123
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,420
false truth,
right?

124
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,820
You picked up and embody and
Harry with you every day.

125
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,300
Okay?

126
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,600
Your story is not with us today,

127
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,190
but your pattern,
your beliefs,

128
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,520
the things you feel are
true about yourself.

129
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,130
Those are with us right now.

130
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,410
That's where I want to beat big
believer of the power of present moment.

131
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,480
So that's where we're going to say the
things that are with you right now are

132
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,140
the most powerful tool.

133
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,520
Tell learning about yourself.

134
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,530
So you have to understand we're
coming in mid scene here, okay?

135
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:48,880
We're like turning on the TV mid scene
back in the day when you actually turned

136
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:51,770
on TV and didn't just pick
what you wanted to watch. Um,

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,740
and the Unicorn just had a thing happen,
right?

138
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:01,741
Something just happened and she's having
a conversation with her fear and it

139
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:06,550
sounds something like
this. Oh my God, Oh my God,

140
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,810
something just happened and I need to
make sure that that thing never happens

141
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,170
again. Oh my God. And fear
is sitting there saying,

142
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,510
I told you not to do that.
I told you not to be so noticeable.

143
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,530
I told you this day under the radar,
what have we learned today?

144
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,240
What have we learned today?

145
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,680
Okay?

146
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,210
And the Unicorn says,
well,

147
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,420
I learned it's not safe to be seen.

148
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,010
Okay?

149
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,240
And I'm not lovable.

150
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,920
Okay.

151
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,160
Now these are the Unicorns,
false truths that she picked up.

152
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,600
You may have your own,

153
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,710
you may be starting to kind
of realize what yours are,

154
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,740
or maybe not. That's okay,
but you're out this journey.

155
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:56,770
Just see if you can tune
into what are my truth.

156
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,370
That's a question that I would
love for you to dance with.

157
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,660
So as a Unicorn realizes it is
not safe to be seen as a unicorn.

158
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,600
I still have things I want to say.
I still have things I want to do.

159
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,620
Just because it's not safe to be seen
doesn't mean I have to quit all together.

160
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,940
So she tells fear. First of all,
you stay in the dark, right?

161
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,660
This is what everyone tells us about fear,
what it in the jar.

162
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,490
Don't worry about it. Don't
look at it. Be Fearless, right?

163
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,560
So let's see how this works out for her.
We're going to put him back in the dark,

164
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,440
not to be heard from because she said,

165
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,110
I'm going to be fearless and I'm going to
go out into the world as a white horse.

166
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,570
Now,
why horses are still powerful creatures.

167
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,600
They can get a lot done in the world.

168
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,600
So she didn't lose all her seem
right. She just realized, okay,

169
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,280
this is what it is.
This is the card I've been dealt.

170
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,150
Okay.

171
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,400
So she moves into her first

172
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,750
rose quartz intuition.

173
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,870
She gets quiet

174
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,000
and she hears it's not safe to be seen.

175
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,550
You are not lovable.
Now.

176
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:34,270
You have to understand that
from here on out in her journey,

177
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
her entire being,

178
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,240
her entire intention is always
about keeping her and her truth.

179
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,213
St

180
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,160
Okay?

181
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,130
No one is going to make her bud.

182
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,430
No one is going to convince her
otherwise because she has learned.

183
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,430
She has experienced
that this is her truth,

184
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,970
but she still has things to say,

185
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,690
so she presses on leaving her intuition
behind because as far as she's

186
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:14,560
concerned, the lesson has been
learned. It's not going to change,

187
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,510
so still just keep it as is
and know that that's the truth,

188
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:20,960
okay?

189
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,730
Now,
in the land of safety,

190
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:27,731
this is where you start to gain the
tools that help support your truth.

191
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,820
So in this land,

192
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,080
this is where you might start
looking for other white horses,

193
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,980
other people who are
playing under the radar,

194
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,530
not rocking the boat too much.

195
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,130
You start to become very paternal with
looking at what other people are doing,

196
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,980
being incredibly aware of the competition,
because listen,

197
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,480
if the internal conversation
is you're not lovable,

198
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:00,970
okay,

199
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,320
the external goal is I have
to at least be likable.

200
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,600
I have to at least be likable.
Look at me.

201
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,240
So there are a lot of,

202
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,300
there's a lot of pressure to get people
on board with who you are to validate

203
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:24,370
your truth, to validate this
new life as a white horse.

204
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,360
Cause you got things to say and
nothing's going to stop you.

205
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,140
Okay.

206
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,440
Now in my world,
in this space,

207
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,310
I was solid with my white hoarseness.

208
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,880
No one by this point could tell me I was
a uniform and I had just moved to New

209
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,250
York fresh out of college
here to be a dancer.

210
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Now you can imagine that the cocktail of
not being lovable and it's not safe to

211
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:56,750
be seen,

212
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,010
there's a killer doc Dale to be bringing
into the entertainment industry. Right?

213
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,340
So I would go to auditions
and I mean hate it.

214
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,700
I would have to take the rest of the day
off just to bounce back from the damn

215
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:15,620
experience.
And then I will get callbacks and not go.

216
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,180
I would not go to dance class
for like months at a time,

217
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,440
but still tell people I was a dancer

218
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,530
and I didn't realize it at the time.

219
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,800
But all of those patterns
were me supporting my truth,

220
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
being myself safe because I had
learned it's not safe to be seen.

221
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,210
I'm not lovable, so I'm going
to go almost, but not quite.

222
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,440
I'm going to go as far as it is the
unsafe and then I'm going to pull back

223
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,480
because it's called survival.

224
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,600
Moving a little bit farther.
I accepted that.

225
00:15:58,601 --> 00:15:58,871
Okay.

226
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:03,370
The dance thing is not going to be where
I'm at because I don't show up for it.

227
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,500
So I started singing.
I co wrote an off off Broadway show.

228
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:12,340
I co wrote an album. They did great.
The performances were awesome.

229
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:13,840
The songs are amazing,

230
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,980
but I did not do one performance sober.

231
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,070
I was at least three drinks lubricated
by the time I stepped on stage.

232
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,590
Okay.

233
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,590
Not because I so badly wanted to embody
the rock star lifestyle and be drunk on

234
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:36,280
stage. I really didn't even
realize what I was doing.

235
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,480
And again,

236
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,460
I was fighting for my truth saying I am
a white horse and it might not be safe

237
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:47,644
to be seen,

238
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,740
but I'm going to do as much as I can
in the limits that are in my life.

239
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,160
So I danced with that
for a while with almost,

240
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,090
but not quite.

241
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,900
And then as I moved into being authentic,
now you guys,

242
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:11,930
you have to realize I was
being as authentic as I knew
I could be by this point.

243
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:20,060
The fact that I was a unicorn was
like a deep buried memory at best.

244
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,990
Again, if I even had the memory
of it now, by this point,

245
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,020
I had gotten the opportunity to
run a talent management company.

246
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,460
Now this was like, oh, I found
it. I found my sweet spot.

247
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,710
I can help people get into the spotlight,

248
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,230
but I can be an arm's length
distance from it and feel sick.

249
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,400
And I was good at this job.
There was negotiating,

250
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,670
there was power.
I was a decision maker.

251
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,570
I was working with really
high powered producers.

252
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,590
I was moving a rube and things were good,

253
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,050
so I Yay because why not?

254
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,650
I finally found a nice balance
where I can work with artists.

255
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,260
I could be involved in that world,

256
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:21,270
but I could also stay in the shadows,
make an impact,

257
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,750
be authentic.
And Stacy.

258
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,560
Yeah,

259
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,110
because I was fighting for this.
True.

260
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,630
You have to understand that everybody
is doing the best they can at all times.

261
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,160
It may not seem that way,

262
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,560
but everybody is fighting for their truth.

263
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:46,730
Okay.

264
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,280
So as I moved into impact,

265
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,070
the company was doing great.
Actors were booking really amazing thing.

266
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,330
I was getting compliments some
producers who were watching me,

267
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,050
how I ran my company saying,
you're doing a great job and keep going.

268
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,180
Just as I felt like I
was hitting my stride,

269
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:15,890
I was winning all the races.
Right? I was the best white horse,

270
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,700
just the one I got comfortable with that.

271
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,710
Okay.

272
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,780
The whispers started coming in.

273
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:25,790
Okay.

274
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,260
And the whisper asked me,

275
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,123
okay,

276
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,480
but all of these actors to be seen.

277
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,973
Okay.

278
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,960
Might it be safe for you to,

279
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,560
Nah, ignore that. Right?

280
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,870
Because why would I risk everything
I built all of my success,

281
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,480
all of the people who were counting
on me to continue on this path.

282
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,160
Why would I risk follow a whisper?

283
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,260
No, not going to happen, and that is why

284
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,790
I so fiercely believe that you cannot
just convince yourself into a new reality.

285
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,950
You cannot just start with the blows
and think that it's actually going to

286
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:30,480
change what you believe to be true.

287
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,690
You cannot go to a single mom of two
kids who is up at 1:00 AM at her kitchen

288
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:41,400
table crying because
in an eviction notice,

289
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,230
you can't go to her and say

290
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,273
what?

291
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,370
She doesn't want to believe that you
think she doesn't want so badly to

292
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:03,000
experience this abundance that
everyone is talking about.

293
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:08,190
She wants to,
but she's fighting for a truth.

294
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:09,980
Okay,

295
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,610
a true,

296
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,610
that probably sounds something
like every nickel you earn,

297
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,940
you've got a bleed for it and
you're not even worthy of much.

298
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,380
If that is your embodied
truth and someone says to you,

299
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,450
the universe is abundant,

300
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:35,610
they might as well be looking
at you and saying your Unicorn

301
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,110
there is,

302
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:43,110
it doesn't resonate because of everything
she has experienced in her life thus

303
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:47,380
far has proven otherwise.

304
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah.

305
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,460
No,
it's not about convincing yourself.

306
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,170
What is it?

307
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,580
What is it that gets
you to switch and say,

308
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,180
oh my gosh,
that might be possible for me.

309
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:04,810
Yeah.

310
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,110
So in my world,
the whole,

311
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,550
maybe it they've been like that
with her was not working on me.

312
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,860
Like the universe was
like, okay, she's stubborn.

313
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:17,770
She's not going to react to this one.
We got to go at it from another angle.

314
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,790
Universities persistent.

315
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,230
So it went after my other belief.
You are not lovable.

316
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,973
Okay.

317
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:32,060
And at the time I was dating someone who
revealed themselves to be a narcissist.

318
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,070
Yeah.

319
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,070
And it got to point where I had to
stop painting the red flags white.

320
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,840
I had to look at what was
really happening here,

321
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,030
the lying, the cheating, the
manipulation, the emotional abuse.

322
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,160
And I had to look at it and say,

323
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,370
this really all I'm worth.

324
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,110
Okay.

325
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,270
And the whisper came in

326
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,883
and asked,

327
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,980
what if you are lovable?

328
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,600
The questions,

329
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,040
the questions that get you to wonder what?
Yeah.

330
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,950
Okay.

331
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,950
Not the demand to believe that it is true.

332
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,330
Me. Ooh. The Taishan to ask what?

333
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,373
Yeah.

334
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,350
Yeah.

335
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,350
Why is the place where you can
begin to have somebody release?

336
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,340
They're true and that is
oh really brave thing to do

337
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,830
because you don't know what's
waiting for you on the other side.

338
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,380
In hindsight, you look
back and you're like, oh,

339
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:54,830
that's why I had to let go because
that was coming in and it's all real

340
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:56,620
beautiful from the backend.

341
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,660
But when you're living it and someone
asks you to let go of the truth that you

342
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:07,160
have been living for
possibly multiple decades,

343
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,200
it's going to take a law

344
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:18,030
or it's going to take one moment
where all of a sudden you realize,

345
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,950
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

346
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,100
The thing I thought was
true might not be true.

347
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,940
And with that in my world when I
realized, Oh, maybe I am lovable,

348
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,800
then the maybe it's safe
to be seen came with it.

349
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,890
So I had it back to the
beginning where I came from,

350
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:44,390
cause I had somebody to talk to. I knew
that was going to happen. All right. Who?

351
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,010
She went back and talk to
fear because he was like, Hey,

352
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,620
remember how we said it wasn't
safe for me to be seen? Well,

353
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm starting to doubt that.

354
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,720
And you had all this crazy
stuff to say and fear is like,

355
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,820
I'm so glad you came back.

356
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,300
I've been trying to get your attention.

357
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,300
You were out there trying to be fearless.
I'm back.

358
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:12,620
You're trying to get your attention
because I'm not your enemy.

359
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,510
And he said, by the way, you
know that you're a unicorn.

360
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,620
Yeah.

361
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,390
And she's like, what? This
whole time I'm out there,

362
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:31,920
you saw me. I'm out there.
I'm like, no. Fear was like,

363
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,980
can I come with you now this time? Can
we do what it done? And she's like,

364
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,220
well I'm a uniform.

365
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,240
I did all that on the white horse.

366
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,940
How'd you what I can do with a Unicorn
now the fear says I'm coming with you.

367
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:55,800
Let me get, let me get my outfit now.
Yes, I'm going to put his outfit on.

368
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,990
I promise you it's worth the wait.

369
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,950
It's totally worth the payoff
because look, you guys,

370
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,470
if you were to hire somebody,

371
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,060
a private investigator to tell you
exactly what's going on with you,

372
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,140
who is your
really good news for everyone?

373
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:17,160
We all have one and he works pro bono.
So

374
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,610
this is now, hmm. We're starting
to build our squad goals,

375
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,523
right?

376
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,860
So off she goes as a unicorn
back at her intuition,

377
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,260
same thing.
She gets quiet.

378
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:40,090
The truth is it is safe to
be seen and you are lovable.

379
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,980
So just before

380
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,760
our re thing from here on out is about
protecting her and her truth by eating to

381
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:55,020
bill that true.

382
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,900
Now as you move the same thing,

383
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:03,901
she's learned lesson to bring your
intuition with you because those change

384
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,450
things can change along the way.

385
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,660
This isn't the only catalyst
that's going to happen in her life.

386
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:15,930
So she brings the intuition and of
course you get your man who has your back

387
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:18,070
ready to let you know if
anything weird is going on.

388
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,610
Okay?

389
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,540
Now this same thing you guys.
This is the really important place.

390
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,060
This is where the positive affirmations
can start to work because they are no

391
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:33,780
longer debating your truth.

392
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,320
They are supporting what you now
are already open to believing.

393
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:42,760
Okay?

394
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,350
This is where maybe you have to stop
hanging out with some of the white horses

395
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:50,590
that really used to fit
kind of who you were,

396
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,480
but now that you're a unicorn,

397
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:56,580
they're kind of intimidated by the
whole thing and it just gets weird. No,

398
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,190
you lose some people in this space.
It can be painful.

399
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:08,090
This is also the space where you do
want to explore those stories and those

400
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,290
things that happen,
those panelists in your life.

401
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,740
This is where you get to own your power
and you decide what gets shared with the

402
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:24,300
world.
What gets put out there,

403
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:29,540
because baring your soul does
not equal leadership and power.

404
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,311
Oh,

405
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:36,311
knowing your stuff so you can
become a mirror of what is possible,

406
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,910
not is what we're working on.

407
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:47,420
So I can't tell you what authentic
leadership looks like for you.

408
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:51,510
If that means bearing your soul
is telling the world your story,

409
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:56,160
go for it, right? It's all you.

410
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,601
Kim.

411
00:28:57,601 --> 00:29:02,070
Kardashians means to strip down every
other week and get on social media to feel

412
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:05,010
empowered. Hey girl, do you?

413
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,340
But there is a not messaging out there
that is telling people you have to

414
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,060
overcome and prove that you're stronger
than I can take John All the judgment

415
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:20,430
because your fearless.
There's enough of that.

416
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,410
I'm here to give voice to the
person who says, you know what?

417
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,090
There's more to me than one
event that happened in my life.

418
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:31,810
Okay?

419
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:36,810
And this is where you get to start
exploring all of who you are.

420
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,710
And then when you move into authenticity,

421
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,010
remember we're bringing all of your tools.

422
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,020
You're not leaving these safety pools
that you just built behind because you

423
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:54,220
know you're going to
keep building as you go,

424
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,540
right? Asking for help,
working with a coach,

425
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:01,290
working with the therapist,
really out,

426
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:05,440
allowing yourself to be supported.
Not because you're weak,

427
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,790
but because you understand
that when I get this support,

428
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,630
it allows me to be more of who I am.

429
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,070
Okay?

430
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,300
So in this game by this space,

431
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,880
I started realizing that number one,

432
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,740
I want to infuse comedy into everything
that I do, so I'm going to do it.

433
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,460
Okay?

434
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,260
It's the kind of authenticity that when
you book one of the coolest speaking

435
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:36,600
gigs of your career and they're like,
hey Jen,

436
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,210
are you going to have slides in your life?
Know what?

437
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:43,380
I'm going to bring a stuffed Unicorn.
It's roll down, throw the card. Cool.

438
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,600
Awesome.
That's the kind of stuff that happens.

439
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,780
You're not looking around wondering
what other people are doing because it's

440
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:58,941
irrelevant to what you are working
on here and what you have to offer.

441
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,820
Okay,

442
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,440
so this final piece,

443
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:08,100
when she moves into impact
and she has her intuition,

444
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,240
her safety,
her real authenticity,

445
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,590
not the one that someone told her he's
supposed to have in order to be authentic.

446
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,250
This kind of self awareness.

447
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,350
Okay.

448
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,480
Is the conscious leadership

449
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,950
because you start to become a living,

450
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,600
breathing how to list for people.

451
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,053
Okay.

452
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,730
You're not running around
trying to save them.

453
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:43,770
Okay.

454
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,770
Because you know that the
catalyst is just the question,

455
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,650
how to list is that moment
that makes someone go, oh,

456
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,530
maybe what I thought was true isn't true.

457
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,360
As a leader,

458
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:09,110
if you can get people to feel
safe enough to release that.

459
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:12,324
True.

460
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Did they have been calling
for dear life out of survival?

461
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,610
If you can get people to release that,

462
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,300
that is leadership.

463
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,260
Yeah.

464
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,060
The rest of their journey,
right?

465
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,020
They have to choose to go back to the
beginning and talk to their fear about

466
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,530
what the hell went down
and am I a unicorn?

467
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:39,770
And when did you choose to not
tell me I was Unicorn? Right?

468
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,590
Wow.
Is conscious leadership.

469
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,653
Okay.

470
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,940
Oh name.
When people say own your power,

471
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,850
step into the light might be seen.

472
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,990
When I hear people say,
be seen,

473
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,680
the first thing I ask is,
are you seeing yourself?

474
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,543
Okay?

475
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,900
So if you don't begin with
positive affirmations, right?

476
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:16,260
If it's not just a leap to
convince yourself of what it is,

477
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,000
then where do you begin?

478
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,080
You begin by looking for your truth.

479
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,540
What am I fighting for right now?

480
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,780
What do I believe so much that it's
true that I will deny everything else.

481
00:33:31,891 --> 00:33:33,860
Someone could come in here
right now and tell me I,

482
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:38,861
I'm a Unicorn and until I feel
that I am until I feel that,

483
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,730
yeah, that's all. Yes.

484
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,030
Getting quiet,

485
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,150
having the courage to wonder what if

486
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,670
where so many people that say to me,
Jen,

487
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,390
I don't even think it's responsible
for me to dream in that way.

488
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,250
Right? It's just, it's just not
worth while. I've got a job there,

489
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,150
but got family up things like a things,
it's not responsible to dream.

490
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,140
Right? While it's a truth,
people hold on to a law.

491
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,300
I have to keep running my race.
I'm a white horse who wins all the races.

492
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:30,380
Don't tell me to slow down.
I'm surviving.

493
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,180
Okay.

494
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,830
And as a conscious leader,
you are the invitation

495
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,980
that it is safe

496
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,450
to start that exploration for yourself.

497
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,570
A good leader does not judge their success
by how many people they've been able

498
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:57,410
to convince.
Right?

499
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,430
Or how many people are
trying to now be like them.

500
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,200
A conscious leader looks
around at their world and says,

501
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,680
I'm here to help.

502
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,730
All of you be more of who you are.

503
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,750
Even if right now you're a white horse,

504
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,400
the best white horse you can be.
So when the question comes,

505
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,913
you hear it

506
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,610
and you're not afraid of it,

507
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,470
and you're willing to follow it.

508
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,040
So it's not about what you're
putting out into the world.

509
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,620
It's about how you show up.

510
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,890
Hi,
I'm Jen.

511
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:58,240
Let her and to you our Unicorn.

512
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,160
Thank you.
