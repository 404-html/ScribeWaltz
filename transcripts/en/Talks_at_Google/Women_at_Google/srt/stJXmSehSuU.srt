1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,210
Thank you. [inaudible]. Good
afternoon everyone. Good afternoon.

2
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:17,690
Thank you very much.
Rob also fall into for having us.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,670
It's an honor to be in London,

4
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:23,780
although this way the gates to
me every time I visit London.

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,190
Thanks. Snack Lien.
Thank you for coming to,

6
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:33,191
how did you then become to work for
him within his company and how did your

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,070
family take your,
I suppose that the change in a 1994,

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,440
Mr Mandela became the first democratically
elected president in 1990 in,

9
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:49,441
in April of [inaudible] 1994
and in October of that year,

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,960
I applied for a job, um, in his, uh,

11
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,070
extended office and he had a few
ministers in his office and it was the,

12
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,370
one of the ministers,
uh,

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,800
it was a booth for a minister
without portfolio portfolio.

14
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,930
So I looked at the ad and I was only
driven by the fact that I needed a job

15
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:13,580
closer to my parents home because I was
still living with him at the age of 23,

16
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:16,370
which no child should do.
At the age of 23.

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,350
I was living with my parents and I
needed a job closer to home. So, um,

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,100
that was the one thing that was
attractive about the job that the union

19
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:28,250
buildings in which the president's
head office is situated,

20
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:32,360
was close to my parents home.
And secondly, uh, it all,

21
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:36,140
the job was also advertised that
you would do six months, um, uh,

22
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:39,080
duty in Pretoria,
which is the administrative capital.

23
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:43,640
It's about 20 miles I think from,
from, uh, from Johannesburg.

24
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:45,380
I'm not sure about miles and kilometers,

25
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:48,260
but I'm about 20 miles from Johannesburg.

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,670
And then you could spend six months there,

27
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:53,420
rest of the six months of the year
you could spend in gaped down.

28
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,170
Now you all know, if you know South
Africa, everyone knows about Cape Town.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,160
And even as a young South African,
we all just want to go to Cape Town.

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,320
So the job was advertised
as part of a sessional duty,

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,820
uh, um, uh, office.

32
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,950
So you could spend six months of the
year in Pretoria and then when parliament

33
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,120
is in session in Cape Town, you would
spend the six months in Cape Town.

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,420
Those two things were the only things
that I was interested in when I applied

35
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:27,710
for the job in the ministry without
portfolio, I thought to myself, well,

36
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:31,640
because, um, these notebook
portfolio attached to this minister,

37
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,590
the job couldn't be too, too complicated.
Um, this man does it. I thought to myself,

38
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:39,830
this minister doesn't even have a job
because he doesn't have a portfolio.

39
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,840
So I thought to myself, I'm apply for the
job and see how it goes. And of course,

40
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:49,610
never thinking that I would
end up in Mr Mandela's office.

41
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,850
So I was invited for an interview in,

42
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:55,970
in the head office of the presidency
and during the interview, um,

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,940
I was still conversing with the HR people.

44
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,230
The door flung open in
this very flamboyant,

45
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,370
beautifully dressed black lady intake.
Uh,

46
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,670
her name was married and she was,
um,

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,880
the president's brought President Mandela
private secretary. At the time. Now,

48
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,920
if you don't believe in fate or destiny,

49
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:18,370
then the story will make you
believe in fate and destiny.

50
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,910
I sat in that office when Mary entered
and she really just physically burst into

51
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,450
the office without announcement and
interrupting us. And she just said,

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,380
I need an assistant and I need it right
now. And I don't care what color she is.

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,600
And I thought to myself, I'm your person.
You need someone, I need a job here.

54
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,740
You know, the two of us. I
mean, it's mean to be. And um,

55
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,000
do she lived, we never got introduced.
And I was never told who she was.

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,790
And often the interview that
called me and they said,

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,740
would you be interested in a job in
President Mandela private office?

58
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,890
And I thought to myself, private,
it sounds dangerous actually. Um,

59
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,890
I thought,
well,

60
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,600
I hope I'm never expected to go
to his house because now remember,

61
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm still very afraid of this
person. I'm still, um, you know,

62
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:12,490
with the same conservative
mindset, I thought if I work
in a, in a bigger office,

63
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:16,600
I could just disappear. So private
office, um, you know, didn't sound right.

64
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:21,160
And so I said, is this job in the union
buildings in the, in the aid office?

65
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,840
Because I was trying to avoid to
go to a private office. They said,

66
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:28,790
GCA sits in the, in the
Union Buildings. I see. Um,

67
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,800
and would I be able to do
sessional duties? So six
months, Pretoria, six months,

68
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,750
Cape Town? They said, yes. I said,

69
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:39,751
I'm sold neighbor or asking questions
about how big is this private office?

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,250
Um, you know, who would I be working for?
Would I ever have to meet the president?

71
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,720
Never asking those questions.

72
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,370
It was just the logistics that might
seems to me and that was attractive to me.

73
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:55,690
And so I said yes.
And of course then I realized,

74
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,190
so I was the first day I started
my job in the union buildings,

75
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,090
I thought at first that
I made a big mistake.

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,850
I walked into this very stately office.

77
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:11,851
It's like 10 Downing Street and you walk
into this office and the door's open by

78
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:15,380
motion detector and um,

79
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,460
it's very stately inside and very
formal and you can hardly a pin drop.

80
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,260
And all this grand idea and um,
beautiful carpets and everything.

81
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:30,210
And then I made one or two people and
I thought, well, where's the raced?

82
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,600
Where's the other 200 people I'm expecting
to find there? And they said, no, no, no,

83
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,410
we are only five people in the
president's private office.

84
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,050
So for the first few weeks
in my job there, I would, um,

85
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,320
whenever I heard the president deriving,
I would just lock my door quickly,

86
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,191
my office door,

87
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:53,170
the door to my office and hide
because I thought we can even meet,

88
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,740
you know, we are just gonna meet this
person and you know, he's the president.

89
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:00,950
Now I also kind of feel
a shame, um, for, for,

90
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:01,790
for you know,

91
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,300
a birthdate and down understanding a
little bit more of course now of the

92
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,810
environment. Um, but I saw it, it's
just not proper that we even meet.

93
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,420
So I would really hide
for the first few weeks,

94
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,710
sister unleashing to go from
that to where you ended up. Um,

95
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,780
so the title of this book is,
Good Morning Mr Mandela,

96
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,390
but that came from a watershed moment,
didn't it?

97
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:27,660
So I know because I've read that book.
How did that happen?

98
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,360
Eh, yeah. So two weeks into the job, um,

99
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,450
I walked into Mary's office because
of course I was now employed by her.

100
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,560
I walked into the office to deliver
a pile of books or something.

101
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,500
And suddenly this group of people,
a crowd of people exited her office,

102
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,130
all men,
all of them dressed in dark suits.

103
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,210
They're wearing sunglasses indoors.
Um,

104
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,700
they have Yuring aids and they have
all this technology speaking to their

105
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:59,520
watches. And you realize that
this is like a body guards.

106
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,800
These are definitely the
stereotype bodyguards. And
immediately you think, well,

107
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,570
you realize, wow, these people are so
you need to behave in a different way.

108
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:13,040
Now don't make sudden movements.
And um,

109
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,850
then things started happening in slow
motion for me because this moment was so

110
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:21,810
important. Um, and from this
crowd of people emerged,

111
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,920
President Mandela,

112
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:26,730
the first democratically elected
black president of South Africa.

113
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,000
And that first thing I, of course I
see GM was good morning Mr Mandela.

114
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,280
And he extended his hand
to me and I thought, well,

115
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:41,640
what am I supposed to do now as an hour?

116
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:46,080
And you must remember I'm 23 years
of age. I'm young, I'm naive,

117
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,710
I'm stupid. I am, um, vulnerable,

118
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:52,710
extremely vulnerable store.
Um,

119
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,550
and these extending his hand to me
and I thought, you know, it's, it's,

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,490
it was like moments that I thought,
well,

121
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:03,630
should I run away and can I turn
around and run down this corridor?

122
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:05,310
And then I realize, well,
these people are all,

123
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,990
they're going to shoot you on this golf.
You're going to be blood every way.

124
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,550
Don't run,
you can't run.

125
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,230
And then the first thing you noticed when
you meet Nelson Mandela for the first

126
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:19,970
time was this incredible
kindness in his eyes. Um,

127
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,120
the sincerity of his smile
is infectious smile RVs.

128
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,890
And they looked at me, still waiting for
me to do something and I took his hand.

129
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:32,100
And throughout the conversation
he held my hand into a firm grip,

130
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,120
just holding onto it.
And then there was a pause.

131
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:38,760
You were saying something and there
was a pause and I realize why.

132
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:42,810
He just asked me something, but I,
I have no idea what he just asked.

133
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,060
And I had to ask him to repeat himself.
So I said, excuse me, Mr President.

134
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:52,470
So when he repeated himself, I realized
he was speaking to me in Africans,

135
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,130
my own, my home language
and the of the white people,

136
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:58,740
the language of the
oppressor in South Africa.

137
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,730
And I heard him say over the years
that when you speak to a man,

138
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,510
it goes to his head. But when you
speak to your man and his language,

139
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,040
it goes to his heart.

140
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,080
That's what he did that day by holding
onto my hand and speaking to me in

141
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,080
Afrikaans,
he destroyed my defenses immediately.

142
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,300
And the opened me up to
the rest of my life. Um,

143
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,410
that was the watershed moment for me
because I then found this person in front

144
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:29,910
of me. We stood there for
about seven minutes. Well,
it felt like two years, but,

145
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,280
um, he asked about my upbringing.
Luckily he didn't ask what I voted. Okay.

146
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:38,960
I, because I think that was what's going
to be the loss, but no, not really.

147
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,740
He asked about my family,
asked about their upbringing,
about my parents, you know,

148
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,120
everything, these, these, these,
uh, very unimportant things really.

149
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,570
And I felt respected for that moment,
standing there and I,

150
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,480
I felt undeserving because of the,

151
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:57,300
of course then I knew of
the history of South Africa,

152
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,590
what happened in my country.

153
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:03,300
And you feel immediately you feel
responsible because the person you find in

154
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:07,980
front of you is completely the opposite
of what you were taught to believe

155
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:11,070
about. This man. He's friendly, he's kind,

156
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,150
he's extremely caring in his,
just his personality.

157
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,510
So you know what women do
based in a situation like that.

158
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:22,320
Then we start crying as well,
still holding his end.

159
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,330
Now the DSR rolling down my face and
I try and answer whatever you had.

160
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,580
We was asking. And um, he,

161
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,640
he saw I was crying and then he put his
other hand on my shoulder and he said,

162
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,770
no, no, no, relax. You are overreacting.

163
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:39,771
Now of course he realized that I felt
responsible immediately and that I felt

164
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:45,100
sorry and that I, um, you know, I
was just overcome with emotion. And,

165
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:49,590
um, that moment really changed my entire
life because I walked away from that

166
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:52,950
meeting wanting to know more
what happened in my country,

167
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,290
why these things that I was told in
the media, in the church, my parents,

168
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:03,150
I had to question my own upbringing and
have very difficult conversations with

169
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:05,730
people asking,
why didn't you tell me?

170
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,990
Why did you only present one
side of the street to us? Um,

171
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,000
and um, they are, it was all started by
just that one moment with Mr Mandela.

172
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,390
Do we have any questions?
Okay. Going, I have loads.

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,390
Sure. So I might just, um, hi. Um,

174
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,370
you mentioned that this sort of role
job can kind of consumer life and your

175
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:32,350
life,
their life becomes your life.

176
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,590
Prior to you getting the first role,

177
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,460
what was your dream job or where
did you think he was going to be?

178
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:43,090
And do you ever regret not
pursuing that over? Wait, what now?

179
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,060
Thank you. Yes, I am at the age of 23.

180
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:50,370
I really just wanted a dye job,
you know,

181
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:53,990
something just to earn a little
money to buy my makeup. Um,

182
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,150
I had no real ambition at that point.

183
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,910
My father was a businessman and,
um, he was a logistics men manager,

184
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,080
um, at the South African breweries.
And he had a very, very effective, uh,

185
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,490
personal assistant.
And she really embraced me.

186
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,620
And I wanted to be as
organized and, and, and, um,

187
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,220
uh, the forming like Danny
who was the secretary.

188
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:22,120
So that was who I wanted to become.
I wanted to marry and I have three,

189
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,950
three children, three boys to be
specific. Um, but then, you know,

190
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:29,140
life happens,
something happens along the way.

191
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:33,430
You don't recognize these opportunities
when they come along. And I think it's,

192
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:36,220
um, as I said to your destiny
and fight played a role,

193
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,920
and this is the life
that was handed to me.

194
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,740
And I always said to people that when
you, when you talk of regret, um,

195
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,220
I look at Nelson Mandela's life and I
look at him spending 27 years in prison,

196
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,330
um, away from his family, away from life,

197
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,400
sacrificing release life so that I
could have the freedom of speech,

198
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,670
the freedom of movement,
the freedom of association today.

199
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,920
So who am I to talk about my sacrifices
in comparing my life to he's my

200
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:09,550
sacrifices. There was nothing,
there was really none.

201
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,750
I would do everything exactly the
same if I knew what I, what I,

202
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,570
what I do now, uh, 20, well,

203
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,620
25 years ago and um,
this seven,

204
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,610
7.5 billion people on the planet now.
Right.

205
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,940
And I am that one person
who had this opportunities.

206
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:32,620
How do I day talk about regret.
Thank you.

207
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,470
I Zelda and my mill fellow
South African and wouldn't

208
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,250
fabulous.
Um,

209
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,080
it was really interesting to listen
to you talking about your upbringing.

210
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:50,840
I mean I was born two weeks
before the sweater riots,

211
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:55,841
so I know about indoctrination
by state and my family,

212
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,300
uh, and by church more
than most actually. Um,

213
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,520
I was just wondering what is your
perspective on how racial attitudes have

214
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:09,140
changed for white people in South Africa
towards other races and particularly,

215
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,890
I Guess Afrikaners do you think we're
there? We have a long way to go.

216
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:14,540
And where do you see it going?

217
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,670
Thank you. And Yeah, I
always say to people,

218
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:20,850
and it feels like we
haven't made progress,

219
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:24,900
but we have my night lot of
progress in South Africa.

220
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,170
Look at me and change is possible and
we measure things maybe differently now

221
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:35,730
because of technology. Um, I think
in South Africa you will always have,

222
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,330
in any society across the world,
you will have buckets of racism.

223
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,280
People will just simply refuse to change,
not for any good reasoning,

224
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:45,880
but people who just don't
want to change that.

225
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:49,140
You always have that in any society.
South Africa specifically,

226
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:52,230
I think there's been
massive, massive, um, uh,

227
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,000
pro as far as racial
relationships and our concern,

228
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,290
the problem are either is that I heard
someone said that we live in the age of

229
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,920
smartphones and stupid
people. So, um, what people,

230
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:06,770
it's the age of instant gratification.
Um,

231
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:11,000
we don't listen to each other
anymore. Um, and, and, and you know,

232
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:15,080
that was one of [inaudible] strongest
characteristics was his ability to listen

233
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:19,520
to people and to listen with the intention
of really understanding what a person

234
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:24,320
is saying rather than listening with
the intention of, of responding.

235
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,150
And with smartphones and social
media these days, that's what we do.

236
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,720
We look at something and without
thinking or listening, we respond.

237
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:34,610
Because I do want most likes.

238
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:38,840
I do want to be the most famous
person or I do want to shame someone.

239
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:42,910
Public is a, that's who we
as a society has become. Um,

240
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,890
so when it comes to racial relations
in South Africa, you have this, um,

241
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,020
the radicals, and I'm sure you
know, I'm talking about, um,

242
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,110
we have the radicals on both white and
black side that it makes it a beer that

243
00:15:56,361 --> 00:16:00,620
we haven't made progress or that we are
moving backwards. But you know what,

244
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:05,060
in all the years I have not found
the people on the street that,

245
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:08,390
so intolerant,
as you see in politicians,

246
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,510
people on the street in South Africa
are not intolerant people in the street,

247
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,500
one to live together. They want to bring
a work together to bring solutions.

248
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,740
So I do think we've made,
we've made great progress.

249
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:23,720
It's just that it appears because
things are so open and so transparent in

250
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:27,800
society because of,
of the Internet that it appears different.

251
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,800
Absolutely agree with you.
And especially when you see the newer,

252
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,800
younger generations and just how,
when you,

253
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,700
when you see them going out socializing
and just how comfortable they are living

254
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:39,680
in such a multicultural society.

255
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,870
Totally. Yeah. And I always say to people
that everywhere in the world, if you,

256
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:48,400
if you look at the uas and did I as
well, uh, you know, you have these,

257
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:51,660
this very intolerant, uh, um, uh,

258
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,930
atmosphere and um, it's always,
it's everywhere in the world.

259
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,440
It's not just America, it's not South
Africa, everywhere in the world. It's the,

260
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,760
it's the radicals shouting that makes us
all move back into a more conservative

261
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:10,170
societies are, I'd rather be blend
and say how I really feel. The, the,

262
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,650
the thing is that if you, if
you are serious about, um, the,

263
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,230
uh, righteousness and, and, and, and,

264
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:21,880
and equality and the freedoms that
people like Nelson Mandela fought for,

265
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,120
you need to shout louder,
um,

266
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,340
and not become the blend
society and the people,

267
00:17:27,341 --> 00:17:31,310
the person who doesn't have an opinion
just because it's safer. Um, it's,

268
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,950
it's hard. And I myself had to learn
through social media or the hard lessons.

269
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,130
Um, but it is a powerful,
powerful tool for us.

270
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:41,530
And if you look at
Nelson Mandela's legacy,

271
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,250
he stood on the world stage and
then at times they will maybe 50,

272
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,190
50,000 people in a, in a stadium that
he addressed those days. We didn't,

273
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:51,270
they didn't have smartphones.

274
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,620
So the 50 people whose
opinion was confined to the
50,000 people in front of him

275
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,120
with the Internet today,
all of us in this room is on some form,

276
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,490
some form of, of, of social media.

277
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,760
If we all have a hundred
people to influence,

278
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,350
actually our power is much
bigger than it was. Um, uh,

279
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,620
those years, you know, and
we can reach more people.

280
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,510
So how do you choose to use that
responsibility, um, in this,

281
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:21,120
in this age of, of, of, of influence,

282
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:25,140
age of technology and use
it to build the bridges, do,

283
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,200
to promote tolerance,
to promote equality,

284
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,530
to promote the things that
we all know, um, you know,

285
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:32,910
makes the world a better place.

286
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,960
Thank you.
And thank you for your time today.

287
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,913
Thank you.

288
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,480
Both my parents are Palestinian,

289
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,830
so I'm sure you can imagine that this is
something that's also very close to my

290
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:48,660
heart. And I was wondering if you could
be miss speak a little bit about, um,

291
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,950
maybe Nelson Mandela,

292
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:54,210
if he ever spoke about forget
forgiveness from within or yeah.

293
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:57,060
How he could come,
come over this incident.

294
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:01,620
The things that happened
to him personally, uh, to
work with and integrate the,

295
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:01,771
you know,

296
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:05,400
these people who had done this to him
and in society as he was president.

297
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,100
Thank you. Yes. And you
know, Mr Mandela at, at, at,

298
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,530
I think about 10 years after
I started working for him, he,

299
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,820
he started this thing of saying that
he misses prison. I forgot what I said.

300
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,640
You can't say that. That's disgusting.
To say that you miss prison.

301
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:25,420
Don't repeat that. And then you said,
and it's not that he miss prison,

302
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:28,930
it's that he misses the opportunity
to think about things properly.

303
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,130
And he then said to me, I, I,

304
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,160
at another stage I see team when I
started knowing him quite well, I said,

305
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,920
you know what?
It's very unnatural of you not to hate,

306
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,120
not to have resentment and
not to want to have revenge.

307
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,130
And with me alongside you, you
know, just take the opportunity and,

308
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,240
and,
and I'm sure we can overcome this,

309
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:52,690
but be angry at me because it's
not natural that you are not angry.

310
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,410
You have to be angry at, at,
at white people specifically.

311
00:19:56,411 --> 00:20:00,970
So I see it take it out on me. Um, we can
sing Kumbaya afterwards. Again, you know,

312
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:04,060
just, we can make up. Um,
but you have to get it out.

313
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,110
And then he would laugh at me and he
would say to me, I'm these no anger.

314
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:12,550
There's no resentment. Because he
realized that unless he worth did himself,

315
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,640
he could not take the country forward to,
unless he worth it,

316
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:18,370
his own anger and his own resentment.
Um,

317
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,800
he couldn't influence the
people around him. And he said,

318
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:25,690
it's much harder work to change yourself
than it is to change other people.

319
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,630
Um, so when it comes to
something like forgiveness,

320
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:32,530
when it comes to something like
reconciliation that made me realize that,

321
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,400
you know, in prison it took a lot
of time thinking about these things,

322
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:41,401
what is the best way forward I need is
really to work at oneself much harder.

323
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,700
Um, in forgiving you have to also
reconcile style with your own boss.

324
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,610
I am my wisdom through my life story,

325
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:52,840
I had to come to terms with the fact
that that is who I was and that is why I

326
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,430
can be so brutally honest about,
yes,

327
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,400
I was a racist when I
started working for him. Um,

328
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,090
but I've been through
this change and, and, and,

329
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:06,091
and we need to take the time to think of
ourselves in any situation and how do I

330
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,360
appear to other people rather than one
thing to preach to people how to behave.

331
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,400
Because we all know
how difficult it is to,

332
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,070
to change behavior. Um, if
you want to stop drinking,

333
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:23,050
stop swearing, stop smoking, stop,
whatever it is, we, it's difficult.

334
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,210
Um, yet we want to tell everyone around
us how to be a, it's, it's, it's um, uh,

335
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,460
behavior is like,
it's like fashion.

336
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,270
If I change my ba there other
people will follow. So, you know,

337
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:37,990
all of that made me realize that Mr
Mandela worked very hard at himself to

338
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:41,680
forgive.
And it's only because he did that,

339
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:46,681
that we had such a smooth transition in
South Africa because people follow these

340
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:47,734
example.

341
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:48,760
I am,

342
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,170
that's very brave of you to work on
herself and share this experience with us

343
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:58,030
also. Thank you so much for
that. Thank you very, very
much. So, one final question.

344
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,290
Um, what did you learn most
from President Nelson Mandela?

345
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,890
I think the lesson that stands out
nightly is to respect the respect people,

346
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,723
um,

347
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,910
irrespective of who they are and what
they represent and what they appear to me

348
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:19,090
to be. Um, without judgment. You know, um,

349
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,460
Mr Mandela always said that
if you question a person's
integrity without valid

350
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:29,510
reason, it could well be a
reflection of your own integrity.

351
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,800
And I often think of those things
and I always think of the person that

352
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:38,240
approaches me now stripping from all
those layers because that's what I learned

353
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:40,760
from Mr Mandela is strip
him from what he weighs.

354
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:45,760
He or she ways from the sexual
preference, from the wealthy state, this,

355
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,550
the appearance, all of that, the
ideology, they, they religion,

356
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:52,340
they conviction all of that politics,

357
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:54,860
strip the person and
connect with a human being.

358
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,280
And that is what made him such an
effective world leader as well,

359
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:03,281
is that he always was able to connect
to the humanity of a person above

360
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:08,740
ideology. Um, and I think
that speaks of respect and,

361
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,940
and if we can all just dry and do that,

362
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:15,500
recognizing the human being behind
every person that we, that we, um,

363
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,820
that we come across, then, um, you know,
that it makes the world a better place.

364
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:24,680
And I be witness to the fact that I
saw a person waking up every morning,

365
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,570
um, Nelson Mandela for
19 years. He decided,

366
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,660
and purposefully every single morning
he decided if I can change or if I can

367
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:38,240
touch one person's life today,
I can change the world.

368
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:42,560
You really believed in that individual
action. And if you now look at, well,

369
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:47,240
the street he did. So it's
enough bower. It wasn't very,

370
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:51,470
it was a super human being. He was
a Audrey human being like all of us,

371
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,140
but he made decisions and always choosing
the right thing. And, and, and, and,

372
00:23:56,141 --> 00:24:00,530
and I think that kind of respect,
that kind of self respect as well.

373
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,310
Um, is, is the lesson that I
take away from my experience.

374
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,700
That's fascinating.
So it's been amazing having you.

375
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:10,940
Thank you so much for coming all the way
from South Africa to be with us today.

376
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,940
The book is available and you can buy it.
It's a great read.

377
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:16,340
I definitely recommend it.
It's available on Google play.
