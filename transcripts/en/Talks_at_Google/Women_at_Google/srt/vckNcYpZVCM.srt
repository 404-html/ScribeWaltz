1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,963
Okay.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,940
Hi everyone.
Thank you so much for being here.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,190
On behalf of all a Lex Google
talks at and Latino Heritage La,

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,710
I'd like to welcome everyone to our first
Hispanic heritage month event or we're

5
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:20,740
going to have a panel discussion where
we celebrate the vibrancy of Latini that

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,080
or an on many different aspects
that make us Latino today.

7
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:28,190
We will hear it firsthand from three
very talented local Latino artists,

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,370
each one of them providing their own
take on what it means to be an artist in

9
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:35,990
the u s I will start with [inaudible]
in the middle son's I coordinate who is

10
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:39,650
the first generation Salvadorian
American artists born in Houston, Texas.

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,760
Historical collective memory of post
civil war Salvadorian culture is an

12
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,950
important influence and
inspiration for her work.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,660
She recently implemented a
portfolio preparation course
at blessedly La Rasa for

14
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:54,890
students aspiring to
continue their education and
profession in the arts center.

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,090
Received a VFA from Vcu with a
concentration in painting and printmaking,

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,060
recipient of the Ellen
Battelle stoeckle fellowship.

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,630
She attended the Yale Norfolk summer
program. Thanks for being here

18
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,570
and then we have your land all the way
to the left or to your right was born

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:16,571
into a family who is artistic heritage
dates back to 1877 Gonzales's travels in

20
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:17,630
different countries.

21
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,560
The bonds forge the individuals in those
places and the resulting transformative

22
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:26,420
experiences are reflected in her art and
her life. She has done for her strong,

23
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,680
bold brushstrokes of color and texture
intent and evoke in imagination and

24
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:33,650
emotion.
She was an artist in residence in Ginza,

25
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:38,000
Japan followed by a similar stint in
Assisi, Italy. Throughout the years,

26
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,610
Gonzalez has started various
community organizations.

27
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,120
You can see some of her work on the gold
line trains as well as buses throughout

28
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:46,700
La.
In a collaboration with a Arp,

29
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,510
you'll end the study that the Pasadena
Art Center College of design after

30
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,150
winning a painting competition that
are awarded her a scholarship to the

31
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:56,570
prestigious school.
Thanks again of course,

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,070
and now we have Roselli Lopez Elo's
Angeles based artists whose work involved

33
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:04,700
combining cultural iconography with
references of our everyday surroundings.

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,420
At a young age, she was heavily
impacted with the realities of loss,

35
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,820
addictions and violence.
Within our immediate family,

36
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,730
which continue to shape our
perspectives and society and culture.

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,380
She primarily uses printmaking but
been picado installation and the altar

38
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:23,270
offering to really experiences of survival
loss in pride was a earned a master

39
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:27,020
of fine arts in printmaking from Indiana
University and do a bachelor of fine

40
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,650

making from California State University.

41
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,543
Long Beach.

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,060
All three women have had their artwork
exhibited in many museums around the

43
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:37,910
country and internationally.
So let's give him a warm welcome.

44
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,340
[inaudible]

45
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,840
welcome to the Google fund maybe.
Yeah, this is very exciting.

46
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,420
Super exciting to do it.
You know,

47
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,790
Spanish heritage month first
event and we have you. Yeah.

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,060
So I'm super,

49
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:57,110
super excited to not only have you here
but also your artwork if you haven't

50
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:00,610
seen the fabulous display of art that
have here in the collection in the

51
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,190
boardwalk. Some people were
like, what is the boardwalk?

52
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:07,060
We have a in front of the Barista outside
of big Lebowski. That is our boardwalk.

53
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,230
That's where we have um,

54
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,140
six different artists displayed
and three of them are right here.

55
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,430
So I love to know.

56
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,490
So there was probably a thought
process which artwork bring to Google.

57
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,113
Was that hard?

58
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,730
Like we have like six for one side of
you specifically chose one Jolanda like

59
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,550
six Roselli four.

60
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm very interested like the behind the
scenes look at why these pieces and what

61
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,340
the selection process was. So just so
everybody knows if we go to one slide,

62
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,340
this is your land does work.
Yolanda, tell us about this.

63
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:43,070
Why did you choose these very particular
pieces to have here with us today? Well,

64
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:43,904
they wanted to

65
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,290
um,
exhibit something contemporary,

66
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,460
something that was
representational of my work. Um,

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,030
that was more recent, that had, um,

68
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,060
all of the texture that I usually use a
color that is known for the Chicano Art.

69
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,173
Um,

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,100
and I wanted to send some of the
works that I'm most excited about. Oh,

71
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,650
very nice. Which are some
still lives and some portraits.

72
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:12,140
And these are portraits of people
that I know that are dear to me, uh,

73
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,580
that represent strength,
power,

74
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,290
positive energy and love.

75
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,720
Thank you.
And now the way the subject,

76
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:22,450
I noticed that two of the paintings
are called Deanna something.

77
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,010
Who is this DNR person?

78
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,273
Well,

79
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,370
the Ana Elise has a very dear
friend of mine and her husband is a,

80
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,870
an incredible, um, jewelry. My Sro,

81
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,350
so this is Diana's husband. This is all
of the work that he creates. And um,

82
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,590
we've known each other for about 25
years and she's just a brilliant woman.

83
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,020
Brilliant, powerful woman.
Great. That's so nice.

84
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,710
Do they have this artwork in their
homes? Uh, they do. They have some,

85
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,850
they have a house in the loom and they've
taken some portraits that I've created

86
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:56,690
of them to their home.

87
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,720
Oh, that's wonderful. Thank you. Thank
you. And then in the next page, um,

88
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,670
we have Roselli's work.
Roselli,

89
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,270
you have four different pieces here
with poppin picado and different things.

90
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:10,160
Tell us why these specific pieces,

91
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,250
uh,
kind of going off what Yolanda was saying,

92
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:17,570
I wanted to pick work that exemplified,
uh, when I'm creating right now, um,

93
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,560
as a printmaker and someone who
combines that with [inaudible].

94
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,620
I wanted to choose works
that talk about the,

95
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:27,500
a friend that and offering and,
um,

96
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,450
a very contemporary way in an
untraditional somewhat ways. So,

97
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,060
um, I have a puppet picado
piece of an La scene, um,

98
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,080
a family portrait that I
combined with led lights and, um,

99
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,000
a couple other, uh, offering that
pieces that are all puppet Ricardo.

100
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,700
So I felt like together they make a
group being that really talks about, um,

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,730
the things that I feel embody
the content that I work with.

102
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,750
That's great. Thank you.
Yeah. So you do a lot.

103
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,690
So you do these also tons of
other like, cause you, yeah.

104
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,150
Combine you installation art.
Um,

105
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,990
sometimes it's just pure printmaking mixed
together sometimes with Buckin picado

106
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,350
so I really enjoy creating,

107
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,350
transforming spaces to give
people an experience. So, um,

108
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,480
sometimes that means breaking out of the
frame and, and uh, inhabiting a space. So.

109
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,600
Nice.

110
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,740
Thank you.
That's great.

111
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,430
And now we're going to see standards
work and Sandra is very specific.

112
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:26,260
You have like this big huge artworks.
One P one.

113
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,370
I'm very curious why one

114
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,630
one piece? Well, it's, it's a group
of work that I'm currently working on.

115
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:37,320
I tend to work in series,
um, set the moment.

116
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:40,280
I'm exploring notions of childhood,
um,

117
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,480
memory and nostalgia. Like, what
drives that nostalgic power,

118
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,340
um, in this image is, you know, is it
something that's been romanticized,

119
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:54,390
something that's been skewed?
Like why, why, like what does,

120
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,650
like why does it have that power?

121
00:06:55,651 --> 00:07:00,300
So I love kind of like asking these
questions as I'm making the work.

122
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,040
So as you see this piece,

123
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:06,450
it's representational yet has
very abstract elements to it.

124
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:11,310
So kind of like a push and pool,
like an inquiry of my past,

125
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:16,020
like where I come from. Um, so it's
a very tender, loving memory. Um,

126
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:16,601
you know,

127
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:21,601
that's a bit like this combobulated and
may make sense and it might ring truth

128
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,810
to some, some of my viewers. I hope so.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,690
No,
I loved it.

130
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,350
So all the work is beautiful and I
thought it was very powerful that you just

131
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:34,020
chose one. Yeah. Like this
is, I need to know more. Um,

132
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,610
so I like to know also,
um,

133
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,180
so you were talking about themes and how
right now you're working on this theme

134
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:44,290
of like childhood. Yeah. What drives a
theme? Like when, for all three of you,

135
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,430
when you work on a theme,

136
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,530
what is that driver or that
influence to go on that theme?

137
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,100
How do you choose the theme that is next?

138
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:51,951
Well,

139
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:56,510
there tends to be themes that I've been
working with for a really long time.

140
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:01,250
So whether it's commemorating a, a
figure, like in a monolithic space,

141
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:04,760
like one figure in a space.
Like why, like telling a story,

142
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,990
like always very narrative.

143
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:10,991
Like I'm so childhood social
justice where I'm from El Salvador,

144
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,400
like it's history,

145
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:18,401
so it's very historically based and
I'm always seeking out a narrative and

146
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:20,600
whatever that narrative may be,

147
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,940
that's the image that surfaces so great.
Yeah.

148
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,020
Um, how, how does it work for both of you?

149
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,130
I think for myself it's something
that's very personal and um,

150
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,800
I try to cover narratives that are,
um,

151
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,120
what people are going through along with
myself and that reality and how that

152
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:47,090
reality is portrayed on canvas,
uh, in a beautiful manner.

153
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,623
Thank you.

154
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,880
In my case, I feel like I'm
very much, I'm inspired by, um,

155
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,770
my community, my neighborhood. And um,

156
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,470
in the beginning a lot of my work was
definitely influenced by those worth those

157
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:06,150
alters and how women would use these
alters as a platform to discuss social

158
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:10,650
issues in the community as a way to have
a voice and gathering assemblage work.

159
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,750
And so, um, from that and
using my own experiences, I,

160
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,210
I use it as a way to

161
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,800
talk about people who I want to praise
or I want to commemorate and how we can

162
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,920
take pride in our communal histories and
stories and display them as something

163
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:30,660
to be very proud about.
Nice.

164
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,730
Do you feel that, so of course, I
mean artwork is, is your emotion.

165
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,980
There's a lot of,
there's a voice behind it.

166
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,780
And do you feel there's a voice or an
emotion that you tap into and when you do

167
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,760
better work comes out, what does that, so
people are like, I need to be depressed,

168
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,300
or Oh, I'm not an artist.
Like this is magical.

169
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,740
Do little things for my children, but
not, but, or certainly like in school,

170
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:59,100
but now tell me, how does that
work for you? That process?

171
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,500
No, definitely like for
me, like in my works,

172
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,290
the struggle, like a struggle,
any struggle. Um, uh,

173
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,470
perseverance, overcoming, um, beauty,

174
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,960
like all of these,
like very strong,

175
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,850
like elements that just run through
all of my work is what drives it.

176
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,260
Like,
absolutely.

177
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,600
Um, I definitely feel like
I'm in, in my case the,

178
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,620
the materials that I use and uh,

179
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,860
the person that I'm dedicating it to are
things that I harness and I want that

180
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:38,870
energy to transmute and
infuse into the artwork. Um,

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,280
so I pull on a lot of
those emotions a lot.

182
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:44,110
Most of the people I use are people
that I'm connected to in some way.

183
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,650
So I have a relationship
with them and I'm,

184
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,660
if I'm commemorating a past memory or
igniting a thoughts from other viewers in

185
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:57,640
it, I want them to, to cherish
those things and to have value, um,

186
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,700
so that they don't forget.
I know.

187
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,790
Okay. I think my inspiration is
people, the relationships that we have.

188
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,810
And then we'll watch shows that they
evoke in my soul and in my heart.

189
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,770
So when there's somebody
that I'm passionate about
that I'm creating a portrait

190
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:16,700
of, you definitely see it on the
canvas course. Absolutely. Yeah.

191
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,640
So, so, so it's that emotion that
we're discussing, right? So it's, yeah.

192
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:23,720
So when you're doing people, I mean
it's people you're passionate about it,

193
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:26,050
very excited to evoke.
Um,

194
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,560
is it just all pure happiness or do you
have like inner emotions that are coming

195
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:32,720
out in this painting too that
you're trying to get? I mean,

196
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:35,090
like there's always like subliminal
messages. Yeah. That too.

197
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,200
There's all kinds of emotions that,
that transpire in the creative process.

198
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,920
And it's that relationship
between your canvas. Um,

199
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,210
and since I've been painting for 30 years,
it's,

200
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:51,211
it's a love relationship and it's
this medium that feeds my soul and um,

201
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,220
and then this other person. So it's
a dialogue between the three of us,

202
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:00,880
between the creative process, the
canvas, myself and the sitter,

203
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,490
the portrait I'm creating of.
Um,

204
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,360
and so definitely there's different
emotions that come out and,

205
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,390
and it's lovely to allow yourself to
convey that with the brush strokes.

206
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,230
Sure. Definitely. Yeah.

207
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,630
So tell me,
tell me,

208
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,870
I was just going to say it's like a form
of communicate. Instead of using words,

209
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,080
you can say it basket with
images and yeah. And textures.

210
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:24,610
And as those things layer,

211
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,610
it creates the emotion that you're
not quite able to put into the same,

212
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,540
same sort of wording. So it, um,

213
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,480
you hope that people get that when
they see it or it allows them to see

214
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:37,750
something in a different way because
that's how you find your mode of

215
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:40,030
communication happening best. Sure. Yeah.

216
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,180
That's like for the next Google talk,
we'll just have easels. Absolutely.

217
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,420
Great idea that's doing it.
Um,

218
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:52,320
so I'm very proud to be a amongst,
you know, all these Latinas. Right?

219
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:56,520
It's wonderful. And I'm thinking, how
hard is it? I mean, I Latina a woman,

220
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,320
basically you're an entrepreneur,
right?

221
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,140
How hard is it in the art world to be
a Latina and a woman, you know, in,

222
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:07,980
in, in a business that's, there's
a lot of men in it to tell me,

223
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,180
I want to know.
Um,

224
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,450
there are obstacles.
I tend to not focus on them.

225
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,750
I just continued to forge forward and
to continue to be focused on what I'm

226
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,530
doing in business and my creativity.

227
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,520
So there'd Yolanda Gonzales who
is the artist, the creative, um,

228
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,180
and there is your land.

229
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,290
They go on sale as the business person
that was taught to me by my dad,

230
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,810
the Apollo one, Silas who
was a great businessman. Um,

231
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,840
so I think if you can separate yourself
from the creative and then to the

232
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:41,120
business of this, this
beautiful painting, um,

233
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,320
that you're going to hand over, their
soul is going to hang in somebody's home.

234
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,700
I think it's important to focus on that.
So there are obstacles,

235
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:53,140
but I think like in any, in
any other line of work, um,

236
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,650
I just focus on a clear,

237
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,370
straight and narrow road.
That's to my goal.

238
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,940
It's that Latino backbone.

239
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,940
And we have parents and family
who teaches how to work hard,

240
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,640
show us what it's like to have
dedication into something.

241
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,840
And, um, I, I feel like I definitely
pull from that to like my mom,

242
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,630
single parent mom and what
she did to make things work.

243
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:23,050
And you use that transmute that into what
goals you want to accomplish. And it,

244
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:24,510
it sets,
it comes through.

245
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,270
You can tell people's drive and
you could see it because they,

246
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,020
they learned from people before and
them not even in the same field or a

247
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:31,350
different thing,

248
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,350
but they see it being applied and
then it trickles down into your own

249
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:38,760
personality and the way that you, that
way that you meet that you work. Sure. So,

250
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:42,750
um, uh, I think that there
is definitely a struggle.

251
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,720
Being an artist is not easy.
And I,

252
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,040
I want to do a lot of
answers first because she's,

253
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,120
she's got a lot more experienced than a,
Sandra and I were,

254
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:53,580
were newer in this starting
game. So I feel like, uh,

255
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,630
I learned from women like her that,
that their strength and their, um,

256
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,940
passageways. Then pioneering
these these paths for us. Yeah.

257
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,680
Make it a different world for us than
it was, I think even in their timeframe.

258
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:08,300
So I acknowledged that.

259
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:12,620
I really feel like they are people that
I like to look up to and I learned from,

260
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,940
um, I'm a teacher too. So I feel
like as an instructor, as a teacher,

261
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:20,210
sometimes a student has don't think like,
Oh, where's the teacher? Oh, that's me.

262
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,840
You know what is right here.
I'm not as a,

263
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,830
I appreciate her boldness
and her strength.

264
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:27,500
And I think that's something that
I really admire about Yolanda.

265
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,350
It comes through in her work and,
um, I feel like, uh, I'm just,

266
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,730
I'm coming to my own in that,
um,

267
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,960
I'm finding that voice and I'm
figuring how that communicates with my

268
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:43,090
surroundings and my neighborhood.
Um, I feel like I can be a, uh,

269
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,020
a venue for communicating
these things. Um, how,

270
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,350
how I am impacted by them and how
other people see this happening in our

271
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:51,891
communities.

272
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:56,891
So we play an important role in showing
people that it's not the same route to

273
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,820
understanding what's happening in our
culture, in our neighborhood. And,

274
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:06,740
um, I, I feel thankful to be a
part of events like this because,

275
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,620
um,
it's not a voice that's commonly heard.

276
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,950
It's not a voice where we often get
a platform to be such a strong voice.

277
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:17,420
So I appreciate, um,
being involved with it

278
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,650
then being involved with artists like,
like these. So of course. Are you kidding?

279
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:26,420
You're always welcome. Yeah. I'd like
to say thank you for saying that.

280
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:31,310
I appreciate it and I've, um, I've
worked hard to, to keep it, um,

281
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,620
my reputation and my persona kind of a,
a certain way for,

282
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,330
for you.

283
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,100
The aura comes through. I never
had, I never had the kids, you know,

284
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,020
I never had a kid.
Yeah.

285
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,910
But I felt when I would go places, I
always tell my friends we're representing,

286
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,960
we are representing, we're
responsible wherever we are, you know,

287
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,810
we are responsible to hold
up who we are and our,

288
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,200
our whole culture where there were the
only Chicana in the room at its function

289
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,660
in a very astute place. And
we're representing, of course,

290
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:07,920
it doesn't matter if you're in the
restroom or if you're in the dining room.

291
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,850
People Watch and you have to represent
who you are, who your culture is.

292
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,740
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And
Los Angeles, just in general,

293
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:20,820
like I've moved around a bit and
I've experienced different, um,

294
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,460
like art communities.
But having,

295
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,160
having arrived here three years ago,

296
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:31,260
I found a lot like an art community
here that was just very inviting,

297
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:35,820
very giving, like, you know, finding
these strongholds. Like he's beautiful,

298
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:40,050
powerful women, like Chicana
artists that, you know,

299
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,400
that'll give you a chance. Like, you know,
I'm, I'm Salvadorian, but I met this, uh,

300
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,720
amazing artists, Margaret Garcia when
I first moved here and she's like,

301
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:50,670
oh honey,
we're all the same here.

302
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:54,510
Like within like a week
of me having meeting her,

303
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:58,650
like she already had me kind of like
meeting different people and into

304
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:03,540
exhibitions and it's just like everyone
here is like down to help each other out,

305
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,960
which is something that you don't
really find in a lot of places.

306
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:11,961
So it's a lot of power here within the
art community and Chicanas Latinas in

307
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:12,970
general.

308
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,990
So you're paying it forward. You
were saying you, you know, you're,

309
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,940
you always have a voice. You always,
people are always watching. Do you mentor,

310
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,580
tell us a little bit about that.
Like what do you do to like pip?

311
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:24,190
So to give to the next generation?

312
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,740
Cause I know your team right
now. I, I I love teaching.

313
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,610
I teach right now at two
cal state universities at
cal State Long Beach and cal

314
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:38,560
state North Ridge and also at Cerritos
College. So, um, teaching art.

315
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,190
I feel like some of my
biggest mentors that I have,

316
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,670
a lot of them were professors and some
of them were working artists outside of

317
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,340
the institution.
So I really try to bring,

318
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,180
I try to think about how I can
bring that communal experience and,

319
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,540
and working with artists outside of
the institution and think about how you

320
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,500
could bring that into the institution
and work with students and get them to

321
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,340
clarify their own voices, how you're
teaching them, how to use a medium,

322
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,770
and then also how to speak
through that medium. So, um,

323
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,140
it's an interesting thing. I think like
that helps to pay it back. I think. Uh,

324
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,550
I'm really happy to also work at
the community level with places like

325
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,580
[inaudible] where I get to work with
youth and those young kids that just love,

326
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,850
you know, working with art. It's not
even always about the end product.

327
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:28,360
It's about the process of working
and having fun and you know,

328
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:32,710
those experiences coming together
or what makes it a lot of fun.

329
00:19:32,711 --> 00:19:37,300
So yeah, of course. Anything
over there I have more questions.

330
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,010
You know, I think, I think it's
important to, um, mentor. Um,

331
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,940
I've taught several places throughout
the 30 years that I've been creating art.

332
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,230
I worked for blessing for
plastic Rasa teaching, um,

333
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,240
and for better Los Ninos, uh, for
inner city yards for 14 years. Um,

334
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,320
and it was amazing to work
with the youth and, um,

335
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,880
just to teach them art, but to also
teach them acceptance of who they are.

336
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,550
Right now I work with ultimate,
uh, teaching senior citizens,

337
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,720
teaching senior citizens a
watercolor and a ceramics,

338
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:18,490
hence your arp. Yes. And they're
absolutely, and they're absolutely lovely.

339
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,653
Absolutely lovely.

340
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,850
And so you were here recently,
you're saying three years
ago, right? Yeah. So how,

341
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:25,330
how,

342
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:30,330
so they've embraced you and now it's too
early to move to give back or what are

343
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,900
you, what are you thinking about in terms
of like the next generation? How, um,

344
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,680
Oh man,

345
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,210
I'm, I'm excited to be working
with Walesa La Raza. I was, um,

346
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,550
I noticed that while I was working for
Margaret Garcia and I also worked for

347
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:47,270
Frank Romero and other
artists in the community, um,

348
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,890
I would assist them within their classes
at Plaza La Raza and realize that there

349
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:57,460
was really nothing being offered for the
next generation that's trying to move

350
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:00,640
forward and kind of like
hone in on their skills,

351
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,090
what they're really trying to say and
express and just like start developing

352
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:07,000
their own style, their
own voice through art. Um,

353
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:12,001
so I proposed a portfolio preparation
course at blessed and we're entering the

354
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,510
fourth semester now. So I'm
pretty excited about it. I,

355
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,000
we have many beautiful,

356
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:24,001
very talented artists and just giving
them a space to really think about the

357
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:27,960
work that they're making and have
them develop their style. Um,

358
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,060
that was something that was very
important for me as a kid in high school.

359
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:33,880
Like having that teacher that,
you know,

360
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,170
we'll just kind of give you the space
and room to do what you need to do. Um,

361
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,150
and you know,
and just like beginning dialogue,

362
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:42,580
like having conversations about your work.

363
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:46,840
Like there's more to it than just the
beautiful image, you know, or, um,

364
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,740
so that's,
I already feel like I'm,

365
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm giving into that and feeding it and,
and it's feeding me as well.

366
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,270
It's definitely like a
reciprocal relationship.

367
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,160
I love it. So I mean, as an artist,

368
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,310
I mean your surrounding shape,
you and,

369
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:08,130
and you know and influence you and the
people you meet and all the travels that

370
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:11,310
you do. I mean, you've moved around,
you've traveled, you've been to, you know,

371
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,220
even done work in a CC.
Um,

372
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,740
you've had a ton of things also in
the community had happened. You know,

373
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:20,850
if there's a lot that
goes on, um, in my mind,

374
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,440
can you think of an anecdote or a story
or like one example that's really shows

375
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:28,830
they wanted piece of art really
made an impact. Is there like a,

376
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,270
like the one or is it like, no all
the time or everything? I don't know.

377
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,960
I mean, when and why, what
is, what made that impact?

378
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,280
Aw, I guess during, yeah,
you got a story. I love it.

379
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,700
Uh, I, I've had this idea of why I would
make a lot of altars and a lot of, uh,

380
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,980
offerings.
So it,

381
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:52,340
I've had this idea for a long time and
I was happy to be able to do it finally,

382
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:55,820
like I think three years into having it
was in my sketchbook and I finally get

383
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:58,990
to do it and that's the
grant money to do it. Um,

384
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:02,270
but I've always wanted to do
this popup alter installation.

385
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,590
I'm dedicated to my mom. My
mom, when she passed away,

386
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,060
we inherited all of her plants.

387
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,260
And so my sister and I started taking
care of her plants and learning how to

388
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:16,220
have this green thumb because we wanted
to preserve her through these plants.

389
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,120
And so I've been sprouting them and my
sister and I were living together and

390
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:23,000
then we were going to part ways.
She was going to get a job somewhere else.

391
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,050
And the thought of not having her
plants was like, oh, don't worry,

392
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:29,720
I'm going to clone them. I'm going
to, we can each have, you know.

393
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:33,500
So I cloned all the plants and I started
getting into cloning and I decided to

394
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:33,741
make,

395
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:38,030
I wanted to make a pop up alter where
people shared stories of their mother's

396
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,380
with me and an exchange.

397
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:42,050
I would give them a sprouting
Platt from one of my mom's plants.

398
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,360
So I wanted to gather and archive all
these and post them up on social media and

399
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:51,050
on my website so that people can listen
to these great stories that they told

400
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:55,400
and they share it about women in their
lives. So, um, this past mother's Day,

401
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,340
the day before mother's Day,
um,

402
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,500
I was able to set up a little popup
on the La River bed and I asked,

403
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,410
I got a chance to do it,
sit at this huge altar,

404
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,840
beautiful green plants and you know,

405
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:10,340
just seeing them sort of perky and happy
there. The plants that is, I always like,

406
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,110
like this is for you mom.

407
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:16,130
And then also hearing everyone's stories
of how women in their lives brought

408
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:18,440
like so much strength and um,

409
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,670
the amazing things that people remember
and also their connection to this living

410
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,770
thing, a plant, what that meant to a lot
of people. And those stories that I heard,

411
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:28,820
it was like a constant,

412
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:32,600
I felt like that was giving back because
those memories stay with people for the

413
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:37,520
rest of the day. They, they remember that
memory about grandma or about anti and,

414
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,940
and it stays with them and they thought,
man, I almost forgot about that.

415
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,760
And is because of that moment,
that event that they got to remember.

416
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,210
And that's what was really important
for me. I felt like that was,

417
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,740
that was my anecdote. That was
beautiful. Thank you. Wow. Yeah.

418
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,740
Are you going to do it again? Oh, I'd
love to. I've always wanted to do this,

419
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:58,910
like in a flea market or swap meet and
have a different sort of crowd, you know,

420
00:24:58,911 --> 00:24:59,600
uh,

421
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,770
and then grow that archive and just
continue adding stories and adding stories

422
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,940
to it. So now you can,
not all of us. Yeah.

423
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,300
Sunday you had a story as well.
All you can tell, Huh? Yes.

424
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,330
Um,

425
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,760
so when I recently moved here,

426
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:19,820
this is why I think it's
just like when I moved here,

427
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,830
all the stars were just
like telling me like,

428
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:26,720
you're at the right place at the right
time. Uh, when I had just moved here,

429
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,430
um, I, I was, I remember I was in Home
Depot and I was like walking around.

430
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,010
I was like, well, I need a plant
from my new home, you know,

431
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:37,840
like looking around and then I
get an unknown phone call. Um,

432
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,760
and when I pick up,
I Maria,

433
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:43,670
what Datto is on the other line
at the other end of the line,

434
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:46,310
and I'm not sure if you
guys are familiar with her,

435
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,950
but she was very prominent.
Um,

436
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:52,010
social justice figure here in Los Angeles,
um,

437
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,210
had survived through many,
many things.

438
00:25:56,211 --> 00:26:00,100
I'm in El Salvador and resettled
in the United States, um,

439
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,560
during the 80s.
So since the 80s,

440
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,740
she's been organizing with
so many different groups. Um,

441
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,200
she heard about the type of
work that I was doing, a,

442
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,530
which is all based on historical
collective memory, um,

443
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,640
like stories from the Salvadoran
civil war. And she said to me like,

444
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,310
I'd love to meet you and you know,
I'd love to talk to you. I'd love,

445
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,330
I'd love to have you paint me
like have a sitting, right?

446
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,450
So we talked about getting that together
and I worked with her for about a year

447
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,800
and walked away from the experience
with two really beautiful paintings.

448
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:41,760
But throughout that, that timespan,
like she shared her stories with me. Uh,

449
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,490
we would go out for
pool, we would, you know,

450
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:47,440
it's just a lot of beautiful
experiences. But, um,

451
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,460
she also sat me down to watch a
documentary that was done for her.

452
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,100
So we like sat in a room held hands
sometimes because it was just like the

453
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:01,480
story. It was just really intense. Um,

454
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,130
but she explained to me maybe midway of
having spent time with her that she had

455
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:09,000
cancer,

456
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,590
like you had come back and she had
a certain amount of time to live.

457
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:18,591
So just having the opportunity to sit
with her and paint her and share her

458
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:23,340
story, um, and exhibited
in different spaces,

459
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,900
like brought so many people together
from different parts of her life,

460
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:32,820
um, that would recognize that
person in the painting. Like
people were, you know, I,

461
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,680
I walked up to one person, I'm
a patron of mine actually. Uh,

462
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,210
and she was crying when
she was seeing the,

463
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,640
the painting and she shared with me
like once Maria had already passed,

464
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,630
she had shared the stories that they
shared together, like through goddess.

465
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:50,400
And so,
um,

466
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,720
I feel like it was just a very organic
and natural thing that just happened.

467
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,080
And I feel fortunate to have
been able to document that.

468
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:02,430
And so just produce something
that keeps her memory like living.

469
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,020
So it was pretty magical. Yeah. I'd
love to show you guys the images now,

470
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,500
but um, you know, but her story was,

471
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,460
was definitely about survival.
There's a beauty to it,

472
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:18,900
but there was also a lot of darkness
to it. Um, so I think, yeah,

473
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:21,840
it was just very powerful,
like for sharing of course.

474
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,530
Delanda all your experience.

475
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:29,120
Tell me one maybe,
I don't know,

476
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,660
then you can you reduce it? I
don't know. Yeah, I could, I can

477
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,510
reduce it. I think, I think
one that is very recent. Dom,

478
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:40,490
I was recently commissioned,
um, by ultimate to create a, um,

479
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,590
a sculpture for one of their
facilities. Um, and um,

480
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,910
I have been creating ceramics
for about 20 years. Um,

481
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,380
and um,

482
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,650
there are these women that I make that
are called the [inaudible] and they have

483
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:59,420
these Jong Ethos and they're very
colorful and very strong, uh, women.

484
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,150
Um,
so they asked me to create this piece,

485
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,390
which was going to end up being
about six feet tall and ceramics.

486
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,940
So I started to created,
um,

487
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:12,770
we had the heads that are large orbs
about this big. Um, we created the heads,

488
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:17,570
the torso and the skirt. Uh, and
it's during a time where, uh,

489
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:22,670
I was going through a very, um,
difficult a transition in my life.

490
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,070
And, uh, so we created the skirt,

491
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:29,170
which is about this tall am
and it's going into the, uh,

492
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,970
Kim and it breaks,
uh,

493
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,640
and it was very symbolic of
what I was going through.

494
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,500
We created another one and went into the
kiln. When it came out, it was cracked.

495
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,170
Um, then we created a third
and when it came out and,

496
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,430
and some form,

497
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:50,431
I was in a stronger place and kind of
more comfortable where I was and wasn't

498
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:54,820
struggling so much with the transition.
She came out fine.

499
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,240
And how long was that process between
the first one? It's been six months.

500
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,550
It was six months. Um, and then also
creating the orbs in the heads for me,

501
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,930
uh, was very organic and feeling
these orbs and creating the portrait.

502
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,650
Um,
I felt it was like,

503
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,570
this is what it would be like to give
birth this or I felt it and it was cool.

504
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:17,404
And the clay was,

505
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,460
the smell of the clay was just
so beautiful and magical. Um,

506
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,250
so I created her, it took four men to
install, or cause she's about 600 pounds.

507
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,710
Uh, she was installed. Um,

508
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,000
and so once she was installed and I
turned around and I looked at her,

509
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:39,001
I cried because I thought we have both
a completed this process together.

510
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,340
And that's what that piece was for me.
It was,

511
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,300
it was building myself up again to
continue what I had to continue.

512
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,150
Universal,
very symbolic and wow.

513
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,630
And so is there anything that I know
like transitioning from that, it's like

514
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:00,010
cry. It's an artist. Artist's
life. Welcome to the artist's life.

515
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,910
So in this roller coaster of emotions,
is there anything you were

516
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,990
Gret then? Nothing. Not One.

517
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,610
Is there a some type of artwork or,
um,

518
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,730
John Ra that you would never do?

519
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,403
Oh Wow.

520
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,460
Can't say that, but I dunno. I
Dunno. I'm asking you to say never.

521
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:24,220
We have so much that you wouldn't want
to wear that you're like have fear of,

522
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:26,880
is there like a, like a thing that
you're like, ah, I try to avoid it?

523
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,163
Mm.

524
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,360
I think if there's different mediums
because people will come to you. Um,

525
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,860
I was sent to Japan to do printmaking
and I had done some printmaking it self

526
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:38,530
help graphics,
but not that much.

527
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,140
But what you do is you
essentially, um, interpret it,

528
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,250
that style, that medium
in your process. Okay.

529
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:52,210
So you make it your own. Yes. And
then therefore it's accepting to you,

530
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,480
but is there anything else that
you were like, I don't know.

531
00:31:55,481 --> 00:32:00,010
I don't want to go there.
It's not something that's
my style. I don't want to,

532
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,210
you know, maybe I,

533
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,010
yeah,

534
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,140
that's an interesting question.
Um, it's hard, I think, um,

535
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,490
when I think about moments in my life
where I wondered if I had gone this way

536
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:18,110
versus that way, I definitely
thought about, um, there,

537
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,730
there was a time in my life when I had
just graduated and I got my on my BFA

538
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:28,210
degree and I was going to be
going into Grad school. Um,

539
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:32,710
and there was a time in
between then when I, uh,

540
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,300
I lost my brother unexpectedly at
a very young age. Um, and he, um,

541
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,541
yeah,
he,

542
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:43,280
he died of an overdose and I was like
really distraught and my family was out of

543
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:46,080
state and I was in California.
I stayed here in California.

544
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,340
They had moved away and I really felt
like I wanted to be with them and it was

545
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:50,031
so difficult.

546
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:53,690
But here I am in a part of my life where
I'm supposed to decide where out of

547
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:54,890
state I'm going to school.

548
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:58,550
And it was a horrible feeling that
should have been like much different.

549
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,830
And so I, my heart wanted to go
to New Mexico where my family was.

550
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,300
And uh,

551
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,840
I had gotten a opportunity to go to Grad
school on a full ride scholarship in

552
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:14,840
Indiana University and the thought
of going across the country,

553
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,500
leaving Los Angeles and going
to a place where you know,

554
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:23,150
where you really are different.
Sure. Um, and it was, uh,

555
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,110
it was heart wrenching.

556
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:28,310
It was my mom's advice that sort of
pushed me into continuing to go into that

557
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:31,940
route because it was like, that's,
that's what he would wanted you to do.

558
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,030
But it wasn't what I wanted to do.
I wanted to go and meet with them.

559
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,980
So I wonder what my life would be
like if I had continued and lived out,

560
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:40,311
I dunno,

561
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:43,370
maybe applied to school out there and
decided to go a different route with my

562
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:46,190
life. Um, but while I was in Indiana,

563
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,570
I totally got immersed in like
an in using Altrisk as a way to,

564
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:54,380
to remember to heal and, um, to,

565
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,900
to learn to have my own voice.
So,

566
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,040
and having living in
that place where I there,

567
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,920
there's not as much social
diversity is we have in Los Angeles.

568
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,040
It really forced me to have to talk
about my work to people who didn't

569
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:10,310
understand it. So it was great. Yeah.

570
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:14,900
That experience was very difficult,
but also like, I think that, um,

571
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,720
yeah, it just was a point
in my life where I thought,

572
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:20,870
I wonder how it would have ended up if
I had gone somewhere else versus here.

573
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,610
Course. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

574
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,500
Speechless a bit. Um,
very strong women. Wow.

575
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,730
I love all these stories and thank
you. They were very personal. Yeah.

576
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,770
Very thankful that you're
sharing that with us.

577
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:38,740
So it feels like I'm part of like,
I'm in your homes and you're like,

578
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:44,020
I need to give you some coffee, see
doors. And I'm like, this is like really

579
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,350
getting in touch with this beautiful
stories and like, wow. Thank you. Wow.

580
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,930
Um, okay. So, so I want to touch
a little bit more on the whole,

581
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:58,840
the whole aspect that you, you were
just, you were just touching on,

582
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:00,830
have you had to explain your art?

583
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,960
People really didn't get it or didn't
understand it. How was that process like,

584
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,550
have you had that experience too?

585
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,770
It was, I'm going to speak as a, you know,

586
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,540
acknowledging the fact that I'm
very young in this environment. Um,

587
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:21,330
but that I looked, it made me realize how
much more I had to study and learn, um,

588
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,910
the artists who are working in this
form before me and understand their

589
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:29,210
conversations and where it was coming
because it helped me build up my strength

590
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,090
to even be able to communicate
these things. I want to,

591
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,740
I want to talk about a person's life
and celebrate it without feeling the

592
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,860
drabness of death and like leaving this
life and I want to celebrate them and

593
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,420
the lessons that they taught
me and how do I do that? And,

594
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,090
and those Muertos and alters
and [inaudible] gave me
that venue to be able to

595
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:52,290
talk about it. So I, I
studied, I researched, I,

596
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,543
um,

597
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,850
I definitely wanted to investigate a lot
of Chicanos who were using alters as a,

598
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,250
as another way, not just to
commemorate their, aren't the silos,

599
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:06,720
but as a way to talk about the social
dynamics of where they're coming from and,

600
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,860
and how they can communicate
that in a public atmosphere.

601
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,750
It doesn't have to be in a, a white wall
gallery. It can be in, in a public space.

602
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:17,820
So, um, growing up in,

603
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:21,960
in La and having places like self help
graphics that are pioneering, you know,

604
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,280
a contemporary that was worth as a Chicano
wise version of it goes mirth though.

605
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:28,140
So it was like a setting
the pathway for me to,

606
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,650
to discuss all of these things and to,

607
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,670
to be who I wanted to be and talk about
my family and also my situation and

608
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:38,980
related to everyone else
around me. And uh, the,

609
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,890
even though I was all the way in Indiana,

610
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,610
I had the access to resources
to do this homework to, to,

611
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,720
to look at books and to read and research.

612
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,920
So when I came back home I felt like a
lot more empowered to understand it when

613
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:57,660
you kind of take it for granted a
little bit growing up in it. So yeah,

614
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,321
that's great.

615
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:01,020
And your power at a ton of other
people and now they're more educated,

616
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,540
empowered everyone here.

617
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,970
Yeah. Like it's more than just like a
lack as a makeup and you know, it's not,

618
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:08,850
forget this like,

619
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,020
yeah, of course. Thank you.

620
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,510
Sunday we were going to say anything.
No, maybe, but I do have a question.

621
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,810
So we were discussing, you know,
this voice that you have as artists.

622
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:26,820
How has social media or digital
or technology helped your careers

623
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,780
or not? I mean maybe not. Well,

624
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,960
I mean it helps in the sense of like
having you connected with so many of your

625
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:40,140
peers and your colleagues.
And I mean,

626
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:45,150
being able to research and especially
like the way that I gather like source

627
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:48,420
material. Um, it's very, you know,

628
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,190
I very much needed the Internet and
social media to be able to do that.

629
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,203
Um,

630
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,970
but in particular maybe,
I don't know, maybe not.

631
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,170
Yeah, I'm very intrigued by the,
um, the, the fact that, you know,

632
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:08,280
art is now accessible to all right.
So the minute you do something,

633
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,420
it is seen by millions and millions
of ball eyeballs all over the world

634
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,780
instantly.
And so when you're making this now,

635
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,110
cause it's different like
maybe even 30 years ago, right?

636
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:23,010
Oh yeah. I mean, when you're creating
[inaudible] excited about beepers,

637
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:29,790
well your [inaudible]
turn it around eight,

638
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,840
three, eight, three. It's love.
It's one, four, three, one,
four, three. I was there too.

639
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,520
I remember the phones,
the long cords.

640
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,873
Yeah.

641
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,660
I have a question for you then. So in the
30 year span you've, you've gone from,

642
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,870
you didn't have digital really to now
having people see or artwork if they want

643
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,450
it to around the world.

644
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,240
Does it change now your
perspective when you're painting a,

645
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,710
in the sense that before
people would go and you know,

646
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,560
wherever you had the exhibition
people would see it, you know,

647
00:38:58,561 --> 00:39:00,960
it was that specific people maybe
you toward whatever it is you,

648
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,870
those are the people who saw
it. Right? We Seeked it out,

649
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,940
but now anybody can see it and share it.

650
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:11,090
Does that change how you paint now and
the voice or the message you want to

651
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:13,134
give?

652
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,120
Um, I think it changes a lot of things
except for the way I paint. Okay.

653
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:21,410
Because the painting process and my
relationship with the creative process,

654
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,560
um, is very pure to me. It's very sacred.

655
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,540
And so that is very strong.
One of the strongest relationships I have.

656
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:34,490
Um, and, but it's very exciting to me to,

657
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,590
um, to share. And I,

658
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,920
what I like to do is put a piece,

659
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:42,230
when I first start the sketch,
the rough,

660
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,250
when it's almost done and then when it's
completed so people can kind of see the

661
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:50,240
process of what's happening
of creation. So be it. Um,

662
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,120
so you know, when people put
their kids pictures every month

663
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:59,330
on Facebook and I put my paintings every
month, you know, both of my babies.

664
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:01,090
But that's what's exciting about it.

665
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:05,000
It's like we get to see like the studio
practice unfurled in front of us on

666
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,370
Instagram and Facebook. So
it's like that they, we,

667
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,050
and it's also hard to get used to it,
to opening people up to that process.

668
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:15,710
You know, how much do you want to show?
Like how much is exposed, you know,

669
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,450
like you want to keep
some of those things,

670
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,840
right? Yeah. Right. Yeah. It's
whatever you're comfortable with.

671
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:20,591
You know what I mean?

672
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:24,160
It's whatever you're comfortable really
sharing because it's out there and once

673
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:25,360
it's out there,
it's out there.

674
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,690
But it is amazing and I've
utilized it to the fullest where,

675
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,900
um, you know, you send out
your message, you know,

676
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:38,350
and you send out your images and then
you represent messages that need to be

677
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:42,250
represented as well. Um,
but I think it's, it's,

678
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,960
it's a fascinating, fascinating
process. You know, the Internet,

679
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,910
it's just fascinating to me and I'm,
I'm such a gadget person.

680
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,320
I love, I loved that. So anything I can
get my little hands on and, and, um,

681
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,540
expose people to what's going on
or in my world, my little utopian,

682
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,760
strange world that's there,

683
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,250
right? It's a, uh, it's exciting.

684
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:09,980
I feel like we're living in a world
where there's all kinds of new technology

685
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:12,350
happening all the time. And, uh,

686
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,550
as artists we get to figure out how to
interpret that and use that. And um,

687
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:22,250
so like a print maker and it's one of
those like classic dying forms that people

688
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:24,350
don't like to use any more
because it's very cumbersome.

689
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,370
But there's always this like conversation
on how we're pulling from new

690
00:41:28,371 --> 00:41:29,990
technology to influence our work.

691
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,410
So how do we keep it relevant in this
of like constant technology of grades,

692
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:39,890
you know? So, um, I like
to see how it impacts the,

693
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:44,480
the conversation I want to have or the
way I envisioned a piece happening. Um,

694
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,020
there's some of the ways that I've
used is I'm a graphic designer,

695
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:52,520
so a lot of the work also starts off on
the computer using digital programs are

696
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:55,410
digitizing the work somehow.
And then I'm like,

697
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:57,260
it's seeing how the work can transmute.

698
00:41:57,261 --> 00:42:01,280
I've had a chance to use CNC router
machines to create like custom furniture

699
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:04,460
pieces that are reminiscent
of my purple Picabo patterns.

700
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:07,870
And that was amazing experience.
Or like laser cutting machines.

701
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:09,530
I take puppet and Ricardo
and a whole other world.

702
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:13,070
What happens when the machine cuts it
out and he had these little burned edges

703
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:17,690
and you know, how those things start
to impact the, the message. And I just,

704
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:21,450
I'd be excited to be able to,
to play with it even more. Um,

705
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,970
I think what becomes a biggest
attorneys accessibility. It's expensive.

706
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:28,610
It's hard to get access to. So, um,

707
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,420
especially once you're outside and you
don't have access to like a university or

708
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:36,090
anything like that. How do you,
how do you use this equipment, um,

709
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,710
in your work? So, um,
yeah, I'd be excited to,

710
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,630
to try to learn to use it more and uh,
it's,

711
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,410
it provides another way for
you to have that communication.

712
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:53,410
So any other way that I can try to use a
technology and I've used it for sharing

713
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:58,070
the stories and I'm collecting to have
this online archive for an online alter.

714
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,080
Um, so I, I try to use it as much
as possible, but I think that,

715
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,393
um,

716
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,070
there's also some deterrent because of
the accessibility of it too. Of course.

717
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,010
Yeah. Yeah. The big machines
are talking about too. I mean,

718
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,380
just in how they collide though,

719
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,750
how you can take the old school in the
classic with like the new technology. So,

720
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,660
and there's like three d printers now
too. Yeah, yeah. Three d printing.

721
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:24,950
I'd love to, to mess around with that
kind of machinery. Yeah. Nice. Well,

722
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:27,350
so now I'm going to open it
up to the audience as well.

723
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:32,300
You have any questions at all please.
This is your time to, um, there's the,

724
00:43:32,301 --> 00:43:33,320
uh, microphone, neither one.

725
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,830
We were talking about the one
you can throw around cube.

726
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,720
Anybody have questions?

727
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,993
Yeah.

728
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,810
Hi everyone. My name is
Eric. So first of all,

729
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:51,880
thank you guys for spending
an afternoon with us.

730
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:54,760
I thought this was really interesting
and really awesome and I'm really happy

731
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:58,340
that you guys came by. Uh,
so now my question is, uh,

732
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:01,460
a few months ago there was like a,
um,

733
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,310
a case in Canada where a
rider was criticized for
saying that other writers and

734
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:10,150
artists should take and write from the
point of view of different ethnicities,

735
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:12,070
cultures, genders, and backgrounds.

736
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,320
And so I was kind of curious
to hear what you guys thought.

737
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:19,321
If you would encourage others to sort
of take the point of view of people that

738
00:44:19,661 --> 00:44:21,220
come from different
backgrounds that they do.

739
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,870
I think that's a big
responsibility. It is. Yeah.

740
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:30,850
I only have my own view and
I can't expect everybody to,

741
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,220
to respect,

742
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,360
um, or accept my point of
view on a whole of a culture.

743
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,530
I don't know at this need. I don't
think that's, I mean, it's right.

744
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,160
I think any artist out there
that's making work, I mean,

745
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:49,161
they're true aspiration should be to
convey a truly honest perspective of their

746
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:54,060
own. So I feel like being
able to share that, I mean,

747
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:56,850
that's how other people are
able to learn about it. Right?

748
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:01,980
But to put yourself in a different
place, it's, it's, it gets tricky.

749
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,790
Of course,

750
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,610
you don't want to be put in a position
where you're the spokesperson for

751
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:09,270
everyone and that just doesn't seem fair.
It's important to be inclusive,

752
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:14,100
to be aware, um, but to, to
be put in the position of,

753
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,780
you know, I'm the spokesperson for Latinos
and I would never want that. You know,

754
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:23,580
that responsibility is too many, too many
voices out there to be heard. So yeah,

755
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:27,560
that's, that's a pretty
tough criticism. Yeah.

756
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,160
So that's what a lot of
hard work. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

757
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,560
definitely. And I mean, I
completely agree. Like it's, I mean,

758
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:39,040
there's the variety of opinions
about it, I guess. Um, and you know,

759
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,760
like on one side, you know, you
should say like, oh, you know,

760
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,360
if by encouraging people to talk about
cultures that are different than their

761
00:45:45,361 --> 00:45:50,350
own, you encourage them to, uh, find
commonalities to find ways to, to,

762
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,240
to empathize. And then from
the other point of view,
kind of like you said, it's,

763
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,020
well, there are many people that could
talk about this particular experience.

764
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:02,550
So why is somebody that may not have
as much experience or knowledge in that

765
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:06,380
background take it upon themselves
to, to talk about it. Um,

766
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,670
so I was kinda curious to hear what
you guys thought. So thank you.

767
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,110
Thank you.
Thank you for the question.

768
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,600
So

769
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,440
cool
ladies,

770
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,080
thank you so much for being here and
I want to take it to the business

771
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:21,580
perspective.
Um,

772
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,680
women traditionally make 72
cents of the dollar of males.

773
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:27,903
Um,

774
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:32,560
black women make 62 cents
and Latinos even less.

775
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,340
So I'm wondering, in terms of
your male counterparts as artists,

776
00:46:36,341 --> 00:46:39,010
when you're comparing art to art,
um,

777
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:44,011
do you find yourself having to or not
making as much as men do in the industry?

778
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,310
Why did we choose to
price it less than that?

779
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:52,800
What know are people wanting you to
charge you less because you're women or

780
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:53,634
Latinas?

781
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,540
That's interesting.

782
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,710
I've seen that on both ends of the
different artists I've worked with since

783
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:07,250
being in Los Angeles.
Like the more, you know,

784
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,420
like the more recognize like
male figure and you know,

785
00:47:11,421 --> 00:47:15,740
a woman that's been like struggling and
really putting in the work like since

786
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:19,340
she began like decades
ago, you know, and uh,

787
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,160
just realizing like that there's,

788
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:27,161
that like women tend to kind of
like underprice their work or like,

789
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,170
like I don't, it's, it is, it's difficult

790
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,190
I think,
uh,

791
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,120
as a woman artist, it's, um,

792
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,410
it's important not to under price my work,
um,

793
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,440
to value my work for the years that I've
been creating art and it's been 30 long

794
00:47:48,681 --> 00:47:50,550
years.
Um,

795
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,200
and I think it's a huge
responsibility for the artists,

796
00:47:56,571 --> 00:48:00,830
the young artists who are following
me to open the door for them,

797
00:48:00,831 --> 00:48:04,010
not only through my art,
but through my business sense.

798
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,330
So you educate people to pay.
If they want a piece of your art,

799
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,470
they want piece of your soul,
they're paying for it.

800
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,310
Yeah.

801
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:15,560
Properly. And if they don't buy it at
that price and they don't deserve it,

802
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,280
they don't buy at that price,
somebody else will, you know,

803
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:22,790
and I have little little pieces you
can get a little piece about this big,

804
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:25,370
we could take pat home.
That'll be fine. Nice.

805
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,250
I got it. Yeah. You
just got know your yeah.

806
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,400
Worth it. Like, you know, stick to it.

807
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,750
And it's hard because a lot of
artists are not business people.

808
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:39,670
I see here it's difficult to separate
because you're emotionally involved to

809
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:41,620
this,
this piece of art.

810
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:46,510
But then what you do is you find somebody
who you trust to represent your art

811
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:52,030
and, and to market it
that way. Yeah. Yeah.

812
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:52,830
I,

813
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,320
I struggle with that a
lot as well because I,

814
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,790
okay.

815
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:01,790
I worry about accessibility and I think
that when like all those things are

816
00:49:03,091 --> 00:49:07,290
true, uh, pricing and the time,
that's an end, what you've invested,

817
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,070
where your career is at, all of those
things that factor into pricing.

818
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,810
And then some of the things I worry
about is like, who can buy that?

819
00:49:15,811 --> 00:49:20,080
Who is going to be able to buy that?
Who am I making it for? And, um,

820
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,670
even though I know it's not
going to make me very much money,

821
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,100
I want my artwork to be accessible,
I want it,

822
00:49:26,101 --> 00:49:29,730
I don't want it to be unreasonable and
attainable for people to be able to

823
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:32,310
purchase. So I, I need to
hire a business person.

824
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,150
I feel like I want to,
I want a little of both.

825
00:49:36,151 --> 00:49:40,260
I think that creating tiers of work
that you could sell for different prices

826
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:44,610
helps to, to make things that
are accessible and um, you know,

827
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:48,000
there you have bigger ideas that a lot
of my work is installation artwork too.

828
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,150
So there's never like really, I
don't really intend on, it's a,

829
00:49:51,151 --> 00:49:54,270
it's a temporary installation
and exist for that point in time.

830
00:49:54,271 --> 00:49:58,230
So sales a lot of times aren't really,
the driving force is more like,

831
00:49:58,231 --> 00:50:00,700
how can I complete this idea? Um, I,

832
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,590
I just moved back to Los Angeles after
living away for six years. And, um,

833
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,180
this past year that I've been back,

834
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,960
I've really been like forced to think
the people in the friends that I've met

835
00:50:09,961 --> 00:50:14,760
are really made me think a lot about
pricing. And I was sort of a living in,

836
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,780
I feel like my own little dream world
of I just want to do the idea, man.

837
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:22,320
I'm just trying to get this idea out
there. The cash wasn't even about it.

838
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:26,430
It wasn't an in, that's the kind of the
struggling part. So that's why I teach

839
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,710
for Leo.
That's one of the reasons why I teach it.

840
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,530
I know that.
So I can have that,

841
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:37,010
that freeness to be able to like create
what I want to create and not be driven

842
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:41,160
by the price, but it's a,
it's a struggling game of
back and forth. And you know,

843
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,950
Yolanda is very established and,

844
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,250
and has a lot of years and I think that,

845
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:51,280
I hope one day to kind of get to a level
where I can be a lot more demanding

846
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:56,730
with it too. Um, but I also think, uh, it,

847
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,150
there's a line too about where you want
to be open and have people find you and

848
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:03,200
get to know you and,

849
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:07,910
and create that relationship through
being a little more accessible. Um,

850
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:10,520
yeah, it's difficult. It's very difficult.

851
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,240
I think as far as accessibility.

852
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,280
If somebody comes into the studio and
they really want a piece instead of

853
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:21,210
lowering the price, you know,
it's a small piece or something,

854
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:22,410
I'll just give it to them.

855
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:23,580
Okay.

856
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,410
You're like, I got payment plans. No, no.

857
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:31,780
[inaudible] I just say take it,
take it. If you want it, take it.

858
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:32,643
Yeah.

859
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:36,880
But, but, um, and then there's also like,
I have a watercolor series. It's really,

860
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:41,740
really reasonable for my work and, but
some of the paintings now, you know,

861
00:51:41,741 --> 00:51:46,210
when I was your guys's age, I would paint
five, six, seven, 10 paintings in a week.

862
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:47,010
It was

863
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:51,320
now been on [inaudible] shoulder,

864
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,740
but now,
you know,

865
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,650
once a month, it's just, it's, you
know, it's closed down, but it,

866
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:03,890
but that's just where I'm at. You know,
that's his, that's this with 30 years of,

867
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:06,800
of the process is taking me and
I have to be accepting of that.

868
00:52:06,801 --> 00:52:10,680
I'm not 25 anymore, you know, but, um,

869
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,180
anytime you need you, you want to come
over and talk, you know, we'll talk.

870
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,820
I'm there.
I'm open to that.

871
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,560
Any other questions?

872
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,643
Okay.

873
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,570
So I'm going to end with one last
one since. Any other questions? Um,

874
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,150
so we have 'em back to the
next generation. I'd love,

875
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,550
there's a ton of people who
not only are digital natives,

876
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,880
right, they don't know anything
else but the online world,

877
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:48,180
but also are really intrigued or really
want to explore art as part of who they

878
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:50,410
are.
Maybe it's their career as part of their,

879
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:55,660
what advice can you give them for this
next generation of artists? You know,

880
00:52:55,661 --> 00:52:59,170
I always believe that can just
have technology, can just have art.

881
00:52:59,171 --> 00:53:04,150
I think the combination works really
nicely now, especially now with steam,

882
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,940
right? Where you can do both. Um, what,

883
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,770
what advice can you give the next
generation of people or kids who want to

884
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,604
pursue art?

885
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,083
Okay.

886
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,750
I think just, just, it's just the old
classic, you know, follow your dream.

887
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:24,520
But now the dream is very large
and vast with, with the Internet.

888
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:25,350
Um,

889
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:30,350
and I think it's amazing for them to
have that accessibility to the Internet.

890
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:35,760
But I also think that the classic way
of learning art is very important.

891
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:40,140
So I think if there's a way to have
the classic way of learning art,

892
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:44,760
which is pencil, charcoal
still life, you know, um,

893
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:49,380
and then transfer that into the internet,
you know,

894
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,620
and combine it and incorporate
it and collaborate with it.

895
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:57,230
I think that's the fascinating part of
the new art we're going to be seeing, um,

896
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,230
in the future.
You know,

897
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:05,140
know where you come from.
Continue to be curious,

898
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:09,550
explore and just continue to ask
questions like within your own work.

899
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:14,230
Definitely. Nice. Um,

900
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,320
I dunno, I, I, I've thought about
this question a few different ways.

901
00:54:20,321 --> 00:54:23,020
There's a lot of artists now who
solely exist on social media,

902
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,270
like their main venues are on social
media and they have a really hard time

903
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:31,270
doing the classic stuff.
You know, the nap again,

904
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:34,330
like I'm already got this many followers
and they're all, you know what I mean?

905
00:54:34,331 --> 00:54:36,490
Like it's,
it's a different way of thinking,

906
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,510
but I think that's the challenge of how
the classic and the traditional still

907
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:45,511
engage that newer age because they found
ways to bypass a lot of the traditional

908
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:50,410
stuff. Why do I need to learn how
to draw the figure if I'm doing,

909
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,610
you know,
um,

910
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:56,860
specific performances and random spots
in la and I'm getting, uh, you know,

911
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:59,830
commissions and they're getting
paid for doing it. So it's,

912
00:54:59,831 --> 00:55:03,220
it's the challenge that I think that the
institution hasn't quite yet led up to

913
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,910
learning how to teach those students how
to keep up with it all because they're

914
00:55:06,911 --> 00:55:11,820
struggling with keeping up with
that new technology. Um, I,

915
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,150
I think too, that I remember
being a student and that this the,

916
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,650
the mode of thinking being like concept,
concept,

917
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,460
concept and those things are really
amazing. Um, you need, if you're,

918
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,870
if you're wanting to be an artist,
there's different types of artists.

919
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:32,320
Some people just paint in their basements
and never expose it to the public.

920
00:55:32,321 --> 00:55:34,540
It's about that moment
that they're creating.

921
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,520
And it's not really about
sharing it with everybody.

922
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:39,400
Some other people have the yearning
to want to share it out in the public.

923
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:40,930
And it's about that communication,

924
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,990
the way that people perceive
it in a public space.

925
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,730
And that's what drives that force.

926
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:49,180
So I don't know that would have like
one piece of advice for artists.

927
00:55:49,181 --> 00:55:53,260
It would be like, you know, what's your,
what's your main goal for this? You know?

928
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,600
Um,
yeah,

929
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:58,970
it's like stem is huge right now
in schools and you hear like,

930
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,290
I'm looking for jobs all the time and
they want to know how you can incorporate

931
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:07,880
stem into your curriculum. And a,
I think that accelerating lead,

932
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:11,080
it's more important because the schools
have stripped away like a lot of those

933
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,640
artists and creatives out of the school,

934
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:17,200
but they want to bring it on on again as
an educational component to teach them,

935
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:20,500
to teach them science,
to teach them all these other things.

936
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:24,640
But where can art exist just for
art? Like white, when you're a kid,

937
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:26,260
you think you're thinking about concept.
No,

938
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:29,920
you're remembering that fun part of why
you want to make art of what it is to

939
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:33,790
create. And it's important not to
lose that were so strained, I think,

940
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,420
to have this greater, bigger
social message. And those
things are very important,

941
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,160
but there should also still live a space
where you can just be free to create

942
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:45,420
just because, and you may
not know why, but it, it, it,

943
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,570
you need to have that happen at the same
time that other people are more driven

944
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:53,590
by that message. So to have both
existing simultaneously, I think,

945
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,770
and not knock people down for having a
different way of thinking about it or

946
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,900
working with it.
Yeah.

947
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,230
That's great.
I agree completely.

948
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:05,910
I think there's a space for
both also separately. Yeah.
And together. Why not? Yeah.

949
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,780
Again, thank you so, so
much. You've been wonderful.

950
00:57:09,781 --> 00:57:13,230
Thank you for sharing such beautiful
personal stories for allowing us to have

951
00:57:13,231 --> 00:57:16,560
and share your beautiful work
right here in our halls. Um,

952
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,460
and just for being here today.
Thank you. Thank you. Ladies.
