1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,080
We're here today to talk to Angela
Duckworth who's book, uh, Grit,

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,190
the power, passion perseverance was today
is the official publication date. Right.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,030
The official publication date.
Congrats. Congratulations. Yeah. Yeah.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,230
Thank you.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,030
Incredibly gracious of her to fit
time in at Google with a really,

6
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:25,780
really busy publicity tour, um, which, uh,

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,580
I was getting exhausted just hearing
about it a few minutes ago. So, um,

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,970
for those of you who aren't familiar
with Angela Duckworth's work,

9
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:37,610
let me read, try to briefly
read a biography. Um,

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,500
Angela Duckworth is a
professor of psychology at the
University of Pennsylvania

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,350
and the founder and scientific
director of the Character Lab,

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,830
a nonprofit whose mission is to advance
the science and practice of character

13
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:49,810
development.
In 2013,

14
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,110
Angelo was named in Macarthur Fellow
and recognition of her research on grit,

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,760
self control and other non Iq
competencies that predict success in life.

16
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,380
Uh, it's a very impressive resume.
Uh, prior to a career in research,

17
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:05,320
Angela founded the summer school for low
income children that was profiled as a

18
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:07,930
Harvard Kennedy School case study.
Um,

19
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,840
she's been in Mckinsey management
consultant, a math and science teacher.

20
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:14,140
In the public schools of New York City,
San Francisco and Philadelphia.

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,260
She has degrees from Harvard,
Oxford,

22
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:21,730
and the University of Pennsylvania in
neuroscience and in psychology. Um,

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,840
and did I mention she's a MacArthur
fellow, 2015 in MacArthur fellow. Um,

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,790
all right, I'll stop there. And Grit is
her first book. It says, so welcome again,

25
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,720
Angela.
Thank you for coming.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,940
Thank you for having me.

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,973
Delighted.

28
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,890
So let's get right into it. If you're
not familiar with her work, the Ted talk,

29
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:45,680
the, uh, the, the book, um,

30
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,800
I guess, uh, is it maybe,

31
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:53,801
hopefully it's fair for me to summarize
the thesis as that the power as you put

32
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:58,400
it, the power of passion and perseverance
or at least a strong indicators and

33
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:02,120
contributors to success or achievement
as things like Iq and talent, which are,

34
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,290
I think what Societaly at least
we've traditionally focused on.

35
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,090
And that resonated enormously
for me because I think at
Google we spend a lot of

36
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:15,670
time thinking about, uh, uh, talent Iq,

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,970
raw talent. Uh, it's kind of baked into
this crazy hiring process that we have.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,050
And, um, which brought me to the
first question I had for you,

39
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:27,290
which was do you think that, I mean,
from what you know about Google,

40
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,190
do you think that we are,

41
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:31,970
do you think that organizations in
general select for the wrong things in the

42
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:34,780
hiring process and would,

43
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,680
would we be better off what organizations
be better off if they looked for grip

44
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,990
plus bit as opposed to attempting
to measure innate talent?

45
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,240
You know, I think the interest
that we all have in talent,

46
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:50,960
right? And it's not just
Google, it's me to, you know, I,

47
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,170
I wish I were more talented
talents. Great. Um,

48
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:57,240
and if you could give me five
more Iq points, I'd take them.

49
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,950
It's not that I don't think it's wrong.
Think about talent.

50
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,930
I don't think it's wrong
to think about potential.

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,070
I do think it's useful to think about
what we really mean when we say the word

52
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:06,904
talent.

53
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,090
And if you force yourself to write down
on a piece of paper and a sentence that

54
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:14,230
ends with a period, talent is, it's
really hard to actually feel it.

55
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:17,560
Like what do I mean? I'd potential
and when we start to use metaphors,

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,470
here's my definition of talent
and I think it reveals that.

57
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:25,471
I do think it's important talent is the
rate at which you increase in your skill

58
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,273
with effort.

59
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,960
Some people are going to increase their
skills faster than others and I think

60
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,570
it's legitimate to say
those are the quick studies.

61
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,890
Those are the talented people.

62
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,550
I think it's legitimate for Google
to look for them, right? Why not?

63
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:44,230
Why not try to hire the more talented
people? But in my data I find two things.

64
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,470
One is that more talented individuals
don't always keep showing up, right?

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,730
Woody Allen famously once said,

66
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,850
80% of success in life is just showing up.

67
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,990
He was later asked by William Sapphire
of the New York Times how he got to the

68
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:03,340
number 80 and woody Allen who is not
exactly a scientist, said, well, you know,

69
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,930
I was going to say 70 but it had one
extra syllable. Nevertheless, you know,

70
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:11,060
70 86 to, you know, I think his point was,

71
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:15,400
is that his experience as a writer, which
was the context of the quote, you know,

72
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:19,520
there are many people who could write
a great book or who are talented in a

73
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:21,880
sense that when they write
they get better faster,

74
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:23,650
but they'd never finish what they begin.

75
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,580
And so what I find in my data is that
talent is no guarantee of actually showing

76
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,500
up and finishing the
things that you start.

77
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,580
And the second thing is characteristic
of high achievers. Really in any domain,

78
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,080
whether it's Google or outside,

79
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:39,550
Google is this kind of daily discipline
of trying to get better, right? You know,

80
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,390
just you know,
in sometimes you know,

81
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:44,950
microscopic infinitesimally trivial ways,

82
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,620
like all those little
details add up to excellence.

83
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,860
And it's not always the people who are
the quick studies were willing to put in

84
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:54,100
those hours and hours of behind
the scenes on glamorous work.

85
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,210
So sure Google should hire talented
people, but I, I do believe that you want,

86
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:01,180
people are going to stick with things
when they're hard and who are going to

87
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:04,510
daily submit themselves to the
Japanese principle of Kaizen,

88
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,040
continuous improvement.

89
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,780
So on that subject can
continuous improvement.

90
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:12,110
You talk in the book about practice
and the difference between,

91
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:17,111
I think he used the words
directed practice versus a
regular undirected practice

92
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,210
and it reminded me of, I think at
running there's a phrase junk miles,

93
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:21,380
which may be indicated.

94
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,770
I've never actually been a runner so
I can only hypothesize what, what,

95
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:27,230
what it means. But I guess
it means kind of a, you know,

96
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:29,600
running that doesn't really contribute
to your improve conditioning.

97
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,130
And w what is the difference between
director practice and on directed practice

98
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:36,620
in the spirit of Kaizen
and self improvement.

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,730
So let's take,
running is actually the perfect example.

100
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,540
So when I started to try to understand,
you know, the science of achievement,

101
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,020
right beyond bumper sticker
wisdom, you know, what,

102
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:50,170
what do we really know as a science
about experts and how they got that way?

103
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,980
I quickly found myself at the
doorstep of Anders Ericsson who is,

104
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,350
who's the world expert on world experts.

105
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,420
He studies what experts do that make them
different from the rest of us. Right?

106
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,260
It's a great job.

107
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,910
He goes to like the Sudoku Tournament
and he studies World Cup soccer players

108
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:07,070
and um, and, and he,

109
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,690
he refers to it actually as deliberate
practice and he would like to say that

110
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,370
deliberate practice is different from
anything else that we do in four important

111
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:18,620
ways. And I'm going to come
back to running as an example,

112
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,710
but the first thing when you're doing
truly deliberate practice is that it's

113
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,770
extremely intentional.
It's problem solving.

114
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,100
Something in particular like not like
I'm going to come in to Google and be a

115
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:31,790
better CEO w whatever it is.
I, it's, it's like, you know,

116
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,960
I'm going to say that the first 15 seconds
of my presentations are going to be a

117
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,320
little sharper. I mean it's extremely,
extremely precise. That's the first thing,

118
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,530
a very specific goal that you're
working on. And often it's a weakness,

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,860
not a strength.
Second is 100% focus.

120
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,840
Or as some coaches would say,

121
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:51,860
like Pete Carroll of the Seahawks
practicing with great effort, right?

122
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,410
A third is feedback,

123
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,200
ideally right away,

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,230
and ideally information rich and forth,

125
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,260
the kind of refinement that you reflect
on and you try the whole thing over

126
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,890
again. Right? In fact,

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,190
these four things are
incredibly straightforward
and you might wonder why only

128
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:13,100
worldclass experts do it.
But let's come back to running.

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,420
So when I heard about this research on
deliberate practice, I, I asked Anders,

130
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:17,810
you know,

131
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,810
why is it that I had gone running pretty
much every day for years and I'm not a

132
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:28,400
second faster than I ever was, right? This
isn't that evidence that you're wrong,

133
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:30,650
that it's not thousands and
thousands of hours of practice.

134
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,320
He started asking me questions like,
well, when you go out for a run, um,

135
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,970
do you have a goal like a certain time,
right? Or are you trying to run, you know,

136
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:41,750
hills and said, no, no, I'm taking
the same route, you know, every,

137
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,630
every time I go out around my neighborhood
and he said, okay, well that's great.

138
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,820
What do you do when you're, when
you're running? I was like, well,

139
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:49,730
I listened to NPR, um, and you know,

140
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:52,520
any other podcasts because I'm trying
to distract myself. And he said, well,

141
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:55,670
that's interesting because people who
are trying to improve their running or

142
00:07:55,671 --> 00:08:00,200
actually concentrating on their running
and their strides and they're breathing

143
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,890
all right? And he said, so, um,
how are you getting feedback
on your writing? I mean,

144
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:06,740
are you keeping your times? Are you
measuring your heart rate? You know,

145
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:11,480
do you have a coach who's looking
at your form? No, no and no.

146
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,190
Right?
And then he said,

147
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:16,100
are you going back every time when
you run and thinking to yourself,

148
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:19,160
what can I refine here right
before this next repetition?

149
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,060
What is there that I can do
differently? No. And he said, well,

150
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:26,720
then I can tell you why you're not getting
any better at running. And that is,

151
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,590
those thousands of hours are not
thousands of hours of deliberate practice.

152
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,960
So I think this idea that, you know,
we should be getting better at things,

153
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,490
you know, we can unpack that a little.
It's not just going out and trying hard.

154
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:40,130
It's actually trying hard in
those four very specific ways.

155
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,540
So on the subject of deliberate
practice, uh, and coaching,

156
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,420
I thought it's an interesting
question. What, what, um, you know,

157
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:49,380
in the organization,

158
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:52,830
do you have theories about what roles
managers can play in helping people

159
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,210
develop in the same way?
Is,

160
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,380
is do you have opinions on
how professional development
works in organizations

161
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,520
versus how it should work?

162
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,181
You know,

163
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:03,780
one of the things that's really important
to know about human beings is that

164
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,810
it's not that we stopped
growing up when we're 18. Right?

165
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:09,510
And if you look at the
etymology of the word parent,

166
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,190
the word parent really means to bring
forth. So after we leave our own parents,

167
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,560
right, who have tried to bring
forth our about, you know, we,

168
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:19,410
we kind of like leap
into other situations,

169
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:23,520
which frankly are our parenting
situations. I mean, I had teachers,

170
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,040
I had professors, I still do, you know,

171
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:30,330
mentors who in a very authentic
way, our, our parenting me,

172
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,240
all right, now what does it really
mean? What does it look like?

173
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,070
I think that really, really great
leaders do a couple of things right.

174
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,240
One is they model the character that
they want other people to emulate.

175
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:44,670
And there are two schools
of thought about leadership.

176
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,950
Some people say the leader
doesn't really matter, you know,

177
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:51,210
swap out one put in the next one. Really
culture is going to happen without them.

178
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,970
I'm in the other school of thought.
I think that's absolutely wrong.

179
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,500
Everybody watches the leader,

180
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,350
the leader sets the pace
for the entire organization.

181
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,810
And when the leader is nice
to other people, you know,

182
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,720
when I go and visit famous
people like you and I, you know,

183
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:07,170
I watched them and I watch how they
talk to the people who aren't famous.

184
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,630
You know, I watched them like, you know,
when they order their food, you know,

185
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:10,680
do they look the person in the eye?

186
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:14,580
And all of those little things are being
watched by all the people who work for

187
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:19,410
you. No pressure. Um, and, and, and
they're emulating you. I mean, and,

188
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,290
and especially if they respect you.

189
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,170
And that brings me to the next
thing that leaders do. I mean,

190
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:29,610
our leader is respected when they
provide both the kind of demanding

191
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,820
challenging, it's not good enough,
it's still not good enough.

192
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:35,610
I need you to do this differently.
Bring it back to me again.

193
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,660
It's that in combination
with support and uh,

194
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:43,140
and it brings me all the way back to the
parenting metaphor because that's what

195
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,830
great parents do. They're demanding,
they're challenging, it's not good enough.

196
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,210
I'm occasionally disappointing you,

197
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,900
but at the same time
genuinely care about you.

198
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,870
I want you to be successful
and I respect you.

199
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,920
So on, on the subject of mentoring
and parenting, I thought it was, uh,

200
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,220
I don't know where I
read it, but that, uh,

201
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,020
you share your peer review of
what you submit papers is share,

202
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,610
you share the negative peer reviews
and grant proposal rejections with the

203
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,720
people in your lab and your students.
Is that right?

204
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,310
And it's all true. And here's the
thing about it, right? And when,

205
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,400
when you interview someone who is, you
know, whatever, they win an award, right?

206
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:19,070
So like it was more or,

207
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,700
or you just read now you read off
someone's resume and by the way,

208
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:23,440
you only usually read the good parts,
right?

209
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:26,680
Like how about the time that you
completely screwed up and made this wrong

210
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:30,100
decision? I didn't put that on my resume
so you couldn't read it. But you know, I,

211
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,570
I think a lot of my work is
about demystifying things
like excellence, right?

212
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:38,860
You know, people who succeed
fail all the time. In fact,

213
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,540
I think they feel more than anyone else.

214
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,260
Like that's what makes him so successful
because failure provides an opportunity

215
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:47,980
for information in academia.
When you submit an article,

216
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,340
even when you're very good,
odds are it's going to get rejected.

217
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,670
And in my world comes with a 13 page
single spaced review letter about exactly

218
00:11:57,731 --> 00:12:02,500
how you suck, right? Like I can't believe
how badly written as like, oh my God,

219
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:05,630
does this person not know the Meta
analysis done in 2000 you know?

220
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,020
And I send those letters out as soon as
I get them to everybody who's working in

221
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:16,021
my lab so that they can see all the
imperfection that eventually will lead to

222
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:19,930
some kind of achievement. I want them
to know the truth as opposed to the,

223
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:20,591
you know,
Shiny,

224
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:25,090
polished myth that I think
is easy to fall into,

225
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,700
which feeds into the myth of talent,
right?

226
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,200
There's some people who were just so good,

227
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,980
they appear onstage one day never having
thought about what they might say and

228
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,480
you know, and perform King Lear flawlessly
or whatever the case may be, right?

229
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,750
Whereas in reality it was direct
and practice and failure. Right?

230
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,630
And again, that person may have
been so, so take, you know,

231
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:46,960
take your few favorite actor or actress,
you know, Duty Judi Dench. I mean,

232
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:50,140
take whoever you want to think of
as somebody who's like a paragon of,

233
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,030
of masterful performance,
right? It's not that, you know,

234
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,020
I'm saying that anybody
could have been that person.

235
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,150
I'm not saying that we all
could have been Einstein,

236
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,120
but even Einstein wasn't born
knowing anything about physics.

237
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:04,120
Even Judi Dench had to
learn how to be an actress.

238
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:09,121
I mean skills because we are human and
we are not horses or other lower order

239
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:13,030
animals who are born with a
lot of stuff hardwired, right?

240
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:16,180
Horses don't really have to learn
how to run hours after they're born.

241
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,450
They run right?
Human beings are born knowing nothing.

242
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,510
The only thing that we're
born knowing is how to learn.

243
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,290
And so skills are acquired
over a lifetime. Sure.

244
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:30,550
The talented progress faster if they
stay with things and if they continue to

245
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:31,384
work at it.

246
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,960
On the subject of learning,
um, I guess, do you think that,

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,520
I wonder,
is it,

248
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:43,500
do you think that the educational system
is set up to support and recognize

249
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:44,850
grit?
Perseverance.

250
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:49,851
It seems like the academic cycle is short
with immediate feedback and it's easy,

251
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:51,961
for example,

252
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:56,400
to move on from one subject to another
after three or six months of study if

253
00:13:56,401 --> 00:14:00,420
things don't go well.
Uh, is, is, is academic,

254
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,970
are the standards we've
set for academic success,

255
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:06,120
hurting our ability to
develop grit in people.

256
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,500
Obviously all of them could benefit.

257
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,260
Well, if you think about
younger kids, right?

258
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:13,770
The kids are still in elementary school
or middle school and high school.

259
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,300
One way in which our system I think
doesn't do a great job of encouraging grit

260
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,220
is there's a kind of a narrowing of the
focus on what it means to be successful

261
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,630
to essentially mean what are your scores
on the annual standardized tests of

262
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:29,540
math and reading.
That's incredibly narrow.

263
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,340
It not only leaves out a lot
of things that I care about.

264
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:35,940
Grit for example for something that you
find meaningful and I haven't yet met

265
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,760
the 16 year old who finds their
standardized test scores, you know,

266
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:40,560
a meaningful life goal.
Right?

267
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,310
It also leaves out the kind
of interest where a lot of us,

268
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,880
it probably in this room would say that
that's what they really did care about.

269
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:51,620
Like, you know, there are a sports team,
you know, being on the baseball, you know,

270
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:53,030
writing for the school paper,

271
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,960
you know the things that kids do outside
of the classroom that are unmeasured,

272
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,830
that policy makers, not only are they
not measuring and caring about them,

273
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:04,760
these things are getting cut. You know,
from, from schools, uh, left and right.

274
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,120
Then we talk about university
education, right? Well, you know,

275
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:10,280
you do have to have a
major in most schools.

276
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,320
So that's gritty in the sense that
grip means doing something in depth as

277
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:18,560
opposed to being scattershot.
But I'll tell you a story.

278
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:22,070
I was once on a committee to decide
who was going to be elected to Phi Beta

279
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:26,960
kappa. And as you may recall, this is,
you know, the honor society that uh,

280
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,350
there are people like me, you
know, faculty who say, okay,

281
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:34,100
well this kid's really extraordinary
as a budding academic and this kid,

282
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,340
maybe not so. So, you know, the first kid
gets on Phi Beta Kappa and the second,

283
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,320
so I remember looking at this one kid's
record and it was very clear to me that

284
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:46,970
it was grit and the passion for
this kid was biochemistry. Right.

285
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,720
You could see in his transcript that
like all of his classes were taken in

286
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:54,170
biochem. You know, at the med school.
Every summer he was doing internships.

287
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,830
Even before he was going to graduate,
he was going to be a published author,

288
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,100
which is a very hard thing to do for
any kind of scientific publication.

289
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,250
Committee gets to discussion and
people are like, Oh, you know,

290
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,830
I don't really see much humanities
here. Like, oh you know,

291
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:11,330
this isn't a very good grade, and his
his writing class, I was like, look,

292
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,670
this kid's going to win the Nobel prize.
Okay,

293
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:17,990
I exaggerate but this kid has a passion,
let's reward that.

294
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,840
And I argued hard enough that
he did get Phi Beta Kappa,

295
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,080
but I think that there is this
kind of averaging, you know,

296
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:27,200
people don't care about the average
ability that you have across all thing.

297
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,140
Most of us in life are going to become,
if we're lucky,

298
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,400
good at something and it's that one
thing that actually matters and not the

299
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,140
other things that you didn't invest in.

300
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,760
Do you have a favorite grit story?
Someone who even,

301
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,530
I mean your book is full of great stories
of people who've demonstrated so many

302
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:51,531
facets of passion and perseverance and
interest and a commitment over time.

303
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,580
Is there a favorite one?
Is there a,

304
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,930
you know, it's a great job that I have,
you know, so like Anders Ericsson,

305
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:59,760
I kind of go around
studying experts and um, uh,

306
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,250
and you see it everywhere by the way.

307
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:04,880
It's not just that you have to go to
the Olympics or to a chess tournament.

308
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,790
You know, you go into a great restaurant,
and this is a very trivial example,

309
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,040
but I think it resonates for me.

310
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,340
You went to a restaurant and you ever
have like a great waiter or waitress.

311
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,430
I mean, they're just so considerate.
And they, and I was like, you know,

312
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:17,390
that is a pro.

313
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:22,190
That is somebody who loves what they do
and who seems to be trying to get better

314
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:26,030
at it. And, and, and that is grit
just as much as a famous story.

315
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,220
I do have a story that I've recently
been rereading and that is Julia child in

316
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,050
her autobiography.
Um,

317
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,310
and you may or may not know that Julia
Child took until her late thirties to

318
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:40,640
really figure out that she wanted to
do anything at all related to food.

319
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,650
She grew up in a wealthy family that
had a cook. She said she had an,

320
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:50,651
I quote zero interest in the kitchen
when she was a young woman going to

321
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,550
college. She thought she might
want to be a writer, a novelist.

322
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,310
Then World War II happened,
so she's sort of, you know,

323
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,650
went to work mean this is
not a story of Grit so far.

324
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,560
She marries Paul Child and for his job,

325
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:05,340
not for her as they go to France
and she has a really memorable meal.

326
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,370
It was soul Moniere in a little restaurant
outside of Paris and that was the

327
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,220
beginning of a journey,
right? Not by the way,

328
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,970
an epiphany that she knew that she was
going to revolutionize the way Americans

329
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,180
cook and introduce them to French cuisine.
But you know,

330
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:23,160
one step in a journey where,
you know,

331
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:26,790
in the next meal she noticed that was
also different than anything she'd ever

332
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,830
eaten.
Then there was a bee Stroh they went to,

333
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:32,790
she started wandering around Paris and
looking at this beautiful produce and

334
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,090
this bread that she had never tasted.
You know, she got more interested.

335
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:38,610
Somebody gave her a cookbook,
a her husband,

336
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,620
I think gave her her
second French cookbook.

337
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,280
She found out that there were classes
that she could walk to and learn French

338
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:49,080
cooking. What I want to say about
these stories of grit is that one that,

339
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,280
that is accessible.

340
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:54,060
When you actually dig down into the
details of how people became great,

341
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,080
suddenly it becomes something that,
you know, you might actually aspire to.

342
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,540
And it's never really a snapshot.

343
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,290
It's always a movie and it's a long movie
and you might not want to see all of

344
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,710
the scenes that, you know, could
be edited out to make more drama.

345
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,860
But in a very real sense, I think
excellence is a long story that has, um,

346
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,560
you know, parts that are not
suspenseful, that parts are mundane.

347
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,870
Yeah. There's like practice that happens
every day, right? You do it all the time,

348
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:25,410
it gets better. Um, just so, um,

349
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,810
I guess how measurable is Great.
I mean,

350
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:31,530
you actually did a bunch of pioneering
work to measure it in west point cadets,

351
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:35,580
right? But is, I mean, what do we
think about talent in Iq and so on?

352
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:39,180
There's a a rich, if somewhat
colored history in the
measurement of intelligence,

353
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:42,390
right? Is Grit equally measurable
and you're in your opinion or

354
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,730
I think scientists have a much better
grip on how to measure intelligence than

355
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:50,150
they do to kind of measure grit or so
many other things that you could say are

356
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,690
under this broad umbrella
called character. And you know,

357
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:58,130
we've had these Iq tests really for over
a century continually being refined.

358
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,730
And in 45 minutes I can give
you your Iq score. Well,

359
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:04,430
in two minutes I can give you
your grit scale score, right?

360
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:06,230
So what's the difference?

361
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,270
The difference is that my
questionnaire is completely fake.

362
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:12,980
Double my questionnaire.
I mean really like I am a hard worker.

363
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,550
It's not, you know, it's
not hard to, you know,

364
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:20,450
think about what the answer is to that.
If you want a higher score in an Iq test,

365
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:23,240
you can't really fake. I mean, you
can't say like, oh, I'm going to guess.

366
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:26,180
See Cause I know it's the right thing,
but I don't really know, but I'm fake.

367
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,470
You know, that doesn't work. Right? Second
thing is when you're taking an Iq test,

368
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,980
there's no subjectivity. There's no
judgment, right? You take the test,

369
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,350
you get a score with the grit scale.

370
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:40,580
If I gave it to you and you said
to yourself, am I a hard worker?

371
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,240
I can only imagine the people that you
would be comparing yourself to, right?

372
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,000
When I talk about finishing whatever,
I begin on the,

373
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,760
you're going to compare yourself to your
peers who are all probably extremely

374
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:53,770
gritty.
So in addition to faking,

375
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:56,740
there's what in sciences called
the frame of reference bias.

376
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,950
And that is your standard
of comparison can vary.

377
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,510
And here's one concrete example. In high
performing charter schools like Kipp,

378
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,750
right? Eh, these are schools that
are in New York, but you know,

379
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:11,770
all over the country, kids are, are like
in, in many other schools, you know,

380
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,140
brought to a very high
standard of excellence.

381
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,290
When kids rate themselves on
items like I just read you,

382
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,640
their mental frame is different from kids
who could be just down the block at a

383
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:26,410
different school that doesn't have
those standards. So that distorts the,

384
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,100
the scores to some extent. As a
researcher, I know about that.

385
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:33,070
I know how to adjust for that when
I run statistics and so forth.

386
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,530
I also know that there's,
there's error.

387
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,480
I know that there's the
possibility of faking.

388
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,810
What I worry about is employers
or schools or you know,

389
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:46,650
government agencies who make the mistake
of thinking that you can take, uh,

390
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,960
a grit scale score and make
those high stakes decisions.

391
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:54,250
That the grit scale was never designed
for, like don't hire with the grit scale.

392
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,880
We want that to be the headline.
Didn't think it was going to be,

393
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,920
but I do wonder, uh, I mean it, it, uh,

394
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,510
it seems to me like we've perfected a lot
of ways of measuring a bunch of talent.

395
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:11,650
Just want me to tell you my best
ideas haven't been tested yet. Okay.

396
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,370
So I've one idea that has been tested
when you look at the resumes of people who

397
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:17,800
want to be Googlers,
which I can also tell you,

398
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:20,110
I think that's interesting that
you use that term Googlers.

399
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:23,290
And I think I know why you do.
But that will be for another question.

400
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,560
I would love to know why. Why would
I tell you? I'm going to tell you.

401
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:29,470
I think it's actually like, yeah, I think
it's not trivial so I'll tell you, but,

402
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,960
but when you look at the resume is
somebody who wants to get in here.

403
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,660
What I would look for is evidence of Grit.

404
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,740
I'm not saying that it has
to be an exactly this domain
or even for the job with

405
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:41,980
that. Ideally, yes, but
sometimes it can be like, wow,

406
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:46,540
this kid was on the tennis team for three
or four years in college and went from

407
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,480
a to B in their accomplishments.
Like who this kid weren't. You know,

408
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:50,470
I'll tell you about my own husband.

409
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:52,830
Like this kid worked for
Domino's pizza as a delivered,

410
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,730
but like they got promoted,
right? Like they kept,

411
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:59,440
you know that there's progression and
there's continuity in a high grit resume.

412
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,910
Conversely,

413
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,480
don't hire the people who have these sort
of like Dilla taunt resumes of sort of

414
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:06,790
like, oh, a little bit here,
a little bit there. You know,

415
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:11,530
where is the evidence of passion and
perseverance applied to something before

416
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:15,420
they got to my, to my doorstep. So
I think you can look for the res,

417
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,490
the residue of grid as it
were like in people's resumes.

418
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,910
What I don't think you should do is use
the grit scale and also I don't think

419
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:23,230
you can rely on interviews.

420
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,730
I am of the opinion that you
can interview for charisma,

421
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,100
you can interview for social intelligence,
you can interview for confidence,

422
00:23:33,101 --> 00:23:34,690
you can interview even for chemistry,

423
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:37,540
like am I going to like to sit next
to this person and work with them,

424
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:42,130
but how are you going to interview for
that quality of a person where the next

425
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,650
day they're going to get up and they're
going to be the first into the office or

426
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:45,610
the last,
you know,

427
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:48,710
you know when you give them the feedback
that says this isn't good enough,

428
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,250
is that person going to genuinely
reflect on that and try to improve?

429
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,970
That's really hard to get out of
any kind of short interaction.

430
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,180
And my best idea, which
hasn't been tested, right,

431
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,170
is if there is something that people are
going to have to do at Google and its

432
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:05,690
particular obvious to their job,
right.

433
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,000
That is really hard where you can set
up a kind of mini grid experiment right

434
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,650
where you're going to April. We are going
to let them perform right. And learn,

435
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,800
get feedback,
see whether they take that feedback,

436
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:21,910
see whether they come back for
a second, try, get more fat,

437
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,890
see whether they come back for a third
try. I think that would be fascinating.

438
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,740
Assessment as opposed to
InterMune. Exactly. But you know,

439
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:29,900
it's like you're piloting
the person, right. I mean,

440
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,190
giving them a chance to display their
grit as opposed to trying to guess at it.

441
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,700
Do you want me to tell you why I
think he used the word Google? Yeah.

442
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,540
I would love to know. Yeah. Um, so, so
my dad worked for dupont his whole life,

443
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,690
right? It was, um, you know, he
actually retired with a gold watch.

444
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,230
I thought that was just like a metaphor
or it's he got one and it said dupont

445
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,720
better things for better living on it.
Um,

446
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:55,000
spent his entire adult life there in
automotive refinishing products. Um,

447
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,720
which was his passion by the way. Um,
and you know, my dad did not talk about,

448
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:04,340
you know, working at dupont. He talked
about being a dupont or really? Yeah.

449
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,670
And um, you know, people who go to
west point graduate from West Point,

450
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,420
so they call themselves west
pointers, right? Kids who go to Kipp,

451
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,980
they're not students. They're our
kipsters. Uh, at the Seattle Seahawks.

452
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,330
You're not just a football player.
You're a Seahawk, right? These are nouns.

453
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,470
They're not adjectives.

454
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,370
And when people have a extremely
strong cultural identity,

455
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,900
they're usually able to express
that as a noun. You know,

456
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,950
I'm a Googler,

457
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,610
I'm not working for any other company
there a way that we do things here.

458
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,680
There is a language that we use here.

459
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,160
You probably don't use it where you
are because you're not a Googler.

460
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,210
So we also have an adjective googly,
oh, what does that mean? Just in the,

461
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,080
in the spirit of Google.

462
00:25:46,081 --> 00:25:48,170
And the spending eight years
trying to figure out what it means.

463
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,080
But I think you should
stick with Googler googly.

464
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Sounds like those little eyeballs that
on Brian on stage once made that comment.

465
00:25:57,851 --> 00:26:00,410
The old googly. Yeah. I
don't think that's the,

466
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,640
I let the marketing department decide,
but I mean that's what you're going for.

467
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:08,510
Yeah. So yet, sadly Google,
he is pretty baked in already.

468
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,860
But I still don't feel that does happen
with culture too. Yeah. But it probably,

469
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:15,740
you know, but it really, these words that
you, I don't know how many vocabulary,

470
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,720
cause I'm not a Googler.
Right. So I wouldn't know.

471
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,220
But at west point they have
this entire glossary, right.

472
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,000
And there are all these words that you
wouldn't know unless you go to west point.

473
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:25,060
So a plebe, right. He was like, you know,

474
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,400
you know a plebe and a firstie and a year
later and it's like what are those and

475
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,610
Woo Yah.
So at west point they exclaim Buya,

476
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,130
which doesn't have an easy translation,
but like you say it,

477
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:37,130
when somebody does something really good,
it's like we are. And then you know,

478
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:40,280
the whole, the whole crowd of
cadets that you're in will erupt.

479
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:43,650
And these words that you've
never heard in the English. And,

480
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,070
and that's very important because that's
what it means to be a west pointer.

481
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,910
You know,

482
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,710
every company has a culture and
when that culture is really strong,

483
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,560
people identify with it in and now form,

484
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,180
they speak the language,
they often wear the colors,

485
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,870
they follow the rituals. It, you know,
it becomes part of your identity.

486
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,850
And when I heard about Googlers,

487
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,320
I thought immediately of all these other
very strong cultures that are very,

488
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,140
I'm not saying intentional and that like
one person's writing the handbook, um,

489
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,260
but it really is part of the,
you know,

490
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,120
it is part of what
makes the company great.

491
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,031
No.
Is there a,

492
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:23,740
is there a connection between that
kind of cultural identity and grit or,

493
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,770
and non ICU correlates with success?

494
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,250
I absolutely think so.
So you know,

495
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,910
you can identify with an organization
or a culture that itself is gritty.

496
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:35,100
I'll give you a national example.
Right?

497
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,400
Country of Finland has actually
fewer citizens then New York City has

498
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:44,660
inhabitants. It's small, it's a cold. Uh,

499
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,390
what is there to know about, uh,
Finland that could be of interest to us.

500
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,850
There's a word and finished
called [inaudible],

501
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,250
which very roughly translates to grit,

502
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:56,250
but quite literally translates
to your insights to your guts.

503
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,570
And if you're finished,

504
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:01,560
you have the identity of someone who
when things are really hard and you've

505
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:05,880
given all you can and you
still are falling short,

506
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,040
you reached down inside and you use
your see sue and you do it anyway.

507
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,320
Now it's anatomically impossible that the
fins are walking around with this like

508
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,890
extra battery pack in them.
And, and if they did have that,

509
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:21,720
why don't like the Swedes have that right?

510
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,510
Because it's like not that far and it's,
you know, Scandinavia and then ones,

511
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,430
I think they had those little
bit of rivalry there. Yeah.
Going back. But you know,

512
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,760
I think what's important to learn
there is that you have an identity as a

513
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:35,070
Finnish person. And Finnish
people do things that are hard.

514
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:38,640
And we have see sue and
we and we, uh, we prevail.

515
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,480
And I think that when you are part of
an organization like West Point or on a

516
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,660
team like the Seahawks or the Celtics,

517
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:49,020
there are another very gritty team with
another very gritty leader or you work

518
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,250
at a company like Google.

519
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,490
That identity is very much part of why
you often struggle through when in a

520
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:59,670
different context with a different
cultural identity. You might not,

521
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,470
no,
are the,

522
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,220
I mean expanding it to national identities
and national cultures is fascinating

523
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,880
in itself. Are there, you know,

524
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,430
are there particular cultures or immigrant
groups that are grittier than others

525
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:12,264
or

526
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,430
I'm sure there are. I'm
sure there are, right?

527
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:17,640
The lots of countries and cultures in the
world and then trying to race bait you,

528
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:20,790
by the way. No. Well, I haven't
looked at the question directly,

529
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:23,190
but let me tell you why. Right?
First, let me just acknowledge,

530
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:26,550
I mean anybody who wants to say that
like all cultures are the same. That's,

531
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,880
that's naive.
I don't have any impulse to say that,

532
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,190
but it's really hard to ask the question.

533
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:35,370
You are the Americans grittier than
the French and other French, you know,

534
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,890
less gritty than the Japanese.
You know? And here's why.

535
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,810
When I give my grit scale to you,

536
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,850
you're going to answer it as
would with your comparison group.

537
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,490
When I give it in Japan, they're going to
answer it with those cultural standard,

538
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:49,800
not only of their company and their
family and their neighborhood, but,

539
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,980
but the coal country.

540
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,550
I want to tell you about a study that
was done of over 60 countries where they

541
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:56,740
asked people to fill out
personality questionnaires.

542
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,220
They didn't give the grit scale, but
they gave a scale of conscientiousness,

543
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:05,050
right? Related, it's in the family,
right? Dependability, orderliness,

544
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:06,310
I'm punctual,
et Cetera.

545
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,210
So now you have data on dozens
of countries around the world,

546
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,710
and you can ask the question,

547
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,260
which countries are the most conscientious
and which ones are the least? Well,

548
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:20,590
I'll tell you what. The findings are the
three least gritty areas in the world.

549
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:25,510
War Japan. This conscientious
says by the data, right?

550
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,050
Japan, Korea, and China, really?

551
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,950
They're messy people. They're not
dependable. They don't work hard.

552
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,920
They're really,
yeah.

553
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,960
So the researchers in that study concluded
that perhaps these data were being

554
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:47,410
influenced by the very high standard
that exists in this country.

555
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,880
That's why it's so,

556
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:53,290
so hard to make these comparisons
because two things go into your score,

557
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,170
what you really are,
and then the frame of reference,

558
00:30:56,171 --> 00:30:57,820
the standard to which
you're holding herself.

559
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,700
W we should probably try to open up
to questions in the room. And uh,

560
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,240
and on the Dory, I think it's given
time. We have about 15, 20 minutes left.

561
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,930
I'd love to that. Yeah. Uh,
we have lot of questions.

562
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,100
Can you use peer assessments,

563
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:19,240
especially cross cultural
or ethnic boundaries to then
get a more baseline grit

564
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,193
comparison?
Yeah.

565
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,010
So the problem with a peer assessments
when you're talking about the cross

566
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:26,160
cultural work in particular is
that, you know, who are your peers,

567
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:29,280
like other people who also
live in the same culture.

568
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,540
So I don't think peer ratings get you
out of that. But I do think that if you,

569
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:36,810
and you know, I know Google is always
trying to hire better, right? You know,

570
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,990
triangulation is a great strategy.
In psychology,

571
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:42,000
we call it the principle of aggregation.

572
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,660
Whenever you have imperfect data from one
source and imperfect data from another.

573
00:31:45,661 --> 00:31:48,690
So like what you do is you put more
and more imperfect data together,

574
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,880
the error cancels out,
right?

575
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:54,890
Or the unsystematic variance the are
and you get a stronger signal. So yeah,

576
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,890
get a pure rating and a teacher rating
and a performance task and look at their

577
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:01,620
resumes. You could even
throw the grit scale, Lynn,

578
00:32:01,621 --> 00:32:03,750
if you know it's only
one thing among many.

579
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,190
And when you get a consistent signal that
everybody thinks this person is gritty,

580
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,140
then you actually have a
good bet that they are.

581
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,250
Yeah. Thank you for coming. First of
all. Also, I saw you have an audio book,

582
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,450
so props to you and also guidance.
She read it herself, which I did,

583
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,250
which was really sweet. Yeah, it's fun.

584
00:32:23,251 --> 00:32:27,960
I'm going to listen to it like sped up
anyway, but I really liked chip Monck.

585
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,910
Yeah, three, three times. Okay, good.
Yeah. Uh, no, but, um, so my question is,

586
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,650
you talk about, um, this example
of the biochem kid who is really,

587
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:41,820
really, really deep into biochem. I would
call him pointy, so to speak. Like he,

588
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,220
he dug into that thing really hard and
you're talking about how you can use grit.

589
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,290
The grit property gets you
to do that, right? It's the
people who who can do that.

590
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,390
So I had a question that's
maybe it's outside of the
scope of, of, of the grit. Um,

591
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,420
but my friends and I were
actually very gritty people. We,

592
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,230
we dig into things very,
very deeply. But recently,

593
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,450
particularly after graduating college,

594
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,160
we had trouble figuring out what
to actually be gritty, like into,

595
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,000
right. Yeah. Right. In
college it's very easy.

596
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,080
Or even in school because you know, it's
kind of, the metric is there, you know,

597
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:21,740
you get good grades, maybe you pick
a major, you do well in it, fine.

598
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,130
But then in the real world,
I find that my friends in particular,

599
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:28,670
they have trouble being gritty.
Not because they can't be gritty,

600
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,850
but because they want to be pointing you,
but they don't know what to pick.

601
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,930
And then you can be really pointing
and like Russian literature and then it

602
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,720
turns out you need to
make money or something.

603
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,363
Yeah,

604
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,013
I'm just

605
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,840
punch the Russian lit.
There are any,

606
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,161
yeah.

607
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:48,610
So how do you actually go about deciding
what to be pointy and especially when

608
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:52,210
the cost of picking
incorrectly is can be high?

609
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:52,820
You know,

610
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,660
I think that one of the things that makes
it so hard is that we know the cost is

611
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,660
high, right? It can, it can make
us freeze up a little bit. Right.

612
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,460
I was at Mckinsey and you know,

613
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:03,590
there are a lot of people
at Mckinsey who like me,

614
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,610
had basically spent their entire life
opening doors of opportunity, right?

615
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,480
If I do this internship, I can do
anything. And then if I go to Mckinsey,

616
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,370
anybody will hire me. Well, you know,

617
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:16,130
you get to a certain point in life where
you realize that that's not the game

618
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:19,430
anymore. It's not opening
doors of opportunity. It's
actually walking through.

619
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,900
Right. And it's walking through and
hearing the other doors slam shut.

620
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,520
Now that's even more paralyzing in terms
of the anxiety that would produce when

621
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:31,550
you don't have this really strong
inner compass. You're like, okay,

622
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:35,270
follow my passion. Where do
I get one? Right? And, um,

623
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,950
and here's my advice about that. You know,
I do think that really, really gritty,

624
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:43,730
passionate people have two
sources of motivation and this,

625
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,180
these are two questions to ask yourself
when you're going to ask yourself what

626
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:51,200
to do with the rest of your life. One is
what are my real interests, right? And,

627
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,610
and there's still emerging, you know, they
develop over years, but for many of you,

628
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,250
there were things that you were interested
in and things that you were less

629
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:01,910
interested in that we're kind of boring
for you around the time that you were

630
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,050
hitting adolescence.

631
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,030
So many gritty people will remember that
they started liking to do something.

632
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,170
You know, at 12 or 13, there are
exceptions like Julia Child, right?

633
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,220
But interestingly, her or interest at
that early adolescent stage was writing.

634
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,340
Maybe think about Hulu, Julia Child,
really key, you know, grew up to be,

635
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:24,050
it was not just a chef, but equally if
not more so a writer, right. Of Cookbooks.

636
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,640
So, so first to kind of like think back
down memory lane to when you were a young

637
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:31,490
teenager, what are the things
that you absolutely hated doing,

638
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,970
but what are the things that you kind
of started wanting to do spontaneously?

639
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,070
That's a clue, right? That's a thread.

640
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,000
The second major motivational drive of
passion is purpose. You know, importance.

641
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,720
It really is almost moral for something.
It's like what is the,

642
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,040
what is the greater mission
that my work serves?

643
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,790
And if you think about your
values, right? It can be, you know,

644
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:56,550
I really want to help people become
their best selves or you know,

645
00:35:56,551 --> 00:36:00,600
I really care about the environment. I
mean, whatever it is that is for you,

646
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,830
a value that you think is deeply
meaningful and isn't going to change.

647
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,130
If you can follow that and figure
out where it overlaps with interests.

648
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,400
We finally mentioned not becoming
an impoverished, you know,

649
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,820
professional Russian literature
critic, right? You know,

650
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,260
I don't know how many
jobs there are like that.

651
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,530
You probably do need a third
circle, which is reality, right?

652
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:26,310
And trying to make a living, but at
least starting with the first two, right.

653
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:30,380
My interests and my purpose,
where my values, I think that's,

654
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,880
that's more helpful than just saying like,
oh,

655
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:36,900
we'll go follow your passion because most
of us don't know what that even means

656
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,670
until we actually find one.

657
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:40,830
Cool.

658
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,850
Thanks.
Thank you.

659
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,140
Uh, all right. Why don't we go?

660
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,720
Okay, great. I certainly enjoyed the
topic and the presentation. Clearly,

661
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:54,640
grit has a lot of value both
in professional life and
personal life. A different,

662
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:56,740
a podcast I'd been listening to recently.
Maybe you heard it,

663
00:36:56,741 --> 00:37:00,210
one of your runs by the, uh,
freakonomics authors. Yeah.

664
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,970
About the power of quitting and failing
fast. We might say an engineer. Yeah,

665
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,640
I was on that podcast.
Oh, I can't remember.

666
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,640
I remember maybe I don't really listen
to them afterwards, but go on. Yeah, I,

667
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,720
and I love that podcast.
It's a great one. Yeah. Yeah.

668
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,310
So it was trying to figure out how to
like combine them because isn't a personal

669
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:18,950
life on the sort of taken off that last
question because we've tried a lot of

670
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:21,620
things until you find something
you choose as a passion,

671
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,110
do you have any advice from the
corporate world of how to combine,

672
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:26,930
choosing when to fail and when
to stick it? Stick to it? You

673
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,200
know, let me use the
metaphor of dating, right?

674
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:32,860
Because I am personally really happy
that I did not end up marrying my first

675
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:36,400
boyfriend. Um, and, and so I
quit on him. Right. I mean,

676
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:39,970
every time you break up with someone,
you're quitting and, and you know,

677
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,830
is that a good thing? Is it a bad thing?
You know, I think that for me anyway,

678
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,890
you know, I was dating to
find my life partner, right?

679
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:50,170
I guess people can date for other
reasons, but that was like, oh,

680
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:52,900
we're not going to get
married over. Um, and,

681
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:57,670
and it took a few dates and guys to
kind of find the guy that I'm with.

682
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,110
This is my husband.
Uh,

683
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,110
but I think it's actually exactly what
we do in our careers too. I mean, you,

684
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,400
you're exploring,
right?

685
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,640
But there are some people
who are exploring with
intention and I was dating to

686
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:10,030
get married, right? I mean,

687
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:14,110
I wasn't really ever intending
to like stay dating forever.

688
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,380
I think that makes all the
difference. So shore quit. But for me,

689
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:22,381
quitting the White House speech writing
Gig and Mckinsey and being a teacher,

690
00:38:22,991 --> 00:38:27,550
it was, it was sort of a groping towards
something that I wanted to stick with.

691
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:27,851
You know,

692
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:30,910
I was only quitting those things so
that I could find something that I would

693
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:35,470
never want to quit. And when
I was 32, finally, after much,

694
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,970
you know, exploration, I figured that
out and it was to have the career I have,

695
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,600
but it's, it's not, uh,
you know, predictable,

696
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:48,340
efficient process. Uh, so quitting
in the service of not quitting is,

697
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,750
I guess my,
my answer.

698
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,710
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

699
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,050
Thanks Angela. So much for
coming. It's great. Um,

700
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,950
there's something about grit that seems
very intrinsic or natural, almost.

701
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:05,850
Unlearnable do you have
any recommendations for how
people can increase their

702
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:06,684
greediness?

703
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,990
So I want everybody in this room to watch
their own language in the next day or

704
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:14,980
so for the word just, you
know, um, whenever we say, Ooh,

705
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,360
they just have it. Oh, they just are,
you know, a natural or, you know,

706
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:23,410
he's just extroverted, you know, like
how does he do that? He's just, you know,

707
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:24,640
kind of a math guy.
You know,

708
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,540
we use that language I think when we
can't explain something, right? I mean,

709
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:31,540
that's when we use the word just actually
when Nancy Reagan said, you know,

710
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,930
just don't do it. Or you know,
when Nike says just do it,

711
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:37,150
I always find that like deeply unhelpful.
Like,

712
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:42,010
could you please tell me how or are you
just going to, you know, like, so, um, so,

713
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,880
so this,

714
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,200
this idea that when we see
someone do something fluently,

715
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,130
particularly when we can't do it, I
mean, somebody who dances really well,

716
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,120
we can't dance or plays
music, really willing it, we
start to use words like just,

717
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:59,050
and we say things like, there are
natural. And I was actually giving a talk,

718
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:02,320
what was the pre book tour, right?
Today's the first day of book tour.

719
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:06,250
But you know, I gave a talk and I give
talks all the time. Sure you do too.

720
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:08,560
And you know, you get
practice, you get feedback,

721
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,350
you make these little refinements,
tiny little ones.

722
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:14,650
Like oof that fourth slide I totally
had to change the background color.

723
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:16,120
I mean it's really that trivial.

724
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,710
I get off the stage and I'm talking to
the person who's handling it and she's

725
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,380
like,
you are just a natural.

726
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,300
And I thought about the irony that I
just wrote a book about, you know, uh,

727
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,730
I can say I recently wrote a
book instead of, I just wrote it,

728
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,200
I recently wrote a book about, about
the fact that that is a, is a, you know,

729
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,990
such an attractive myth
as like a seductive myth.

730
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:43,000
And I think the answer is this, you
know, we can say that people, you know,

731
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:46,360
Jerry Seinfeld would say that some
people are born to be comedians and some

732
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,230
people are not born.

733
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,730
I think there is a sense in which people
are born with different inclinations

734
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:55,840
thinks that they find fun to do
things that hold their interest.

735
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,520
But if you ask the question of how they
eventually became Jerry Seinfeld, right.

736
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,210
If they eventually wrote a book that's
halfway decent or they gave a talk that's

737
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,230
reasonably fluent,

738
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:10,590
it's not just anything except if you want
to say it is just hours and hours and

739
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:16,290
hours of iteration with feedback to get
better at something which may be I did

740
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:18,490
just like,
you know when I was a little kid.

741
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,883
Yeah.

742
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,180
My question is how do you, what
conditions do you, for a child,

743
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,280
not you were talking about kids do you
set in order to or no breed greediness.

744
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:38,870
So to give an example,
I don't have kids. Yeah.

745
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,560
Thinking about him though. Okay,
good. So I'm a, I recommend them.

746
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:44,360
I'm a Colombian immigrant
to the United States.

747
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:45,710
I came here when I was five years old,

748
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,850
eventually graduated west point low
income household in New York City,

749
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:54,710
four of us living in one bedroom,
mom, dad, sister, et cetera. So,

750
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,210
I dunno what can,

751
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,270
I still don't know what conditions were
set for me to persevere because I could

752
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:04,040
have been easily in that demographic
of Hispanics that ended up in jail or

753
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:07,850
whatever it is. Yeah. Especially
in the city. So what conditions,

754
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:12,290
what makes me different or people liking
me different than my peers that I went

755
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,030
to high school with that perhaps did not.

756
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,190
Do you have any hypotheses?
You have? Any guesses?

757
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,010
I mean,
I think parents,

758
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:22,610
parenting definitely had a lot to do
with it as an example of the hardworking

759
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,020
immigrant parents, et cetera. Um,
but then outside of that, you know,

760
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:30,170
in the classroom it
may have been teachers,

761
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,970
but at the end of the day I still have
to do the work and I just, I don't know.

762
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,280
And you probably see people who grew up
in maybe not identical but such similar

763
00:42:39,281 --> 00:42:44,281
circumstances and they didn't end up
anywhere close to to where you are.

764
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:48,130
You know, that is itself, I think
you know, my life's work, right,

765
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:52,390
is to answer your question and, and I,
and I only have an incomplete answer,

766
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:56,830
but I will say this, first of all, you
did inherit Dna from your mom and dad.

767
00:42:56,831 --> 00:43:00,010
And so when you see gritty little kids
who have gritty parents, you know,

768
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:04,360
you have to at least pause and
acknowledge the fact that you know,

769
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:07,390
half of their deans came from mom and
half came from dad. They got shuffled up.

770
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:11,590
And in part we are like our parents
because of our shared genetic heritage.

771
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,240
At the same time,

772
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:17,350
it's absolutely unequivocal that
parents model certain behaviors.

773
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:21,040
It's usually the case, not
always, there are exceptions,

774
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:25,120
but it's usually the case that kids are
modeling the work ethic and the passion

775
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,120
of their parents. Uh, if
it's not their parents,

776
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:29,860
often there was another strong role model,

777
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:33,130
like a particular teacher who had a
big effect or a coach and so forth.

778
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,440
So that's maybe part of the equation.

779
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,950
I also think that a lot of grit comes
down to kind of these virtuous cycles.

780
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:45,220
You know, you start to find that you
have, uh, a thing for a certain sport,

781
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:48,610
that that becomes a source
of pride and success.

782
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,290
People begin encouraging you.

783
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,100
It's an upward feedback
cycle of motivation,

784
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,860
effort and achievement.
And it feeds itself.

785
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,580
I think there are people who then are on
the opposite spiral, which is, you know,

786
00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:03,250
they get a little down at the about
themselves. They stopped trying,

787
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:06,310
they proved themselves right because
things don't go well and they kind of

788
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,780
spiral on the opposite direction.

789
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,260
And Einstein is quoted and I
am not sure I can verify this,

790
00:44:11,261 --> 00:44:14,950
but somebody at Google can as saying
that compound interest is what we all

791
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:17,620
really need to understand.
That is the mystery of the universe.

792
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,580
And I think this compounding of,
you know, a little bit of Grit,

793
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:25,540
a little bit of effort, you know, a
little bit of success, little more grit,

794
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,530
you know, a little more effort,
a little more six. Like,

795
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,370
if we could understand that compounding,
then maybe we could, why, you know,

796
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:33,960
kids like you ended up where you are.

797
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:37,230
But we could also maybe understand
why so many other do, you know, don't

798
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:39,420
Nice.

799
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,180
And I would like Google to help me figure
that out by the way. So it would be,

800
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,910
yeah. Volunteer. Great. Thank you.

801
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,690
I think we only have to want
right, if I'm, whereas in his,

802
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:52,430
his annual expected to sign books at the
end to know at the end. Okay. All right.

803
00:44:52,431 --> 00:44:55,180
So we have five more minutes.
Should we do a question on the

804
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,070
dory? This is somewhat confrontational.
I don't mean to, oh, that's okay.

805
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:00,480
It's all good. Yeah, yeah. No,
it's good. Wait, I'll read it.

806
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,320
I'll read it to the hard one. Yeah. Yeah.

807
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,380
There was a study of 4,000 UK students
published back in February in the journal

808
00:45:06,381 --> 00:45:09,890
of personality and social psychology
in which grit was not shown to be that

809
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:10,530
predictive of

810
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,120
academic success.

811
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:17,320
Instead, intelligence and
conscientiousness were key. Do you,

812
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,220
do you have any thoughts on that study?
Yes, I do have thoughts on that study. Um,

813
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:27,450
actually one of the coauthors of that
study sent me the report before it was

814
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:31,110
published and here's what I said to him.
So I'll tell you the full study.

815
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:34,950
So there are thousands of,
of British kids,

816
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,240
about 16 years old, I think, uh,

817
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:41,730
who were going through the British school
system and their grit scores on these

818
00:45:41,731 --> 00:45:42,810
kids.
And they're also,

819
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:46,740
they're standardized math and
reading scores on the UK test. Right.

820
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,120
It's a something like that. And I guess,
right, yeah. Not British enough to know.

821
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:51,391
Right.

822
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:54,090
But it's a standardized achievement
test and we've all taken them so we know

823
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:54,924
what they are.

824
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,370
The finding is this grid does predict
their standardized test scores,

825
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,790
but not quite as well as a
measure of conscientiousness,

826
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:05,370
which we were already talking
about, you know, dependability,

827
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:09,090
being able to control your impulses,
that sort of thing. So yes,

828
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,820
it predicted but maybe
not quite as, uh, as much.

829
00:46:11,821 --> 00:46:15,000
And also intelligence was a
better predictor in that study.

830
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,100
I don't find that all that
surprising. I also don't, I mean,

831
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:22,460
I don't question those findings
for one moment. I think there,

832
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,960
there are very real,
for me,

833
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,500
my complaint is that if you were going
to equate your standardized test scores

834
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:31,920
when you were 16 and things that
frankly most 16 year olds are not,

835
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,880
are not invested in, right. It's
not a meaningful personal goal.

836
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,490
If you're going to equate that
with success or even, you know,

837
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:40,950
with academic achievement
grades for example,

838
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:44,130
do not send all the same
signal as your test scores.

839
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,710
Grades are a better predictor
of college persistence.

840
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:49,440
Then your standardized test scores,
so not interchangeable.

841
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:51,810
There's information that's
carried by, you know, grades.

842
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:53,280
It's not carried by test scores.

843
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,150
There's information carried by your
extracurricular activities that's not

844
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:01,050
embedded in your test scores. My
complaint is not with the finding itself,

845
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:01,860
but the,

846
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,850
the idea that that is everything that
we would need to know about success for

847
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:10,380
those kids. So I guess that's the major
thing that I'll say about that study.

848
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:13,950
And I think that it's very important
to recognize the grid isn't the only

849
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,300
important thing in the world.

850
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,600
I studied high achievement
in challenging circumstances.

851
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,770
It's in those circumstances where
the goal also matters to you.

852
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:25,380
That I think re emerges as a,
you know,

853
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:28,530
the most reliable predictor and not
just a moderately predictive one.

854
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,760
Should we go back to, Oh yeah.
Question. Yeah, I got a live question.

855
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,450
But if you're applying your
amazing good to the wrong thing.

856
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,630
Let's say I wanted to be a film star
that I have no grasp of what the world

857
00:47:42,631 --> 00:47:44,130
actually wants from a film star.

858
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,970
When should I just say I should probably
stop trying to do that and apply my

859
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,910
grit to something else. Right? It
might actually be more successful.

860
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,280
Yeah.
So for example,

861
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:55,700
what if you're trying to be a film star
and you're just disastrously untalented,

862
00:47:55,701 --> 00:47:58,730
right? There's like nothing that you
could do that you would ever beat, right?

863
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,680
So that's one way that you could be wrong.

864
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:03,980
The other thing that you could be wrong
is that you're picking an industry that

865
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,130
is going to melt, like, you know,
like the polar ice caps, right?

866
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:09,890
Like the whole industry is
going to go away. And you know,

867
00:48:09,891 --> 00:48:13,580
that happens these days, right? In,
in ways that are faster than before.

868
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,790
So there's lots of ways that grit
can get you into trouble, right?

869
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:20,690
I think the question is this, you
know, you got to take risks in life.

870
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,350
There's no getting away really for, even
if you do nothing, you're taking a risk.

871
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,520
What grit means is to put your left foot
in front of your right foot and then

872
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:31,340
your left foot again and keep
heading in a certain direction.

873
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:34,640
And you're absolutely right that you might
end up somewhere that you didn't want

874
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:35,474
to be,

875
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:39,920
but you can guarantee yourself that
you'll never get anywhere by switching

876
00:48:39,921 --> 00:48:44,600
direction every few paces or not
walking forward at all. So yeah,

877
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:47,030
there's absolutely risk and
being a paragon of grit,

878
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,540
but I'd say there's a guarantee of
failure and not being passionate and

879
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:51,374
persevering.

880
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,040
So a related question to the one

881
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:57,880
he just asked is, is, is grit
in a continuum with obsession?

882
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,140
Is there a bright line between grit
and obsession or are they unrelated?

883
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,910
No, I think there is actually a strong
family resemblance between grit and

884
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:08,700
obsession. You know, one of the
individuals that I interviewed,

885
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:10,350
but I didn't put her into the book,

886
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,370
partly because I forgot to push record
when I was interviewing her was temple

887
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:16,230
Grandin and I don't know
if you know her work,

888
00:49:16,231 --> 00:49:18,480
but she is Lino famously autistic and she,

889
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,480
she writes about her
autism and in her words,

890
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:25,560
a little bit of obsession gets a hell
of a lot of work done. Um, and you know,

891
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:28,200
this idea that you wake
up, I mean, I'm obsessive.

892
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:31,590
If you woke me up at three in the morning,
which sometimes just happens to me,

893
00:49:31,591 --> 00:49:34,210
you know, like you wake up and you
have to go to the bathroom and yeah.

894
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,660
You know what I'm thinking about?
I'm thinking about grit.

895
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,970
I'm thinking about like, why did
that person do that? You know,

896
00:49:38,971 --> 00:49:42,450
it's so interesting. Like where did they
get them? I think about it all the time.

897
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:43,560
I think about it in the shower.

898
00:49:43,561 --> 00:49:46,650
I think about it in Yoga when I'm supposed
to not be thinking about anything,

899
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:49,500
but I'm thinking about grit,
right? Like Shavasana pose,

900
00:49:49,501 --> 00:49:52,710
you're supposed to be doing nothing. And
I'm like, I wonder where that, you know,

901
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:54,990
is gonna you know, it's,
it is an obsession.

902
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,920
The difference maybe between the way most
people think about obsessions and the

903
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:02,460
way gritty people think about the
sessions is, you know, when they say,

904
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:06,240
I love what I do, they love
that. They love what they do.

905
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,590
There's no sense in which they would
trade that life for, for any other,

906
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,090
and that's how I feel about my own work.

907
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,223
No,

908
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,320
I think we have time for one more
question. Should we? Yup. Hi.

909
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,950
So a lot of your examples of people that
have shown great grid, like Julia Child,

910
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:27,980
she starts at 30 and then becomes
this great. They also need

911
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,070
to be underdogs that then succeed.
Do they have to be,

912
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,150
you know,
you don't have to be an underdog,

913
00:50:33,151 --> 00:50:36,900
but I am fascinated by underdog
psychology because, and I'll, I'll,

914
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:39,540
I'll say these words to you and
I wonder if they'll resonate.

915
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,060
There is characteristic of many,

916
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:47,061
many grit paragons that I've studied
a sort of all show you rebel,

917
00:50:47,401 --> 00:50:47,880
you know,

918
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,410
like you know why I don't think you
really cut out to be a programmer or you

919
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:54,450
know, just this like, you know, fear.
It's an aggression almost. Yeah.

920
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,570
And I felt that when I was,
you know,

921
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:00,900
failing my neuro biology class my
freshman year of college and my very well

922
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:03,990
meaning teaching assistant,
my ta said, you know,

923
00:51:03,991 --> 00:51:07,710
you really should withdraw from this
course because you're going to get an f on

924
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:12,000
your transcript and you don't know this
yet because you're 18 that's not a good

925
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:15,900
thing to have. Right. And
I felt a kind of, you know,

926
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,070
like a hot anger.

927
00:51:17,071 --> 00:51:21,900
I mean I marched out of that office to
the registrar's office and I not only

928
00:51:21,901 --> 00:51:22,950
didn't drop the course,

929
00:51:22,951 --> 00:51:26,970
I declared my major in
neurobiology that very day.

930
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,800
What the hell is that? You know, the,

931
00:51:28,801 --> 00:51:32,610
I will show you response I think is
fascinating. I don't fully understand it,

932
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,320
but it's fascinating that,
you know,

933
00:51:34,321 --> 00:51:38,790
the same exact experience can either
lead people to feel like I'm a loser.

934
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:42,750
I give up or the precisely
opposite psychological reaction,

935
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,780
and I think it's not need necessarily,
but it's very,

936
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:47,610
very common to paragons of grit.

937
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:50,980
Okay.

938
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,370
I think we're out of time. Hey, Angela,
thank you so much. That was good.

939
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,480
Fascinating.
Thank you.
