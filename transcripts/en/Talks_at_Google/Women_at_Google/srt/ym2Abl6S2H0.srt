1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,880
Well, come to talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Today.

2
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,720
It's my enormous pleasure to
welcome I William Pollack,

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,000
author of the recently published book,
the only woman in the room,

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,670
why science is still a boy's club.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,120
Mrs Pollock is professor of creative
writing at the University of Michigan.

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,310
She is a published author of novels,
nonfiction and textbooks,

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,130
but she was not always as
we see her now at one time,

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,050
she overcame many obstacles,
most of them external.

9
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:49,590
A few, uh, if I read the book correctly,

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,800
internal probably to become one of the
first two women at Yale University to

11
00:00:57,151 --> 00:01:00,210
earn a Bachelor of
Science degree in physics.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,520
She graduated summa cum laude with
honors and yet chose at that time not to

13
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,820
pursue a career in physics,
which you had dreamed of her entire life,

14
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,550
but rather to pursue a career in writing.

15
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,980
Part of this book is a memoir that
explains how she got to that point.

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,510
What she did after that,

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,500
it picks up again as a research
study sparked by Larry Summers.

18
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,070
Infamous comment or
famous comment and 2005 g,

19
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,620
why aren't there more women
teaching and the hard sciences?

20
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:40,030
Could this be because et cetera.
Uh,

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,380
so she took it on herself to interview
former fellow students and teachers and

22
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:51,591
women who had since made careers in
stem subjects to find out the answer.

23
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,630
I won't spoil it here. Um, there
may not be a happy ending yet,

24
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,120
but perhaps it's something
we can work toward.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,120
Please join me in
welcoming Eileen Pollock.

26
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,560
Hi everybody. Can you all hear
me back? Roads and everything?

27
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,910
Thanks for coming out. I can only
imagine how busy you all are. And, uh,

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,790
it's really,
uh,

29
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,860
an honor and it's exciting for
me to be in a Google space.

30
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,690
I've, you know, we all the outsiders here,

31
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,380
how mystical it is for you guys.
And it turns out it's true.

32
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:36,360
I've just never worked in such a place.
Um,

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,940
but I have a lot of attachments to
Kendall Square. So back in the 80s,

34
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:45,941
my ex husband was doing his mdphd at
Harvard and MIT and his lab was right on

35
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:50,360
the other side of Ames street. But of
course, none of this looked like this.

36
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:55,361
It was just this huge wasteland because
they were supposed to build the Kennedy

37
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:55,881
Space Center here.

38
00:02:55,881 --> 00:03:00,100
So they destroyed all the buildings
and then Kennedy was assassinated.

39
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,430
So it became the Johnson
Space Center in Houston.

40
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,940
And for all those many years,
there was just this big,

41
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:09,600
vast nothing here.
I'm,

42
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,900
the only place to eat was there was the
old bnb deli. It's not, it's still here.

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,400
Anyway. Um, so it's, it's
interesting for me to be back and I,

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,550
my first job was at MIT.
I,

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,800
I worked for the head of the
civil engineering department, um,

46
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,210
that he would get assigned from the UN
to write books about how to build low

47
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,260
cost housing in third world
in developing countries.

48
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,300
And I researched and wrote them for him.

49
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,680
And considering I had never even built
a birdhouse and had never been to a

50
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,910
developing country.

51
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,260
I have always hoped that really nobody
ever use those books at the UN for

52
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:45,094
anything.

53
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,900
So what I thought I would do was talk
a little bit more about the book, um,

54
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,320
because my publisher
would want me to do that.

55
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:57,190
And I do hope you'll be to get a copy
and I would love to sign them for you

56
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,000
afterward.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,900
And then what I'm actually gonna read
to you from though is a more recent

58
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,630
article that's more directly, um,
focused on, on tech and how, um,

59
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,670
some of the issues affect
a place like maybe Google.

60
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,720
Um, so yeah, so the book is divided into
a bunch of parts and it starts with,

61
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,760
with sort of an investigative memoir.
Um,

62
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,940
when Larry Summers made his
remarks, uh, you know, I got upset,

63
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:29,530
but I had actually known Larry for years.
We went way back.

64
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:34,000
I was a debater in high school.
I was just nerdy in every way.

65
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:38,740
You could be nerdy. And Larry was older
as he, he judged our team and then I,

66
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,910
you know, kept track of him later
and, and, and knew him. But, um,

67
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,200
so I got all upset that he would have
thought that there was even a possibility

68
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:51,010
that one reason there weren't more
women physics professors at Harvard was

69
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:55,660
because of any kind of innate aptitude
problems or that women didn't want to

70
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:57,520
work hard as hard as men.

71
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,960
The other reasons he gave seem to be
more on target that they were cultural

72
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:04,240
reasons is and bias and things like that.

73
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,420
So I actually sat down to write him an
email to explain why I had really not

74
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:14,050
gone on in physics, even though I so
passionately wanted to in the email,

75
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:18,280
just went on and on and I ended up with
this like 20 page email and instead of

76
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:20,710
sending it to him,
then I decided to write a book.

77
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,000
And then I sent the book to him after
it was done and he was good enough to,

78
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:27,160
there's a blurb on the
back and he said, oh, now,

79
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,910
now I see the light and I understand
what I didn't understand before.

80
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,710
So that made me feel good.
Um,

81
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,490
but I realized that I didn't even
really understand why I hadn't gone on.

82
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:39,440
It was so painful for
me to have walked away,

83
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,790
to have worked so incredibly hard
to get that physics degree and do,

84
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,390
do this research and stuff that I,
when I walked away from it,

85
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,870
I really didn't want to ever think about
the part of my life that had wanted to

86
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,640
be a physicist.
Um,

87
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,410
and so then I had to go back and
really revisit everything and you know,

88
00:05:56,411 --> 00:06:00,320
part of it was, um, as Jonathan
said, sort of these external factors.

89
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:04,550
So I went to a not very good rural
high school and I actually wasn't,

90
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,140
we didn't have any AP courses,

91
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:10,850
but there was a sort of accelerated track
that a couple of boys got to take in

92
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,930
science and math. And I wasn't allowed
to do it because as the principal said,

93
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,750
girls don't go on in
science and math anyway.

94
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:21,200
So you would just be wasting a seed and
besides it would ruin your social life.

95
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,370
I didn't have a social life because
if you're a girl at that age and your

96
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:29,600
interest really good at science and
math, that does help anyway. But, um,

97
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:33,680
so I got very bored and angry and I stayed
home and taught myself what I thought

98
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:36,080
were,
I was really reading about physics,

99
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:40,010
but I thought I was actually studying
physics and I taught myself calculus.

100
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,370
But when I got to Yale, I was just
blown out of the water, right?

101
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,560
Because first of all,
there were 118 guys and two women.

102
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,920
Um, and they, almost all of them had, had,

103
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:55,700
had gone to really good schools and
had two years of high school physics,

104
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:59,900
two years of advanced calculus. And I
had taught myself this stuff from books.

105
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,960
So I flunked my first midterm
and I was going to drop,

106
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:07,250
which is what happens to many young
women in minorities. You get there,

107
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:11,390
realize that you have had a terrible
background, you flunk your first test.

108
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,920
And of course those courses, or
even cold weed out courses, right?

109
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:19,970
So there's this ethos that if you get
there and you're not already like top of

110
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:23,300
the pack, you couldn't possibly
be good, are worth saving.

111
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:26,840
And so let's weed you out.
Luckily I had, you know,

112
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,830
the book is not a story
about villains. Um, uh,

113
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,250
I know that the 70s sound
like a really long time ago.

114
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,540
You're mostly really young,

115
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:40,541
but it was actually didn't feel much
different from now in terms of sort of

116
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,460
feminism and sexism. And we, we already,

117
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,140
we felt even then that all the
battles have been fought and, um,

118
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,640
that women could do anything. And I didn't
feel like a pioneer. And I had really,

119
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:56,720
really nice. I had all male professors,
there were no women professors,

120
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:01,560
but I had really, really nice guys
teaching me math and physics. Um,

121
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,510
but, and so when I was
going to drop, actually my,

122
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,800
it was very unusual,

123
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:10,460
but my freshman year of physics professor
wouldn't let me drop the course.

124
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,880
And he gave me very good advice and I
stuck it out and I worked incredibly hard.

125
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,800
Um, and as often happens, if you come from
behind, you overshoot the mark. Right?

126
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,090
And by the time I was a senior,

127
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,810
I was top of my class and I had
done all this research. And, um,

128
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,050
and so the fact that I didn't go
and I had almost perfect grades,

129
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,340
but I didn't think that I was good
enough because no one said you're good at

130
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:38,750
this, right? No one said, are you
going to Grad School? You know,

131
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,800
and I thought if I were good,
someone would have said go on.

132
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:46,190
Which is a big difference between
most young women in most guys,

133
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:50,450
that guys are raised more to,
you know, make their own value.

134
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,720
Like not look to other people to pat you
on the bed, you know, head and say, yes,

135
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:58,510
you're, you're pretty your queue,
you can do it, whatever. Um, and,

136
00:08:58,511 --> 00:09:02,220
and to women more need this
encouragement from the outside to go on.

137
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,270
I didn't have confidence because I had
come from behind and I still thought of

138
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:10,530
myself as behind.
If you're the only woman in the room,

139
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:14,910
the only black person in the room, the
only whatever in the room, there's this,

140
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,530
it's called a stereotype effect.

141
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,860
But this self consciousness where
everything you do you feel like you're

142
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:23,400
representing your whole
gender or your whole race, um,

143
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,640
you feel self conscious every time.
I would cross my legs in class,

144
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:30,210
even though I was wearing jeans.
So like the professor would stop talking.

145
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,160
You know what?
It was so distracting.

146
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,840
So there were just so many distractions
and I was so isolated. Really.

147
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,260
None of the,

148
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,520
all the guys did their problem sets
together and I was off just working all by

149
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,060
myself. Nobody ever even
talked to me in classes. Um,

150
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,920
and so those were the factors that
I started to realize had really been

151
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,380
debilitating. Um, and the reasons,

152
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,190
the main reasons that I didn't go on.
Um,

153
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,530
so when I, the second
part of the book was, um,

154
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,620
I wanted to see whether my
experience had been unique,

155
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,840
whether anybody had ever
felt anything similar. Um,

156
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,730
and I was really interested in how
it compared to young women today.

157
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,920
I assumed that, um, that
things really must've changed.

158
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,310
And so I was shocked, uh, when I,

159
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:24,060
so I went back to Yale to talk
to the young women there. Um,

160
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,520
I followed up with people
I had been in school with,

161
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,150
but I was really interested in,

162
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:31,350
in young women today and young women at
University of Michigan where I teach so

163
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:34,860
I could compare a public
school to, you know, an ivy.

164
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,350
And I was really shocked. Um, there were
a few more young women in the classes,

165
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,460
but most of them seem to be
saying that inside itself,

166
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,810
the same as I had felt right,
that they weren't getting encouragement,

167
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,580
they didn't have the confidence,
they felt isolated,

168
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:57,690
but also, and what I think this is,
it was very hard for me to admit it.

169
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,240
And then I think for them
to admit it to me too,

170
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,320
they felt that these beautiful,
smart,

171
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,690
charming young women at
Yale or saying to me,

172
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:10,890
nobody wants to date us because they,
when we say we're a physics major,

173
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:15,270
that's the end. Um, is anybody going
to marry me? You know? And I was like,

174
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,450
can I really be hearing this
at Yale in, in, you know,

175
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:20,880
2012 it just couldn't be.

176
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,570
And then they started telling
me stories of the teasing.

177
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:29,280
They had been getting like in junior
high and high school, um, you know, oh,

178
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:33,210
I'm going to grade you on the girl curve
and your physics class and the boys

179
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:36,480
will be graded on the boy curve.
I mean, this me from my childhood,

180
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:39,990
this is like from people
your age, um, or uh,

181
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,780
one friend's daughter
was told by her teacher,

182
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,880
you're too pretty to be good at
math. Um, and very recently I heard,

183
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,810
so I heard from one young woman who,
um,

184
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,070
uh, walked into, she wanted
to be in the robotics club.

185
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:00,630
She walked in and it was all guys, she
turned around and walked out. But um,

186
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,360
three young women who are on a robotics
club in high school and they were

187
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:05,800
preparing for a competition.

188
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:09,700
The club was going to host a competition
and the advisor for the robotics club

189
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:13,660
said to the three young women, you can
be in charge of RefreshMints right.

190
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,920
Show they, they just dropped the
club. They never told him like,

191
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:22,750
you shouldn't say that. Um, so this
stuff was still going on and that, um,

192
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,330
that really shocked me.
Um,

193
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,400
so I think what's different is there a
few more women, they last a bit longer.

194
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,110
Um,
there,

195
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,370
there are a few more organizations
for support groups and things, but,

196
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,200
um, I was really surprised
how little had had changed.

197
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,960
Um, for the third part of the book, um,

198
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,230
I did look at the studies that had been
done on gender bias in the science and

199
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,890
more and more of those studies are
being done now partly because of Larry

200
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,970
Summers remarks.
So again,

201
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:59,971
I think he inadvertently
did a real service because
a lot of people got mad and

202
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:05,110
said, all right, he wants us to give him
the reasons for this, let's figure it out.

203
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,490
And um,
and some of those studies are being,

204
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,680
are very recent and are
really very powerful.

205
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:16,000
So the one I quoted in the excerpt that
appeared in the Times magazine two years

206
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:20,740
ago, it's in the book by Joe Handlesman
at Yale, which really shocked me.

207
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:23,110
So it's about implicit bias.
Um,

208
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,010
she ran the study at mostly
research institutions,

209
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:30,910
but one of the categories was engineering.
So it was engineering, physics,

210
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,280
chemistry,
I think math was the other one.

211
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,530
And what they did was just mock up,
um,

212
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,850
job applications for an
entry level position.

213
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:43,540
So it's sorta for someone who's between
Undergrad and thinking of it one day

214
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:48,010
going on for a phd and in the meantime,
once like a lab manager job.

215
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,000
And so they're exactly
the same job application,

216
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,140
the same cover letter
references, you know, grades,

217
00:13:56,141 --> 00:14:00,490
everything's the same. And uh,
but once it's John on it at once,

218
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:05,170
it's Jennifer. That's the only
difference. And if you see the bar graph,

219
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,040
um, for the statistical
difference, it's so significant.

220
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,680
It's not like some little
sliver. It's huge, right?

221
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,840
That John was judged more hireable,
more competent,

222
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,300
and more worthy of being mentored.

223
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,750
Then Jennifer by huge margin and
if Jennifer was going to be hired,

224
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,260
her salary was a good four
to $5,000 lower than John's.

225
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,370
And we're talking really small salary.
So I mean, John would get like 30,

226
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,690
32 and she was going to get 28 or
it's 26 and 30, something like that.

227
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,970
So that's huge. Right? And what
really shocked me was that the,

228
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,050
the degree of bias did not
vary according to gender.

229
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,010
All right. So women who were
going to hire a lab manager, John,

230
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:56,840
just as much as guys who were going to
hire a lab manager and it didn't vary by

231
00:14:56,841 --> 00:15:00,740
age, right? So if you were an
assistant professor or full professor,

232
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,140
you were 30 or you were 65,

233
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,870
you were just as biased against Jennifer,

234
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,500
except the Jennifer was much more
likely to be judged. Likable.

235
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,520
Like who did you think was more
likable? Jennifer. All right.

236
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,310
So what you could see how insidious
some of these things are cause shit.

237
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,380
People are Jennifer.
And you went in for the job interview.

238
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:21,680
You didn't come out thinking, Huh,
they really liked me. I got the job.

239
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:26,090
And you wouldn't even get why you didn't
get it because the people hiring you

240
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,720
wouldn't get why you didn't get it.
Okay.

241
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,240
So that I thought was shocking.
Um,

242
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,630
one study that's not in the book that
I'll share with you, that also shocked me.

243
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:39,230
So this one just came out literally
last week and it was done by actually a

244
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:43,820
friend of mine from the old days.
Um, Bob Saggy, who's in Boston.

245
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:46,670
They came out in the Journal of
American Medical Association.

246
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:50,870
So you tend to think too
that these problems aren't
as bad say in biology cause

247
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:55,340
those are now women's fields and
people fields or whatever. Um,

248
00:15:55,341 --> 00:16:00,341
so this was in biomedical science and
the study measured startup grants for

249
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,610
first time hires. So if you, in
academia, you get your first layup,

250
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,510
you need money to set it up because you
haven't been able to get grants yet.

251
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:09,080
Right?

252
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,340
So the money comes from the institution
that hires you show the average for

253
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:17,720
women starting their lab,
their support money was $350,000,

254
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,280
which sounds like a lot,
right?

255
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,950
She could imagine a young
woman getting hired going, wow,

256
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:26,210
they hired me and they gave me
$350,000. Yes, thank you so much.

257
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:29,450
When do I start?
What was the average for guys?

258
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,140
Okay,

259
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,180
$890,000

260
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,130
as a half a million dollars
difference to start up your first lab.

261
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:42,090
Now imagine how that accumulates
in terms of your whole, right.

262
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,630
And nobody knows, right? The guys don't
know that the women are being screwed.

263
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:49,650
The women don't know, the guys are
getting 800. It clearly has to do with,

264
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,230
they don't know the reasons
cause this is a new study,

265
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:56,130
but you can imagine it might be
the people offering the money.

266
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:59,670
Don't even realize they're offering
more to the guy because he's a guy.

267
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,030
But then the guy knows to
bargain, to negotiate. Right.

268
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:06,000
Well I want even more than that. Whereas
the woman's getting lower and going,

269
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:10,680
thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Right.
So there's still much work to be done.

270
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,210
Um, the fourth part of the book is
sort of an epilogue in that, um,

271
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,870
after the piece came out in the times,
I just,

272
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,710
I got thousands of emails and
heard from all sorts of people,

273
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,530
mostly people who agreed about the
encouragement, the confidence factor in.

274
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,840
And I heard more so I focused
the book more on say physics,

275
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,550
but I heard a lot from people in tech
and finance and the issue seemed to be

276
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:38,490
very similar. Um, I heard
from women who would say,

277
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:42,180
I'd be in a room and I'd
get an idea, um, you know,

278
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:43,830
or I know how to solve the problem,

279
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:47,070
but I didn't have the confidence to just
say it right out and somebody else says

280
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:49,020
it first. And then I
kicked myself. So that,

281
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,080
that kind of thing in the implicit bias.
Um,

282
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,740
and then of course the
issues for childcare and, um,

283
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,100
how much of the house work you're
doing and all the, you know,

284
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,070
benefits for policies for I'm taking
time off if you're having a kid or,

285
00:18:04,071 --> 00:18:08,370
or other family problems. So that's,
that's the final part of the book.

286
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,860
Um,
so again,

287
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:15,030
rather than read from the book and because
I'm hoping that maybe you'll take a

288
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:15,750
copy,

289
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,700
I thought I'd reach you a piece
that I just wrote the times, um,

290
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:25,290
wanted me to write an op Ed piece that
sort of is a, uh, a new angle on this.

291
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,830
And so this piece is,
um,

292
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,700
focus more on computer science and,
uh,

293
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,140
somebody else's research that just came
out. And I don't know that I'm right.

294
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,130
And so afterward,

295
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:41,940
I would love to hear your responses and
if it doesn't jive with your experience

296
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:45,150
or it doesn't sound
right, let me know. Okay.

297
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,320
The largest high tech
companies such as Google,

298
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,060
have finally begun to
devote serious resources to
attracting and promoting women

299
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:56,400
in minorities.
Unfortunately,

300
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,210
if young women and students of color
continue to shy away from classes in

301
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,920
computer science and engineering,

302
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,360
these firms will compete for the same
limited pool of employees who aren't white

303
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,194
or male.

304
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,540
Figuring out why people who choose not
to do something choose not to do it.

305
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,530
It's like trying to interview the
l to live inside your refrigerator,

306
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,450
but only come out when the light is off.

307
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,550
Women already working at a company
might tell you what makes them unhappy,

308
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,750
but these complaints won't necessarily
pinpoint the factors that frightened

309
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,810
girls away from studying computer
science in the first place.

310
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,440
As one of the few women
who's lived in both worlds,

311
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,820
I earned a bachelor of science and physics
from meal in 1978 but have lived the

312
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:42,270
past 35 years as a writer,
an English professor.

313
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,150
I've long been interested
in why women like me,

314
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:50,010
who loves science and math switched to
other fields and so many other women flee

315
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:54,840
in horror at the site of the simplest
equation that young women who love science

316
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:58,560
and math grow tired of being teased
about their interests seems easy to

317
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:03,060
understand. Rather than receive
encouragement, they face discouragement.

318
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,410
They may dislike working in a competitive
aggressive culture that demands they

319
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:10,830
give up any outside interests that
might keep them healthy and sane.

320
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,960
They face very real difficulties
trying to raise young children, walk,

321
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:19,961
carrying out research that might earn
them tenure when might strike people as

322
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,120
less plausible is that many young women
avoid studying computer science or

323
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:28,410
engineering simply because they fear they
won't fit in with the students who do

324
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:32,130
take such classes.
For the past six years,

325
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,990
SAP Cherian,

326
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,380
who's a psychology professor at
the University of Washington,

327
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,430
has been studying white girls in high
school are significantly less likely than

328
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:44,040
boys to sign up for class
in computer science,

329
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,460
take the AP exam in that subject or
express interest in computer science as a

330
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:50,980
career.
And why?

331
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:55,510
Female college students or four times
less likely than men to major in computer

332
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:59,470
science or engineering, even though
they test extremely well in math.

333
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,570
What Sherry is research reveals is that
many girls just don't think they would

334
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,370
feel comfortable in such a class.

335
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,990
This shouldn't be too surprising when
most of us are deciding whether to move to

336
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:14,050
a new town, join a club,
or take up a hobby.

337
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,430
We are as perceptive as Sherlock Holmes
and picking up clues as to whether we

338
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:21,100
might belong over and over.

339
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:25,090
Cherry and her colleagues have found that
female students are significantly more

340
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:29,440
interested in enrolling in a computer
class if they are shown a classroom,

341
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,730
whether virtual or real. So if it's for
an online class, right, the classroom,

342
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:36,070
you can make it look like anything.
Um,

343
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,620
it's decorated not with star wars posters,
science fiction books, computer parts,

344
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:45,520
tech magazines and boxes for
video games and software.

345
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,510
But rather with art and nature posters,
water bottles,

346
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,220
coffee makers, lamps, plants, pens
and general interest magazines.

347
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,730
So one is sort of this
stereotype of what you know,

348
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:00,790
computer science room is going to look
like in the other incident meant to be

349
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:04,720
feminine or masculine. It's
more neutral. Interestingly,

350
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:08,380
the willingness of most male students
tend to not to change significantly

351
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:12,580
whether they're shown a room decorated
in a stereotypical manner or a room with

352
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:17,581
a more neutral decor while about a quarter
of the women reported being drawn to

353
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:21,460
the more stereotypical setting. Okay. So
there's some women who are like, great,

354
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:24,070
I like Star Wars. Here I am. Um,

355
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,770
the importance of what Sharon calls an
ambient sense of belonging proves equally

356
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:34,750
strong with female college
students considering a job
in an office that does not

357
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:37,990
conform to their image of what a
computer company might look like.

358
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,000
Sherry and in her colleagues also found
that cultural stereotypes about computer

359
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:47,230
scientist strongly influenced
young women's desire to
take classes in the field.

360
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,000
At a young age.

361
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,710
Girls are ready hold stereotypes
of computer scientists
and we know this doesn't

362
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:56,830
apply to anybody.
We actually know as Pale,

363
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:59,320
awkward young men who
were socially isolated,

364
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:03,760
obsessively devoted to playing video
games and intensely focused on machinery

365
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,380
and whose genius is inborn rather than
the result of study and hard work.

366
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,760
Given that such stereotypes run
counter to the indoctrination,

367
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:16,240
most girls still receive that they
should be feminine, whatever that means.

368
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:21,510
Interested in working with other people
and modest about their abilities as well

369
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:25,300
as many girls beliefs that they are not
in neatly gifted at science or math.

370
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,250
It's no surprise that they cannot see
themselves as happy successful computer

371
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:31,150
scientists.

372
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,710
In another experiment Cherian and
her colleagues arrange for female

373
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:40,600
undergraduates to talk to an actor
pretending to be a computer science major.

374
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,750
If the actor wore a t shirt that said,

375
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,020
I code therefore I am and
claim to enjoy video games.

376
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,550
The female students express less interest
in studying computer science and less

377
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:56,300
confidence in succeeding in such a class.
Then if the actor war,

378
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,980
solid tee shirt and claim to
enjoy hanging out with friends,

379
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,320
even if the actor was another woman,

380
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,610
such stereotypes might seem laughably
outdated and yet studies show that the

381
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:14,960
basic stereotype of a scientist the most
people have hasn't changed since they

382
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:19,961
first started testing for it in the
1950s and these stereotypes do still have

383
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:22,940
some basis in reality.
In some ways,

384
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:27,320
young women today might have an even
harder time imagining themselves as

385
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,580
physicists,
engineers,

386
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:32,660
or computer scientists than when I was
a physics student in the mid seventies

387
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,800
back then,

388
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,750
women were still rebelling against the
norms of the 1950s most of us wouldn't

389
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:41,330
have been caught dead
pretending to be princesses,

390
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,160
even when we were little girls or
wearing high heels and fancy dresses.

391
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,960
As adults, we issued manicures,
makeup and hair salons,

392
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,430
fancy weddings.

393
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:56,900
The required a year of planning were
anathema and we weren't about to devote

394
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,140
every minute to hovering over our
children the way or stay at home.

395
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:01,640
Mothers hovered over us.

396
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,650
I'm not making a value judgment about
women should wear or shouldn't wear or how

397
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:09,860
much time they should or shouldn't devote
to their weddings so their families.

398
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,480
But young women today clearly face
more pressure to dress in a feminine,

399
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,670
sexy manner than they
did when I was young.

400
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,020
Which means that the gap between
the way women see themselves,

401
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:26,030
this most women and the
way they see scientists has
only grown wider in the past

402
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:26,720
few decades.

403
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,290
Not to mention that the messages young
women continue to receive from their

404
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:34,040
teachers, parents and classmates
convinced them this gap is real.

405
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,713
For instance,

406
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,950
one girl I know was recently told by
her high school teacher that she was too

407
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:44,870
pretty to be good at math and research
demonstrates that female undergraduates

408
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:48,200
who have watched commercials in which
women focus excessively on their

409
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:53,060
appearance demonstrate less interested
in careers in high tech than students who

410
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:54,710
haven't viewed such commercials.

411
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,900
Cherian and postulates is similar theory
to explain why the percentage of women

412
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:04,901
studying computer science has fallen
since the mid 1980s citing evidence that

413
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:09,440
high school students get their ideas
about scientists from popular culture in

414
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:10,274
the media.

415
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,700
She wonders if there might be a causal
link between the decline in women to

416
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:19,520
interest in computer science and the rise
of movies and TV shows such as revenge

417
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:24,200
of the nerds and the Big Bang theory
which portrays scientists and engineers is

418
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:26,180
white or Asian male geeks.

419
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,810
The media intense focus on the startup
culture and geniuses such as Steve Jobs

420
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:35,540
and Bill Gates might also have inspired
more young men than women tend to the

421
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,880
field. That's, that's her theory.

422
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,470
Even though very few jobs are located in
startup companies and very few computer

423
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:44,940
scientists,
Steve Jobs or Bill Gates,

424
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:50,300
again present company excluded some
people scarf that if young women are going

425
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:54,420
to let such nebulous factors deter them
from careers in physics or computer

426
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,021
science,

427
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:59,280
while the women are simply exercising
their own free choice and if girls were

428
00:26:59,281 --> 00:26:59,941
tough enough,

429
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:04,350
such exaggerated stereotypes and feelings
of discomfort wouldn't discourage them.

430
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,840
Yet the stereotypes are still
pervasive. Just yesterday. Well,

431
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,580
yesterday from when I wrote this,

432
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,660
I was standing in line at my corner
pharmacy in New York when I realized that

433
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:19,790
the covers of the magazines I had been
staring at for 10 minutes showed a god

434
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,750
like portrait of Steve Jobs.

435
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,860
It was the subject of a recent
movie at the top beneath him,

436
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,970
a big busted model in her underwear.
Then a heroic,

437
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:33,930
clear eyed portrait of Mark Zuckerberg
and then at the very bottom,

438
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,420
another scantily clad female model.

439
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,660
All of us are bombarded by such images.

440
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,410
How can we not absorb the lesson
that computer geniuses, they're men.

441
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,010
While the chief goal of a woman's
life should be to look fabulous in her

442
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:47,844
underwear.

443
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,440
I wonder how many young men would choose
to major in computer science if they

444
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:55,830
suspect that they might need to carry
out their coding while sitting in a pink

445
00:27:55,831 --> 00:28:00,831
cubicle decorated with posters of sex in
the city and film in Luis and copies of

446
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:05,400
vogue and cosmo scattered
around the lunchroom. In fact,

447
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,050
Sherry hands research shows that young
men tend not to matron English for the

448
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:13,560
same reasons. Most women don't
major in computer science.

449
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,580
They compare their notions of who they
are to their stereotypes of English

450
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:19,440
majors and decide they won't fit in.

451
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,590
All of this meshes with my own experience,

452
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,000
even though I felt more comfortable in
a tee shirt and jeans and address or a

453
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:31,500
stylish shoe. Sue, after four years
of majoring in physics at Yale,

454
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,180
I experienced so much pressure to dress
and act like a man that I began to feel

455
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:41,181
extremely uncomfortable about my identity
as a woman working as an intern at Oak

456
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,900
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee
or attending a conference on theoretical

457
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,430
physics in Austin,
Texas.

458
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,440
I felt out of place among my mostly
male colleagues because I hated drinking

459
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:56,400
beer or eating barbecue and didn't like
getting teased about reading novels.

460
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,540
I've heard similar stories
from countless women,

461
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,590
even the female students at Olin
College of engineering right here in

462
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:08,760
Massachusetts complaining to me about
feeling out of place among male classmates

463
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,030
who were always engaging in pissing
contests or burping the periodic table.

464
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:20,250
Those were their words or male coworkers
at summer jobs who continually cursed

465
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:21,450
and made vulgar jokes.

466
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,520
The good news is that women's stereotypes
of scientists can be surprisingly

467
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:29,220
malleable.
In one experiment,

468
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,660
young women who read a fake article
claiming that many computer scientists no

469
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:37,110
longer fit the geeky
stereotype demonstrated,

470
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:41,440
is significantly greater interested in
computer science than their counterparts

471
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:46,441
who read a fake article saying that the
stereotype remains true to make computer

472
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:49,360
science more attractive to women.

473
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:52,360
We might try to change how
women think about themselves,

474
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,730
but we might also diversify the images
of scientists the women see in the media,

475
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,740
along with the decor of classrooms in
which they might want to work to study

476
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:03,574
your work.

477
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,570
This would be especially easy to do in
the case of virtual classrooms for online

478
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:08,404
courses,

479
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,680
and the office is in which they all
they might apply to work in this way,

480
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:17,290
we could retain the men and women who
are drawn to the current images and

481
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:22,240
environment while attracting women and
men who might previously have shied away

482
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:25,420
because they felt they
wouldn't fit in after all.

483
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:29,920
High Tech Company isn't like the army
where the stereotype of a warrior is

484
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,880
inextricably linked to the actual
requirements of the job. Uh,

485
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:38,170
stylishly dressed woman in a cheerful
room with a beautiful painting on the wall

486
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,280
is just as likely to write a brilliant
line of code as a man in an I code.

487
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:46,990
Therefore I m t shirt sitting in a
dingy cubicle decorated with a star wars

488
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:50,170
poster and littered with
Soda Cans and pizza boxes.

489
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,260
Even small changes might
make a big difference.

490
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,480
A thoughtful male computer professor once
wrote me to suggest that changing the

491
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:03,481
name of the major from
computer engineering to
computer arts or computer arts

492
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:07,900
and sciences would double the
number of female students overnight.

493
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,180
Of course,

494
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,290
Lauren Young women into a field by
showing them images of offices that don't

495
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,870
exist and letting them read fake articles,

496
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:21,871
the complainant's claim
computer scientists or more
suave and socially adept

497
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:24,310
than they really are,
might be unfair.

498
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,260
But as Sherry and points
out this stereotypes or at
best only partially true,

499
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,760
and women who actually take classes in
computer science don't hold the same

500
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:37,960
negative views as women who get
their ideas from movies and TV shows.

501
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,700
Besides if companies do succeed in
attracting more women and minorities,

502
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,500
this stereotypes will change as well.
Presumably the grubby decor. Of course,

503
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:48,610
as I'm reading this to you,

504
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:52,630
I realize that this is the least grubby
decor that I have ever seen in my life.

505
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,690
So then that part clearly
doesn't apply to you guys.

506
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,300
This is why Mayor Bill de Blasio,

507
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:02,200
his recent announcement that within
10 years all of New York City's public

508
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:07,030
schools must offer at least some training
in computer science to all students is

509
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:12,031
so important as Cherian herself suggest
requiring all students to take computer

510
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:13,444
science.

511
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,350
Not only would change the stereotype
as to who does your doesn't take such

512
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:18,184
classes,

513
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,750
it would provide girls and students of
color with the opportunity to experience

514
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:27,490
the material and decide for themselves
if they like the work at the college

515
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:27,821
level.

516
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:31,780
Some fairly simple changes could allay
the anxieties of female and minority

517
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:36,781
students at Harvey Mudd College at college
strategies such as renaming courses.

518
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:42,890
So they took introduction to programming
in Java and renamed it creative

519
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:47,510
approaches to problem solving in
science and engineering using python.

520
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,720
Well, I don't know that
that, that's a direct,

521
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,710
but you can see the difference in the
kind of name it is creating separate

522
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:58,850
introductory class just for students
with zero programming experience and

523
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:03,851
students who already know how to
code discouraging show off behavior,

524
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:09,550
exposing students to non Geeky computer
scientists and allowing them to work on

525
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:11,990
projects that fit their preferences,

526
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,460
lead to an increase in the percentage of
computer science majors who were female

527
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,180
from 10 to 40% in only four years.

528
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,950
So just making these like
ridiculous kind of sounding changes.

529
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,160
They went from 10% of 40% female computer
science majors in four years as an

530
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:32,090
added benefit.

531
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,960
[inaudible] research on the effects of
stereotypes and what she calls an ambient

532
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:40,460
sense of belonging and career choices
might have important lessons to teach us

533
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:44,840
about how we might persuade more young
men to enter fields they traditionally

534
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:49,490
avoid such as nursing education,
early childcare and yes,

535
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,630
even English and creative writing. So, um,

536
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,770
so that's,

537
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,850
that's the piece I'm working on now and
I would just be happy to take questions

538
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:02,080
or hearing your disagreements,
your viewpoint.

539
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,440
You are the ones working in the
field. So, um, I would just love,

540
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,070
love to take questions or hear what
you think and if you have a question,

541
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:12,470
if you could go to one of the Mikes,
that would be great.

542
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,000
Yes.
Um,

543
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:22,010
so one thing I heard like as a refrain
throughout that is that if we hide away

544
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:27,600
geekiness thing,
we'll attract a more diverse culture.

545
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:32,990
And the problem with that is that like
geeks exist and many geeks in nerdy

546
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:40,620
people and weird people throughout
high school experience extreme Austria

547
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,000
Austria's is right for sure.
And um,

548
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,890
like kind of retreat
into hyper intelligent,

549
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:54,180
you know, kind of approaches. I think
I, I don't think this is an accident.

550
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:57,600
I don't think this is just an arbitrary
thing that happens for no reason at all.

551
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,260
Um,
those people feel very,

552
00:35:01,261 --> 00:35:06,261
very invested in tech culture and they
feel that they are being attacked by the

553
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:09,270
bullies that bullied them in high school.

554
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,290
Right now we're all supposed to grow up
and become adults and realize it's more

555
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,440
complicated than that. I'm not
justifying their position. Right.

556
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,280
But I mean this is a very real
conflict, right? Totally metastasis.

557
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,880
I think it needs to be
addressed respectfully and
with, with an understanding.

558
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:28,130
So my question to you is to
answer those concerns. I think

559
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,220
what, what, what was, um,

560
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,380
in the piece that I read was
that we need to be open to more.

561
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,720
Okay. So we're not changing
or denigrating what is there.

562
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,440
We're opening to more possibilities.
Okay.

563
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,810
So what it was saying
is that there are uh,

564
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,130
people who, who were nerdy, Geeky,

565
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:54,680
whether by choice or that's just who they
are or they they want to do it. And um,

566
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,840
we want to keep those
people and respect them.

567
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:02,790
So it said 25% of the women who
were surveyed actually were drawn.

568
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,290
They, they were drawn to the classroom
that had the star wars posters. Okay.

569
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,030
And so I was very careful to say,

570
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:13,980
and Sheridan is very careful to say we
want to keep that right and respect those

571
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:14,700
people.

572
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,700
So it's not taking the people who were
bullying the Geeky kids or the women who

573
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:25,620
feel that they can't show their inner,
you know, math and science self.

574
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,010
Cause then they get bullied or teased
or nobody last them out, right?

575
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,140
It's trying to have both groups now
want to be free to take whatever kind of

576
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:37,320
court, not to be ruled by
stereotypes and bullying. All right?

577
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,060
So there's this anti intellectual culture
that affects young men and women who

578
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:45,800
are ha let their inner geek and nerd out.
Right?

579
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:50,310
And they get disrespected.
But then there are these girls who,

580
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,690
and probably some young men who
would like to be doing that, right?

581
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,370
But they're scared off because they've
been socialized by these images to say,

582
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:00,420
that's not me.

583
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,280
Or to fear that if they're like that no
one will like them or date them or you

584
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:08,940
know, be nice to them. We want
both of those groups. And,

585
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:12,390
and that was what I was kept trying to
say is that we want to make the images

586
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:17,391
more diverse to show more
possibilities so that anybody,

587
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,660
so we'll,
we'll draw in.

588
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,890
People will keep who we have now and
respect them and draw in people who are

589
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:26,730
being scared off by the
bullying and by saying,

590
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:29,410
but I'm different from um,

591
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,380
the kids who at least have each other
in the robotics club or the computer

592
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:36,600
science lab,
but I'm not like them.

593
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,550
And they think that's the only way to be.
So even though if you're in that room,

594
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,920
you feel like you're being
bullied or disrespected.

595
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,720
There's this other group
that's looking and saying,

596
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,020
at least you have an identity and
you're doing this thing where it's,

597
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:51,990
I don't fit in with you and I
don't fit in with them. Right.

598
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,260
So it's how do you get more,
first of all,

599
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:59,280
how do you get rid of the
awful stereotypes from the
movies and the TV shows

600
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:04,110
that are really not doing anybody
any good. And how do you say that?

601
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:09,110
There's room for many different kinds
of people that are currently in tech and

602
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:14,700
the way, so de Blasio saying everybody
has to take computer science.

603
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,280
At least you didn't get
everybody in the room.

604
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:20,280
And there's no more sense
of only those kids do it.

605
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:22,890
Or you'll be stigmatized if you do it.
And if you do it,

606
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:27,420
it's because you have to take the class
and then you discover you love it. Right.

607
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,690
So in a way to one way to literally get
everybody doing it and lessen the stigma

608
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,050
is to require everybody to do it.
The other way is to have more in it,

609
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:43,051
to be for all of us to be much
more alive to the stereotypes,

610
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,870
the images, the decor, and who,

611
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,440
who was being attracted by it and
who's being turned off by it and why.

612
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,500
And to realize that even though
it sounds like small stuff,

613
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:56,680
it's very powerful stuff. So yeah,
I totally agree with you and,

614
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:57,560
but there were lines,

615
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,850
there definitely were lines in here
that we're saying that we want to keep,

616
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,550
you know, and that there are women
and men that are attracted to this.

617
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:05,650
They're great. We want to keep
them, they should be happy,

618
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:09,550
but that there are other people that
they're actually being kept away by

619
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:13,250
thinking that's the only way
you have to be. Yeah. Hi.

620
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,670
Um,

621
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,500
Lord Mitson a two fuels I can think of
where there's been an increasing number

622
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:22,170
of women that uh, certainly
not equal yet, but much better.

623
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,120
And they both seem to be
Philly geeky fields in the
St math or computer sciences.

624
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,710
Have you,

625
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,580
do you have an opinion on whether we can
learn any lessons from those fields and

626
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:35,280
transfer them across
to sciences in general?

627
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:41,190
Which fields, um, are, are we, are you
talking about the law and Benson? Okay.

628
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:45,910
Yeah. Great. So yeah, I do. So
I'm especially in medicine. Um,

629
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,960
what happened in medicine
is really interesting. They,

630
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:54,660
the big stumbling block, there used
to be medical school training, right?

631
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,400
Um, well first of all there were
rules and women couldn't be doctors.

632
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:02,100
They wouldn't let him into med school.
But once they got past that,

633
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:03,840
there were women who wanted to be doctors,

634
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:08,841
but the training system was a grueling
hazing system where you had to be on call

635
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:12,390
for like four days straight and
you couldn't go home. And it,

636
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,460
it was incompatible with human
life. Right. And especially if you,

637
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,090
if there were children at
home, you couldn't just
disappear for four days. Right.

638
00:40:21,091 --> 00:40:24,420
So only men who had a wife at home who
had stayed with the kids could do it,

639
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,460
but it wasn't even good for the men.

640
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,350
And it wasn't good for the
patients because a doctor
who's been up for four days

641
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:34,800
straight off and screw something up.
Um,

642
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,270
so long about the time my ex
husband was in medical school,

643
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:42,000
we met him through medical school,
but we made it through phd.

644
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:44,430
We didn't make it prepares much past that.

645
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:48,300
It was just because these
issues are so hard. Right?

646
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,410
So he was never home.
So there was a movement to change that.

647
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,640
And it was partly because women were
entering the field and it was keeping them

648
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:57,240
out.

649
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,960
And partly because the men were finally
admitting that it was destroying their

650
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:01,794
lives too.

651
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,120
So there was a move to humanize medical
school training so that you didn't have

652
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:09,630
to like give up your marriage, your
kids, your whole life to do it.

653
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,410
And that was a reason that more
women could go into the field.

654
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,910
They picked certain areas
that seem more girl friendly,

655
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:20,370
like being a pediatrician,
but you know,

656
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:23,700
it's spreading now even to some of
the heart, more hardcore specialties.

657
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:29,570
The reason that's relevant is because
I think phd training is still a hazing

658
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:32,970
like that.
It's still much more like medical school,

659
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,930
the old days where the idea is
if you're not sick, you know,

660
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,320
if you're not willing to be in the lab 24,

661
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:42,830
seven and give up every
other interest and you know,

662
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,390
forget about your spouse and any
responsibilities to any other human being,

663
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,810
you're not serious. You won't be
taken seriously and you don't belong.

664
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,970
And so we still lose a lot of women.
Um,

665
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,050
so it's just Grad school's
miserable for guys too,

666
00:41:57,051 --> 00:42:01,520
but they tend to be more socialized to
tough it out. They have to have a career.

667
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:06,400
People don't let them just drop
out as quickly and easily. Um,

668
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,100
so that hazing,
um,

669
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,840
period in a profession tends to be a,
um,

670
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,830
a block. And if you can
get rid of that. Um,

671
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:23,720
so I think in terms of fields that
where you need a phd, that that's the,

672
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:26,900
if you can do for the phd program,
which is humanize it,

673
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:31,580
the way medical school
training was humanized and
convince people it's not going

674
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,380
to lower standards that,
you know,

675
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:37,640
if you're trying to run a program or a
blog after you'd been up for four days,

676
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:40,250
you're going to screw it up the way
you would have killed your patient.

677
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,020
Now for tech,

678
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:45,920
I think it's more like what Anne Marie
slaughter was saying in her article,

679
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:50,120
which is just that if, if being in the
profession, like that article about,

680
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,550
I was at Amazon where you just have to,
like,

681
00:42:52,551 --> 00:42:57,380
you're treated like crap and have to
work 900 hours a week and you know that

682
00:42:57,381 --> 00:43:02,120
those, that idea of what is
needed to be good at your field,

683
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:06,740
I think is still something we, you know,
if that, if that applied to all fields,

684
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:10,790
if you can have things more humane,
right. And that's not the standard.

685
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,880
The other part of it is the stereotypes,
right?

686
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:18,740
So there's still this very
American idea that somehow girl,

687
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:23,540
you know, girl femininity does not
equate with math, computer tech,

688
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,070
right? These, the stereotypes that
girls who picked up by second grade.

689
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,420
And one thing I was really interested
to discover in researching this book is

690
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:34,310
that's not true in other
every other culture.

691
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,820
There are a lot of cultures where
women don't have certain other rights,

692
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,970
but it's inconceivable to
the men in those cultures.

693
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:45,110
The women wouldn't be as good at science,
math, computer programming, whatever,

694
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:49,310
coding, right? Which if you're American,
you go, wait, no, you know, we,

695
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:54,200
that's such a basic stereotype for us
and yet in other cultures is maybe the

696
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:58,040
woman needs her husband's permission to
go to a tech conference because they're

697
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,960
going to be other men there.
But he doesn't think,

698
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:03,530
but no one thinks there are cultures that
think women are better at math because

699
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:07,760
women are more creative than men. Right.
And that whole business about how,

700
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:10,850
you know, women used to be
the software people until,

701
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,630
because it was seen as just
the secretarial work until
the guys decided that was

702
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:16,070
the cool part.
And then they kicked him out.

703
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:20,330
So just these being alive to
sort of the hazing aspect,

704
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:22,940
the part that makes it in human,
but also the,

705
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:26,170
the way the stereotypes are just,

706
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,810
I think they're more pervasive today than
they were when I were young was young.

707
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:34,811
There's even more on women being
really traditionally girly,

708
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:38,490
feminine spending all their time, you
know, on planning weddings and stuff.

709
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:39,630
And that's just not,

710
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:44,990
and then they get a stereotyped idea of
what tech is like and the two just don't

711
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,950
Mesh.
So it's being really,

712
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:51,780
really alive to the stereotypes
that are so different. Yeah.

713
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,643
You were next.

714
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,060
So, um, I don't know if
you've seen, uh, there's a,

715
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,830
there's a woman online
who known as the key cast.

716
00:44:58,831 --> 00:45:02,690
She was doing Linux colonel programming
and she's just decided that she's going

717
00:45:02,691 --> 00:45:05,240
to step out because she's
done with the hazing. Um,

718
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,880
she's done with the combative attitude of,
of having to take a lot of crap,

719
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,480
which of course speaks to what you
were just saying, but what you're,

720
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:15,990
what you're addressing is what I think
we at Google tend to refer to as the

721
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:18,930
pipeline issue where
women aren't coming in,

722
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,040
but there's also a substantial issue
where a lot of women once they're in and

723
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:25,790
have been here for a while
will then drop out. Right.

724
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,460
I know that that's something that we've
seen with the numbers inside of Google.

725
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,400
Right. I don't know if I'm allowed to
actually say what those numbers are,

726
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:36,090
but certainly the higher
up the levels you go,

727
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:38,850
the fewer women there are.
Um,

728
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,880
do you have any ideas on how to address
the lack of role models as given that

729
00:45:45,091 --> 00:45:49,830
there are a few women to
act as role models for women
who are joining the field?

730
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,760
It's much harder to then stick around
because you don't have a model on which to

731
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:54,594
base your,
what your

732
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,510
for. Sure. Um, well first
of all it's, you know,

733
00:45:57,511 --> 00:46:01,200
I focused in the book much more on
sort of the pipeline issues because I,

734
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:05,940
my whole question was why didn't I go
on? Right. And if I had gone on and I,

735
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,580
you know,
spent 10 years working for a tech company,

736
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,440
I would have felt more secure focusing
on that. I should say that I did do pro,

737
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:13,770
you know,

738
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:18,240
I taught myself four Tran when I was
an Undergrad and did a program for a

739
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:21,300
professor of scattering program.
We didn't have, there were no pcs,

740
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:23,220
there were no screens.
So you had to do,

741
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,240
everything came out printed
on paper and you had a flip.

742
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:29,910
It was like a flip book to
make the simulation work.

743
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:34,911
And then I worked at Oak Ridge programming
a simulation there and you know,

744
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:38,730
I mean, so I have some sense of this, the
sexism there was just unbelievable. It,

745
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,620
I think that was the worst
I've ever experienced.

746
00:46:40,621 --> 00:46:42,600
There were stuff called
job control language.

747
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:46,980
So you'd needed certain codes to even
get time on the computers and that it was

748
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:52,340
run by guys and mirrored sunglasses
who literally would make the women say,

749
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:53,161
say,

750
00:46:53,161 --> 00:46:57,510
or do something sexy and suggestive so
that they could find out that they as JCL

751
00:46:57,511 --> 00:47:00,570
language, you know, so I'm going to have
some idea of it, but it's not, I can't,

752
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:03,150
I feel like you guys are
the experts that said,

753
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:07,050
I've talked to a lot of
women and I think there's it.

754
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:12,030
What's really insidious instead,
it's so many relatively small,

755
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,270
uh, obstacles, insults, you know,

756
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:20,271
just the hardships that no one of
which is enough to make you just go,

757
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,360
that's it. That's the way a
straw. But they accumulate, right?

758
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,150
And in some ways,
so,

759
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:31,720
so a lot of what happens is somebody
finally can't take it and says,

760
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:33,460
I'm just going to stay
home and raise the kids,

761
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:36,220
or I'm going to do something different.
And then people say,

762
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:40,660
use that to justify that women are
no good or that they actually prefer

763
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:41,530
something else.

764
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,950
So the fact that I eventually became a
writer caused people to write to me and

765
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:49,150
say, we'll see you prefer to
people field. And I'm like, no,

766
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,300
it was made so miserable for me.
But it's gradual.

767
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:57,301
So the analogy I sometimes use is if you
were at the gym and you're on a tread

768
00:47:57,761 --> 00:48:02,580
master and there's a guy on the next one,
right? And you both think that the, um,

769
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:05,110
inclined,
the resistance is the same,

770
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:08,390
but what you don't know is yours
to set higher, right? And she,

771
00:48:08,391 --> 00:48:12,970
you're both going right and then you
speed it up and like you're sweating and

772
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:17,260
huffing and puffing and he's not so
much and you think what's wrong with me,

773
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:20,650
right? That it's harder for me.
And he's looking over and going,

774
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:24,160
why is she sweating and huffing and
puffing? We're both on the same treadmill.

775
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:28,180
And then you give each person one of
those balls at the gym that look the same,

776
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:31,600
but one is much heavier and you
don't know yours is heavier, right?

777
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:34,720
Cause I don't know this data that
you're not sharing, like right,

778
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,830
if everybody doesn't know the data,
that's childcare. That's parent care,

779
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:42,220
that's house care, right? And
at some point you're just like,

780
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:46,990
not only am I exhausted, but he's
not, so I must not be as good at this.

781
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:48,700
This isn't worth it.
I'll go,

782
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:53,230
just go take a yoga class and see women
look just like yoga classes, right? Show,

783
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:57,250
talking, right? Registering
what's going on.

784
00:48:57,251 --> 00:49:02,251
So the more that you can be aware of
what's going into the fact that it seems

785
00:49:02,351 --> 00:49:05,530
harder, like to articulate
that, to bring it out,

786
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:08,530
to make as much public as you can,
to be aware of it,

787
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:13,531
and to know what you're
at least experiencing and
fighting that he got $890,000

788
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:15,730
to set up his lab.

789
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:20,110
And I showed the women at Mit in the late
nineties to whom this first occurred.

790
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:22,960
Like, why are we so much
more tired than the guys?

791
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,820
Nobody wanted to share the data. They
forced the issue. Let's see, salaries,

792
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:32,410
they were on their hands and
knees measuring, um, lab space,

793
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:36,730
right? So whatever it is
that you can articulate, can,

794
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,230
I think that that's actually even more
important than literally having a role

795
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:44,830
model. Right? There were a lot
of guys who are very sympathetic.

796
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,500
I'm sure many of them are in this room,
right?

797
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:52,830
Having a sympathetic male supervisor or
a role model can be just as powerful.

798
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:58,750
And unfortunately sometimes it's so hard
for a woman to get to a certain point

799
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:03,700
that by the time she gets there, she
sort of like, I did it, I did it my way.

800
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:08,970
And it can be harder to have her as a
role model than a guy you because you

801
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,450
stuck out so much to defend.
Um,

802
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,060
so I sometimes hear from
women who disagree with
everything in my book and say

803
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:20,980
none of this is true because it didn't
apply to them. And I'm saying, right,

804
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:24,010
that's why you're the only woman
where you are and it's great.

805
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,620
I loved what you did.
But they are denying that their reality,

806
00:50:27,621 --> 00:50:29,810
they're saying their realities
the same for everybody.

807
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,150
So it's also like not depending,

808
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:36,440
not taking your role model as
maybe the obvious choice. Right.

809
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:39,740
Sometimes my greatest
role model is as a writer,

810
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:44,910
it was an African American male
writer who was just brilliant and said

811
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:49,100
everything I needed to hear and he
was my role model, right? Worse.

812
00:50:49,101 --> 00:50:52,550
There were some women writers,
older women writers who were,

813
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,301
I don't know where did,

814
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:58,301
they were trying to toughen me up or
they forgot that their age at my age,

815
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:01,940
they weren't so tough either or that
they needed encouragement when they were

816
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:02,240
young.

817
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,240
So sometimes you just have to
pick different role models or say,

818
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:11,070
oh, I can do it on my own because
I'm not on my own bit bit.

819
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,200
But with other women at the same level,
and some men bring in men, male allies,

820
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,160
just trying to articulate some of those
hidden stressors and differences and see

821
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:26,240
if you can work on those rather than
just let it all accumulate the way I did

822
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:27,740
and walk away from it.
Right.

823
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:31,280
And then be my age and
regret that you let people,

824
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:32,960
not that it's your weakness or your fault,

825
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:35,960
but if I had known what I was coping with,

826
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,760
I don't know that I would've walked
away. Okay. Here's another question.

827
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,620
We have time for it.
Yeah.

828
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:48,420
Hi. Um, so here I am. I made
it. I did finish my phd.

829
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:53,580
Uh, and um, I am just really fortunate.
I went to an all girl high school,

830
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:56,340
which set me up in college to not even,

831
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:59,580
I really did not notice that
I was in a room full of men.

832
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:02,190
I have a very funny story
that I will spare you. Um,

833
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:07,220
and then I was fortunate to find a female
professor who thought highly of me and

834
00:52:07,681 --> 00:52:11,060
went out of her way to mentor,
not just me but other female scientist.

835
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,920
She was my phd advisor and I mean my,

836
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,290
my research group at my university,

837
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:19,830
we had parody because the two professors
in charge of our group went out of

838
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:23,280
their way. But I also have friends
who are software engineers,

839
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:26,760
women who are software engineers
at other companies and they,

840
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,110
they really do not have a good
time and these other companies.

841
00:52:31,111 --> 00:52:33,030
So I was kind of scared. I said, Oh,

842
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:36,420
thank God I'm going to Google where they
have these things like unconscious bias

843
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:39,890
training and they care about this.
Um, so I guess the question is like,

844
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,950
if we are here and we made it, what
do we do to help? I'm not willing,

845
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:46,660
I mean I'm not going to go and be a
teaching high school cause that's not my

846
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,990
temperament, but what, what
can I realistically do to
help the women behind me?

847
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,210
All that's great. And I'm so,
and I have to say that, um,

848
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,390
although I don't have it as study,

849
00:52:55,570 --> 00:53:00,160
I don't think studies have been done to
back this up after just six months doing

850
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:01,180
the research on that book.

851
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:06,181
I felt like I could tell if a woman had
gone to an all girl high school or if

852
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:08,230
I'm an African American student,

853
00:53:08,231 --> 00:53:12,490
had gone to a historically black college
because there was something about that

854
00:53:12,491 --> 00:53:17,230
experience of, especially if in junior
high and high school, um, you're,

855
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:19,690
you're saying that a
single sex institution,

856
00:53:19,691 --> 00:53:24,160
it's almost like you get inoculated
against the stuff that really was so hard

857
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:27,330
for me. The, the encouragement,
lacking the confidence.

858
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,590
I don't know how it weighs out against
whether there are disadvantages of it,

859
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:35,130
but even later when women say
then they're in the room with men,

860
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,900
they just don't seem to experience the
same psychological, um, hindrances.

861
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,610
Um, and I think that's really important.
So with that Harvey Mudd College,

862
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:45,540
what they're doing now,

863
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:50,541
that first course separating people out
so that there's a room for it tends to

864
00:53:53,221 --> 00:53:56,760
be mostly women, but some guys too
who have had no experience, right?

865
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:01,910
So they are not kind of intimidated away
by the mostly guys who feel really good

866
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:06,140
about their skills and are all too
ready to show, you know, so that,

867
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:10,050
that keeping things separate at least
long enough that people get their legs

868
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:14,010
under them I think is important.
So if you're working at the college level,

869
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:14,970
that's one way.

870
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:19,140
So you're not really separating by
gender accepted ends up being gender

871
00:54:19,141 --> 00:54:23,370
influenced with the
experience. I think really, um,

872
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:28,730
the work to do is
trying to,

873
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:33,440
if there are things that work here,
trying to get other industries to adopt,

874
00:54:33,441 --> 00:54:37,490
like what are the best practices? Can
you publish? Can you write op ed pieces?

875
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,910
I'm the one, they're asking the right,
the op Ed pieces. If you were writing it,

876
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,800
you'd know even more what to say.
Right.

877
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,650
And then people read it and
it spreads to other companies.

878
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,860
And to work on these
images, like, you know,

879
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:53,861
if you're watching a show or movie and
the imagery of who is or isn't a computer

880
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:59,840
scientist or what it's like to work
in the field, you know, you can exert,

881
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:04,340
get people to exert pressure on Facebook
or wherever on whoever made the movie

882
00:55:04,341 --> 00:55:06,860
or selling the product. Um, so yeah,

883
00:55:06,861 --> 00:55:09,880
I think there are are things to do,
um,

884
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,740
get support groups going,
um,

885
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,570
go into other companies to be
a role model or a mentor. Um,

886
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:21,710
but yeah, I think that, um, the,

887
00:55:21,711 --> 00:55:24,470
especially what you were talking about
with the single sex institutions,

888
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:27,110
it's very, um, it's very powerful.

889
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,750
Any other questions?
Yeah.

890
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:34,090
All right.
Uh,

891
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:38,350
so you talked a lot about how the
images of who computer scientists and

892
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:42,100
programmers are influences
people's perceptions,

893
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:48,060
but has there been any study about
what computer science is used for?

894
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:54,010
So sort of the popular conception
of Silicon Valley, you know,

895
00:55:54,011 --> 00:55:57,100
disrupting industries and sort of,

896
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:59,380
it's tends to be very aggressive language.

897
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:04,430
And does that turn off people who just
don't see what programming could be used

898
00:56:05,591 --> 00:56:08,410
for that sort of constructive
or creative or artistic?

899
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,260
Yeah, very much so. And, and Sharon works
on that and some other people have too.

900
00:56:12,261 --> 00:56:15,640
So she, there two levels
of that to their, the,

901
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,450
the students who are just maybe thinking
of going into the field and taking up

902
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:24,460
first class are thinking about maybe
do I want to major in that then that is

903
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:27,730
extremely important. Like,
well what would I use this for?

904
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:32,560
And basically people have no
idea what you do with coding,

905
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,720
which seems, I know if you actually do
it, you know, it's everything you right.

906
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:41,440
But you don't get that if you don't
know what it is. Right. And so, um,

907
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:46,450
one of the things Harvey
Mudd lets students do is pick
their own projects, right?

908
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:49,480
So that would make it easy for you.
I mean, you're given some guidance,

909
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:53,710
but you can pick the thing that seems
important for you to work on. You know,

910
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:58,540
there's some notion that young women
want to work on people fields or things

911
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:00,190
that'll benefit humanity.
I,

912
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,280
I've never really seen a study that
proves that to my satisfaction.

913
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:08,080
And I always wonder where
that notion comes from.

914
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:13,081
I think it gets drummed into your head
if you're a girl that you should want to

915
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:13,901
work on.

916
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:18,880
Some people feel that's good for humanity
because I remember people saying it to

917
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:21,640
me,
like I'd say I want to be a physicist.

918
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:24,460
And I remember my social
studies teacher saying, no,

919
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:26,800
you should want to work on a people field.
So like,

920
00:57:26,801 --> 00:57:28,870
where does it really come from?
Um,

921
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,310
but that's a lot of the work that's
being done with like girls coding clubs,

922
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:37,270
robotics, clubs like that. A lot
of work is actually being done.

923
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,470
It's never enough,

924
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:42,610
but they're trying to work with like
seventh and eighth grade girls in clubs.

925
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:45,040
Like what would you use coding for?

926
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:50,041
And this is something that's enjoyable
to you and it's not like to blow people's

927
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:53,440
heads up or, you know, on a
video game or something. Um,

928
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:59,110
and then there's the level at which once
you're in start to be in the culture,

929
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:02,700
the aggression and the competitiveness.

930
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,100
That's more the hazing stuff that I
was talking about before the culture.

931
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,450
And again,
a big part of what I'm trying to do,

932
00:58:10,451 --> 00:58:11,680
especially in physics,

933
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:16,210
but it's the exact same thing here is
changed that culture because I just don't

934
00:58:16,211 --> 00:58:17,770
think it's healthy for anybody.

935
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:22,420
And I think there are a lot of guys who
don't like it and get caught up in it

936
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:26,800
because it's the way they
think they have to be. Um,

937
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:30,490
the other woman,
so I was one of two women who graduate.

938
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:32,830
We were the first graduates
with a physics degree.

939
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:36,670
The other woman became
just a whiz programmer.

940
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:40,690
I mean she's just brilliant and she's,
well she started at bell labs,

941
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:45,340
worked at all these other places
and she's been kind of edged out.

942
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:48,910
She's currently unemployed
and she's utterly brilliant.

943
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:53,920
But the competitive, sexist, ageist stuff,

944
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,390
just,
she got edged out.

945
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,860
So it's working on that culture.
When you see it calling it like,

946
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:05,410
why did you have to talk
to the person that way?

947
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:08,860
Or like if somebody presents something,
do you have to jump on them first?

948
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:12,700
Could you maybe say like what was good
about what they did before you make

949
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:16,170
suggestions? That's,
that's the difference. Um,

950
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,320
one last thing is, um,
one thing that struck me,

951
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:25,321
so was trying to recruit more minority
employees and they had one African

952
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,450
American engineer was
pretty high up and he went,

953
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:36,170
I don't know if it was his alma mater,
he just decided to go to,

954
00:59:36,171 --> 00:59:40,310
I think it was Howard University.
And he said,

955
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:43,430
how many of you would be,
how many of you use Dropbox?

956
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,350
And like a lot of them raise your hands
because like we, a lot of us use Dropbox.

957
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,473
You said,
Whoa,

958
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,960
once you like to come work for the
company that makes this happen.

959
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,710
And they're like, yeah, we really
would. Would you like us to come?

960
00:59:57,711 --> 01:00:01,340
Nobody's ever recruited anybody
here and we'd love to do this.

961
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,110
Part of it was they didn't
know, Oh yeah, I use this thing.

962
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,670
It would be fun to create stuff like this.
So that's part of it.

963
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,980
Knowing what,
what you do with it,

964
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,600
but also thinking you're wanted
because you look at the, you know,

965
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:19,640
the room or the movie or the whatever,

966
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:23,450
and there's nobody who looks like you
there and nobody's coming to your school

967
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:26,900
to recruit. So yeah, all of the above.
What do you had to do with this?

968
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:29,840
And I think what happens is
once you're in the field,

969
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:34,550
it's so obvious to you that to get that
back down to the level of like an eighth

970
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:37,130
grade girl or an eighth grade
boy, or who are, you know,

971
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:42,050
or an African American kid, you
know, why is it not obvious to them?

972
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:47,480
Where was it that you picked up the ideas
and how are these people either being

973
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:51,980
welcomed or scared away? Um,
that's, that's sort of where it,

974
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:55,370
where it is.
Okay.

975
01:00:55,610 --> 01:01:00,400
I think that I'm being signaled
that we have our time up, so I will,

976
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:04,220
I will stick around as long as you'd
like me to see if anybody wants the book.

977
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,670
But thanks so much for inviting me.
I really am glad I got to meet you guys.
