Planned Parenthood Federation in the

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,590
Western Hemisphere region and today we
really are going to have a conversation

4
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:24,250
about the state of women's health in the
state of women's rights in the region

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,540
and how the International Planned
Parenthood Federation is navigating the

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,720
regions, um, rapidly changing political,

7
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:33,910
economic and environmental landscape.

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,180
I am delighted to have a woman leader
here today to talk about this important

9
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:42,140
issue. So welcome so much.
Thank you for [inaudible]

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,420
introduction. Thank you all
for joining this conversation.

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,230
Thank you both John and [inaudible] for
making this company companies a great

12
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,960
opportunity to be here.
Coffee is great,

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,110
and I look forward to the next, to the
next opportunity. Thank you very much.

14
00:00:57,111 --> 00:00:58,480
Good. Well, just all,

15
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:01,410
I always like to start these
conversations with the personal stories.

16
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:05,570
So can you tell us a little bit about
how you got interested in this work and

17
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:07,580
sort of how you got to
where you are today?

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,020
Well, I, you know, I grew up in Argentina,
in Argentina. And when I say rural,

19
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:13,820
I mean rural.

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,410
I remember receiving the Sunday
paper at 4:00 PM that's rural.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,050
And, um, you know, I went to
an all girls Catholic school.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,190
Um, we, and this is not a telecom
faith faces as you just mentioned. I,

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,480
I, we work with, uh, progressive, uh,

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,610
religious leaders and I'm part of the
board of Catholic for the right to decide.

25
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,900
But, you know, we, I remember
we used to be, you know,

26
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:41,600
girls playing on one side and
boys playing on the other side.

27
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,510
And I remember always asking the
question, why is this, you know,

28
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:46,070
I have brothers and cousins.

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,550
We used to play together and
things were different there.

30
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:53,580
And I remember the answers were not quite
satisfying. And then as I grew up, um,

31
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,870
you know, my parents would say like,
what do you want to be when you grow up?

32
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,900
And across the street there was,
um,

33
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,200
a farming school full of
boys and, um, and this,

34
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,760
I thought that was really cool.
You know,

35
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:07,910
like they used to be outdoors all the
time and said, I want to be a farmer,

36
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:12,700
I want to go to that school. And, and they
would be like, not real. That's, that's,

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,950
you know, for boys. Like
why is that? And again,

38
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:17,960
not a very satisfying answer to that.

39
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,250
And then I think all of it came together
when I was in secondary school and one

40
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:26,570
of my best friend got
pregnant and she wasn't,

41
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,570
I'm rejected from a school, but, um,

42
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,450
but she couldn't be part of us anymore.
You know,

43
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:35,510
like the social stigma associated
with teen pregnancy is huge,

44
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,250
continues to be huge. And, um, and so
I think all of it came together and,

45
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,890
and it was clear that it
could have been any of us,

46
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,920
that we needed the information to be
able to protect ourselves to live healthy

47
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:53,030
lives. And that wasn't there,
that wasn't available to us.
Right. Um, I also grew up,

48
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,500
you know, during the dictatorship
in Argentina. I was born in 19,

49
00:02:57,501 --> 00:03:00,430
776 on in, and now, you know,

50
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:04,840
my age and the leadership
began in March of that year.

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,150
So I remember that crashing
sense of, um, that,

52
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,350
you know, things would never change.
And, um, and then when democracy came,

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,190
that feeling of it was in our hands to
make that happen and to protect that.

54
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,240
So I think,
you know,

55
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,740
all of it had to do with ended up where
I ended up in planned who do it worked

56
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,470
for women's right.

57
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,110
I truly believe that there isn't the
possibility of development without half of

58
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:32,020
their population being uh,
including um,

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,570
and sexual and reproductive
health and rights are key, right?

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,000
Deciding if we want to
have children when we have,

61
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,330
we want to have to live with whom is
critical to us being a full participant,

62
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,770
participants, um, in society. So all
came to everywhere. I love that. Well,

63
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,370
thank you for sharing your personal story
with us and I always appreciate that

64
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,500
because it sort of gives a sense for,
you know,

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,390
how you got to where you are today,

66
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:59,010
which I think a lot of people
always want to know about. Um,

67
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,400
tell us a little bit about sort of a
wide range of services that planned

68
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:07,330
parenthood does provide and sort of
white you're the population you serve,

69
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:10,150
looks like he has. Well, we, um,

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,190
last year alone serve about 6 million
women in lead in America and the Caribbean

71
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,610
and provided roughly 30 million
services from a really pap screening,

72
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,750
cervical cancer screening,
sexy location,

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,460
a gender based violence services,
access to contraception, um,

74
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,210
and safe and legal abortion
when that, when that is
allowed by the local laws. Uh,

75
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,050
one thing that I should mention is that,
you know, we're a global federation. Um,

76
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,630
so we have a presence in about 150
countries around the world. Um,

77
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,050
we represent the Latin America and
the Caribbean. We work with 40, um,

78
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,480
independent organizations,

79
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:50,020
non for profit organizations
that are affiliated to us. Um,

80
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,080
I don't know how many of
you do know, uh, of, uh,

81
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,680
Planned Parenthood Federation of
America. Many of you know, right? Yes,

82
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,250
they're great. There are a
great partner in the US. Um,

83
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,090
how many of you do know of I
BBF or International Planned
Parenthood Federation?

84
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:07,570
Probably not too many.
Right. It's, it's okay. Um,

85
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,130
Planned Parenthood Federation of America
is our partner in the U S and lady that

86
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,310
we have partners,
uh,

87
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,690
in 150 countries globally are so
many of them providing a full care,

88
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:23,350
comprehensive sexual and reproductive
health services for women and men.

89
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,810
About 10% of our services are to men.
And we got a big focus on youth.

90
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,700
Um, I across the world and in particularly
in Latin America and the Caribbean,

91
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:38,280
about, uh, 40% of our services
go to young people. Um, yeah.

92
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,390
And then a lot of those cases,

93
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:44,440
are you providing free or low cost health
care to the patients that come in your

94
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:49,270
door? Yes, we lose one. We not only
have clinics in many of the countries,

95
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,470
you know, that is a, a game
I like to play when I go.

96
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,720
I spend much of my time visiting clinics
and programs in Latin America and the

97
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:59,960
Caribbean. And, uh, when the
taxi driver picks me up from
the airport, I always ask,

98
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,030
so how do you know local clinics?
Have you been there,

99
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,650
your friends when they're,
and,

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,980
and the answers to those questions
normally is yes. Uh, they, uh,

101
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:14,360
they know our clinics because we've been
providing services now for 50 years, uh,

102
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,840
in the region, but we not only
provide the services in the clinics,

103
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:22,841
we also run community based programs down
in communities where other people will

104
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,910
then go. Right. Eh, and many,

105
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,200
all of our services are subsidized and
many of them are free of cost in these.

106
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,940
So probably in a lot of friends,
a lot of these women,

107
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
especially in rural communities,

108
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,990
that planned parenthood clinic might be
the only clinic that is affordable and

109
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:42,070
accessible for them.
Right. Indeed. Indeed. Yes.

110
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,990
So you've been with the
Organization for over a decade,

111
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,370
which is quite impressive.

112
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,580
Can you share what's changed in
that time over your service with the

113
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,600
International Planned Parenthood
Federation? Well, you know,

114
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,170
it's interesting because I transition,
um,

115
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I am a first time CEO and transition
to become the CEO last year,

116
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,840
arguably not the best year to transition
anything called planned parenthood. Uh,

117
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,020
it's a, you know, full of challenges.

118
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:12,770
And I think my work before
was a programmatic work.

119
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:16,460
I spent time with women and,
and the communities.

120
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,780
And I think I saw a great
change in terms of, you know,

121
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:25,370
we have been able to lift many people
out of poverty in Latin America and the

122
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:29,690
Caribbean. We still remain as one of
the most unequal regions in the world.

123
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,040
Uh, that means that if you
are young, if you're poor,

124
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,660
if you're from an indigenous community,
if you're a for the [inaudible], um,

125
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,310
the way you experience life
health services, you're
needs are different, right?

126
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,270
Um,

127
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,070
most of our countries are considered
now middle income countries and uh,

128
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,310
this means that donors have
pullout from the region,

129
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,410
but huge pockets of poverty
and inequality remain. And, um,

130
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,660
and the people we serve are these people,
right?

131
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:04,430
So we need to continue investing in
this program and in the services.

132
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,990
Um, I think we know that we
have then great advances.

133
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,730
We have been there for 60 years.

134
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,190
We have brought contraception
to many of these countries.

135
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,520
Emergency contraception,
what is called the morning after pill.

136
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,700
It should be called the, as
soon as possible, Bill, because

137
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,890
you can use it up to five days
after having unprotected sex.

138
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,930
But the sooner you use it,
the better.

139
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,680
We brought that to many of the
countries in which we are working.

140
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:35,000
So we have made great
strides, um, in, um, you know,

141
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:36,530
bringing in contraception to women,

142
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,710
but we know that we have 23 million
women who want access to modern

143
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,570
contraception and don't have it.
Right.

144
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,170
So I think there have been
great advances in general,

145
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,530
but there are huge challenges that,
uh,

146
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,920
that remain and we have to
continue working to close
that gap for sure. You know,

147
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:57,750
in Silicon Valley here we're
technologists by and large.

148
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:00,990
And so we always think about the
role of technology in our work.

149
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:05,670
So has technology played a role in the
work of International Planned Parenthood

150
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,470
Federation? Yes, I think
we have made important than
investments in technology. I,

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,910
my, uh, seems small to you,

152
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:16,911
but we invested in making sure that we
have electronic health records across the

153
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:20,670
world so that we can not
only serve women better,

154
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:25,200
but also assess the health outcomes
over time. And that's an investment we,

155
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,430
we have done over a number of years now.

156
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,590
We think that are great opportunities
for technological innovations.

157
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:35,790
We are a region with high conductivity
and we have in front of us,

158
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,680
um, the largest generation
of young people ever. Wow.

159
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,850
Reaching them. Uh, it's a
huge opportunity, right? It's
a huge challenge as well.

160
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,880
And I suspect that we will know how to
help us close that gap because I think

161
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,340
probably technology has a key role to
play in reaching these people with both,

162
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,260
um, information, uh, it location
and actual actual services.

163
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,670
Um, unfortunately the, you
know, telemedicine, uh,

164
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,460
all of that is not as
developed as it is here,

165
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:12,230
but we do a follow very closely and,
uh,

166
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,270
love to try a few innovations that we
know are happening in the United States

167
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:20,420
right now.
And that hold great potential too,

168
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,180
to bring services to women in
a much more cost effective way.

169
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,650
How that's a fantastic opportunity for
all of us here to think about and be

170
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:29,940
involved with for sure.

171
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,500
So we do have a powerful
female CEO here in our midst,

172
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,640
and I always like to,

173
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,960
to ask you a little bit about what that
year has been like and what are some of

174
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:44,280
the key leadership challenges you faced
and the lessons you've learned, um,

175
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,320
in that year? Well, it's, it was,
it, it was clearly a tough year. Um,

176
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,160
not only, um, you know, we had
a new US administration, um,

177
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,860
not quite favorable to
our issues. And, um,

178
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,940
you know, everything that happens in
the u s has an impact, um, overseas.

179
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,190
Um, we, you know, the US used to have
a leadership role on these issues.

180
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:11,250
That's no longer the case. And, um,

181
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,330
prison term impose as soon as he
took office. The global gag rule.

182
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,450
Talk a little bit about that cause I'm
not sure everybody's familiar. Yeah. The,

183
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,220
everybody, a Republican
president since Reagan, um,

184
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,420
uh, put in place something
called the global gag rule,

185
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:32,421
which is limits the ability
of organizations overseas
that receive us funding,

186
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,590
um, to either, uh,

187
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,870
advocate for change in the laws and
policies in relationships to abortion,

188
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:43,230
to provide abortion services
with their own resources,

189
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,880
even if our version is legal
in that country. And, um,

190
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,600
and their money normally,
uh,

191
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,740
from the u s government was for
work lake access to contraception,

192
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,470
gender based violence.
Uh, what the was uh,

193
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:03,530
impose a rule of really unprecedented
proportions that in every source of

194
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:08,830
funding from, from the US government,
including tuberculosis, malaria,

195
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,450
HIV, AIDS. Um,

196
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,560
so normally about 600 million of us
falling assistant money would be gab,

197
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,020
um, as we call it. Um,

198
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,280
in this case is about
eight point $8 billion.

199
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,420
So this is a policy that has the potential
to really do serious damage to women

200
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,200
around the world.
Um,

201
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,540
we as an organization decided
not to be guided by these policy.

202
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,270
Um, we, you know,

203
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,020
we give up out $100 million
as an aside, as a holy, um,

204
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,320
uh,
and um,

205
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,480
and we think this rule is unfair and
unjust and harms women and really has the

206
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:59,470
potential of harming women
across the globe. So, um,

207
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,730
that was a big challenge. We face
as soon as I took, I took office in,

208
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:04,870
um,

209
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,870
I think in April last year we had Brexit
in July and we had the elections in

210
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:14,260
November and this happened right
after in January. So I think that's,

211
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,060
that was one of the biggest
challenge. Um, the second one, uh,

212
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,140
you might have heard we have a string of
natural disaster you have effect in the

213
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:26,380
region, um, over the past
few months. Um, again,

214
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,330
disasters of unprecedented
proportions. Um, you know,

215
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,290
our clinics have been badly
affected. Our teams. Um,

216
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,090
what is really amazing to
see if, you know, we had the
earthquake in Mexico, they,

217
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,430
after our teams, people in our,
our office lost their homes.

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,810
They show up to work to
provide care for women,

219
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,170
not in the clinics because the
clinics were damage on the streets,

220
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,420
whatever that was possible. They were
there to help women because we know, um,

221
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,313
that,
uh,

222
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,280
one of the things that happen when natural
disasters effect is that the needs of,

223
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,320
of women and girls are normally not
the priority, but life goes on, right?

224
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,840
People continue to need contraception,

225
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,410
people continue to need
a prenatal care. And, um,

226
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,840
and I think has been amazing to see,
um,

227
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,630
the level of response in spite of,
of such, such a difficult situation.

228
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,880
And maybe if, if I am allow a second
to talk about Puerto Rico because, yes,

229
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:32,090
please. For the record, you
know, it's a case that hurts,

230
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,500
hurts me because the tuition of
the island was dire before, um,

231
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,660
before the hurricanes
hit. And, uh, you know,

232
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:45,400
50% of the population living below
the poverty line, many of them women.

233
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,390
Um, and then, uh, we have the
hurricanes. And as you know,

234
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:54,130
the response from the
government, has it been, um,

235
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,490
limited, um, unsatisfying?
I don't know how to,

236
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,910
what objective to objective
to use to define it. And, uh,

237
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,080
and I feel like we have four
clinics, um, in the island,

238
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:11,150
none of which are up and running because
they'll steal because we don't have

239
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:14,780
electricity. We, um, uh, you know,

240
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:19,420
we raise funding to buy
generators, which is the way, um,

241
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,790
and if they go away for
generators to get there,

242
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,670
because obviously everyone is trying to,

243
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,250
to buy generators and you can't
keep them running all the time.

244
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,040
So that will have some limitations.
Gas is a problem accessing gas, uh,

245
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,000
two random, um, and you know, we have,

246
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,540
uh, we know the need is there. We have
the infrastructure to set of women.

247
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,500
We need help to get those clinics,
uh,

248
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,880
back in order and to provide the services
that are very much needed because no

249
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:52,850
one else will we be doing
that. Right. So, so it's,

250
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,050
I guess I plenty of help for the case
of Puerto Rico in which the response has

251
00:15:57,051 --> 00:16:01,040
been with contempt. Yeah. And um,
and he's wearing matching myth.

252
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,340
No, I think that's a really good
point. And you know, as you point out,

253
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:07,550
it really has been such a
challenging year, you know,

254
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:12,551
from policy and politics and natural
disasters and I can tell that this work is

255
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:18,140
very personal and it's very emotional
and I really do applaud your bravery and

256
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:19,730
your courage and your leadership.

257
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,120
How do you sort of keep your staff and
your caregivers and your providers sort

258
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:26,420
of,
you know,

259
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,430
motivated to do this work in the long run
because it can be very challenging and

260
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:32,810
emotional and taxing.

261
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,840
Yeah, we um, hold tight to
the good things. You know,
these people are fighters.

262
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,310
They been fighting in the front lines.
These challenges are not new to us.

263
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,080
Our bigger, that's right. It's
always difficult but they,

264
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,470
our themes are there
serving the needs of women.

265
00:16:50,471 --> 00:16:52,480
There is nothing more satisfying.

266
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,980
There is nothing more satisfying to me
and to many of them. Then when, you know,

267
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:59,380
when you sit with women
in the waiting rooms in,

268
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,070
when I travel and get to talk to him
and the number of barriers they had to

269
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,570
overcome to be there and you have
the answer to what they need,

270
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,090
there is nothing more satisfying
than being able to provide that. Um,

271
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,030
and I think that Colin tied to that is
what keep us going and the support of so

272
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,960
many of you,
you know,

273
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:21,961
we couldn't do this work
without supporters like you
who are there to hold the

274
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:26,920
line and, and support us every step of the
way. So thank you. Thank you very much.

275
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,530
You know, um, then thank you.

276
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,570
Thank you for motivating,
you know,

277
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,410
your team of caregivers and
providers to do this work.

278
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:35,730
It's really quite incredible.

279
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,950
You talked a little bit about how
oftentimes when a young woman gets to your

280
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:41,371
clinic,

281
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:45,660
they've overcome a lot of barriers just
to get there and be present that day for

282
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:46,530
their services.

283
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,890
Can you talk a little bit about
some of those barriers women face?

284
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,510
Yes. And we work to help them
overcome them. You know, like I'll,

285
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:56,120
I'll talk a little bit about
our cervical cancer work,

286
00:17:56,121 --> 00:18:00,740
which I think is a good indication
of that. We, um, you know,

287
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,880
cervical cancer is still a killer in,
uh,

288
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,770
for women in Latin America
and the Caribbean and across
the globe and is caused

289
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:11,600
by a virus called HPV virus.
Um, there are many strains of,

290
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,050
uh, of the vitals, but two that
really causes cervical cancer.

291
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,930
And there is a vaccine that is a
very low in developed countries.

292
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:23,350
So we partner with the Ministry of Health
in Bolivia and our members association

293
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:27,950
there to bring the vaccine, uh, to,
to Latin America and the Caribbean.

294
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,330
And it was quite pricey at the moment.
And I'm normally here, you know,

295
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:34,910
women would, uh, take girls.

296
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,380
The vaccination ranges between I
think nine and 12 years of age. Um,

297
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,970
and, um, to the pediatrician, the
pediatrician would offer the vaccine.

298
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,740
The vaccine has three doses,

299
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,340
so you have to go three times a
year with your girl for the vaccine.

300
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,880
So when we began looking at
this program and knowing,

301
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,770
I mean many of the women we serve,
um, you know, working the fields, um,

302
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,540
selling food in the market, they can't
just take the day off to do these,

303
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,960
uh, they might not have enough money
to feed their family that we give.

304
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:10,930
They do so. Right. Um, so we, uh,
develop this initiative and um,

305
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,620
uh, apply the vaccines in a pilot
program in schools because we know a high

306
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:20,270
proportion of the girls are in school,
they don't need their mothers, their and,

307
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,570
and we have a very successful rates
of vaccination higher than any other

308
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:27,860
vaccination program in
this pilot initiative.

309
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,960
So we tried to bridge the gap because when
you work in low resource settings, um,

310
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,910
we have to be creative and disruptive
in the way we think through through

311
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:40,190
programming. Right? So
that has been a, I think,

312
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:44,720
a very good example of trying to find
people where, uh, where they are and, um,

313
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,220
and help them overcome the challenges,
uh, that they wouldn't have otherwise.

314
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,620
That's fantastic.

315
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,150
I want to talk a little bit about a real
issue in a real crisis. And our society,

316
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:58,510
which is the issue of sexual
assault. Um, you know,

317
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:03,370
we've seen movements like me to start
spilling out to other countries and we've

318
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:08,170
definitely been hearing just more and
more about the prevalence of sexual

319
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:11,650
assaults, sort of, um, two
women around the world.

320
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,570
How are you sort of thinking about that
work and thinking about educating girls

321
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:20,740
and women about sexual assault,
sexual violence, sexual harassment,

322
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:24,640
and the impact of those things
to them? You know, I come from

323
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,490
joining, which I'm one in three women
have suffered violence, you know, the,

324
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,220
um, I think if we have 25 countries
with highest homicide rates, uh,

325
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,750
feminist side we call them against women.

326
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,730
14 are in Latin America and
the Caribbean. Um, I um,

327
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,640
I think, um, I follow very
closely. Me Too. I think, um,

328
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,040
it's great. That is a lot in
women's story. Deli come in,

329
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:55,970
women coming forward and telling
their stories. Um, I think um,

330
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,340
it was very interesting to see how that,
um,

331
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,950
how that trickle effect and
about 12 countries. Um, you
have to love the French.

332
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,040
They call it out the pig
or something like that.

333
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,050
I mean it's just a fabulous, and
I think to see, uh, very quickly,

334
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:15,130
even in Argentina, a few days after
the waste end case in the u s uh,

335
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:19,750
we have a case, um, uh, on,
uh, for a journalist as well.

336
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,620
I think there is a lot of power in people
telling their story in coming forward.

337
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:27,790
This is not just about a solidarity,
it's about self exposure, right?

338
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,000
And four, we know those of us
who have worked in violence,

339
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:35,050
we know that for every woman that comes
forward there yet that are at least 10

340
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,200
that haven't.
And that is a of you know,

341
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:42,770
a pervasive element in our society.
Um,

342
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,960
also in Argentina we are
home of a movement called um,

343
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,060
new and our not one less.

344
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,420
This moment kind of happened organically
as a result of a number of super high

345
00:21:55,601 --> 00:22:00,130
profile cases of, of
homicides against women, uh,

346
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,850
mostly by their partners.
And um, you know,

347
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:08,851
we are 40 million and they mobilize out
a million people in the first time that

348
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,110
they go together. Last year they mobilize
3 million people. And you could argue,

349
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,080
you know, Argentinians
like to march, but, um,

350
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,890
but I think that it was incredible.
The mobilization,

351
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:25,030
the digital mobilization. Many
people show up at work, uh,

352
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,320
dressed in black tomorrow to show
their solidarity. And I think,

353
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:30,970
I think that's amazing.
I think as a,

354
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:34,660
as a movement or I like to think
we are reaching a tipping point,

355
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,620
we no longer have to accept
these as part of our life.

356
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,480
And I think that is a lot of
transformation going on. And I,

357
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:48,481
if there is something to have faith
confidence on is in the ability of civil

358
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,910
society or follow fats,
um,

359
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,690
keeping this conversation going
because laws and policies will follow.

360
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,710
But we first need to understand that
this is simply not accept or we cannot,

361
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,470
we don't have to put up with this anymore.
And that's right.

362
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,880
That's the conversation that I saw going
on that gets me very excited because I

363
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:09,970
think it's the beginning of the end,
which was,

364
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,170
which is a terrific sort of optimistic
view and I really thank you for that.

365
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,480
You know, you said something that
really struck me, sad for everyone.

366
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,150
My man that comes forward and reports
a sexual assault or sexual violence,

367
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,270
there's probably 10 more that
haven't reported. You know,

368
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:30,271
how can technology or how can our work
help more women sort of be able to come

369
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:35,860
forward and get the help they need
and the support they need. Yeah.

370
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,230
I think it's what we are
seeing. You know, we,

371
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,910
we have been one of the first institutions
that created a health response to

372
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:47,390
violence. No. And I think with
technology, so much more can be done. Uh,

373
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,380
I think, uh, as I said,
there is a lot of um,

374
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,280
it's very powerful for women to come
forward and they have done so, um,

375
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,420
and a beer, you know, this
is a conversation happening,
the regular conversation,

376
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,850
everybody's is talking
about this. And I think, um,

377
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,410
technology's obviously a big part of
the cooling cap happen before, you know,

378
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:10,580
this is not, I support techs.
This is Mitchell. Yes, I am.

379
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,980
I am very much part of
this. And I think, um,

380
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,460
and I think it was possible because
of the connectivity and the platforms,

381
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:19,580
we have to be able to express ourself.
And I think that's a great thing.

382
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,680
That's a great thing. Yeah, for sure.

383
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,820
Tell us a little bit about
how International Planned
Parenthood Federation as

384
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:28,940
approaching HIV and
AIDS, um, the treatment,

385
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:32,630
the care or the awareness and the
region as well. Yeah, we have know, uh,

386
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,790
sexual rights and,

387
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,180
and the work around HIV AIDS have
been central to our work. Uh,

388
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,450
we integrated HIV detection services
across our region in Latin America and the

389
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:44,864
Caribbean.

390
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,700
I have gone to the communities work with
a specific population where the virus

391
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:54,470
tends to be concentrated in the region,
has been a critical piece of our work.

392
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,270
Um, luckily the, the, there has been
a lot of progress in the region, uh,

393
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:04,130
on that issue. And some of
our member associations even,
uh, provide treatment. Um,

394
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,290
one of them Dominican
Republic for instance.

395
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:11,291
So we have been fully involved over
the past 10 years in integrated service

396
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,330
delivery,
uh,

397
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:17,090
on HIV and feel very proud of
the accomplishments in that area.

398
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,673
It's wonderful.

399
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,630
And I want to turn a little bit to some
of the laws and policy in the region. So,

400
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:25,760
certainly even in the states,

401
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:29,000
we're seeing laws and restrictions
being passed that, you know,

402
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:32,480
make it harder to have access
to safe and legal abortion.

403
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,440
Are you seeing that as well? Um,
in Latin America and the Caribbean?

404
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,550
Thank you for that question because when
I talked earlier about service delivery

405
00:25:40,551 --> 00:25:45,300
and location, and I forgot to
mention that we really work, uh,

406
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,790
around laws and policies
that inhibit access, uh,

407
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,230
for women's exercise of their rights.
Right?

408
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:56,231
We work at the local and the regional
and we also had the work at the UN on

409
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:00,440
behalf of IBM as a whole globally.
Um,

410
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,720
what we are seeing, um, in Latin America
we have a lot of laws and policies. They,

411
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,070
they issue a, the
hardest nut to crack, uh,

412
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,870
is in the implementation aspects of things
and making sure that the money exists

413
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,710
to support, um, uh, service delivery. Um,

414
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,290
we're still home to,
uh,

415
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,770
for countries who have a
total ban on abortion. And,

416
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,430
um, for those of you who
might not know what that is,

417
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:31,880
is that you can't access abortion
services in any circumstances,

418
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:36,130
not even to preserve your
own, uh, life. And, um,

419
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,850
so it's a big challenge. We have,
I remember the case of parents,

420
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,990
she was a 16 year old from the Dominican
Republic who was pregnant and had

421
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:50,991
cancer and her treatment for cancer was
denied because of her pregnancy would

422
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:54,560
put at risk to her pregnancy. And
in the Dominican Republic, uh,

423
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:59,220
along with El Salvador and
Nicaragua and Honduras. Um,

424
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,350
there are no exceptions. Um, so,
um, she laid, she'll, if she paid,

425
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:07,620
she paid with her life, the
congress, the still, um,

426
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,660
debating a bill to open
some legal exceptions,

427
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,760
eh, but, um, there is much
work to be done. Um, in,

428
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,470
in that regard, we have a number
of countries that have, um,

429
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,420
legal exceptions and the books,
but those have not materialized,

430
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,590
you know, in the life of women.
Um, they might exist on paper,

431
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:33,770
but the implementation of those,
um,

432
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,230
I guess offer often time
limited and oftentimes we are a,

433
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:44,200
one of the providers in those places in
which legal exception exists, uh, for,

434
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,000
for abortion care, for legal
abortion care for women. Um,

435
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,360
we should to up big window. We, um, uh,

436
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,770
there was a total ban on
abortion in Chilean. And, um,

437
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,900
we just, um, maybe, maybe I want to
say two months ago, we're able to,

438
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,800
uh,

439
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,800
pass a legislation that allows for
three legal exceptions to preserve,

440
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,870
preserve the life of the woman,

441
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,350
four cases of rape and incest and cases
of fetal malformations incompatible with

442
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:22,860
life. And, um, and you know,
the law is limited in scope.

443
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,540
It's only three circumstances.

444
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,450
It was legacy from the
Pinochet dictatorship. Um,

445
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,620
but it's a biggest step
forward with Chilean women,
uh, to be able to access, uh,

446
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,980
in these circumstances.
And we still have four more countries to,

447
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,370
to be able to, to overturn the total vans.
We have the gates, I don't know if you,

448
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:47,490
if you have heard or follow the news,
we have the case of El Salvador.

449
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Women in El Salvador go to jail if
they are suspected of having economists

450
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,440
courage for 30 years.

451
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,810
So these are really
draconian laws, um, that, um,

452
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,490
that, you know, need, need to change
and um, and um, they need to be changed.

453
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,413
Definitely.

454
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,250
And so I imagine a lot of your work as
the CEO of the International Planned

455
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,920
Parenthood Federation and the Western
Hemisphere is working with policymakers

456
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,680
influencing lobbying for change.

457
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,860
How are you finding the receptivity to
these issues and their willingness to

458
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:26,640
understand the issues, learn and
adapt and change? You know, we have,

459
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,150
I think a great partnership with
the government. We have, you know,

460
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,180
local organizations that are leading
the work on the ground. Just like, uh,

461
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,400
BFAs Lee in the work here in the u s um,

462
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,550
that helps because the organizations
have been there for 60 years.

463
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:46,150
They have a reputation,
they know where we do. Um,

464
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,930
having said that these issues are hard.
And as I said,

465
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:54,640
it's not only just changing
the loss once they load change,

466
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,590
the real fight begins and the fight
is making sure that those services are

467
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:02,440
available to women. So we are also, um,

468
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,640
act as watch dogs for the
government to make sure that, um,

469
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,000
the laws are implemented
and quite importantly,

470
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:14,680
that there is funding to
support the provision of
those services in the, in the,

471
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:18,130
in the national budget. Because
at the end we, you know,

472
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:20,950
we are there to support
as long as much as we can,

473
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,280
but this needs to be part of,
of the country program.

474
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,350
And that's easier said than done. Right?
Uh, when, when it comes to the reality,

475
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:34,270
we have laws that have been on the
books for a hundred years now and uh,

476
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,360
and many of them, you know,
implementation is a, is a slow, um, it's,

477
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,330
it's, it's a hard fight,
but I think one was fighting

478
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,930
very much so.
I think you said something that probably,

479
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:48,600
it's definitely surprise me and
maybe some of our audience too,

480
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:52,380
is that there's a big difference between
getting a law passed and the practical

481
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:54,930
implementation of it.
And I think sometimes as activists,

482
00:30:54,931 --> 00:30:57,840
we think our work is done
when the law is passed, right?

483
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,890
It's a law is passed and change magically
happens. And I think you're saying, hey,

484
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:05,490
there's actually a long road between
a law on the books and practical

485
00:31:05,491 --> 00:31:07,050
implementation on the ground.

486
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,380
Are there steps that can be taken to sort
of shorten that gap between passing a

487
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:15,510
law and practically implementing
it for the folks you serve?

488
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,520
Yes, we think, you know,
we're experience, you know,

489
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:23,521
working with health care teams as the
low in building the support for the new

490
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:24,931
low.

491
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:29,170
It's critical because you've got to have
providers query to provide services not

492
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:33,880
only ready, uh, ideologically
ready technically. Right.

493
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,890
Um, so I think we have learned
that if you engage, uh,

494
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,710
healthcare providers from the get go,
not only they work with women every day,

495
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:44,450
they know their stories,
they can bring their stories,

496
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,040
stories to the public
conversation, right. Um,

497
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,140
but also,
um,

498
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,850
they are the ones who will have to provide
services and that has proved to be,

499
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,080
I think an important element that we have
learned through the work we have done

500
00:31:59,081 --> 00:31:59,914
in the region.

501
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,130
Yeah. That's very
insightful. Thank you. John.

502
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:04,230
I just wanted to take a
look our check with you.

503
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:05,460
Are there questions from the Dory?

504
00:32:05,461 --> 00:32:07,410
I certainly have a lot
more for just solve that.

505
00:32:07,411 --> 00:32:08,910
I want to make sure the
audience gets correct.

506
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,400
These have a couple, right?
One of the bully asks,

507
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,430
I used to work in public
health in Subsaharan Africa.

508
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,850
One of the challenges I encountered
was combating dangerous myths about

509
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:20,260
reproductive and sexual health.

510
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,900
How do you correct these
misconceptions in the field?

511
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,510
And is there anything that we have
Google can do to combat this type of

512
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:26,344
misinformation?

513
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,543
Of course.
I mean,

514
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,420
I think we heard it all right in
terms of myths and misconceptions.

515
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:35,740
Our contraception, I would
everything else. Um, I think, um,

516
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,190
I could not stress enough the need to
have comprehensive sexuality education

517
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,840
for,
um,

518
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,930
for young people and as early as
that is possible and not any type of

519
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,530
comprehensive sexuality education,

520
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:53,531
but one that its evidence base that
talks about power and relationships that

521
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,300
helps kids,
uh,

522
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,580
young people in maneuver the life and
the relationships and to calibrate them

523
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,670
challenge,
you know,

524
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:06,470
the social norms around masculinity that
offering oftentimes the basis for my

525
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Cheeseman and for violence. Um, I
think, uh, that that's critical.

526
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,890
I think you at Google can
help. Um, as I said, we have,

527
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,590
um,
the VUS opportunity ever.

528
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:22,940
We have the largest generation of
young people in front of us. Uh,

529
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,970
reaching them with the right information.
Um,

530
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:31,430
it's critical and I suspect you will
have ideas on how you help us do that.

531
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,450
Um, but it's definitely something that
will be an investment that will pay off in

532
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:39,530
the next 40 years. We know
a location base off, um,

533
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,560
comprehensive sexuality education
is not the exception to that.

534
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:46,610
We have plenty of evidence, uh,
of the dipole of, uh, sexuality,

535
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:49,770
location that works.
Um, and I think we, uh,

536
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:54,260
we just need to be able to reach kids
in a school out of school early, uh,

537
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:59,150
with good information so they can
actually live the lives they, uh,

538
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,230
they want to leave. Um, and I think
it's, um, it's critical that we do that.

539
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,380
That's a great question. Thank
you. Molly. Another one. John,

540
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:13,070
can you talk a bit about how you evaluate
your programs for effectiveness? Yes.

541
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:17,000
We, uh, you know, for every
program we run, we, uh,

542
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,400
we do an evaluation of the programs.
Um, also, uh, you know, uh,

543
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,910
each member association runs, uh,
evaluation of own programs as well.

544
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,760
Evolution is critical for learning
for us. And, and I think, um,

545
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,910
the program I was talking about in
Bolivia on cervical cancer is again,

546
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:39,530
a good example because we not only
look about, uh, effectiveness.

547
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,660
Is the vaccine effective, it's
effective in this setting. Um,

548
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,610
we also look at are there better ways,

549
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,770
are there most cost effective
ways of doing that? Um,

550
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,810
one thing that we are very happy to
know now is that the vaccine that I was

551
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:56,840
talking about to prevent cervical cancer,
um,

552
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,570
instead of having three
doses has to those doses.

553
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,990
Being able to deliver a program
with two doses as opposed to three,

554
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:04,400
my seem a small thing.

555
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,160
It's actually a huge thing
because in low resource settings,

556
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:11,950
if you can eliminate one step, keep the
same results, you can use that money, uh,

557
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,980
for other, uh, health pressing
needs, uh, in the country. Right?

558
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,900
So we, uh, we'd love to do much
more, but we have a commitment to,

559
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,800
to evaluate everything. Everything we do.
That's fantastic. And I want to share,

560
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:28,670
we haven't touched too much on yet
as maternal mortality and I'd love to

561
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:33,110
understand sort of the prevalence or
the demographics in your region around

562
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:35,120
maternal mortality and sort of the,

563
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,390
a little bit about the harm reduction
that sort of really helps address the

564
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:44,100
issue. Can you talk to us about that? Yes.
It's, um, thank you for that question.

565
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:44,700
You know,

566
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,700
the harm reduction model was developed
in Norway about 10 years ago and,

567
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,260
uh, by a group of midwives and doctors
who worked in a public hospital. And,

568
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:55,980
um,

569
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,980
maternal mortality was always relatively
low in would away with one exception,

570
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,220
which was maternal mortality
view to unsafe abortion. Um,

571
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,350
and you know, what happens in,
in the region is that if you are,

572
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,240
um, you know, a woman of
means a, even though the law,

573
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:19,530
my, um, may not allow
for, for legal abortion,

574
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,870
you can get an abortion from your doctor.
Um,

575
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:27,690
the problem is that those who are not
women of means simply die right from

576
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:28,411
unsafe abortion.

577
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:33,210
So this is what they face in the
way they thought at the moment that,

578
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,180
you know, abortion was restricted.
There were a few exceptions,

579
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,380
not really known by women and not
really used by providers either.

580
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,320
Um,
and I Callum moment,

581
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,790
but it also has a before and
an after where women have, uh,

582
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,490
contacts with their providers and doing
nothing wasn't what they wanted to do.

583
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:52,800
Right.

584
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,800
So they develop a model that allows
them to educate women about what they

585
00:36:58,471 --> 00:37:02,550
shouldn't do if they decided to
pursue, um, and abortion, uh,

586
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:07,320
what not to insert the
warning signs. Um, and also,

587
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:10,140
uh,
to come back for care afterwards.

588
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,870
They couldn't probably
help them in the moment,

589
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,120
only if they were eligible
for the legal exceptions.

590
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,120
Otherwise they didn't have the,

591
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,730
the ability to help them but help them
with education and they could come back

592
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:25,230
for care when they need care possible.
John is legal in all of the countries.

593
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,390
Um, and, and, and they thought this
was a very important, at the same time,

594
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,530
um,

595
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:36,360
there was a new drug called misoprostol
that became available in the region and

596
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,860
it's a, a drug that saves life, you
know, women can induce abortions.

597
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,740
It's much more, much more safer. And
so providers would advocate women, uh,

598
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:48,150
on how to use misoprostol.

599
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:53,060
They couldn't tell them where to get
misoprostol or the coolant prescribed a

600
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,990
drug. But, um, based on the
right to access information,

601
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,010
um,
you know,

602
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:02,820
they thought women should have access to
the best information to preserve their

603
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:07,020
lives and this is how they build the
model. And quite interesting, um,

604
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,230
the model was expanded to
several countries in Latin
America and in Africa and,

605
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:17,460
uh, they drove maternal mortality
to zero and in a matter of 10 years.

606
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,950
Um, and um, they also pave the way. Um,

607
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:26,880
I think for abortion law
reform would away in 2012, um,

608
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,800
you know, pass a law that decriminalize
abortion up to 12 weeks, uh,

609
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,650
in the country. And I'm absolutely
convinced that talking to women,

610
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:39,400
educating providers was key to build
support around the needs of follow that

611
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:43,880
would allow women to, uh, to manage
this part of their lives. Um,

612
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,920
we'd safety and with good health
outcomes. Um, so I think some other,

613
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,410
uh, it was portrayed in
the New York Times and,

614
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,040
and very much we are proud of
that they, they were able to, to,

615
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,650
to create and how a role to play,
uh,

616
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:03,250
in such a moment in women's lives are
certainly getting maternal mortality down

617
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:07,720
to 0% is an amazing feat.
So thank you for that.

618
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,580
Um,
you know,

619
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:13,150
we talked a little bit about the laws
and the restrictions that you're seeing

620
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:17,650
sort of come up in Latin America and the
Caribbean, but talk a little bit about,

621
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,680
you know, certainly in the u
s over the past several years,

622
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:22,750
there've been a lot of
restrictive laws passed,

623
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:25,930
making it harder to access contraception,

624
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,030
access safe and legal abortion.

625
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:33,040
How does sort of the policy in the
United States and the arguments and,

626
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,570
and politics sort of around women's health
impact the work you do in the region?

627
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,270
Yes, I, you know, the US used to be a
place where we look up, looked up for,

628
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,650
for leadership on these issues. And, and
as I said, that's no longer the case. But,

629
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,050
um, in addition to that, um,

630
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,680
and in addition to the global gag rule
that I talked before the really coattails,

631
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,090
um, uh, the possibility for
organization to serve women, um,

632
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,950
I say that what we're beginning
to see is a much stronger, um,

633
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,600
violent and aggressive or position
in the region, which is quite new.

634
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,220
We had not seen that before
in a matter of a few months.

635
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:14,440
We had,
you know,

636
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,130
our office as vandalize
in one of the countries,

637
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:21,870
our executive director in another country
with death threats and things that we

638
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,220
clearly had not seen before.
Um,

639
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,760
we also have something
that came up in Columbia.

640
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,050
There is called the gender ideology,
um,

641
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,780
a whole reframing conversation around.
Um,

642
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,940
and it came right at the moment
of the peace process. Um, and um,

643
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,910
and against all of our issues
really a very strongly,

644
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,920
and I think we, um, we
have to think about, um,

645
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,360
as a clear influence.

646
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:54,361
There has been some reports recently I
think in the Guardian about the role of,

647
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,330
um,

648
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:00,330
the opposition in the u s funding the
opposition in many of the Latin American

649
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,510
and Caribbean countries.

650
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:06,070
And I think we are going to see
more of that in the years to come.

651
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,110
So really the work we all do in our
individual regions and countries really is

652
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:12,000
interconnected.

653
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,210
And so playing a role to actively
advocate for policies that advance women's

654
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:21,040
health are important for all of us. Yes,
absolutely. Very much so. Very much.

655
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,040
John,
any last questions from the dory is,

656
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:25,510
I asked to sell just a few last important,

657
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,601
just one last one,

658
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:30,080
which was a lot of the conversation around
planned parenthood is on the topic of

659
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:34,190
abortion. But, uh, I understand you put
an awful lot effort into other kinds

660
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,520
of services. Well, could you perhaps
touch on a couple of those? Um, yes, we,

661
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,170
I mean, I've worked on, if you look at
our annual report, our chancery, cause I,

662
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:45,120
we're 5% of the services we provide.
Um,

663
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,210
about 30% are services on contraception,
um,

664
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:55,460
uh, cancer screening, a gender
based violence. Uh, both, uh,

665
00:41:55,461 --> 00:42:00,230
detection screen and, and support.
So when you look at, um, um,

666
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,480
our, the number of services we
provide and the division, um,

667
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:07,700
you'll see that it's a very
small proportion. We feel
very proud of the work.

668
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:11,960
We do a on abortion version, but
we do, uh, much more, uh, indeed.

669
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,940
And, um, and you know, as I said,
we have been leaders in accessing,

670
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:20,870
in bringing contraception to Latin
America and the Caribbean and have done so

671
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,080
for about 60 years now.
So yes,

672
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:26,000
we provide comprehensive care to women.

673
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:30,390
We feel we need to serve the
needs of women, all of them, um,

674
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:34,730
with no exceptions, uh, when it comes
to reproductive and sexual care.

675
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,970
And that's how we stand
as an organization.

676
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,750
And that can be easily verified by hour,
by hour.

677
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:44,750
Annual report hasn't changed
much over the years. Really.

678
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,580
I think that's a great reminder of the
resources available to us to learn about

679
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:52,580
planned parenthood and the
wide range of work. You all do.

680
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:57,360
So at Google here we're coming
up on our annual giving week. Um,

681
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,950
Googlers are very involved in giving
back to the communities we serve.

682
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:04,370
And communities around the world
through our time, through our money.

683
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:09,670
What is the best way for a Googler who
is interested in women's health and um,

684
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,330
you know, reproductive freedom. What is
the best way for Googlers to get involved?

685
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,840
Well, first, thank you.
[inaudible] we feel your lab.

686
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,790
We are really very capital account
with us. One of our supporters.

687
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:27,440
I think the first thing I would say become
a supporter, you know, um, donate to us.

688
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,700
You can do so through our website.
Um,

689
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:34,850
IPPF whr.org this is the moment if it is,

690
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,680
if none of the agreements before convince
you, this is the moment to double them,

691
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,380
uh,

692
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,240
on women's right to reach the birth to
support all of the progressive causes.

693
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,580
There is no best time to do that.
Uh,

694
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,870
that now because so much is
it's under threat, right? Um,

695
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,960
we, uh, we just learned that you
also have a program, uh, that uh,

696
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,170
you can spend your time with us.
We would love,

697
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,360
I think you have a lot of ideas and
thoughts that could be very useful to us.

698
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,450
Um, and I think finally, you know, again,

699
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,480
you can help us bridge the gap in the
most difficult issues we are facing and

700
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,540
will make a difference in the
next 50 years, uh, in the region.

701
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:19,190
So I love to engage in a conversation
or how that could happen accessing young

702
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:23,560
people, um, uh, you know,
working together to be able to,

703
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,130
to enable that. Um, so I think there are
many ways in which, and, and of course,

704
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:32,280
collaborating and supporting your
local planned as well. You know,

705
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:35,730
we're a global movement and the
support is needed everywhere. Yeah,

706
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,030
that's fantastic. So I want to
end on a positive note. You know,

707
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,980
you did talk about it. It's a challenging
time for women's reproductive rights,

708
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:48,930
for issues of health care,
for sexual violence and
assault. But in talking to you,

709
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:53,130
I can tell that you have a lot of hope
and a lot of optimism for a better future.

710
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,170
And can you tell us sort of maybe a story
or share a few thoughts about sort of

711
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:02,340
how you keep that hope and optimism?
I'm alive in this work,

712
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:06,540
which is so important. It's
difficult than your, that automation,

713
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:09,540
which shave them feel
necessarily this way. Um,

714
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,690
I think we have to keep an
eye on the long fight, right?

715
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,520
We've been here for 60 years.
We'll be here for 60 more.

716
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:19,890
We are not going to
give up on women and um,

717
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,310
and we have seen the change that
happened. Right. And if you, if one keeps,

718
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,600
keeps their eye on the, on that long game,
um, we know things are possible and, and,

719
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:33,470
and change will come. It will require a
lot of effort. Uh, it's tobacco fourth,

720
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,160
it's never a straight line to the finish.
There is never a finished right. But,

721
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:42,030
um, but I have, I the confidence in the
role of civil society organizations,

722
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,810
you know, organizations like ours
who will not give up. And, um,

723
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,100
and I think it's very clear to us that,

724
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,120
that this is a fight worth fighting, if
anything. So yeah, that keeps me going.

725
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,770
Well, just sell. I've gotta tell you,

726
00:45:55,771 --> 00:46:00,771
I think you instilled a great deal
of hope and optimism for me today,

727
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:03,030
certainly.
And I know for our audience members,

728
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:05,670
and I just want to thank you
for that. I think, you know,

729
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:10,671
we touched on a lot of issues today and
I think really gave cooglers listening

730
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:11,700
in the world,
listening,

731
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:15,000
a sense of sort of some of the issues
that we're facing and the importance of

732
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:17,460
getting involved.
So I just want to thank you.

733
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:20,670
We're very grateful for you and
your knowledge and most importantly,

734
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:24,420
your hope and your optimism. So
thank you so much. Thank you so much.
