1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,070
Thank you. Thank you, Natasha,

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,650
for you.
I mean,

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,440
that's the stance you take when you're
getting a cape, but I don't want to be,

4
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,380
you know, rude. Did not have to worry.
Thank you. And I want you to know,

5
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:27,000
thanks to Natasha and also, um, I
typically wear my Cape on the inside.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,240
So if you don't have a cape on the
outside, you can keep it on the inside.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,080
Am I amplified and ready to
rock and roll? Yes. Yeah. Okay.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,920
So what we're going to do today is we're
going to test the limits of what is

9
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:40,440
probable,
what is profitable,

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,460
and what is possible when we bring
our imagination to the workspace.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,010
When we bring our
imagination to our homes,

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,470
when we bring our
imagination to the streets,

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,300
when we bring our imagination
to a talks at Google. What?

14
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,030
So instead of starting at the beginning,
we're going to start at the ending.

15
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,200
So please stand up.

16
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,523
Yeah.

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,590
Okay.
On the count of three,

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,980
you are going to give yourselves and
each other the best standing ovation you

19
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,680
have in u one, two, three.

20
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:33,843
Okay.

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,090
Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, you can
sit down physically bluebuds

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,880
stay standing emotionally
for the whole time.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,190
So I want you to remember that you know,

24
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,250
all of us here have and will dare to
share our wildest ideas and we'll be a

25
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:02,281
little scared or we will deign to raise
our hands and it all hands meeting and

26
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:05,350
share an idea that
scares us or we might be,

27
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,920
it's taking the stage and
giving a presentation and
were a little freaked out.

28
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,300
And so you can remember this moment when
we all gave each other and ourselves a

29
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,390
standing ovation and you can
take that with you. Okay.

30
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,930
So I have spent the last 10 years
consciously bringing creativity into the

31
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:25,930
workspace and imagination.

32
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,290
And I'm talking about when I've worked
and before that little less consciously,

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,480
um, hadn't really developed this
idea of creative trespassing.

34
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,830
But when I was bagging groceries,
when I worked as a Barista,

35
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,250
when I worked in a museum, when
I worked in technology, um,

36
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,640
and as I got more conscious about this,
you know,

37
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,740
infusing imagination and creativity,

38
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,060
I started to notice two things
that were really astounding to me.

39
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,590
And the first thing is,

40
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,680
is that we don't need to work in a job
or a field that is uniquely creative in

41
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,560
order to be uniquely
creative within our work.

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,090
And the second thing that I learned is
that if we bring imagination to confront,

43
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,240
like are self limiting
beliefs, uh, obstacles,

44
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,770
everyday challenges that we will
experience unlimited solutions,

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,210
ideas and innovations. True
Story News at 10, I'm done.

46
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,340
Um, and that's what compelled me to
write this book, creative trespassing,

47
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,810
which I'll show you. Oh my gosh, it's
so red and white and fantastic. Sure.

48
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,530
Okay. And so what I want to, my
talk today is really about, um,

49
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,610
some moments or stories where I learned
to see myself limits as opportunities

50
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,580
to,
to creatively trespass,

51
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,170
to maybe add something that wasn't
there and in live in not just myself,

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,860
but colleagues and the mission and vision
of the companies that I worked for.

53
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,550
So anybody here go to
contemporary art museums? Okay.

54
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:01,330
About 50%. And somebody was like, man,
not only fits a free day, that's fine,

55
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,243
that's fine.

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,540
I sort of felt like math when somebody
offered me a job in a contemporary art

57
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,760
museum. I'm like, I don't
understand the rules.

58
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,620
They're always saying like don't touch
things. And then it's contemporary art.

59
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:16,210
So they're like, why aren't you
touching it? Very confusing.

60
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,710
And I,

61
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:22,510
they wanted somebody like a rule breaker
from the outside to come inside and

62
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:27,511
create like wild programs and generate
new revenue streams and increase

63
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:31,840
attendance. Pretty regular
metrics for functioning. Right?

64
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,120
And so I got there and I started, I
did what I, I'm I do in, in theater.

65
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:39,880
That's my background. You sort of
assess the situation and you're like,

66
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,370
who's my audience? What do I have to
work with? What are the props? And, um,

67
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,880
I realized there was this weird thing
I'd never heard of called employee of the

68
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,620
month. Anybody familiar with it?
And I'm like, employee of the month.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,060
That sounds fantastic. How
do I win that? And right.

70
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:02,110
You're laughing again. Hr was like,
Tonya, you don't win it. You earn it.

71
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,920
And I was like,
then I will earn your vote and when it,

72
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,890
and here's what happened,
I'll show you.

73
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,100
Uh, so we, we, um,

74
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,440
the program I created was called out
of the cubicle cause I was like, um,

75
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:08,290
they put me, they brought me
in to think outside of the box.

76
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,040
They stuffed me in a cubicle.
Ironic or scary, it's a fine line.

77
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,910
And I decided to,
um,

78
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,640
to create a programmatic area online
where people could see that, um,

79
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,380
those of us who thought museums
are kind of sterile in the rules,

80
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:27,770
I don't understand and am I, am I, you
know, okay to go in, will I fit in? Um,

81
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,600
I created this program where I ran around
the offices and actually got to know

82
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:36,130
my colleagues and made these videos
that expose the fact that art museums,

83
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,310
just like any other office culture
are unique and boring and exciting and

84
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:46,120
everything in between. And
so people started watching
this program, um, you know,

85
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:49,060
they came in through the United
States than other countries.

86
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,360
And so I was doing my job essentially.
Um,

87
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,180
but here's the critique that people had.

88
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,850
Museum board and this was a
corporately structured museum.

89
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,450
They were probably 200 employees.
And, um, there were lots of rules.

90
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,460
And I said working in fun,
they're not mutually exclusive.

91
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,430
And then I showed them why they're not.

92
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,350
So I did launch programs in the museum.
That was part of my job.

93
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,540
I increased revenue streams. So not only
did people come in through the videos,

94
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,690
but they literally wanted to come and
see what was happening in the museum.

95
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,020
I also created a program
called arm wrestling for art.

96
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Crazy where I use my teeny tiny nonprofit
budget to buy an arm wrestling table

97
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,890
cause that makes sense.

98
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,110
And then we put it in the middle of the
museum because the problem I was trying

99
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,600
to solve was who here likes art?

100
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,730
Who here can afford to buy the art that
they really like? All the hands go down.

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,780
And I thought, how do we
democratize the acquiring of art?

102
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:53,950
How do we make art accessible for
everyone? Um, what do museums not do?

103
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,260
They don't give away art.
And so I thought,

104
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:59,620
let's make people sweat it out and
arm wrestle for a piece of art.

105
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,100
That seems fair.
That's how we'd solve the problem as kids.

106
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,170
That's how we're going to do it as adults.
So we increased attendance numbers.

107
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,970
That's my job.
Brand awareness.

108
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:12,400
Everybody started to know about
Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art.

109
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,020
It's a small contemporary art museum,

110
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,990
but it has all of this like new life
and people coming through the doors and

111
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:19,180
through the videos, um, earned media,

112
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:23,440
which anybody in marketing knows is
you pay a lot and then you're like, oh,

113
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:27,430
that didn't have an impact.
We didn't go viral. Okay. Um,

114
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,860
so we just earn it the old fashioned way.
And then you dropped the mic.

115
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,840
Okay. Let's see. So, um,

116
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,930
once upon a time I was giving a talk at a,
uh,

117
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:41,480
a startup week and these
two engineers from, uh,

118
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
American Express came up to me after
my talk. They're all like, oh my God,

119
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,640
that was so cool and creativity in
blah, blah, blah. And they're like, oh,

120
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,840
we want to start an
innovation lab in our company,

121
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,830
but we have no buy in from
our boss. No money, no space.

122
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,760
And nobody thinks it's a good,
what's your solve Tanya?

123
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,500
Oh my gosh. Uh, I'm like totally easy.

124
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,490
I'm going to introduce you to
an artist named meg. Do Good.

125
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,600
So meg lives in Chicago.
She had a dream.

126
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,440
Her dream was to have four walls,
a gallery space. That's it.

127
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,800
She wanted four walls to be able to
put people's artwork in from around the

128
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:21,690
world. She had no money. She was like a
full time artist, no patrons, no space,

129
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,330
no by and no American Express card.
I'm certain.

130
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,170
And here's what she did to
solve that problem. So her,

131
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,040
she didn't have the limiting belief
that the guys at American Express had.

132
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,800
So she created clutch gallery.

133
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,360
It's a 25 square inch space
in the heart of her purse.

134
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,343
No,

135
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,480
it's totally absurd. And
whackamole wonderful. Right?

136
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,800
And so she solved a problem and I'll
show you one of her installations.

137
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:50,670
It's a painting show.

138
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,300
And so it just goes to show you that this,
you know,

139
00:09:57,301 --> 00:10:02,220
had she had the same limiting belief, like
I don't have money, I don't have space,

140
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,390
I don't have buyin, she never would
have created this innovative space.

141
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,190
And artists love the challenge of trying
to create artwork for 25 by 25 square

142
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:12,024
inches.

143
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,803
Okay.

144
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,580
I know. Okay. So who
here went to first grade?

145
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,490
Great. I knew we'd have something in
common. Uh, so I went to first grade,

146
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,860
I was five years old,
which was younger than the kids,

147
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,390
not because I was real smart,

148
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:32,780
but because my parents had sex at a
certain period of time and I was born in

149
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:36,020
September, so there was
no, like, she's so smart.

150
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,340
So I was younger than the other kids
and I was like, I was Super Chubby,

151
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,120
but it was all focused in my belly.
So it was like I had a gut, you know,

152
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,900
and I wore eyeglasses and anybody
wear eyeglasses as a four or five,

153
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:56,180
six year old. Fantastic. We
thought we were really cool. Okay.

154
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,770
My Mom said you're cute,
Tanya.

155
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,580
I felt sophisticated and more
intellectual than my counterparts.

156
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,440
I was ready to rock.

157
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,120
So I get on the school bus for the
first day of first grade and I'm like,

158
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,860
I'm looking good. What? And I've got
my glasses and I'm just rock and roll,

159
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:17,480
you know, like, ah. Um, but there didn't
seem to be any like early adopters of me.

160
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:20,810
That's fine.
And so I get on,

161
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,980
I get on the bus and I see a girl who's
about my age and the bus is about to

162
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,610
take off.

163
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,030
So I slide into one of those pleather
benches and sit next to her and I'm like,

164
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,530
let the day begin. And she looks
me square in the eye and I'm like,

165
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:35,840
I like this assertiveness,
you know?

166
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:40,670
And she's like four eyes.
I know.

167
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:46,210
So every single day of the first week of
school I'd get on the bus and I try to

168
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:48,980
like avoid the child tyrant,
you know,

169
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:53,500
I'd find like a seat over here and somehow
that little menace managed to sneak

170
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:57,380
in and call me four eyes.
And I was like, hmm,

171
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,910
sad and lonely and didn't know what to do.

172
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,080
So I consulted my mom and my mom was like,
Tanya,

173
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,540
four eyes are better than two.

174
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,570
And I'm like, not only does
that little girl suck at math,

175
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,000
but she sucks at life. And
so I was like, great, I'm,

176
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,400
I'm armed and I'm ready to rock and roll.

177
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,120
And so I get on the bus with my newfound
trays and I like sit next to her on

178
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:32,350
purpose and she's like our eyes and I'm
like, four eyes are better than two.

179
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,050
And she said, no, they're not. And I said,

180
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,980
nothing. I had no comeback
at all. The good news is,

181
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:44,090
is that I grew up and oh,
somebody,

182
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,780
I was talking about this story the
other day and somebody is like,

183
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:49,480
what happened to this little girl?
And I'm like, well, you know,

184
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,400
she didn't invent Google glass.
Okay.

185
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,760
And she's not a cofounder of Warby Parker.

186
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,100
But what I've learned over years of
being in the world is that that little

187
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,430
critic is not only on the outside of us,

188
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,431
but a lot of times we have that little
child tyrant on the inside of us.

189
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,770
And also what I've learned is that when
we see her or him or non gender binary

190
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,030
person, um, and we
acknowledge and we say, okay,

191
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:26,950
I see you and we let go. That's super
helpful. And I learned another thing too,

192
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,070
that nobody writes books or
plays or make software for our,

193
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:36,190
about anybody who's perfect,
right?

194
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,070
You wouldn't want to read a
book if everybody like fit in.

195
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,030
It was perfect to be perfect or
to fit in is to be invisible.

196
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,740
And I just didn't want to be invisible.

197
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,320
So that was a really good moment
for me to learn. That's me.

198
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,210
Stop it right now is my mom here

199
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,510
a little,
and I've clearly,

200
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:58,240
I was going to going to audition
for the village people the next day.

201
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:06,100
Oh my gosh. Okay. So at
some point in my career,

202
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:06,960
I,
uh,

203
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,590
I received a phone call from a software
company named acts so soft and they were

204
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:15,130
like, Tanya, we've seen you
performing in presenting around time.

205
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:19,060
We'd like to talk to you about
software. And I'm like, software,

206
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,880
that sounds awesome.
I don't know what they're talking.

207
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,890
I love cashmere.
Uh,

208
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,360
and so I took a leap of faith.
I really do,

209
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,180
but I can't afford it. So, but I go
to secondhand stores and purchase it.

210
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:38,320
Thank you. Okay. So, so, uh, you know,

211
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:42,640
I took a leap of faith and I decided to
meet with this software company and I

212
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:46,330
met with the CEO at the time law
Dan Show Jaya. And she's like,

213
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,090
we really like your energy. That's
why we brought you in. And I'm like,

214
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,680
I like your energy. That's
why I came in. She was like,

215
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,170
but we're not offering you a job.
And I'm like, okay, why am I here?

216
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,570
I don't understand this. And
she's like, but you know,

217
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:59,060
we've always wanted to
have a brand evangelist.

218
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,560
You would make a great evangelist.
And I was like,

219
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,210
that would totally freak
my Jewish mom out. Yeah,

220
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,180
I want to be an evangelist.
Can I get a witness?

221
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,720
And so I started work at this company
and my first day on the job I was like,

222
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,410
what is this magical software was selling?

223
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:26,510
Is it like a tool for telling stories?

224
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,980
Is it a magical paintbrush that
allows artists to make work on wall?

225
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,350
Like what is it? And she was like, oh,

226
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:37,580
it's a BTB project management
software for a software developer.

227
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,590
And I was like, Ah, trapped in
slow motion. Like what are you,

228
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,130
I don't understand that.

229
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,820
And Soon I learned, I didn't
understand a lot of stuff. You know,

230
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:56,540
I would hear people talking
about AI and I was like, oh,

231
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,470
that's when a British person is at
a pub and they ask for more beer.

232
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:05,390
They're like, I, I'd like another
point that's not the case. Uh,

233
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,320
I also heard people talking about, they
were like open source, open source,

234
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,660
open source. And I'm like,
don't kiss that person.

235
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,860
I'm pretty sure that that's no Bueno.

236
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,870
So I had a lot of learning
to do and unfortunately,

237
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:23,600
and fortunately within the first two
months of being there and knowing

238
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,630
absolutely very little about software
and my boss came to a colleague and I and

239
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:32,060
said, we are going to host
a girls in technology event.

240
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,730
It's an inaugural one and I
want to show up in a big way.

241
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,490
So come up with a big idea
around women in technology.

242
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,120
This is April,
2015 just to give some context.

243
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,690
So my colleague and I,
Sarah, we like brainstorming,

244
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,380
came up with nothing. Then, uh, you know,

245
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,040
I went for a little walk and I started
thinking about women in the tech space

246
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:59,720
and women in lots of spaces and how a
lot of times we're not seeing her or

247
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:04,250
celebrated for the superheroes we are.
And so I came up with this symbol.

248
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,390
I didn't come up with her. She's been
around for a long time. The bathroom lady,

249
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:13,180
she's here, she's made an appearance.
I've seen her twice today. Thank you. Uh,

250
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,270
and I knew that the symbol was
immediately recognizable across cultures,

251
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,360
across genders. And uh, I didn't
know anything else. I just had like,

252
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,670
it wasn't even an idea.
It was just a symbol.

253
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,630
And I brought the symbol back
to my colleague and I'm like,

254
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,120
here she is. And my colleagues like,
okay. And that was sort of that,

255
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:38,970
but I couldn't shake the fact that
see the, the shape of her dress, it's,

256
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,620
it's a triangle. And
I thought, Gosh, yeah,

257
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:46,550
it's dress and it looks kind
of like the shape of a cape.

258
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,530
And so I printed the vector and made
a few lines and then I, oh my gosh,

259
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:56,040
you're right there. And,
and then ACC, so soft,

260
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,830
we came up with the campaign,
it was never addressed.

261
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,310
And I'm gonna show you what happened
with it because I think it's important to

262
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:03,750
pay.
Let's see.

263
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,010
When Tanya and Sarah came to
me and they gave me their, um,

264
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,330
their pitch on this idea, I immediately
saw it and I thought, wow, yes,

265
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,800
I completely agree.
This was,

266
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,860
this was big initially I thought of a
symbol that was easily recognizable and I

267
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:28,560
thought if the bathroom lady,
because she's everywhere,

268
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,650
just everywhere in the world,
that lady gets around on.

269
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,890
So I've printed out an image of the
symbol and I took a pencil and started

270
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:42,500
drawing some lines and very
quickly she had a cape on and um,

271
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,260
she was fully present and it was as if
she'd been there this whole time and I

272
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:50,950
just hadn't seen her.
We were at the conference,

273
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:53,470
so we're pretty busy. You
know, we're on social media.

274
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,700
We saw the first tweet and we were
like, wow, this is great. You know,

275
00:18:57,701 --> 00:19:00,610
someone is really
connecting with the image.

276
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,280
And then Huffington Post retweeted it.

277
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,310
I was kind of the beginning of it going
viral and then Bam in 24 American hours

278
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,580
now.
It just blew up.

279
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,640
I think people were very excited to to
see that they march just a symbol of the

280
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:19,190
mundane, but they're actually
a symbol of the extraordinary.

281
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,070
We're trying to create
a community and a forum,

282
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,420
so a woman with telling us about how she
had showed the image to her young son

283
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:29,600
and daughter and then later they had
gone to the restroom and the kids were

284
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:33,110
excited and they said, hey mom, we're
going into the superheroes bathroom.

285
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,680
I thought that's how we measure
success is the next generation.

286
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,610
Now they are seeing things differently
and their perceptions have been shifted.

287
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,030
We started having an overwhelming
request for merchandise. However,

288
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:47,420
we didn't want to commoditize
the conversations that
were taking place on it was

289
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,220
never addressed,
so we thought,

290
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,510
let's start a steamed scholarship with
Asu and we've planned on fueling that

291
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:58,170
scholarship with the motion. Nice. Tonya
was bought into ax off as an evangelist.

292
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,890
And part of the things that she's
phenomenal with his public speaking,

293
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,720
it's only natural for her to be popping
up maybe in your city soon where she

294
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:11,190
will be speaking on this campaign and
I'm helping keep the movement going.

295
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,750
It was never just campaign is really a
story and it's also a proposition for

296
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,790
other people to share their stories.
So yes,

297
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,510
I will be going out into the world and
speaking publicly about it was never

298
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,120
addressed. Um, you can
invite me to your hometown.

299
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,300
There's no crowd that's too small
or too large because if we see women

300
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:32,740
differently, we see the world
differently and we see women differently.

301
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:36,190
We see the world differently.
We see women differently.

302
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,330
We see the world differently.
Ah,

303
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,310
one thing that was really astounding
about this moment in terms of my work life

304
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:04,270
and my creative life merging was my job.
I was embedded in marketing.

305
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,590
I was an evangelist.

306
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,520
My job was to learn the product and to
go out into the world and preach the good

307
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:12,100
word of B2b project management software,

308
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,130
the end and uh,

309
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:19,240
and being presented with this challenge,
right?

310
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,470
Solve a problem that you really
know very little about. Uh, your,

311
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,290
you've been a woman in technology
for two months, do something.

312
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,360
And I really saw that as an opportunity
to use some of the skills that I had

313
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:36,220
developed while as a playwright in theater
school to see and engage in audience

314
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,980
with text, with a story. And I went
above and beyond my job, um, because it,

315
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,970
it was something that was important to do.

316
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,940
And even though I no longer
work for act so soft,

317
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,180
we created this beautiful thing
that's bigger than all of us together.

318
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,640
And something that I write about in
creative trespassing that a lot of people

319
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:58,840
forget is that we have an opportunity
to leave a creative legacy at our,

320
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,674
at our work.

321
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,970
We can leave people in processes in better
shape than when we arrived there and

322
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:05,410
took me a long time to learn that.
I mean,

323
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,920
I definitely had some jobs where I'm
like, you refill your own paper. Ah,

324
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,680
and I was out
ink cartridge,

325
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,000
my pie hole, you know, uh,
and then I left. Right.

326
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,770
And uh, and so I'm really proud of
myself. Then I left this, uh, and,

327
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:27,340
and um, and I think that that's really
important because as we sort of, you know,

328
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:29,480
conflate or,
or like we,

329
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:34,490
we remove the space between work and life
between fun and work that we actually

330
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,530
have all of these opportunities to create.

331
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,770
So I would like to do something
right now. I feel like, um,

332
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,400
we started at the ending. So
let's end at the beginning, right?

333
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,870
And after this I would love to have a
little Q and a. Slash. Conversational.

334
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,210
That's Italian for conversation.

335
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,390
So we're just going to take a moment to
close your eyes and I'm going to lead

336
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:03,430
you through a very
short minds eye journey.

337
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,050
If you've not done a mindsight journey,

338
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,070
all it means is that I will gently guide
you and you just receive. That's it.

339
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,503
So

340
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,250
I want you to imagine one of
your self limiting beliefs.

341
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,820
And by that I mean a belief that you
hold that stops you from having an

342
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:27,930
experiencing more joy,
more creativity,

343
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,230
and pursuing your dreams.
So it could be anything from,

344
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,060
I don't deserve a raise

345
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,263
two,

346
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,960
I can't call myself an artist
or I don't belong here.

347
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,353
Yeah.

348
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,420
So see this self limiting belief.

349
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,920
I want you to gently let it go.

350
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,620
And when you feel like you've let it go,

351
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,230
and this is a longer
process than through snap,

352
00:24:16,231 --> 00:24:19,650
but when you've let it go for now,
I want you to open your eyes.

353
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,660
Okay.
And

354
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,140
now that you've let something go,
there's room to take a leap.

355
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,250
So we're going to stand up.

356
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,870
And uh,
this isn't a big performative gesture.

357
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,920
The most important part about taking
leap is that we're doing it together.

358
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,450
And so it's your, the bend your knees
just a little bit, just slightly. And it,

359
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,830
and again, it's not about jumping
highest, it's just about, yeah,

360
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:15,720
we didn't sign any waivers.
This is a gentle jump.

361
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,260
Um, again, the most important
part is that we do it together.

362
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:21,150
So I'm an account on the count of three,

363
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,340
we're going to gently take a leap
of faith together. Okay. One,

364
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,900
two, three. Awesome.

365
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,910
Thank you so much.

366
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,040
I appreciate it.
See,

367
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,453
I see.

368
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,160
And, um, and also, you know,
here's something I, you know, I,

369
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,053
I'm,
I've,

370
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,280
I've worked really hard and focused to
feel comfortable in front of human beings

371
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,940
and presenting and even I get nervous
sometimes and I'm guessing that all of us

372
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:01,290
get nervous sometimes. And, um, we'll,

373
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,020
you can remember the beginning if you
need a standing ovation from all of us and

374
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:10,100
you, and you can also remember that
when you're leaping into the unknown,

375
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,430
when you're starting a new job,
when you're tackling a new project,

376
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,240
when you're sharing your ideas that
were all leaping with you. Okay.

377
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,450
I think that's helpful
to know. All right. Um,

378
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:24,800
I would love to engage in a little
questions and answers and if you have no

379
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:28,280
questions, I'll ask you questions, but
I don't think you're going to want that.

380
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,760
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm totally
kidding. Uh, oh. It's like, Oh,

381
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:40,050
you're very, very intuitive. Uh,

382
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,290
how do you write a book?
How do you write a book?

383
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,890
This is actually something that I
write about and creative trespassing,

384
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:50,610
whether you're wanting to write a book
or make a career shift or actually try on

385
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,470
a different role,
you start

386
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,140
and, and so, uh, you know,

387
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:05,040
you write a few lines about what
you think the book is about.

388
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:09,390
Maybe you write a few lines about what
you want your next job to look like or

389
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:11,930
what you want your next
project to look like. Um,

390
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,560
and then you leave it for a day and then
you come back a day later and then you

391
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:18,750
don't look at it and you write some more.
Okay.

392
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,380
So this is how I've written this
book and this is how a lot of people,

393
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,550
authors that I know, right,
is they write a little a lot.

394
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,110
You know what I'm saying? And
a lot of people, if you're,
if you're thinking about,

395
00:27:31,111 --> 00:27:35,730
or you already have a practice of
writing in a journal or writing a book or

396
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:39,420
whatever, a lot of times we have this a
self limiting belief that if we don't,

397
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,870
we put ourselves on a schedule.
And if we do not adhere to that schedule,

398
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,200
we will just stop game over.
Uh,

399
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:49,140
and I would suggest to you that you,

400
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,130
even if you mess up your own
schedule that only you gave you,

401
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,800
that you forgive yourself and
continue on. Okay. So do a little,

402
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:03,180
a lot. And also, um, I, I find that
accountability for me personally,

403
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,650
I like to have a sort of my, my personal
board of directors that I'm like,

404
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:10,850
you guys, here's what I'm doing. I
will send you some pages, would you,

405
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,340
I don't need you to read them. I just need
to, you need to know they're coming. Um,

406
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,200
or I need you to read them
and I need some feedback.

407
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:20,910
I need to Beta test these ideas. Very
keen of Beta testing lives and projects.

408
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:25,800
I love it. So yeah, that's
what, that's a little a lot.

409
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,293
Yeah.
Thanks Kate.

410
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,010
I was curious about when you were saying
you were getting criticism around, oh,

411
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:35,040
she's just running around and having
fun and how you felt about that,

412
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:38,670
whether you were just like blew it off
because you have all of that check all

413
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:43,110
those checkboxes of I'm so great.
Or did that feel bad to you?

414
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:47,400
I was curious what you felt. That's a
great question. Um, all of the above.

415
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,810
And I remember actually when that news
was delivered, we were in a, um, uh,

416
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:56,580
an all hands meeting for just the museum
staff and there were like 20 of us

417
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,700
there and my boss sort of
delivered the news of like,

418
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,070
there are people who are really concerned
who find this you problematic. Um,

419
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,780
and he's like, and I want you
to know I got your back. Right?

420
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,520
And then I made a realization
cause it hurt. I mean, human
beings, right? You know,

421
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:12,840
when somebody says,
Hey,

422
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:17,930
all the effort that you're putting
into making this organization better,

423
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,860
um, is not right. You are not doing
it the right way. I felt hurt.

424
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,140
I felt like, oh my gosh, how do I control,

425
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:27,600
this is the only way I know how
to contribute. And La, la La,

426
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,260
it was great that my boss had my back.
Um, and I also learned something that was,

427
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,020
that that was freaky and unexpected,

428
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,340
which was the joy is actually really
confrontational to people who are not

429
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:40,740
choosing to live within a state of joy.

430
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:45,490
And that was both disheartening and
really powerful information. Uh,

431
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,020
yeah. So that's why I sort of
preached the good word of joy, uh,

432
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,620
because it is a mindset and it's
something we can choose even even in rigid

433
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,640
rule-bound environments.
It's really the only thing that we have.

434
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,893
Yeah.

435
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,853
Thank you.

436
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:04,800
Okay.

437
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,880
Um, so how do you deal with the
perception if you've received this,

438
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:13,881
that when you switch projects that people
might think that you're unreliable or,

439
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,270
um, flighty or unfocused?
How do you deal with,

440
00:30:18,271 --> 00:30:22,590
I wrote an entire book all about that. I'm
not, I'm not, I'm being totally sincere.

441
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,470
So for years people would
say, so what do you do? Uh,

442
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:31,650
and I was like, I am curator of
everything, you know, whatever.

443
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:36,770
I just made stuff up until I realized
that if I assessed my skills,

444
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,870
my superpowers,
and understood what those were,

445
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:47,640
then it opened up everything that any,
I could go into any field, any job.

446
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,140
So the clarity comes in knowing what
you're bringing because you bring that to

447
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,080
whatever situation,
you bring that to the supermarket,

448
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,980
you bring that to your family parties,
you bring that to to work.

449
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,620
So the sooner I understood what I brought,

450
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,600
the easier it was for me to leap
into different forms. And, um,

451
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,720
and that's something,
you know,

452
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:11,650
we obviously live in a system and a
society that's very siloed, uh, that,

453
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,400
you know, and we have business
cards to prove that. Right?

454
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,840
You are a developer. You are, you know,

455
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,580
and I remember I was at a conference,
I was,

456
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:25,260
I was speaking to 500 CEOs
and the CEOs here. Great.

457
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,270
Let the jokes rip. So I was, I was, uh,

458
00:31:30,271 --> 00:31:33,000
I was, I was in the back
of the room and there were,

459
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:37,200
and there were 500 seat CIO hose,
all dressed in suits,

460
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:42,120
varying colors from dark blue to black.
And it was a Saturday.

461
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:43,980
So they didn't have to wear suits.
So you know,

462
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:48,981
they were like this and I was in the
back watching the speaker before me and I

463
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,850
was freaking out cause he
was talking about like AI
and I AI and Vr and I'm like,

464
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,800
unless they want a monologue about
like, you know, TMI or UTI or

465
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:05,400
BMW's, I had nothing. I was totally
scared. And to make matters worse,

466
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:10,230
he, he's killing it, right? You know
the, and the, the CEO's are going wild.

467
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:11,064
They're like,

468
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,020
and I'm like, ah, where's the exit?

469
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:21,610
And then the MC grabs the microphone
and he's like, Oh, let's thank Steve.

470
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,750
And then we'd like to welcome to the
stage, Tanya could Katon she is a,

471
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,250
Oh and I'm like, Oh
hell no, I'm not a CIO.

472
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:36,300
Another self limiting belief and
I'm not a CIO.

473
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,820
And then he grabs him like,
and he's like chief inspiration officer.

474
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:42,890
And I was like,
oh my God.

475
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,210
So what I learned from that it,
what I learned from that moment,

476
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,610
and I write about it
because it was so impactful,

477
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,200
is that I thought when people ask you,
what do you do that it meant?

478
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:59,000
What's your job title? But in that
moment I realized, Oh, it's my purpose.

479
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,770
That's what I do.
And,

480
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,050
and the more certain and
comfortable you are with that,

481
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,110
the more you can bring it in. And when
somebody says, what do you do? You know,

482
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:13,340
you can make up a job title. You can
tell them, here's my purpose or sit down.

483
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:15,680
I'm not going to give you
an elevator pitch. You know,

484
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,340
I'm good if you really want to know,
let me share what I do in the world.

485
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,080
So great question.
Thank you.

486
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,760
So for people who may not consider
themselves super creative, Yup.

487
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:30,070
Are there tools or strategies that you
advise to maybe tap into creativity?

488
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:33,440
You mentioned like when
it would be our campaign,

489
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,970
you've figured that out on a walk or
some kind of strategy where maybe we step

490
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:39,920
away from our day to day,

491
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,580
not so creative work to tap
into the creative. Absolutely.

492
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,320
That's a great question.
So first of all,

493
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:49,430
I would like to say that creativity is
defined as really using your imagination.

494
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,430
It's not about making art or painting
or Dakota. You could do that.

495
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,410
The creativity is about
using your imagination.

496
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,480
So one thing that I recommend in
creative trespassing is to ditch school.

497
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,120
Anybody ditch school as a kid.
Yeah,

498
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,020
we learned all the skills we need to
disrupt our patterns and habits that are

499
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:10,550
keeping us stuck. So what I recommend
is that you get up from your desk,

500
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,210
you don't have anything to prove by
working until you're sweating and you're

501
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,920
regretting the job you took. Okay? Nothing
to prove. Get up, take a five minute,

502
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,370
10 minute walk.
Um,

503
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,560
Stanford did a study on walking
and in the impact of creativity.

504
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,450
And it raises your creativity by 60%.
So when you find yourself trapped in,

505
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:33,770
you know, uh, trying to solve a
problem or just stuck in a routine,

506
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,920
get up and go for a walk.
And in fact,

507
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:40,280
there's something called the Museum
of walking that I'm a board member of

508
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,550
and it's true.
And you'll look it up.

509
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,910
And basically the museum
exists outside of the wall.

510
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,120
There are no walls to the museum.
What?

511
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,050
Why don't you Google that
later? Oh my God. I was praying.

512
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,760
I was trying to weave that in
anyway. Um, and then, and then,

513
00:34:58,761 --> 00:34:59,760
and then throughout the,
um,

514
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,320
throughout the book I have these things
called productive disruptions and their

515
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:07,220
exercises because I know
that when we disrupt these,

516
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,630
these holding patterns,

517
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,360
we actually do more work and have more
joy in that state of creating work.

518
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,860
We're cocreating work. Yeah. Thank you.

519
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,510
This work is incredible and you are a
phenomenal speaker and I'm sure you wake

520
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:25,070
up every morning with ideas, but what's
next for you? You've written a book.

521
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:29,450
You're a public speaker. Oh my gosh. Gosh.

522
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:32,870
This is where I think my meditation
practice has messed me up.

523
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,710
What's next is what's now I don't,
I don't know what else to say about that.

524
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,670
What's next is,
is me continuing to speak.

525
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,730
So a lot of companies bring me in to give
talks and teach workshops on how do we

526
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:53,241
use creative skills from maybe theater
or contemporary art to innovate from

527
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,730
within our companies.
I would like to be doing more and more.

528
00:35:56,731 --> 00:36:00,030
I could do that all day. And I think, you
know, a lot of people ask, well, you know,

529
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:02,580
you come from performance, don't you
want to perform again on a stage?

530
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:07,560
And to me the most impactful work is,
is being an outsider on the inside.

531
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,080
And then you quickly realize
when you're like, hey, you guys,

532
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,870
I'll do one of the things
is like I do too. Oh my God,

533
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,250
they're creative trespassers everywhere.

534
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,350
And so my really the end game
with creative trespassing
is to cause a creative

535
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:23,670
revolution inside our bodies,
our minds and our cubicles.

536
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,860
That's all. Thank you. Yeah.

537
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,520
Hi. Hi. Uh, with the theme
of International Women's Day
being bounced for better,

538
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:40,440
uh, can you talk about what balance means
for you? Ah, sleeping eight hours. Um,

539
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,400
I, you know what, so as in my
introduction, you, you learned,

540
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:49,200
I actually have gone through cancer
two times. One when I was 21,

541
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,580
one was when I was 31 years old.
And, um, and when you've endured a,

542
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,270
an illness or if you're
living with an illness, uh,

543
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,280
you are painfully aware of the body
and the mind and the connection or the

544
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:04,470
moments when one wants to
disconnect because it's,

545
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,290
it's painful and uncomfortable.
And after,

546
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,720
and during those two bouts of cancer,

547
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,170
I realized I needed to
take care of myself.

548
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,100
So even though I'm sort of on book tour
and I'm going back and back, and then, um,

549
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:17,551
what,
uh,

550
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:22,551
how I care for myself is I eat well and
I'm open to dinners being paid for by

551
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:28,320
anyone, then I better, uh, I eat well.

552
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:28,800
Um,

553
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I try to walk every day and I say try
because sometimes I'm limited in time.

554
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,100
Um, but even then I literally will walk
around like a hotel parking lot. I,

555
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,610
my body feels better when it's walked.
Uh,

556
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:45,660
and also I meditate and,
um, that makes me really,

557
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,890
that makes me consider what's in front
of me rather than what's ahead of me.

558
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,490
And I think that's really important
because if I'm not occupying this space

559
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:56,340
right here and right now, I'd actually
don't know what's going to be next.

560
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:00,630
I won't be open to what's next and I
want to be open. So yeah, that's it.

561
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,380
Great question. Thank you.
Um, first of all, great talk.

562
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,260
Thank you so much for sharing
your story with us. Uh,

563
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,560
I do feel like you have
the answers for everything,

564
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,870
but I wanted to know,

565
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,670
did you ever at expedience self doubt
in each of your journeys and if yes,

566
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:22,650
how did you combat that? Oh yes,
all the time. And in fact, what,

567
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:22,980
just,

568
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,850
I'll go with the first thing that popped
into my head when I started my job at

569
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:30,360
the museum. I le, I mean I don't
have an art history background.

570
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:34,620
I've never been a curator. Like I
was the weirdest choice for that job.

571
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,960
And so I was freaking out the day
before and a n I combated it by saying,

572
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,190
what do I wear?
How do I look rd?

573
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,880
How do I look like I work
in a museum because my big,

574
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,230
my big self limiting belief, since
I was little until now, it was,

575
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,350
I don't fit in.
I don't belong here.

576
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,980
That has been a refrain in the past.
So I'm aware of that.

577
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,970
And so what I do is I, the same
thing I've learned in theater school,

578
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,450
you have to see an audience,
you have to listen to an audience,

579
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,660
you have to decide what you're
going to give to an audience.

580
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,460
And I don't mean this
in a performative way,

581
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:11,590
I mean this thing like an
interpersonal. So I'm like, okay,

582
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:12,424
they're contemporary art.

583
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,580
So I just sort of assessed the situation
and thought I will wear a blue shirt

584
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,070
and an orange blazer and red
glasses and some funky sneakers.

585
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,380
Yes,
I looked like a cartoon character,

586
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,600
but I made me feel like I was
embodying the spirit of art.

587
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,560
So that's what I do and I do.
And so,

588
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:39,270
and also I was recently
telling a story in front of a,

589
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,100
for the moth in front
of 2000 human beings.

590
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,870
And I hadn't done a storytelling in that
form. And I was scared, super scared.

591
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:51,130
So here's what I did in that situation,
I'm about to go on and I say to myself,

592
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,680
Tanya, if you pass out,
you don't have to go on

593
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,100
creative trespassing,
you know?

594
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,380
And so this is something
I've learned from one of, uh,

595
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,390
one of my teachers and from reading and
watching her Pema Chodron is that when

596
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:11,080
you were experiencing fear, it's sort
of the last thing on our list to do,

597
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:15,100
to like embrace it. Right? Um,
and she's like, go into it,

598
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:19,270
go into a barrel head first into
fear, and then you realize, oh,

599
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,850
it's not so bad. I see. I
came out on the other side.

600
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:23,920
We always come out on the
other side, you know, that.

601
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,860
And that's why the leap of faith is
important. The middle part, you're like,

602
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,310
but you always know that
you're going to land right?

603
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,080
And that it's going to be more than okay.
So that's what I do.

604
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,930
Hey.
Um,

605
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:40,810
so it's really cool to hear about how
confident you are and like your purpose

606
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,940
and what you bring to the table.
Um,

607
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,210
and you've talked about like how it's
important to be grounded in that.

608
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:49,660
How do you get to that point though,
if you could talk to them? Yeah,

609
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:52,800
that's an awesome question.
So first of all, um, the,

610
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,840
the way in which we write books,
the way in which we live lives,

611
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:00,280
all of it is a practice. I approach it
as a practice. I'm not the only one.

612
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:04,540
There's a practice of meditation,
a doctors practice medicine, right?

613
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,320
We, those who play
instruments practice. Okay?

614
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:13,300
So when we think about it as a
practice, uh, and if it's a practice,

615
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,810
guess what? It's never going to be
perfect, right? It's a practice.

616
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,730
So if we think of, of sort of building
skills around, I want to be more curious.

617
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:24,280
I want to meet more
confident as practicing.

618
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,520
I'm going to try on what confidence looks
like or feels like to me today. Okay.

619
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:30,010
That didn't work.
That's okay.

620
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,710
But one moment within that I did feel
a little confident. Then your rubber,

621
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,140
you then you try it again the
next day and then the next day.

622
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,740
And then what happens is
something I learned in theater,
which is muscle memory,

623
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,440
guess what?
Your body knows what to do.

624
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,580
It shows up without your
mind messing things up. Okay.

625
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,570
So you have to practice embodying
what it is you want to be,

626
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,400
what you and how you want to be in
the world every day a little bit.

627
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,270
Is that helpful?
Okay.

628
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,530
And I think we're going to
take two more questions. Okay.

629
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,390
Um,

630
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,410
how did you come to find your purpose
and what tools did you use and which ones

631
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:13,280
did you like most of all?
So I've,

632
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,430
I've written about this because
it's taken me a, you know,

633
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,600
lots of tools and in creative trespassing,
uh,

634
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:23,930
an exercise that I have is,
it's called write your fight song.

635
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,700
But really it's a manifesto. Who here
knows who manifesto is? Yeah, it's a,

636
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,490
it's a powerful declaration
of your purpose, of,

637
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:35,360
of your why and your how. Like, yes,

638
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:39,740
I declare this and here's how I'm going
to actually do something about it.

639
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:44,120
So it's not passive, it's
active. Uh, and so I've found my,

640
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,820
I say per Pi,
cause I don't think we have one purpose.

641
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:49,640
And I think that this is
also one of those systems,

642
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:53,000
silo traps we find ourselves in.
And I've definitely found myself,

643
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,210
like I majored in theater.
How come I can't get a job in theater?

644
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,510
I have no purpose and seen,
nope.

645
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:05,720
Using my degree. Um, and I,
I've often found myself in that,

646
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:10,430
in that trap. And then I realized,
Oh wait, my purpose is what?

647
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,440
And another indicator is what really
enlivens you when you're in the act of

648
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:20,090
doing it. Right? So if you are
coding and you're like, Holy Shit,

649
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:24,650
this is so awesome, this feels good. And
every fiber or you're a problem solver,

650
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:29,300
you're a presenter and you're like, I like
people. I like when they ask questions.

651
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,350
Those are all indicators
of your purpose. So, uh,

652
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:38,150
I guess by the book and do
the exercise. Um, and also,

653
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,200
and also, um, just know that
you monitor, you're the,

654
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:45,380
you're the conductor of
the experiment of view.

655
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,910
And so you can be aware of situations
where you feel like this makes me feel

656
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:54,680
alive and it enlivens those around me.
Maybe this is one of my purposes.

657
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,370
Yeah, great question. Thank
you. Okay. We had a super quick,

658
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:01,700
we had a creative trespasser question.
Didn't need a microphone. Love that.

659
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,950
How often do I burst into song?
Like in my daily life?

660
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,320
Oh, well I am known far and
wide as the monotone wonder.

661
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,410
So I don't typically, um, uh, but uh,

662
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,440
I burst into song always when I'm on
a road trip by myself and I'm like,

663
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,173
um,

664
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,390
because I had all the right notes
when it's just an audience of me,

665
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,000
but I dance,
I dance all the time.

666
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:37,700
So like in supermarkets and conferences
and things like that, just, yeah,

667
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,550
inadvertently even sometimes.
I'm like, what? That's awesome.

668
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:47,280
Thanks for asking. I was totally
rooting for you with your employer,

669
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:50,220
the month video and I was curious if
he actually won employee of the month.

670
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,180
Beautiful. Yeah. Okay. So again, my,

671
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,010
my intention with,

672
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:59,430
with doing these videos was to
actually get to know my colleagues,

673
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:04,350
engage them in a playful manner and
tick things off the boxes of my job.

674
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,740
And what happened was, and you know,
I've received that feedback of like,

675
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,950
you're not a good hire, Tonya Katon
get rid of her a lot of lot. Um,

676
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,330
I got an email and you do you
ever get that ominous email?

677
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:18,780
That's everyone all employees
meet in the boardroom.

678
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,210
I received an email from HR that
was that. And I was like, oh my God.

679
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,680
And so I kind of like slowly walked in,
I walked in the room,

680
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,900
everybody was seated there
and very like stiff. And um,

681
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,970
all of a sudden the head of HR said,
Tanya,

682
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,630
we'd like to present you with something
and a video camera comes up and they

683
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:43,080
present me with this big plaque
that says, oh, most employee.

684
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:54,350
And, and to me that's the best
metric for succeeding, you know,

685
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,200
is that not only are they connecting to,

686
00:45:57,201 --> 00:46:00,110
but they're also engaging
in play and creativity.

687
00:46:00,111 --> 00:46:03,470
So that was a really wonderful
moment. Thank you for asking. Yeah.

688
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,970
Well,
thank you so much for having me.

689
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,540
Appreciate it.
