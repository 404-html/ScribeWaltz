1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,090
Hi everyone. I'm Kathy Chen and I am
a product manager here in Cambridge.

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:12,900
Um,

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,820
I just wanted to kind of express how
excited I am to bring Debbie here to

4
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,230
Cambridge to talk to all of us.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,240
I'm actually a Grad Student at Columbia
University full time in a master's

6
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,480
degree program in something
called organizational psychology.

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,930
And one of the things that we cover
there is a leadership and a lot of things

8
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,160
around gender,
also negotiations.

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,900
So I've had the privilege of having
a Debbie as a lecturer for my, uh,

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,793
for my course.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,340
And so my class actually ranges
from people who are politicians,

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:47,760
uh,

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,960
like there's a mayor of a small town in
Connecticut all the way through like a

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,790
chief of staff to a senator.

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,660
And then there's other people who
are like chief of it for a hospital,

16
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:01,950
that kind of thing. And even then in that
class, like a very experienced people,

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,960
everybody learns something
about negotiations when
Debbie was there. So, uh,

18
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:07,980
another day during class,

19
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:11,940
Debbie Ashley talked a little bit more
about diversity and leadership training.

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,690
And so I'm really pleased to have her
here. To talk a little bit about both. Um,

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,840
Debbie is a Deloitte Ellen
Gabriel professor for women
in leadership and Marita.

22
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,800
She doesn't look retired,

23
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:27,801
but she is and a distinguished research
fellow at the center for Gender in

24
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,140
organizations at Simmons
schools management.

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,200
And for those of you who don't
know much about Simmons, but the,

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,320
the center is actually funded by the
Ford Foundation from 1991 and 94.

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,650
Debbie was executive director of the
program on negotiation at Harvard law

28
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:48,651
school and she currently is a senior
fellow of the PR of that program where she

29
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:51,750
co-directs the negotiations
at the workplace project.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,950
She's also an adjunct professor at NC,
at business school in Fontainebleau,

31
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:56,784
France.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,800
Debbie runs women's executive leadership
programs for places like Time Warner

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,980
and Deloitte and Deutscha bank and using
what she's observed about executives

34
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,550
there and these leadership programs.

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,790
Debbie is integrated those
stories into this book.

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,120
So the book is based on
women's real life examples.

37
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,140
She's also written many books and articles
about conflict and mediation and is

38
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,160
an authority on negotiation.

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,420
So today she's here to talk about her
fourth book on negotiations and gender.

40
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,320
And if you want more information about
those other books that she's written,

41
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:35,760
you can find her bio and the website
link on, go negotiating at work.

42
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,860
There's also a dory there if you have
questions and she's gonna talk for about

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,530
half an hour and then take questions
at the end. So with no further ado,

44
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,364
here's Debbie.
Cool.

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,140
Thank you. Kathy. Can you
hear me? God, this is hard.

46
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:55,800
The lightest right in my
eyes. Um, so let me, I'm,

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm delighted actually to be here in
preparation. Read the book about Google,

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,270
um,
by your former CEO and Jonathan Rosenberg.

49
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,140
And I can tell you in negotiation is an
important part of work there. It seemed,

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,333
it seemed to me.

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,010
So let me just place this book in context
before I sort of talk about some of

52
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,200
the principles of negotiation
that are in the book.

53
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,030
So I've written a lot of books about
negotiation on the one that was most, uh,

54
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,280
well known was something called the
shadow in negotiation. And in that book,

55
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:30,700
what I did was I looked at, you
know, we know about getting to, yes,

56
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,590
I'm about the principles of mutual gains,
negotiation in the shadow negotiation.

57
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:40,120
And I talked about the
relationship building
relationships and how you advocate

58
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,120
for yourself and connect with others.

59
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,640
And so that book has done quite well.

60
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,980
They came out in paperback in
it with a different title. Um,

61
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,030
but through my leadership
development activities,

62
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,330
both leadership programs for
women but also more generally.

63
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:58,570
So Kathy's program is obviously
a mixed a mixed group.

64
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,930
I really started to see how experienced
leaders manage some of the challenges of

65
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:10,990
internal and negotiation. And the actual
motivation for this book came from,

66
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,490
I teach a PR, I run a
program in Chicago, um,

67
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,610
that brings people from different
companies for our several module program.

68
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:21,280
I'm the academic advisor
and I teach in it.

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,370
And at the end of one of these programs,
when you know,

70
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,860
you're saying goodbye to everybody
and everybody's hugging and kissing,

71
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,020
this woman came up to me and she said,

72
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,680
the negotiation module
changed my life thinking, wow,

73
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,070
that's really pretty terrific.
There must be a story here.

74
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,560
And so she told me her story.

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,660
And from that understood from that sort
of her sending me in setting this idea

76
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,310
in motion about stories,

77
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,670
I started to collect stories
from experienced practitioners.

78
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,850
So this is a book about stories,
Mex experienced practitioners.

79
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:55,300
I've done a lot of work on this
topic before I've interviewed,

80
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,520
but this is a different
book because it's got these,

81
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,770
it's got these stories in
it from practitioners. So
let me ask you a question.

82
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,930
Um,
how many of you would describe yourself?

83
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:11,050
So this is a question I always ask at the
beginning of a leadership program that

84
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,690
I teach in negotiation.
I asked the question,

85
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,900
how many of you would describe yourself
as successful in dealing with clients,

86
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:24,550
customers, suppliers, places
where you are acting as an agent,

87
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,440
either for your group or for Google.

88
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,950
How many of you would describe
yourself as successful in that? Okay.

89
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,750
And then I can ask,
I have no way of verifying this.

90
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,820
What makes you successful? So
what makes you successful? Yeah.

91
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,281
Yeah.

92
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:46,120
So being positioned to his competition
recently or your goals and what makes you

93
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:47,860
get into a position to accomplish that.

94
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,860
Okay, so you build relationships
with people externally.

95
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,030
What else makes you successful? What?
What makes you when you act as an agent?

96
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,533
Yeah,

97
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,823
you're nice.

98
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,210
What does that mean? Nice.
You're collaborative,

99
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,090
you're willing to make concessions.
What does nice mean

100
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,693
to,

101
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,170
okay, so you're a good listener, right?

102
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,490
You're trying to find some kind of
agreement that both of you are happy with.

103
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,510
So that means nice.
What else makes you successful?

104
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,943
Yeah.

105
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,960
Right?

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,860
So knowing the right people being
very well, people always say,

107
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,390
I'm very well prepared. I know the right
people. I know what they're likely to do.

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,560
I'm very well prepared under
those circumstances. I listened.

109
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,370
I look for mutual gains
agreements, I think, I assume
that's what's behind. Nice.

110
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,390
Um,

111
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,950
and so then I asked the question
that's negotiating as an agent,

112
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:59,330
what I call this capital
letter and negotiation. And
then I asked the question,

113
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,980
what's different when you're
negotiating for yourself?

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,790
You're not an agent.
You're what we call a principal.

115
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,510
So what's different when you negotiate
for yourself? What's different?

116
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,690
Nothing.
It's the same,

117
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,633
sorry,

118
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,930
not so clear. How you can discover
what's mutually beneficial.

119
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:31,430
It might depend on the situation.
What else is different?

120
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,503
Yeah.

121
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,580
People reacted differently when they see
someone asking for something on behalf

122
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,260
of mothers versus for themselves.
Right?

123
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,460
Of course. What did they see? So w so what
do they see and then what do you feel?

124
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,820
Even if you don't feel it, it's easy
to feel like, oh, I shouldn't be asking

125
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,103
people just to see it.

126
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,000
They serve,

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,860
they see and so they see it differently
and you sort of incorporate that a

128
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:58,420
little bit. You can feel a little bit
greedy asking. Right. And so could make,

129
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:01,250
it might make negotiation a little
bit more emotional. What else?

130
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,950
Bothering people. It's just sort of
much harder in negotiating with this,

131
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:17,690
what I call this sort of lower
case in negotiations. You know,

132
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:21,800
it's hard to get negotiations started.
We don't have a structure for doing it.

133
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,180
It's often hard to figure out what
you want in this context. You know,

134
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,550
if you're in, when you're a
capital letter and negotiation,

135
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:31,790
it's pretty clear about what you're
going after. You might change your ideas,

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,450
but when you're negotiating for yourself,
sometimes it's hard to do that.

137
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,030
It might be hard to stay
in the negotiation. Yeah.

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,830
When you say lower case n negotiation,

139
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,010
the parties being individuals,

140
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,640
are you referring to where one of them
is an individual or the other one is

141
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:50,690
actually an organization?

142
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,610
I'm actually thinking about your,
you could be negotiating a,

143
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:59,010
what's an of you is an little
end negotiation negotiating
with an organization.

144
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,340
Well for example,
negotiating a salary

145
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,120
with your superior as an individual.

146
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,470
You're negotiating with them
as representative of the Lord.

147
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,370
But that's, but the is it?
But it manifests itself as
an individual negotiation.

148
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:15,880
Right.

149
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,020
The position I take is
they are representing the
total organization and when

150
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:22,930
they respond to what you asked for,
that's what they're representing.

151
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:26,590
But it actually is two individuals
actually sitting down and negotiating.

152
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,143
Is that right?

153
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,801
How would that be?

154
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,320
Any different from an upper gives
a negotiation breaks dope too.

155
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,520
Well, cause I I that's what I'm
asking you. It's a difference.

156
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,910
I would think so because,

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,990
because in New York in the first
situation it capital end negotiation,

158
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,440
you are a representative, right?
Negotiating with a representative, right?

159
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,620
And lowercase n negotiation,

160
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,520
you're negotiating on behalf of
yourself as an individual and you might

161
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,600
negotiate with somebody who
is representing something
else, but you're the agent.

162
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,740
And so is it different? Right. And also,

163
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,670
I guess what I'm trying to ask is that
are you distinguishing the two cases

164
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:09,510
where you as an individual and negotiating
with an organization versus you as an

165
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:10,760
individual? I haven't. I'm,

166
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,020
I'm distinguishing when you are
negotiating on behalf of yourself,

167
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,220
that's the key. I don't care who
you're negotiating with, God,

168
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,740
it could actually be, you know, buying a
car. It could be a little end negotiation.

169
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:25,620
You negotiate it with a car dealership,
but you want the best price and it's you,

170
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,710
right? Unless you're negotiating on
behalf of your parents, your children,

171
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,440
your spouse or somebody,
you're negotiating as a principal.

172
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,120
So the thing that's important to me
is who you are in those negotiations.

173
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,390
We'll also talk about who the other
person or the person is as well.

174
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,540
So let me ask you some questions about
what kinds of little end negotiations do

175
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:46,590
you have at Google.

176
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,520
What do you negotiate about when you're
negotiating for yourself at Google?

177
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,110
What kinds do you have? Who gets assigned
to bug? Who gets assigned to a bug?

178
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,470
Okay, so work, right? What else?

179
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,260
And you have a preference
about that or not, right?

180
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,260
What'd you say? You don't
want to get it right. Okay.

181
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,380
What else do you negotiate about
little end negotiations at Google?

182
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,060
Yeah, involvement or growth
opportunities. Career Development,

183
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:23,400
growth opportunities.
Those are negotiations.

184
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,740
You're trying to get sort
of things that you can do.

185
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:29,220
That's a little end negotiation. It's
you're negotiating on behalf of yourself.

186
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,320
What else do you negotiate for a desk?
A desk to sit.

187
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,720
Okay.
I didn't really think about that,

188
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:39,870
but I guess that that would be true
and that's where to sit. What else?

189
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,110
Also a flexible work arrangement.
Sex that will work.

190
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:47,040
Arrangements can be and can be that as
well. So I think as we go through this,

191
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,030
it would be useful for you.

192
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:53,031
Have in your mind a little end negotiation
that you might be struggling with so

193
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:55,600
that as we talk about it,
you might be able to think about it.

194
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,290
So what I want to do is add gender to
our story of little end negotiations.

195
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,780
And I want to say a few things, you
know, so we have a class here, you know,

196
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:08,770
gender is not just about women.
Uh, it's an I and I'm not,

197
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:09,610
when I talk about gender,

198
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:11,920
I'm not talking about the
differences between men and women.

199
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,310
I'm talking about what we call second
generation gender issues that his policies

200
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,280
and practices and culture that on its
face looks natural and neutral but can

201
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:29,710
have differential impacts on men and women
and different groups of men and women.

202
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,400
And I always like to say when we
talk about women in these issues,

203
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,870
I always like to say it's like the Canary
in the mine that we sort of understand

204
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,900
some of the issues that might
be effecting a minority group,

205
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:45,901
which is true in a Google might have
implications for the majority group as

206
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:46,630
well.

207
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,080
So one of the ways we like to talk about
what it means to have to talk about

208
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:54,340
second generation gender issues is
to use the example of the US Capitol.

209
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,780
So the US capital was built in the 18
hundreds and of course when they built it,

210
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,590
they had no ladies rooms because
they had no ladies. Right.

211
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,360
And in 1917 the first woman was elected
to the US House of Representatives.

212
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,190
And in 1932 the first two,

213
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:17,191
the Senate prior to 1962 con Congress
women shared a single bathroom far from

214
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:23,791
the chamber even though there were many
in the house in 1992 the women senators

215
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:29,971
were given restrooms on the same floor
as the Senate Chamber Chamber in 2011

216
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,700
forestall bathrooms were put in the house.

217
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,380
And in 2013 they actually put women's
restrooms in the Senate and near the

218
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,840
Chamber when there were 20 women senators.

219
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,610
And so the idea is that nobody was
doing this explicitly to discriminate.

220
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,610
It just was, there were no women.
And so they weren't room for,

221
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,060
there wasn't need for women's restrooms.

222
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,450
And that sort of the idea about
second generation gender issues,

223
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,200
that is they are,
um,

224
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,250
they come into existence because they fit
the lives and the work style a certain

225
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:07,500
majority group. And we don't sort
of think about how it works, um, uh,

226
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,430
for people that aren't in that majority.

227
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,390
So I want to give you some examples
about we're negotiation comes in there.

228
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,550
The first is people are offered
jobs that they don't want to take,

229
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,170
like fix the bug, right? And
you're expected to say yes.

230
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,720
And so what are some of those?
Well,

231
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,310
in financial service organization is
often the case that women get assigned

232
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,540
managerial operational jobs that
is run the office, run the country.

233
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,970
And there's not a lot of value to that.

234
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:41,710
It's obviously the value isn't
sales in financial services or in a,

235
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,780
in a,
in a,

236
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,720
a major manufacturing company I know of
women get channeled into human resource

237
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:49,270
roles because the idea, the belief
is, or they're an operations,

238
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,770
which is really the privilege place,

239
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,650
they won't be able to manage it because
of work and family issues or in, uh,

240
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:58,970
in professional services firms, women
often get put in a chief of staff roles,

241
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,510
right?

242
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,510
And the key thing there is you're asked
to do something you might not want to do

243
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:05,180
it.

244
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,130
And so the key is how you negotiate to
make it fit with what you want to do.

245
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,070
The second is we have outdated
job criteria so that, um, uh,

246
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:18,170
often, uh, people aren't on the screen.

247
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:21,740
So somebody mentioned
negotiating for opportunities
and that's one of the things,

248
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,570
um, there, so in one organization,
people, people say we have higher,

249
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:29,090
like me,
at a certain level in an organization,

250
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,490
people don't know exactly what
they're looking for in leadership.

251
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,030
So the best thing is let's let me find
someone who looks just like me, right?

252
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,270
And so if you don't fit that,
if you don't look just like that,

253
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,800
it's up to you to negotiate for that
opportunity. I do a lot of work in Africa.

254
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,040
Um, and a story about this
woman lived in rural Nairobi.

255
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,600
She's a phd scientist and all of the work
with the important work was in Nairobi.

256
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,170
But nobody ever offered her an opportunity
because they assumed she wouldn't

257
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:55,004
move,

258
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,360
that she wouldn't leave her family that
was in rural rural Kenya or another

259
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:03,350
woman who was picked up work that when
her boss left and was actually doing the

260
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:06,020
work of a vice president,
and she did it for three months,

261
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:09,800
but nobody thought to offer her the
actual role. So she had to negotiate it.

262
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,720
Women often get asked to
do more invisible work.

263
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,020
It was just a column in the New York
Times by Sheryl Sandburg and Adam Grant

264
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:20,630
about women housework at work asked,

265
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:24,520
being asked to do things like
mentor other people. You know,

266
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,730
I think this happens for people who are
different as well. Diversity Mentor,

267
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:32,210
other people run a run
a, uh, group, um, uh,

268
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:33,920
beyond the diversity committee.

269
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,150
All those kinds of things that are extra
work and their presumed that you will

270
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:39,890
do it.
It's invisible work.

271
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,890
And so part of the challenge
there is to negotiate value.

272
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,400
And one of the things that we know is
that when people do invisible work and

273
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:49,020
actually has a benefit for organizations,
um,

274
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,780
and so we have to claim value for that
integrating work and family. Right?

275
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,820
So somebody said flexible
work arrangements.

276
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:58,610
Well it isn't just flexible
work arrangements. It sort of,

277
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,250
we have this vision of
the ideal worker and boy,

278
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,860
the ideal worker at
Google is alive and well.

279
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:06,970
I think you're supposed to be
there all the time. Right? Um, the,

280
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:08,900
the heroic stories in this book,

281
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,770
we're about people who
worked long weekends and long
nights to do all the work.

282
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:15,290
So if you have family responsibilities,

283
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,700
that becomes sort of an issue in the
way is how do you negotiate to make that

284
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:23,210
work? One of my favorite stories is
about this woman who was in procurement,

285
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:27,650
in oil and gas. And to get
promoted, you had to relocate.

286
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,490
And this situation to Ghana,
and she had a family,

287
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:33,350
she didn't want to live
in Ghana for three years,

288
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,450
but what she was able to negotiate was
sort of a commuting relationship so that

289
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:40,910
she was in Indiana for
a few weeks at a time.

290
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:43,160
And then we'd come back
to Dallas and go back.

291
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:48,161
So negotiating to make work arrangement
work in the face of expectations about

292
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:52,830
the ideal worker. And the final
thing is about mandate for change.

293
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,670
So by there's this research, uh,
that's about the glass cliff.

294
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,560
And here's the story.

295
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,580
The story is that when
organizations are not doing well,

296
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,080
the likelihood that a woman is going to
be put in a senior leadership role goes

297
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:09,570
up, right? Think Melissa Mayer.

298
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,520
Think Mary Barra at General Motors.
Think Meg Whitman at Hewlett Packard.

299
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,560
And so the glass cliff means that
you're put in charge of these risky

300
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,420
enterprises. And I guess the reason it's
called a glass cliff is if you succeed,

301
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:25,890
great. If not, you're off the cliff.

302
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,600
But the idea is when you take on
one of these risky, uh, risky roles,

303
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,860
you need to negotiate for
support so that you're a,

304
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,160
so if it doesn't do all that well,
you're a, you're sort of protected.

305
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,040
So when I want to do is
talk about three challenges,

306
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:45,180
I've sort of spent a lot of
time talking about the context.

307
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,560
Someone talking about three things,

308
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,370
getting negotiations off the
ground because the structure
doesn't look the same

309
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,500
in little end negotiations,

310
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,460
get their situation that is really
trying to understand where they're coming

311
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:59,970
from and dealing with resistance,
their resistance to change.

312
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,630
So getting no growth. Here's the,
here's the challenge. Excuse me,

313
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:11,360
I'm here to talk about sources of my
project. Yeah. Later. Uh, so negotiations,

314
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,010
little end negotiations don't
have a structure, right?

315
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,760
You have to construct
them out of whole cloth.

316
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,820
So what are some of the ways you'd
get negotiations off the ground?

317
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,340
There are two major ways that
we write about in the book.

318
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,520
There are others as well. The first
one is to make your value visible.

319
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
People negotiate with you because you
have something they want and you need to

320
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:40,401
make it visible in what we call
a currency that matters to them.

321
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,450
So it isn't just that you work hard.

322
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:44,910
It's what they think about
that matters to them.

323
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,330
That makes a difference because
you're trying to build in some kind of

324
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:51,360
reciprocity that is,
you're trying to get them to the table.

325
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,870
So let me tell you a story.
This is about a woman.

326
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:58,020
She was a director of external
relations at a very large man,

327
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,580
Midwest manufacturing company.

328
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,240
And she was asked by people in
another division. They were, uh,

329
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,350
they were the legislative division to
help save a really important client that

330
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:11,880
they had at the state level.
Um,

331
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,950
they were about to lose the client
and it was going to be a very big, um,

332
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,570
it was going to be, this is a
company that supplies, um, uh, uh,

333
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,100
resources, you know, uh,

334
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,110
all kinds of equipment and stuff to
come to companies and businesses and

335
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,950
buildings, a stuffer
buildings. And so she did it.

336
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,250
She helped,
she saved this client.

337
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,420
She got huge amount of Kudos
presented to the board, the CEO,

338
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,870
it was terrific. But then they
kept asking her to keep doing it.

339
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,610
They would call her up and they would say,

340
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,550
we need your help again in another state.
And you know,

341
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,740
she really liked to
help so she would help.

342
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,800
But she found that she was spending a lot
of time doing this work and it was not

343
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:58,384
her job.

344
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
So the first thing that she did is she
goes to her boss and she tries to make

345
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:04,480
her value visible in a
currency that matters to him.

346
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,860
So she talks about how
she cost her contribution,

347
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,190
how much time she's
spending and what it costs.

348
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,900
And then she talks about what she's the,

349
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,690
how she's really saved the client,
what a benefit it has been.

350
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,560
So she makes her value visible in what
she thinks is a currency that has value.

351
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,850
And he says it's terrific,
but the time isn't right.

352
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,050
You need to be patient.
So the second,

353
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,000
so that's making your value
of it didn't actually work.

354
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,070
So the second is using your leverage and
what do we mean by your leverage? Well,

355
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:42,070
there's a concept in negotiation.
Probably many of you know it. I mean,

356
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:45,040
I think of a lot of, you've taken
negotiation courses here at Google.

357
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,670
The concept of Batna.
Everybody know Batna. Yeah.

358
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:52,030
You know your best alternative to a
negotiated agreement. You asked herself,

359
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,110
what happens if I can't reach agreement
here? What am I going to be forced to do?

360
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,210
What are they going to be forced to do?
So in her situation,

361
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,000
her Batna,
I is what?

362
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,520
What's our alternative?

363
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:11,290
If she can't get her boss to negotiate
what's her Bandana is actually to stop

364
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,530
doing the work for this other group.

365
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,790
But she does it in a way that we
call smoothing out your Batna.

366
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:23,680
So it isn't so abrupt or so threatening.
Maybe.

367
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,380
So the first thing that she
does is she uses question.

368
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:31,390
She goes to this other group. The next
time they ask her and she says, you know,

369
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,210
this is really taking too much of my time.
I'm really concerned.

370
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,260
How will you handle this
if I don't do it right?

371
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,660
So she's letting them know
about her alternative,

372
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:45,760
but she's doing it in a way that's
very engaging. And so they say, well,

373
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,290
there is somebody that's
supposed to be handling,

374
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,880
but that person doesn't
do a very good job,

375
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:53,770
so I don't think it would really
work for us. We really do need you.

376
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,620
Then she says to them, let's focus
on the purpose. I always like to say,

377
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:02,650
you want to connect what's good for you
to what's good for the organization.

378
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,950
And so she talked to them about why it
would be good for her to have this work

379
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,920
as part of her job. And they
say, right, it would be.

380
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,720
And so they become her ally and
they go to her boss and they say,

381
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,500
we really need, this woman's name was
Isabelle. We need Isabelle to do this.

382
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,990
And that gets her boss to the table.

383
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,550
So she gets him to the table,
they reorganize her job.

384
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,490
She now has the legislative
part of part of her work.

385
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,390
And the key thing was is that she used
her alternative with somebody else who

386
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:37,540
could act as an ally for her.
So I'm interested,

387
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,020
do you have problems getting people to
the table and what kinds of things have

388
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:41,854
you used?

389
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,280
What are some of the things you've used
to get people to the table to negotiate

390
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:51,050
with you? So yes, in a salary negotiation,
I used an offer from another company,

391
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,620
right? So you know there's a really
interesting way to do that. I call it,

392
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,690
we call him the Bobi called
smoothing out your Batna.

393
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,650
So one things you can say is,
I have this other offer, right?

394
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,170
But the other thing you can say is this
is that's just letting you know your

395
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,930
Batna, smoothing out your Batna.
Say I had this other offer,

396
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,070
but I'd much rather stay at Google. Right?
So you let them know about your Batna,

397
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:16,070
but you do it in a very
engaging kind of way.

398
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,000
And I think this idea about smoothing
out your Batna is a really nice,

399
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,110
a nice concept.
It lets people know you have alternatives,

400
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,680
but you do it in a way that I think is
consistent with a collaborative culture

401
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:28,514
at Google.

402
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,020
Any other things that people have used
to get people to the table with them?

403
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,930
Nothing else. No other hints. Okay.

404
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,290
Well hopefully it was just
some of these. Nope. Okay.

405
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,750
So let me go to the next
point that I want to make,

406
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,790
which is the idea about getting
who they are and what they want.

407
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,460
So we had this sense
that I'm in negotiation,

408
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,520
we want to focus on people's interest,
you know,

409
00:24:57,521 --> 00:25:00,380
to come up with mutual gains agreements.
But you know,

410
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:05,381
that there's more behind what people
want than just the issues that are on the

411
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,754
table.

412
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,620
People look at the person
you're negotiating with
considers him or herself in

413
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:14,020
the context of the larger organization.
So for example,

414
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:15,400
if you're negotiating salary,

415
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,860
if somebody is going to give
you a salary that you want,

416
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:22,030
they want to think about
what's the implication of
this to other people, right?

417
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,840
So this notion of how they
think about their, uh,

418
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,490
themselves in relation to,
uh, to the things that they
might, they might give you.

419
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,450
And so I usually like to put this slide
up because one of the things we think

420
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:39,451
about is we tend to see ourselves as
the heroes and heroines of our stories.

421
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,240
So we like to say we're strategic.
We take the long term perspective,

422
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,660
we see the big picture. We act in
the organization's best interest.

423
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:49,810
We're flexible and collaborative.
They on the other hand are opportunistic.

424
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:52,870
They're short term thinkers. They have
narrow vision. They're out for themselves,

425
00:25:52,871 --> 00:25:56,350
rigid, an uncooperative. And I have to
tell you, nobody wakes up in the morning,

426
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,560
looks at him or herself in the
mirror and says, I'm opportunistic.

427
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:03,020
I'm a short term thinker, I have narrow
vision, I'm out for myself. Average.

428
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,130
Everybody thinks they're
operating on that left hand side.

429
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,400
That what they're doing and responding
to you is legitimate and strategic in

430
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,560
their view.

431
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,060
So what I'd like to say is when you think
about getting their perspective is to

432
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:27,040
think about there good
reasons for saying no to you.

433
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,070
Good reasons on that left hand side.

434
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,980
What would their good
reasons for saying no to you?

435
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,080
Because that's the hidden agenda of
any of these negotiations, right?

436
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,860
It's their reasons for saying no.
So let me tell you this story about,

437
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:44,310
this was the story actually the woman I
told you about right in the beginning.

438
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,360
So, um, she's the vice president,

439
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:50,910
chief financial officer of a
division of an energy company.

440
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:55,290
And the condition of taking this job was
that she moved to Texas and she moved

441
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,740
to Texas.
And uh,

442
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,990
she was there for two years and her
family said at the end of two years,

443
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,450
we're going back to Pennsylvania,
which is where they were from,

444
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,490
with or without you. And that's when
she said to me, the negotiation changed.

445
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:12,080
My, changed my life because what
she recognized, first of all,

446
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:15,720
it was that she had leverage and her
leverage was that the chief financial

447
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:19,530
officer of the company relied on her to
have a relationship with people in the

448
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:22,980
field. So that made her feel
like she had value to negotiate.

449
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,720
The second thing that she did,
and I think this is really important,

450
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,980
when you raise an issue in
a little end negotiation,

451
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,870
chances are you're raising a problem
and when you raise a problem,

452
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,220
you're the problem.

453
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:43,380
And so it really makes sense
to come in with good options.

454
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,660
We call it in the book anchor with options
because if you anchor with options,

455
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,380
you come in at a frames the negotiation.
So let me tell you what this woman did.

456
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,214
Her name is Cheryl.

457
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,870
So Charlotte negotiated with the chief
financial officer and she came up with

458
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:00,150
this idea of something
she called the Tri Office,

459
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,580
which was sometime in
corporate headquarters,

460
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,620
sometime in the field and
sometime in Pennsylvania.

461
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,900
But then she thought about what are his
good reasons for saying no. By the way,

462
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,160
when we tell people about negotiation,
where we say prepare, prepare, prepare,

463
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,410
and when you prepare, prepare, prepare,

464
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,570
you often can't hear what
the good reasons are.

465
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,230
So it's really important to leave it,
I call it, we call it being mindful.

466
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,510
So when she thought about his
good reasons, first she was,

467
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,920
she thought he might think she
wouldn't be able to do the job right.

468
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,620
She wouldn't be able to in in this
kind of as if she wasn't corporate

469
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:36,660
headquarters,
she wouldn't really be able to do the job.

470
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,650
So she built into her
offer performance criteria.

471
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,450
They would look at performance criteria.

472
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,720
The second thing is she thought
he might think it was too costly.

473
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:50,190
He paid for a move already and
he might not want to do it again.

474
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,530
So she built in a cluster,
Sharon provision.

475
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,690
The third thing was he was afraid if she
left, he loses connection to the field.

476
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,900
So they built in a way that
she could deal with the field.

477
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,950
He thought that she would be tired,
get tired of the commute.

478
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,890
So they had periodic check ins.

479
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,950
And the final thing was he
wouldn't want to change precedent.

480
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,570
There's nothing she could do about that.

481
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,500
But what she did was thinking about
his good reasons for saying no.

482
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,950
And in the negotiations, I
always like to say, you know,

483
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:22,560
if you know a good reason that
people are going to say no,

484
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,670
it's great to start there. So
she could say, and you know,

485
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:30,540
I think you worried about my performance
that this is going to jeopardize that.

486
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:33,930
And he said, right. And once
they're able to talk about it,

487
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,680
it sort of can lower the resistance
a little bit. It's a nice story.

488
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:39,920
They did a pilot, it worked. And Child,

489
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:42,850
she's vice president and
general of that division.

490
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,140
So the final thing I want to talk about
is what we call dealing with resistance.

491
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:51,970
That is you, you, um, uh, you
raise something. So here it is,

492
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,540
uh, you put out an idea, the person that
says this will never work. You say, yes,

493
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:59,860
it will. And he says you're wrong.
And she says, no, no, I'm right.

494
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,900
And what happens in these kinds of
things? I talk about this as, um,

495
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,950
moves and countermoves. So when people
don't want to give you what you want,

496
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,060
they say things that can put you on
the defensive. They're resistance.

497
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,230
And so they defend, they question your
competence. They say, this budget, sweat,

498
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:20,980
align. Uh, everybody else
can do this. Why can't you?

499
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,150
Or they criticize your style. You're
being unreasonable or don't get so upset.

500
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,000
They demean your ideas,
which were ever get these numbers from.

501
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,540
This will never work. Or they appeal
for sympathy. This is really the killer.

502
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,170
I think I really need your help on this.
I'm very stretched.

503
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,700
So please just hold.

504
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,810
That's what the boss did and Isabelle's
case or they flatter you. Another killer.

505
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,540
You're so good at this. Why wouldn't
you want to keep doing it all?

506
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,800
80 hours of it.

507
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,960
And so what happens is we get into
this move and counter move like this as

508
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:54,961
opposed to thinking about what we call
turns and turns changed the dynamics.

509
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,860
So the first term you can
always use is interruption

510
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,180
silenced. It's very heavy,
right? You take a break,

511
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,110
you interrupt because you never
come back to exactly the same place.

512
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,970
Or you can ask a question, you can correct
it or you couldn't solve a problem.

513
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,120
So I want to give you an example.
This is a story about a woman.

514
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,060
This is again from Africa,
she is on a phd,

515
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:36,500
economist works for Large Ngo.
The coin of the realm is doing research,

516
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:40,190
but also having your work make
a difference on the ground.

517
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,980
So her name is Rosa Lee
and she's coming to talk.

518
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:46,610
You can tell this organization to
the assistant director general.

519
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,210
Did you get a sense of
what this organization must
be like with an assistant

520
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:52,190
director general?
And she comes and she says,

521
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,650
I've come to talk to you
about funding to present it.

522
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:56,060
The next international congress.

523
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,020
I just published an important article
in the Journal of Agricultural Economics

524
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,730
and I want to present it. And he says,
I'm not familiar with that journal.

525
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:08,570
But as you know, we need senior people
to come and present at these conferences.

526
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,320
That's where we meet with donors
and you're not ready. And she says,

527
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:17,210
I can't believe you're saying that
I am ready to present. And he says,

528
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:19,610
look, I really need you
to support the work here.

529
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:22,790
You are best at helping me in the director
general get ready to the conference.

530
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,540
And she says, no way am I just
going to help you present my data.

531
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,710
I need to be there too. And
he says, don't get so upset.

532
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,280
And she says, I am not upset. Right.

533
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,250
So that's an example of resistance,
counter resistance.

534
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,430
So let's look at it from
a perspective of turns.

535
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,500
So she says the same thing.
He says the same thing,

536
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,610
but instead of responding
in a countermove, she says,

537
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,230
she asks a question,

538
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,030
help me understand the criteria used
to determine whether people are ready.

539
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,260
Right? So she opens it up
and he says, we need it.

540
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,680
And so he said pretty much the same thing,
but she hears it differently, right?

541
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,020
He gives, she asked a
question, he gives a reason

542
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,910
then knowing that she can correct it.

543
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,590
I understand what a priority this project
is and I want to support you and the

544
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:19,130
director general so you can
meet with donors and he says,

545
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,850
I'm glad you understand. Okay, so
now she's getting cooled out here.

546
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,940
That doesn't work. So she says she
jumps to the problem and she said,

547
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,730
since I am most familiar with the data,

548
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:32,600
I think the best way to support the
project is for me to do the presentations

549
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,290
and be available to answer questions that
donors have that would help the donors

550
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:38,810
have confidence in our junior researchers.
Right?

551
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,830
So she expands the product from just
herself to something that's good for the

552
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:43,520
organization.

553
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,440
It's good for junior resources and for
donors to know that junior resources that

554
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,780
researchers are doing important work.
And so he says,

555
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,580
actually I think that would work.
I'm going to run it by the DJ. Now,

556
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:57,320
obviously this is a very
stylized kind of situation,

557
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:02,530
but the idea about being prepared when
people are going to use these moves that

558
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,530
put you on the defensive.
And what I would like to say in the book,

559
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:06,950
which we didn't,

560
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,130
I didn't talk about today's knowing
what you know about the person you're

561
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:10,850
dealing with.

562
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,240
What do they do in these kinds of
negotiations so you can be prepared.

563
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,490
So the final thing I just say is,
you know, this book, um, we, the,

564
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:23,510
the subtitle of the book is called,
uh, turning small wins into big gains.

565
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,990
And our notion about this is that these
kinds of negotiations over these issues

566
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,190
actually make some change.

567
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,190
So if you think of that Isabel
that was doing this extra work,

568
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,370
she becomes a role model for changing
the idea that invisible work and just

569
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:41,300
helping has no cost.

570
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:46,410
It has a cost and it should
be built in to a job. Cheryl,

571
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,670
in this tri office actually
changes a precedent.

572
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It is no longer the case that it is
expected that people will move to the

573
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:59,240
corporate office as a condition of
taking on a very senior leadership job.

574
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,440
They might, but it's non
negotiable. It's not just assumed.

575
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,940
And Rosalee changes the role
of the junior researchers.

576
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,910
Now the leadership of the organization
is open to the idea that junior research,

577
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,800
it's actually a good thing for
junior researchers to present.

578
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,510
So negotiation becomes a way to
change kind of cultural practices.

579
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:22,490
So I think it's not just good for you.

580
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,740
I think it can be good
for the organization.

581
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,290
So we have some time for questions.
People have questions.

582
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,340
Zone is from Beca.

583
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,890
I'd love tips on helping him manager
understand the value of work that is done

584
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:41,280
outside of one's core
role, right? For example,

585
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,260
training or mentoring others.

586
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,580
It's important for the greater
good of Google or for your work,

587
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,970
but can be hard to defend in the
face of an ambitious team goal.

588
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,230
Right.
So I mean again,

589
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:56,670
I think the most important thing there
is how do you connect, why it's good,

590
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,140
what are the benefits?

591
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:01,530
You'd have to be able to quantify
those benefits in some way. You know,

592
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:05,730
sometimes people say, you know, when we
mentor people it means that they stay,

593
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,481
you know,

594
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:10,620
I reading this book about Google losing
talent is something that Google isn't so

595
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:13,980
happy about. So the idea if
you're mentoring people to stay,

596
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,350
especially if they're in a minority group,

597
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,550
the idea that you're helping
them stay would be uh,

598
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,000
putting this in a currency that has
value presumably to the person you're

599
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:28,020
dealing with. Other people have
suggestions for how you do that as well.

600
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,640
I don't think I have to be the only one
answering that question. How do you,

601
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,680
how do you make invisible work that you
do that isn't just generically value

602
00:36:36,851 --> 00:36:39,660
cause it doesn't contribute
directly to the work you're doing?

603
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,930
How do you claim value for it?
Anybody have any other ideas?

604
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,803
Have you done it?

605
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,823
Yeah,

606
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,470
build it into your goals.

607
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,463
Right?

608
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,560
Okay. Yeah, I mean I think the idea
there is to connect what's good.

609
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,110
I always like to say
there are a few stuff,

610
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,800
a few principles that I have here that
I had in my notes, but I didn't say it.

611
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:15,720
And one of them is connecting what's
good for you to what's good for the

612
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:16,321
organization.

613
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:20,190
You need to be able to talk about why
it's good and the degree to which you can

614
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:23,190
do that. I think, uh, sort
of, uh, it makes a difference.

615
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,873
Okay.

616
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:34,010
So the question was the
answer was in reviews,

617
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,690
bring it up and have it built into your
goals. That's a good time. You know,

618
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:42,740
and I say negotiation doesn't present
itself as sort of clear opportunities,

619
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,130
but reviews are often, um,
uh, a place to do that.

620
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,140
And in the book we talk about,

621
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,800
we have a lot of examples about how
you build in these kinds of things to

622
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:55,040
ongoing conversations, like
reviews, like project reviews,

623
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,820
how you stop that conversation and
build something else in that you want to

624
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:00,770
accomplish.
Yes.

625
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:06,370
So you started by talking about framing
your value in a way that matters to the

626
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,860
other party. But, um,

627
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:14,510
in my experience as a young professional
in when I was negotiating for my first

628
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:18,950
job, my pre, prior to this one,
I had no idea what my value was.

629
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:24,050
They had grades and I had no idea how to
explain that grades would be useful and

630
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:29,120
I got a job. So somehow it,
but they thought I had value,

631
00:38:29,121 --> 00:38:34,070
but it was never clear to me what they
saw or how I could highlight that.

632
00:38:34,071 --> 00:38:34,280
Right,
right.

633
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,220
But you know,
when you're getting

634
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,260
hired right out of school,

635
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:43,120
you don't have value on a currency that
has value yet they have to determine

636
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:47,410
what it is.
But over time and working,

637
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,800
you do have value and a
currency that has value. I mean,

638
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:54,880
I think the hiring is sort of different,
right? I mean, I think, you know,

639
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:56,710
Google looks for talent and good grades,
right?

640
00:38:56,711 --> 00:39:00,550
So you probably had somebody thought
you had talent and you probably had good

641
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:04,750
grades and they thought, okay, I mean
when I gathered from reading about Google,

642
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:08,410
the interviewing process is a really
important part. But I think over time,

643
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:11,530
little end, that's not a little end
negotiation. Actually. That's more,

644
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,470
you're negotiating for it to get hired.
It's a little bit,

645
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:18,100
it is a little end in some ways,
but it's not in terms of the ongoing work.

646
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,100
So now you do have a value and want
to change things where you want

647
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:23,080
opportunities. That's
when you really, I think,

648
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:26,920
have to show your value to
persistent question is how
do you know your own value?

649
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:30,100
Especially as a younger professional.
If you don't know your value,

650
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,170
they won't know it either.
Right?

651
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:36,940
And so you also talk to people you need
to, you know. So one of the things is,

652
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,460
you know, we always think we're
on our own and doing this,

653
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,670
you not to talk to other
people in your network.

654
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,550
Help them get some advice from
people who've done it before.

655
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,750
How did they see their value? What are
the kinds of things that matter? You know,

656
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:50,200
I,

657
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,440
one of the things in the book that we
talk about is knowing what you know about

658
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,990
the person you're dealing with.
How do they like to hear things?

659
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,190
What do they value?

660
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,430
So finding information about the person
you're gonna negotiate can also help you

661
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,980
help you do that, but you're
not on your own. Exactly.

662
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:03,970
Do you have a comment about that?

663
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,840
So I actually sit on our new
Grad hiring committee, so I see,

664
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,110
so you just go by a lot.
I tend to not to see what the offers are,

665
00:40:10,111 --> 00:40:12,990
but I do see the candidates go by.
Um,

666
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,830
and as far as knowing what your
value is and that situation, um,

667
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,700
shop yourself around, right? It's,

668
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:22,380
it's like often when I want to know the
value of an old piece of electronics,

669
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:25,710
I go to Ebay and see what people are
paying for it. Shop yourself around,

670
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,090
see what Twitter will offer you.

671
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,520
See what Facebook will
after you see what you know,

672
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,220
any other company out there we'll offer
you and then come back to, to Google.

673
00:40:35,221 --> 00:40:35,671
Because you know,

674
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:38,010
you wanted to work at Google even though
you're interviewing all these other

675
00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:41,610
places, but come back to them and say,
well, these guys were gonna offer me this.

676
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,690
I have a competing offer.

677
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,110
Nothing gets the recruiters into action
faster than having competing offers.

678
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:49,320
And I think you'll find that true
throughout your professional career,

679
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,340
no matter what level you are
a applying to be hired into

680
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,160
heading another offer is a bat na,

681
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,170
there were such suggests you need to do
a little bit careful about how you use

682
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:02,004
that directly.

683
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,360
One of the things that I like to
say is when you have another offer,

684
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:11,040
you know your value and so therefore
what you're asking for fields defensible,

685
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:15,780
you can stand behind it. Some of the
research suggests, especially with women,

686
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,070
when you drag out that other offer,
people don't hear it so well.

687
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,530
I think you're an experienced
person on the hiring committee.

688
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:26,420
Other people might sort of not do it,
but I definitely want to,

689
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,960
I am not involved directly in negotiating.
Right.

690
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,060
Just so I was looking did they look good?

691
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,140
Right, right. It's just going to say
in terms of like knowing your worth,

692
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,830
like talk to your peers, talk.
Exactly. Peer reviews. Um, you know,

693
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,940
when we have yearly Perf,

694
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:44,630
I think that's a great place and just
just get real time feedback. Right.

695
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:48,040
You don't have to wait, like to go, just
don't go. And I'll get an offer. Right,

696
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:53,060
right. Yeah. Hr. Um, but, you know, I
think that it's, it's more than just your,

697
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,000
you know, there is a lot of other
ways than just going out to,

698
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,800
to see what Facebook would pay you.

699
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,303
Great.

700
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,000
Other questions?

701
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:06,770
There's more questions on the
dory. Okay. You can see them now.

702
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,380
Yeah.
So when a collaborative scrappy,

703
00:42:08,381 --> 00:42:11,440
we're culture teams and individuals
are pulled in many directions,

704
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,150
do you have tips for managing a wide
range of requests and opportunities from

705
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:19,000
multiple unique sources? Well, again,

706
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:22,900
it's a little bit about knowing what
you want. If you don't, if you're not,

707
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:25,150
you can't get what you want if
you don't know what you want.

708
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:30,450
And so if you're just being buffeted
by request and you can't anchor on

709
00:42:31,421 --> 00:42:33,220
something that matters to you,

710
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,240
I do think you need to get
advice about that without,

711
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,970
if you cause a kid getting pulled
in all these different directions,

712
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,500
that's what's going to happen.

713
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:46,740
And so you're not going to be able to
carve yourself out sort of a career and a

714
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:51,700
program, a program to progress.
So I, you know, I think it's,

715
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:55,720
um, yes, you need to have people
that can help you think about that.

716
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,030
That's why mentoring is so important,
right?

717
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,430
In a culture where this happens a lot,

718
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:05,320
mentors are really key to be able to
talk to people and get advice from them

719
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:09,580
about what makes sense here for
me and what doesn't make sense.

720
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,840
It makes sense for me. So I think
there's sort of anchoring and having,

721
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,930
knowing what you want, cause you
can't get it if you don't know it,

722
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,300
if you don't know it.
And I think it is one of the things.

723
00:43:19,301 --> 00:43:22,600
So there's so many opportunities,
it's hard to focus on it. So,

724
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:23,770
but I think if you don't,

725
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,380
it's very hard to sort of push
to negotiate for the thing,

726
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,860
then you can't really negotiate with the
things you want just being pushed back

727
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:30,520
and forth.

728
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,820
Now you might want to narrow it down
to a few things and use these things to

729
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:36,520
trade off each other so
that you might want to,

730
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,370
it might help you get
exactly what you want.

731
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,040
I think there are a lot
of choices here. Um, and,

732
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,550
and so I think focusing
is really is really key.

733
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,023
MMM.

734
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,560
You know,
I think this sounds like a theme here.

735
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,130
There are sexy projects and
Grosvenor projects on every team.

736
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:58,320
How do I negotiate for the ones
that will set me up for success,

737
00:43:58,321 --> 00:44:01,170
which are usually the sexy ones.
So I guess I would say, again,

738
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,880
knowing what you want,
but you know,

739
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,140
doing a little of the grunt but
do it and we call this if then,

740
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,660
right? So I'm willing to
do this if then I do that.

741
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,020
So you connect these different parts of
what you're being asked to do and that

742
00:44:18,961 --> 00:44:21,420
way you really do make it a sort of a,
a negotiation.

743
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:24,780
So there is a cost for you doing
the grunt work. But if you're,

744
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:26,550
the kind of person always
says no to that grunt work,

745
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,050
I think it's going to be an issue.
But if you're,

746
00:44:28,051 --> 00:44:29,850
the kind of person always
says yes to the grunt work,

747
00:44:29,851 --> 00:44:30,990
all you do is get brunt work.

748
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,920
So that the issue is really to make it
a negotiation. If then if I do this,

749
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,730
then I want to do that.
So always connect these asks,

750
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,940
we talk in the book about how to turn
asks into negotiations because that's

751
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:48,480
really key. You get asked all the time
and how do you make it into a negotiation?

752
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:52,800
So one of them is if then, if
then, which builds in reciprocity,

753
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:56,550
I'm willing to do this, but then something
else. And I think that's important.

754
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,253
Yes.

755
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,290
Can you talk a little bit about some
of the basics such as anchoring,

756
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,410
which you talked a little bit about,
um,

757
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:10,650
whether it's you starting the negotiations
at a certain point and ratcheting

758
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:14,260
back. How big do you make
your initial asks? Right.

759
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:17,020
You know, so, um, uh,

760
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:22,260
anchoring comes from a negotiations when
you're attending to negotiate about a

761
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,070
single issue,
right?

762
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:28,450
So you have an idea about a bargaining
zone and we make offers and we moved back

763
00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:32,590
and forth on that zone and it,
it tends to be the case.

764
00:45:32,591 --> 00:45:36,850
If you have good information
about the other size, other sides,

765
00:45:36,851 --> 00:45:40,450
alternatives,
it pays you to make the opening offer.

766
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,420
I don't think this is a
little end negotiation advice.

767
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:47,050
This is external kind of advice because
I think that there's consequences to

768
00:45:47,051 --> 00:45:50,320
doing what I'm about to say it. A little
end negotiation. So let me be clear.

769
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:54,850
But when you have good information
about the other person's alternatives,

770
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,310
it behooves you to make an opening offer.

771
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,300
That's what we call a large opening on
offer because your frame the negotiations

772
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:05,110
and you anchor it in a way
that's advantageous to you.

773
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,750
If you don't have good information
about the other side's Batna,

774
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:12,250
you have a tendency, you have, you run
the risk of either anchoring too low,

775
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,460
in which case you cut off a lot of
the bargaining zone or anchoring.

776
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,330
So much off the charts that
people sort of walk away.

777
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,080
The way I like to use anchoring in
little end negotiation is anchoring with

778
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,720
solutions.
So you know you have this,

779
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:30,580
so you're asked to do grunt work
for example. Well do you have,

780
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,850
can you anchor with a solution
about what you would do?

781
00:46:33,851 --> 00:46:36,660
Some of it or who else
would do it? Um, uh,

782
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,990
so anchoring becomes solutions to problems
because you're always trying to make

783
00:46:40,991 --> 00:46:44,740
trades. I meant to tell my trade story.
So I guess I'll tell my trade story. Now,

784
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,760
you're always looking for making trays.
You know, in the, in all negotiations,

785
00:46:48,761 --> 00:46:50,440
you never want to negotiate
about a single issue.

786
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,620
You always want to negotiate about more
than one issue because you want to do if

787
00:46:53,621 --> 00:46:56,440
then you want to have, uh,
you want to have trades.

788
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,150
So here's my story about trades.

789
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:03,390
This is a story about an anthropologist
who studied the Navajo in Arizona and

790
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,500
she finished her fieldwork and she's
driving back to Phoenix and she passes the

791
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:09,940
Navajo women on the road.

792
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,660
And she asked her if she wants a ride
back into Phoenix and this woman says,

793
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,553
sure.

794
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,890
And this woman gets in the car and it's
totally silent for most of the ride,

795
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,120
except when they're getting
close to Phoenix. The woman,

796
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,160
the Navajo woman notices that in between
the two seats there's a bag and she

797
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:34,210
asks the anthropologist what's in the bag.
And the anthropologist says,

798
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:39,100
it's a bottle of wine from my husband.
And the Navajo woman says, good trade.

799
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,190
So it's important to think about
traits, right? Trays are important.

800
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:47,030
It's always sort of, if, then we,

801
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:49,630
I didn't really talk about that
that much in this talk, but it's,

802
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:52,720
there's a lot of it in the
book always about if then,

803
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,760
and so anchoring in a single ish, you
know, single offer kind of situation,

804
00:47:57,761 --> 00:48:00,910
you know, those are so rare.
That's not what you're doing.

805
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,190
Even when you're negotiating salary,
that's not what you're doing.

806
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:05,590
There's so many other
pieces that are part of it.

807
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,770
So Anka was solutions because
I think it does the same thing.

808
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,700
It frames the negotiation in a situation
that's advantageous to you because you

809
00:48:13,701 --> 00:48:15,910
sort of thought about how
you, uh, how you frame it.

810
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,450
Okay. So suppliers, you know, I'm not
really talking about that. Um, suppliers,

811
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,233
uh,

812
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,240
you know, how you negotiate with
suppliers for on a short timeline to,

813
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:35,400
to pull in dates due to urgent demand.
Again, I think, you know, it's,

814
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,030
it's an if then kind of thing will they
do with this time and in return you'll

815
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:43,950
give them something else later. Um, you
know, I think that those are, um, uh,

816
00:48:43,951 --> 00:48:44,371
and,
and,

817
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:49,130
and then the then could be how we keep
each other informed so that we know more

818
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,120
what's happening.
Um,

819
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:52,510
okay.

820
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:52,811
Yeah.

821
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:56,830
So somebody Nigga isn't negotiating on
behalf of you and they don't negotiate

822
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,110
well, how would you prepare
them to negotiate? Well,

823
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:02,530
I think that's a really important issue
when you are counting on people to

824
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:07,030
negotiate for you. You want to have
the first negotiation with them.

825
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:11,350
What is it you want them to do? And
sometimes I actually might need some help.

826
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,430
Um, uh, when they have to
negotiate on your behalf,

827
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,490
there may be a consequence to negotiate
on their behalf that they don't want to

828
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:22,360
pick up. And so I think you have
to find ways to sort of help them,

829
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,690
help them do that. Um, uh, uh,

830
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,950
help them figure out exactly how they
wouldn't go shake it off and negotiate on

831
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:32,560
your behalf. Um, that, that you don't,

832
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,980
if you may not have all the information
that they have about options and

833
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:39,400
policies, what you want to get,
ask them for that information.

834
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:42,970
So this negotiation with your manager,
it's actually the first negotiation.

835
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,940
It's not something that you're
just sort of talking to them.

836
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,990
It is negotiating to get them to buy in,
to be your advocate.

837
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,170
And that's what you're
sort of asking them to do.

838
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,200
I Dunno. Sales teams, I don't have a,

839
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,250
that's an open ended question that I don't
actually have a lot of advice for. Um,

840
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:06,730
I would suggest you talk to other people
on your sales team to get advice for

841
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:07,960
that.
Um,

842
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,413
okay.

843
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,710
That's it. I, um, I got some,

844
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,930
I interviewed some
people before I, um, uh,

845
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,310
came here to get some other information.

846
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,800
And some of the things
I learned was the case.

847
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:30,860
Scarce resource at Google is time.

848
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:35,240
So one of the major things that you're
negotiating about is really time.

849
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,710
And so it's, it's, uh,

850
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:41,630
trying to think about creative ways
and creative ways to negotiate,

851
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,250
to negotiate about time.

852
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,200
And so we have some ideas in
the book about that as well. Um,

853
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:50,840
especially in terms of negotiating
about work and personal life, uh,

854
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,280
work and personal life issues.
So are there any other questions?

855
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,870
Well, thank you. It's
been a real pleasure.

856
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:04,340
I hope you liked the book and you use
it. Um, and if you do have questions,

857
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:08,180
Kathy has ways to get in touch with me,
I'd be happy to sort of answer them,

858
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:09,530
answer them online.

859
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,250
I think there's sort of a theme here
about the kind of questions you're

860
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:17,240
overwhelmed with choices and you're
having a hard time negotiating about those

861
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,170
kinds of choices.

862
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,130
And I think it really starts with
you being clear about what it is,

863
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:27,230
what it is you want. I guess the other
thing that I didn't say when I talk about,

864
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:29,480
um, I, I said, you know,

865
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:32,900
connect what's good for you to what's
good for your organization and convert an

866
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:36,290
ask into a negotiation.
The issue is,

867
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,320
the way you do that is it's always yes
and that's what builds in the restaurant.

868
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:44,390
Yes, I'm willing to do this
and here's what I need.

869
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:47,680
So you're always thinking about sort
of connecting it and making it a go

870
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,450
negotiation. People always say,
I need more help saying, no,

871
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,810
I don't think that's right. I think
you want to have help saying yes hand.

872
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:58,340
And when you put the and out and they
say, well, I can't do that. He said, well,

873
00:51:58,341 --> 00:51:59,960
then maybe it's not going to work.
Right.

874
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,810
But at least you've had an
negotiation about it. Um,

875
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:06,500
so I would encourage you in
this negotiation culture to,

876
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,260
to think about some of these, uh,
some of us, some of these principles.

877
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,010
So thank you.
