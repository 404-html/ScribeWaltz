1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,020
So welcome everyone.
Our speaker today,

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,050
this is the first time she has
missed a very special engagement. Uh,

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,850
and that is the Vancouver Ukulele circle.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,890
So Stephanie Gray is actually
an avid Ukulele player,

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,940
but in addition to that,
uh,

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,250
she is a Canadian who has spent more
than 15 years giving over 800 talks and

7
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:35,780
debates as well as hundreds
of media interviews on
abortion to diverse audiences

8
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,670
in the United States, Canada,
Australia, Latvia, England, Ireland,

9
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,080
Costa Rica,
and Guatemala in university settings.

10
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:49,220
She has debated Dr Fraser fellows,
a late term abortionist,

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,780
Ron Fitzsimmons,

12
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,370
then executive director of the national
coalition of abortion providers,

13
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,970
Elizabeth Kevin Dash a then legal
director for Naral pro choice America and

14
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:03,200
doctor Malcolm pots,

15
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,620
the first medical director
for the International Planned
Parenthood Federation.

16
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,630
Uh, she's the author of
love unleashes life, uh,

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,800
abortion and the art
of communicating truth.

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,760
And we have copies of her book available,
uh,

19
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:20,170
for a subsidized price of $5. So
if you're interested, come and, uh,

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,500
buy a copy after the talk.
So with no further delay,

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,290
I will introduce Ms. Stephanie Gray.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,960
Thank you. It's wonderful to be
here. I love asking questions.

23
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:41,010
In fact, I have a friend who has
nicknamed me inquisitive Stephanie,

24
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,280
and in my vast travels around the world,

25
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,210
I have asked a lot of people
the following question,

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,790
who inspires you?

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,460
And whenever someone answers that question
for me, I then follow it up with why.

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,920
And here's what I've discovered.

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,460
Very often there are different answers
for who inspires the individuals I've

30
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:08,490
encountered,
but I've begun to notice a trend,

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,520
a theme when it comes to why certain
individuals inspire us and as I have asked

32
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,880
people for the reasons for why
certain people inspire them,

33
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,090
what I've discovered is it seems generally
the people who are inspiring have

34
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:28,080
suffered in some way or they face
some sort of obstacle or some sort of

35
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,420
challenge or some sort of difficulty.

36
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,110
And what sets them apart from those who
don't inspire is how they respond to

37
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:39,924
their suffering.

38
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,400
To the challenge to the difficulty and
what I've noticed this trend is that it

39
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,480
seems inspiring.

40
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:49,410
People in the face of
obstacles and suffering and
difficulty have at least three

41
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:54,090
qualities in common.
They put others ahead of themselves,

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,530
they have perspective and
they do the right thing.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,280
Even when it's hard, you do the
right thing even when it's hard.

44
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,610
And so what I wanted to do today was
look at each of those qualities in more

45
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:13,960
detail and relate them to the very
controversial topic of abortion and a

46
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,591
particular,

47
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:18,760
I want to share with you
various conversations and
encounters I have had with

48
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:23,761
people of all different backgrounds and
viewpoints when it comes to abortion and

49
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:29,011
how I have been able to use those three
qualities and show how they align very

50
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:34,810
much with the perspective that I hold,
which is the prolife perspective.

51
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,550
When it comes to that first quality that
of putting others ahead of ourselves,

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,720
I would suggest that regardless
of someone's political persuasion,

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,080
love is universally attractive.

54
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,030
It is universally magnetic,

55
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:53,170
and ultimately that's what putting
others ahead of ourself is.

56
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,070
That's what love is. It's
willing. The others good.

57
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,790
And I would suggest that again,
regardless of our political persuasion,

58
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,830
each individual has a battle internally
between times where they put others

59
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:10,300
ahead of themselves and times where they
don't put others ahead of themselves.

60
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,830
I was once debating with a college
student in Florida a few years ago and we

61
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:18,370
were debating on the topic of abortion
and in our conversation, I'll admit,

62
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,300
I was thinking to myself,
he sounds selfish now.

63
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,810
Perhaps I could identify that so readily
because I knew that there were many

64
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:28,330
times I have been selfish.
In fact,

65
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,090
I can think of a time recently
on one of my frequent flights,

66
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,620
I had settled into my seat and there
was one empty seat next to me and sure

67
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:39,490
enough that passenger came along to
sit down and as she was coming down the

68
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:39,791
aisle,

69
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,510
she was talking with someone else and it
was very clear that they were traveling

70
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:47,560
together and it was very clear that the
person she was with was further at the

71
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:51,700
back of the plane and this thought
entered my head, I should offer my seat.

72
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,650
That would be nice.
I'm traveling alone.

73
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:56,440
I can take her friends seats so
they can sit next to each other.

74
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,730
But then I thought to myself,

75
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,190
I don't like sitting near the back of the
plane and I don't feel like getting up.

76
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:07,900
And so I didn't offer my seat and I have
to admit later that day I was kind of

77
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:12,901
reflecting on my day and I regretted
that decision of inaction and I thought

78
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:18,010
that was selfish.
And my overarching thought was if I move,

79
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,150
how will this impact me?

80
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,620
That's self interested
instead of if I move,

81
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,520
how will this impact them?
That's other oriented.

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,570
So I recognize that weakness within
me and that that wasn't attractive.

83
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,100
The attractive quality is the one that
is other oriented. So I bring that up,

84
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,000
taking us now back to my encounter
with his college student talking about

85
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:43,030
abortion, where he sounded selfish
and I was thinking to myself,

86
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,420
even though I have made selfish choices,
even though he sounds selfish,

87
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,600
I believe deep down we're
all drawn to selflessness.

88
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,100
How can I draw this out of him?
And besides loving questions,

89
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:58,370
I also love stories and as it should
happen as I was with a student,

90
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,460
a story came to my mind that
I had read about in the news.

91
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,170
The year was 2012 that this student
and I were talking and around that time

92
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:10,970
there had been that Costa Concordia
cruise ship accident where the cruise ship

93
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:15,340
had been steered a little too close to
shore on you're an Italian village and uh,

94
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,560
hit ground and sank and
people lost their lives.

95
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,320
And so I said to this student
that I was dialoguing with,

96
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,790
do you remember hearing about that on
the news? You said yes. And I said,

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,790
that made international attention.

98
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,310
And I said it drew
international attention,

99
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:34,430
not just because it was a major
passenger vehicle that had an accident,

100
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,710
not just because people died,

101
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,630
but there was another element to this
story that shocked people around the

102
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,250
world.
Who remembers what it was.

103
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,053
Anyway,

104
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,590
the captain left the ship and
that's what the students said to me.

105
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:51,560
He answered my question about
this story by saying, well,

106
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,270
the captain abandoned ship.
Now,

107
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:57,770
apparently the captain says the the ship
fell over and he fell into a a boat.

108
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:01,130
But the point was,
the news had been reporting it this way.

109
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:04,010
And so the student remembered that.
So then I said to him,

110
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,270
and how did our world respond? Did
our world respond by saying, Hey,

111
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:11,630
that was a really brilliant
choice of that captain,

112
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,420
or did our world respond by
saying, how could he have
done that? And he said, well,

113
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,690
it was the ladder. Our world was saddened
by that kind of reaction. Studies it,

114
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,720
let's contrast that captain
with another captain.

115
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,480
None of a cruise ship but of an airplane.

116
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,500
And I said to this student a few years
ago, now, this was many years ago now,

117
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,120
but back in 2012 a few
years prior to that,

118
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:36,830
in 2009 there had been a US airways plane
that had taken off from Laguardia when

119
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,270
my country of Canada got in the way.

120
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,290
We have these really annoying Canadian
geese and I don't know if they make their

121
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,290
way down here, but they certainly
made their way to New York.

122
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,680
And so there was a whole flock of
Canadian geese that were flying around the

123
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,680
exact same flight pattern
as this us airways flight.

124
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,090
And so I said to the student,

125
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,150
you know is this plane was taking off
and these Canadian geese were flying

126
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:56,780
nearby.

127
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,780
They got sucked into the engines of the
airplane and it caused immediate engine

128
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:06,470
failure. Do you remember that? I said to
the student, he said, yes, I do. I said,

129
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:10,850
the captain of that airplane Chesley
Sullenberger realized that he needed to

130
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:14,150
make an emergency landing because
if he didn't control the landing,

131
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:17,060
the plane was going to crash
with a dual engine failure.

132
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,790
And he realized he could
not get back to LaGuardia.

133
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,760
You couldn't get to Teterboro or any
of the other surrounding airports.

134
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,280
And so we thought,
I'm going to try to do a water landing.

135
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,620
And he managed to safely land that US
airways plane on the Hudson River in what

136
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:34,280
became known as the miracle on the Hudson.
And I said to the student,

137
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,850
when that plane came to a stop and
everyone inside would have gone to the

138
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,740
nearest exit to get off,

139
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,670
that meant the people at the back of the
plane would have gone to the back exit.

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,540
But one of the first people to get to the
back door didn't realize that the tail

141
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:51,860
of the airplane was tucked in the water.
So when they whipped that door open,

142
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,270
the Hudson River starts flooding into
this airplane. So I said to the student,

143
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:02,271
now everyone is getting away from the
back of the plane and they're escaping out

144
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,520
the middle doors and the front doors
and they're getting off except for one

145
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:08,454
person,

146
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,950
Captain Chesley Sullenberger as everyone's
getting off and away from the back,

147
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:17,490
he's staying on and walking towards
the back and his water was filling the

148
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,060
cabinet about waist level. He
walked the aisle, not just once,

149
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:26,061
but twice to make sure no one was left
on the plane and he was the last person

150
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,320
to get off.
What did our world say about him?

151
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,790
I asked this student and he
said, a hero. Correct? I said,

152
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,280
why? And he said, well, because
he had dependent passengers
and he cared for them.

153
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,630
He prioritize their needs.
He put them ahead of himself and I said,

154
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,150
do you think that's an example
we should follow? He said, yes,

155
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,080
and so I knew by his reaction to that
story that he shared the view I have that

156
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:55,410
even if we sometimes fail
and being other oriented,

157
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,640
we know that that's how we ought to
be and that's the example to follow.

158
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,070
And so once we can establish that,

159
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,100
I then brought it back to the topic of
abortion that we were debating and I

160
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:10,310
said,
if you agree that it was correct for the,

161
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,490
the the pilot to put the passengers ahead
of himself to prioritize the needs of

162
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,310
his dependence,

163
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,450
then wouldn't it follow that when it
comes to the topic of abortion and an

164
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:26,451
unplanned pregnancy that a pregnant woman
ought to prioritize the needs of her

165
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,430
dependent her preborn child,

166
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,400
much like a passenger on the airplane
who's in a vulnerable position and need

167
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:38,130
someone who's more skilled and older
and capable of helping them to help them

168
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:42,900
out. Now, some people respond by saying,
well wait, there's a big difference there.

169
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:46,920
You're comparing apples to oranges,
the people getting off of the airplane,

170
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,940
those passengers, we're human
beings, embryos and fetuses aren't,

171
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,010
so you can't make that comparison.

172
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,790
And I would suggest that that comparison
is valid or invalid depending on indeed

173
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,430
whether embryos and fetuses
are human beings like the
passengers on the airplane.

174
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,360
And so in my work I often wrestle with
that question in conversations with

175
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:11,970
people trying to discern
when does life begin?

176
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,120
And a good question because
remembering I love questions.

177
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,910
A good question that I'll
often ask people is this,

178
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,910
do you believe in human rights?

179
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,730
And I can tell you I have asked that
question around the world and consistently

180
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:31,650
I get one answer. Yes. And if
someone believes in human rights,

181
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:33,120
I then like to say,
okay,

182
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,690
well what about this human's rights
in the case of this seven week embryo?

183
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,130
Now sometimes people will look at an image
like that and say that's not a human.

184
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,760
And if that's someone's
reaction than in conversation,

185
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:50,340
I think rather than
preaching at an individual,

186
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:53,220
a good strategy to take
is to just ask a question.

187
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,730
And the question I like to ask is,
what are her parents?

188
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,510
Is the pregnant woman human?

189
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,170
Is Her partner human?
If yes,

190
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,290
wouldn't it logically follow that their
offspring must be of the same species?

191
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,120
So then someone might object and say,
well,

192
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,800
even if biologically that's human,
it's not alive.

193
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:18,821
Well,

194
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,330
I found myself in a conversation with
another college student a few years ago

195
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,770
and I asked him what he thought about
abortion. He said, I'm pro choice. I said,

196
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:30,580
why are you pro choice? And he said,
well, because the fetus isn't alive.

197
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,630
And so I just asked another question.
If the fetus isn't alive,

198
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,730
why do you need to do an abortion?

199
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,210
And he stopped and he
looked at me and he said,

200
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,640
I'm going to talk to you.
I never thought of it that way.

201
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:50,641
And so we spent about 30 minutes engaging
in a friendly civil dialogue as a

202
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:55,600
result of a question. If someone objects
to the idea that the embryo was alive.

203
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,970
I think another good
question to ask is this,

204
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,400
is the embryo growing at moment of
fertilization when you have a one celled

205
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:03,791
embryo,

206
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,570
is that one cell growing into two and
are those two growing into four and eight

207
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:09,700
and 16 and so forth.
And if yes,

208
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,030
when it followed by virtue
of the embryos growth,

209
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,230
the embryo must be living and
if the embryo has human parents,

210
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,680
wouldn't it follow by virtue of
that that the embryo must be human.

211
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,130
And if we believe in human rights,

212
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,200
then wouldn't it follow what we know
to be a living human has the same human

213
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:33,280
rights as you or me. Now someone
might objected that point and say,

214
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:35,950
but it's just a fetus
or it's just an embryo.

215
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,510
And so I think a good question to ask
that I've asked many people is this,

216
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,850
what kind of fetus I think about
that term for moment fetus,

217
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,420
that's not species specific. So
other species have fetuses, a dogs,

218
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,830
if he does his dolphins of
fetuses and humans have fetuses.

219
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:58,831
So the word fetus doesn't so much tell
us what something is but tells us how old

220
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,700
something is. So again, with my love
of questions, I'll often ask people,

221
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:08,701
when a fetus is born to human parents
and is in the arms of the mother,

222
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,380
what do we now call the fetus at that
moment? And people will say, well, a baby.

223
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:17,830
And, and then when the baby turns two,
what do we call the baby? I'll ask.

224
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:21,760
And toddler is what people say.
And then when the toddler turns 13,

225
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,690
what do we call the toddler? I was once
giving a talk and elderly woman piped up.

226
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,810
Impossible.
That's what we call that individual.

227
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,450
And then when possible turns 21, what do
we call impossible. Even more impossible,

228
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:35,230
right?

229
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,230
So the point is that we humans have
words to refer to age ranges within our

230
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:45,880
species. And so the words
adult or teenager, toddler,

231
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,330
baby,
fetus and embryo,

232
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,750
simply tell us how old an
entity is not what an entity is.

233
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,280
If we want to know what that entity is,
we have to ask what are the parents.

234
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,620
Now when it comes to the abortion debate,
one, one thing that I have found, um,

235
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,740
that provokes a lot of conversation is
defining the exact moment the fetus or

236
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:10,460
the embryo came to be.

237
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,880
And a lot of times we as a culture
will resist the idea that when debating

238
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:19,430
abortion,
that life would begin at fertilization.

239
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,170
And so what I'd like to suggest is that
if we weren't talking about abortion,

240
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,580
we as a society would more readily
accept that life begins at fertilization.

241
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:33,350
In fact, we already do. And a good
question to consider involves this, this,

242
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,470
this, uh, the following. Uh,

243
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,380
imagine someone is not pregnant
with an unwanted pregnancy.

244
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,230
Imagine they're trying
to achieve a pregnancy,

245
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,280
they desperately want to be pregnant,
but they're struggling with infertility.

246
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,230
So imagine this person goes to an
infertility specialist and that physician

247
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,320
recommends in vitro fertilization or
IVF where sperm will be an egg will be

248
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:59,870
fertilized by a sperm in
a petri dish in a lab.

249
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,700
Now setting aside the ethics of that,

250
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:05,890
which could be a whole other group talk
at Google, a setting aside the ethics,

251
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,710
ethics of that.

252
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,090
Imagine the individual then
goes to an IVF specialist.

253
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:15,650
Have we as a society ever heard someone
who's in the business of making life,

254
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,590
someone who's an IVF specialist
and we ever heard them say,

255
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,480
I just don't know when life begins.
If you think about it,

256
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:25,580
when someone is in the
business of making life,

257
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,880
we never claimed to not know when it
begins. We know exactly when it begets.

258
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:34,060
The one moment that the IVF specialist
is trying to replicate in the lab is the

259
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,010
moment of fertilization.

260
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,160
The IVF specialist is not
happy with just a sperm sample.

261
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,670
They're not happy with eggs
harvested by, uh, perhaps, uh,

262
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,200
a student in debt trying to get 10
or $20,000 for such a procedure.

263
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,080
They're not satisfied with just
the eggs are just the sperm.

264
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,500
The one moment they're trying to
create in the lab is not, you know, uh,

265
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,220
three weeks where you have a heartbeat
or six weeks where you have brainwaves or

266
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:00,110
a nine months just aided fetus.

267
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,800
The one moment the IVF specialist is
trying to create in the lab is the moment

268
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:11,450
of fertilization, which I think
tells us we do know when life begins.

269
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,370
We know it begins there particularly when
we think about other species a little

270
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:19,910
less controversial than our own.
We never hear horse breeders say,

271
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,560
I just don't know how to breed a horse.

272
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:25,370
I don't know when a horse becomes a horse
or you know someone who's, you know,

273
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,760
breeding dogs or have a
veterinarian and general saying,

274
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:31,280
I don't know when a dog becomes a dog
with other species. We have great clarity.

275
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,760
So why with our own species
when it comes to abortion,

276
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,320
do we claim to not know when life begins
or we claim that that it's confusing

277
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,650
when with these other species
or this other topic like IVF,

278
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:46,610
we have great clarity and we know
that moment to be fertilization.

279
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,490
When it comes to the
debate about abortion,

280
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,810
what I have found in debating people
formally and informally all over the world

281
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,170
is that it's less of a scientific
debate and more of a philosophical one.

282
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,540
Less a question of when does life begin?

283
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,300
Because really we know the
answer to that fertilization.

284
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,240
But more question about personhood,

285
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,560
which is not really a scientific
discussion but a philosophical one.

286
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,770
And there's a whole school
of thought by a philosopher,

287
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:21,530
Peter Singer from Princeton
University who argues abortion, um,

288
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,680
is justified and he even argue some
infanticide would be justified.

289
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,840
His School of thought comes from the
perspective of a definition of personhood

290
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,080
that would exclude preborn and some born
children and he would say a person is

291
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:40,770
someone who is rational, conscious
and self aware. And so I,

292
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,440
I have encountered people and
perhaps some of the room today, some,

293
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:47,730
some listening in who would argue that
even if biologically the embryo and the

294
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:51,840
fetus are human,
that philosophically they're not persons.

295
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:54,510
And that's why we could justify abortion.

296
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,320
That's why we wouldn't have to protect
embryos and fetuses the way it was.

297
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,590
Good for Captain Sullenberger to protect
the passengers on the airplane because

298
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,920
there are people but
embryos and fetuses aren't.

299
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,540
So then the question we have to wrestle
with is what is the right definition of

300
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,290
a person? Is a person, someone who's
rational, conscious and self aware.

301
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:18,180
So that if you're not those things,
you're not a person.

302
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,440
Well, what I like to do is
ask the question, why isn't,

303
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,520
let's say a one celled human
embryo at fertilization.

304
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,570
Why isn't that embryo rational,
conscious herself aware.

305
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,370
I think we know the answer to that is,

306
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,730
well the embryo is lacking the
Oregon necessary to be rational,

307
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,240
conscious and self aware and
that's the brain. So then we,

308
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:40,140
if we step back from and say,
well why?

309
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,560
Why doesn't the embryo at
fertilization have a brain?

310
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,240
We know the answer that will,

311
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,660
the embryo is the embryo
hasn't had time to develop.

312
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,800
The brain in time is reflected in our age.

313
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,710
So the one celled human embryo,
yes,

314
00:19:55,711 --> 00:20:00,450
isn't rational conscious herself aware
in that moment but ultimately isn't able

315
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,460
to do those things or be that
way because of how old she is.

316
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,170
Now let's contrast that with let's say
an Amoeba. The AMOEBA is not rational.

317
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:14,010
Conscious herself aware. Why? Well
because the Amoeba doesn't have a brain.

318
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,960
Well why doesn't the Amoeba have a brain?
Not because it hasn't developed it yet,

319
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,440
but because it's not within
its nature to develop a brain.

320
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,330
Because it's not within its nature to
be a thinking thing. So in other words,

321
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:32,331
and Amoeba is not rational conscious or
self aware because of what it is versus

322
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,390
a human embryo who is not rational,

323
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:40,410
conscious or self aware
because of how old she is.

324
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,660
So then that brings me back to
the question about human rights.

325
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Who gets human rights isn't the
necessary criteria simply being human.

326
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,920
If we were talking for
example about women's rights,

327
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,920
the necessary criteria for getting
the right would be being a woman.

328
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,960
If we were to talk
about children's rights,

329
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,210
the necessary criteria
would be being a child.

330
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,040
So when we talk about human rights, the
necessary criteria simply is being human,

331
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,000
not being human in a certain age.
And so the question is,

332
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,030
should personhood be grounded in how old
we are or should personhood be grounded

333
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,730
in what we are? Well,
to answer that question,

334
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,940
I find it helpful to go
to the United Nations.

335
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,170
The United Nations has a number of
different documents on human rights.

336
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,490
And as I have read these,

337
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,980
I've been astounded by several
things that have stood out to me.

338
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,700
The first is that in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

339
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,550
that a is a document
by the United Nations.

340
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,580
It very clearly says all members of the
human family have the right to life.

341
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,430
So in other words,
to get the right to life,

342
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,190
all that matters is that you're
a member of the human family.

343
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,710
But that document does reference
persons and it referenced persons,

344
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,760
references persons.

345
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:59,530
In article six in an article six of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

346
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,680
it says everyone has a right
to recognition everywhere
as a person before the

347
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:09,760
law. Well, let's define
our terms, who's everyone?

348
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,920
Earlier in the document and the preamble,

349
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:14,320
everyone's defined as all
members of the human family.

350
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,520
So this document is essentially declaring
if you're a member of the human family,

351
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,570
you should automatically
be considered a person.

352
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,750
Now to understand why
the UN would say that,

353
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:30,220
I think we need to put that document into
context for and understand the history

354
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,150
of how it came to be.

355
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,820
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was adopted in the late 1940s of

356
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,300
course we know when the early 1940s we
had the Holocaust where what happened?

357
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,540
Some humans were deprived of personhood
status based on some feature about them,

358
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:50,440
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation,

359
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,860
and so the UN comes up with
this document to say no.

360
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:57,430
The one thing we all have in common is
our human nature and to ensure that we

361
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:02,140
don't repeat the injustices of the past.
It codifies,

362
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:06,190
it puts in writing this idea that if
you're a member of the human family,

363
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,150
you ought to automatically be considered
a person and you should not be deprived

364
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:15,151
of your personhood rights based
on some quality like ethnicity,

365
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:20,560
religion, sexual orientation, and
in the same way, if that's true,

366
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,220
then we ought to say the same thing about
what we know to be a human embryo in a

367
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:25,054
human fetus.

368
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,100
The quality of age shouldn't be the
basis for which someone has personhood

369
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:34,480
status and therefore they ought to be
considered persons according to article

370
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,370
six,
by virtue of being human,

371
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,780
not by virtue of being a certain age that
enables them as a result of their age

372
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,651
to be rational,

373
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:46,651
conscious and self aware in that moment
their is what is consistent as their age

374
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,820
and therefore abilities change.
If you think about the question,

375
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,230
when do we become persons?

376
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:56,930
I think what's helpful is to look
at the timeline from the moment of

377
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,490
fertilization to the moment of birth.

378
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,210
And if we draw the line
anywhere after fertilization,

379
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:09,910
we're ultimately basing it based on a
developmental stage or based on an age

380
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,790
which would fly in the face of human
rights doctrines which aren't to uh,

381
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,180
acknowledge human rights
based on abilities or aid.
But instead of knowledge,

382
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:24,320
human rights based on being human. And
we know at the moment of fertilization,

383
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:29,720
but oneself embryo has all the genetic
material distinguishing her from the

384
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:32,060
mother and the father.
And from that point forward,

385
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,400
you're going to change your appearance.
You're going to change your abilities,

386
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:35,480
you're going to change your age,

387
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,740
but you're human identity distinguishing
you from everyone else is going to be

388
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:44,741
what remains the same as I have dialogue
with a lot of people over the years.

389
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,540
Not only have I found the question of
personhood being raised in conversation,

390
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:55,930
but I have also found the question of the
dependency of the pre born child being

391
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:01,070
used as grounds to justify abortion.
Where some people will say, look,

392
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:03,230
if if someone has an infant
and they don't want the infant,

393
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:05,960
any of us in the room are
capable of caring for the infant,

394
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,060
but if someone doesn't want their fetus,

395
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,330
none of us in the room are
capable of caring for the fetus.

396
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,600
Therefore a woman should have
a right to have an abortion.

397
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,910
When I hear that argument,

398
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:21,911
what crosses my mind is does the greater
dependency of the fetus make the mother

399
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,960
less responsible or more responsible?

400
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,161
Well,

401
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:36,161
I found myself in conversation a few years
ago with a different student and this

402
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,150
young woman said to me,
look,

403
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:43,151
if you have a baby in one hand and a fetus
and the other hand you obviously pick

404
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:44,594
the baby.

405
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,780
And I thought to myself for a
moment about babies versus fetuses.

406
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,890
As it just said a moment ago, you know,
if there was a baby in this room napping,

407
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,920
we could all leave and come
back and the baby would be fine.

408
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,480
But if there was a fetus left out on the
podium here and we all leave and come

409
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:02,570
back, the fetus is going to be
dead. So I thought in a sense,

410
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:07,130
babies are stronger and fetuses are
weaker in relation to each other.

411
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:09,440
So I thought what,
what the student actually said to me,

412
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,300
although she didn't verbalize it,
was this,

413
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,590
if you have a strong person in one hand
and you have a weaker or person in the

414
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:19,040
other hand,
you obviously pick the stronger person.

415
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,090
And when I kind of translated in
my mind what she'd said to that,

416
00:26:23,091 --> 00:26:27,050
I thought to myself, you don't, civil
societies actually do just the opposite.

417
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,820
We tend to prioritize weaker people
rather than stronger people. Again,

418
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:36,230
the captain prioritizes the
passengers are ought to and so forth.

419
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,390
And so I thought to myself,

420
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,500
how do I communicate that I think civil
societies actually would prioritize

421
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,110
weaker people ahead of stronger
people and as it should happen,

422
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:48,390
a story came to my mind.
And again, as I said,

423
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:52,680
I love telling stories is the story that
came to my mind, uh, relates to this.

424
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,700
And so I said to the student, what you
just said about babies versus fetuses.

425
00:26:56,701 --> 00:27:00,840
Reminds me of a picture of my friend
posted on Facebook and I said it was a

426
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:05,400
picture of a river and in the middle of
the river was something slightly curvy

427
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:06,234
sticking up.

428
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,320
And in reality it was the kind of picture
that I would keep swiping away if it

429
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:11,580
hadn't been for the caption.

430
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,790
And the caption my friend posted
with this picture was this,

431
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,130
my husband is a hero.

432
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,930
And then my friend went on to explain
why as I then explained to the student.

433
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,160
My friend wrote,

434
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:27,690
my husband is a paramedic and is it at
midnight he was called to the scene of a

435
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:31,050
car accident.
A woman had been driving down the road.

436
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,950
She lost control of her vehicle
and is it spun out of control.

437
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,970
It landed in a nearby river.
When my friend's husband got to the scene,

438
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,260
he saw that that woman driver was
sitting on the roof of her sinking car,

439
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,650
holding her 10 month old baby in her arms.

440
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,620
My friend's husband jumps in the water,

441
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,680
swims towards the car and then realizes
he can only take one person at a time to

442
00:27:55,261 --> 00:28:00,000
shore. I looked at the
student I was dialoguing with
and I asked her a question,

443
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,620
who do you think he picked first?
Obviously she knew the answer.

444
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,280
Will the baby correct? I said, why?

445
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,540
If you had to explain the reasoning why
he picked the baby over the mob to take

446
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,870
first, what would it be? She
said, well obviously, cause
if he picked the mom first,

447
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,460
then by the time he got back to the car,

448
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:20,520
the baby could have rolled in the
water and drowned. Correct. I said,

449
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:25,521
so would you say it's fair to summarize
your response to this story by

450
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:29,160
acknowledging that you believe when
you have a strong person in one hand,

451
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:32,790
like the mom and a weaker person
in the other hand, like the baby,

452
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,710
that we ought to prioritize the needs
of weaker people? She said, of course.

453
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,720
And then I brought it back to her original
point about babies versus fetuses.

454
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,030
And I said anyone could care for a baby
and a baby could be left alone for a

455
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:50,790
while, but only one person can care
for a fetus and cannot be left alone.

456
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,320
So in a sense the baby is stronger
like the mom in the story,

457
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,400
whereas the fetus is weaker like
the infant in the mom's arms.

458
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,780
And since you believe that we should
prioritize weaker and more vulnerable

459
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:08,781
people ahead of stronger people than
shouldn't we actually prioritize the needs

460
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,490
of the preborn trialed.

461
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,960
That point was something that was
emphasized very clearly in a different

462
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:22,230
encounter that I had through
what someone shared with me.

463
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,860
I was once at an exhibit that was
looking at parallels between historical

464
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:32,040
injustices and present Dan justices.

465
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,400
One of the parallels being the
Rwandan genocide and abortion,

466
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,950
the argument being that at the
time the Tutsis were slaughtered,

467
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,510
they weren't deemed to be equal to the
WHO to extremists but rather inferior and

468
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:51,910
because they were deemed to be inferior,

469
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,940
the dehumanizing actions were justified.

470
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,950
The parallel then being that someone
generally who supports abortion does not

471
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:04,540
say I think embryos and fetuses are equal
to us and I want to kill not at all,

472
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,840
but instead deem the embryo and fetus to
be inferior and therefore rationalizes

473
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:14,800
actions which would take away that
human's rights because they don't consider

474
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:18,280
them equal the argument than being
if we were wrong in the past about

475
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:20,080
dehumanizing one group of humans,

476
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,860
could we be wrong in the present about
dehumanizing and other group of humans.

477
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,050
So one of the signs that this exhibit
that I was standing with was this one and

478
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:33,190
a woman came past and stopped and began
to speak with me and she told me that

479
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:38,191
she was from Rwanda and she told me that
most of her family had been killed in

480
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:43,381
the genocide from the mid nineties and I
will admit I became very self conscious

481
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,950
standing representing this sign because
I began to wonder if perhaps this woman

482
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,920
would be offended by the
comparison that I was making,

483
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,800
but instead of assuming and wondering,

484
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,240
I thought the best thing I can do is seek
to understand and ask her a question.

485
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,370
And so I looked at this woman and I said,

486
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:08,371
given all you have told me about
the brutality that your family were,

487
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,690
your family members were victims of what
you just barely escaped by fleeing the

488
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:18,100
country before things got really bad.
How do you feel?

489
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,190
I said about this comparison I'm making.

490
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,330
And she stepped back and she
moved her gaze really for me,

491
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:28,960
she hadn't really looked that closely at
the picture and then she just stood in

492
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:32,980
silence for about 20 seconds.
Is she looked at this poster

493
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,050
and then finally she pointed to the
picture of the abort a child and she said,

494
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,510
that's worse

495
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,980
because at least my family
could try to run away.

496
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:55,130
This woman recognized the
greater, uh, humans vulnerability,

497
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,990
the greater another's
responsibility to wards that well.

498
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,610
So if we think about that,
that first quality that I have identified,

499
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,580
that inspiring people seem to have,

500
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,370
that people I've dialogued
with have shared with me.

501
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,930
It is the idea that we ought to put
others ahead of ourselves even when we

502
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:18,411
failed.

503
00:32:18,411 --> 00:32:23,411
We know deep down that that's something
to aspire towards and it's clear that

504
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:26,690
the human embryo and fetus are an other,

505
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,550
just like the passengers in the airplane.

506
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,960
The next point that I wanted to
address today is the second quality.

507
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:37,130
I have found an inspiring people,
which is that they have perspective.

508
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,770
One of my favorite authors is Doctor
Victor Frankl who has written the book

509
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,750
man's search for meaning.

510
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,100
I love books and I love gifting
books to other people. And Man,

511
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:54,101
search for meaning is probably one the
leading book that I have given to a lot

512
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:58,430
of people. The other one would be
essential ism. Bye Bye Greg Kanaan,

513
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:01,430
which is a phenomenal book, but not
what I'm here to talk about right now.

514
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:04,250
But man, search for meaning I've
given away to so many people.

515
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:09,550
And this book was written by a man
who was a holocaust survivor and a

516
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:14,540
psychiatrist. And so man, search for
meaning is really a two part book.

517
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:17,660
The first part is about his
experiences in the concentration camps.

518
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,840
And the second part of his book
is his theories in psychology.

519
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,690
And one of the points that he
makes in his book is the following.

520
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:27,830
He said that he observed
both as a prisoner and as a
psychiatrist who in a sense

521
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,230
as a prisoner, was studying human
behavior as he was being victimized in,

522
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:33,350
in the concentration camps.

523
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,860
One of the things he observed is that
he would have expected all of the guards

524
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:40,790
to be cruel and most of them were.
But he said every now and then,

525
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,060
surprisingly amidst all the cruel guards,

526
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:49,061
there was someone who was kind and
then he said amongst the prisoners,

527
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,220
there were some who when treated like
animals became like animals and were cruel

528
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,040
to their fellow prisoners.
But there were others,

529
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:01,760
he said regardless of how
brutally they were treated,

530
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:05,510
maintained their humanity and
in they're starving state would,

531
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:09,950
would save morsels of food, not for
themselves, but for a fellow prisoner.

532
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,200
And when Doctor Frankel
makes this observation, it
draws him to this conclusion.

533
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:21,220
Someone can have a similar experience
but still choose a different response to

534
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,810
the experience.
And he says,

535
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:31,811
the last of the human freedoms that can
never be taken from us is the freedom to

536
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:36,821
choose how to respond to
the situation that we're in.

537
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,380
That is what perspective is inspired.

538
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:45,650
People who have perspective can be in a
horrible circumstance in a sense beyond

539
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:46,490
their control.

540
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,940
But the recognize what is still within
their control is their response to that

541
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:54,350
circumstance is their attitude.

542
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,560
And Doctor Frankl has come up with a
mathematical equation that explains the

543
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:05,390
power of perspective because in the
concentration camps he saw a lot of

544
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:06,224
suffering,

545
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,550
suffering that was so bad that some people
sought to commit suicide because they

546
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:13,640
despaired.
And Doctor Frankel said early on in his,

547
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,840
in his time at the concentration camps,
he decided he would never kill himself.

548
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,090
Moreover would he not commit suicide.

549
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,690
But he was going to try to dissuade
his fellow prisoners from doing that.

550
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,960
And he discovered the way to try to
convince them not to despair was to help

551
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:30,530
them find meaning.

552
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:36,430
And so his mathematical equation was
this d equals s minus m despair is

553
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:40,170
suffering without meaning.

554
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,900
He recognized in the present circumstances
removing the suffering was near

555
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:46,734
impossible,

556
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,770
but he could decrease despair to the
extent that he increased meaning and Dr.

557
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,200
Franco years after coming out of the
concentration camps sites and example,

558
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:04,201
where where this equation in a sense was
brought to life with a young teenager,

559
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:07,420
he learned about in Texas who
had become a quadriplegic.

560
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,720
Lot of times when people are asked,
you know,

561
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,320
imagine if you were suddenly paralyzed,
would you want to keep living?

562
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:18,820
And when we're not in that state,
we think, no I wouldn't. Well,

563
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:23,230
Dr. Franco sites and example of someone
who found herself not being asked that

564
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:26,620
question in a hypothetical, but that
was reality. She became quadriplegic.

565
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,690
She would spend her days watching
the news, reading the news,

566
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,080
and whenever she came across a story
of someone who is going through a very

567
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:38,290
difficult time of someone who
was suffering in some way,

568
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,940
she would ask an assistant to bring
a stick and place it in her mouth.

569
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,480
She would then use that stick bend over
to press keys on a keyboard so she could

570
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:54,991
write letters of encouragement to the
people she'd read about in the news.

571
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,790
And Doctor Frankel said,

572
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:03,030
her life is filled with an
abundant sense of meaning.

573
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:11,580
We decreased despair in the presence
of suffering to the extent we increase

574
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,630
meaning.
That's what I mean by perspective.

575
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:21,670
I saw the power of perspective up close
and personally a few years ago when I

576
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:25,200
had the privilege of spending an afternoon
with this young man, Nick Wojciech,

577
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,300
how many of you have heard
of this motivational speaker?

578
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,640
I did a quick Google search as to whether,
um,

579
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,390
you had a toxic Google with nick for
Trish and I don't think you have.

580
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:38,620
So I highly recommended
this guy's hilarious. So it
helps that he has an accent.

581
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:41,820
He's from Australia. I just think
accents are cool and uh, uh,

582
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,480
but he's really funny.
So anyways,

583
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,500
I know someone who knows
someone who knows nick and um,

584
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,380
he was coming to the city. I used
to live in, in Canada, in Calgary.

585
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,070
And so I thought I got to try and meet
this guy because I talk about his story

586
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,380
so often.
So sure enough,

587
00:37:56,381 --> 00:38:01,330
he was a willing to meet with me and
my colleagues and we surprised my

588
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:02,081
colleagues with him.

589
00:38:02,081 --> 00:38:04,750
They didn't know that he was
coming and they all knew his story.

590
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:06,280
So when he came to the office,

591
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:10,330
they were shocked like there
was no way this isn't you.

592
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,880
And then nick looks at everyone,
he goes, I'm not nik void church.

593
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,720
I'm his stunt double.
So anyways,

594
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,090
nick is a funny guy. He lives a full
life. He loves traveling the world,

595
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,880
speaking to millions of
people and inspiring them,

596
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:28,960
getting access to audiences I could
only dream of Getty access to.

597
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,820
And it's because of what he doesn't have.
It's because of his lack of limps.

598
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,500
He at this disability as an opportunity,

599
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,850
but he didn't always have that attitude.
He didn't always have that perspective.

600
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,590
When Nick was a child,

601
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:49,591
he was bullied and taunted and made fun
of so much that one night while lying in

602
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:51,790
the family bathtub,

603
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,160
he thought about rolling over and drowning
himself in an act of suicide. Now.

604
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:58,570
He obviously didn't do that,

605
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,500
but what's also obvious is that
his circumstances didn't change.

606
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,800
He still lacks the LIMS now
that he lacked in that bathtub.

607
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,150
So what's changed his perspective?

608
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,170
Instead of thinking about what his
lack of limbs prevents him from doing,

609
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:19,410
he started to think about what his
lack of limbs and enabled him to do.

610
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,610
The afternoon I spent with him,
I spent also with another family.

611
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:29,611
He had invited along and that family
included this two year old girl Brooke,

612
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,800
and as you can see,
Brooke doesn't have arms.

613
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,960
Nick's lack of limbs was not
diagnosed in Utero by ultrasound.

614
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:42,760
It was only discovered when he was born.
Brooks lack of limbs,

615
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,620
her lack of arms on the other hand was
discovered while her mom was pregnant via

616
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:52,621
ultrasound and when the mom went for a
routine ultrasound and they saw the fetus

617
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:56,740
didn't have arms,
the doctors offered to do an abortion.

618
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,060
Brooke's parents said no,
they didn't have a smartphone at the time.

619
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:06,020
So they went home. And where
do you think they went? Kugel.

620
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,710
I've told this story so much, but I have
to say I've never told it at Google.

621
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:11,960
So I think that's really cool.
So uh,

622
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:16,961
they went onto Google and they typed no
arms enter and the first hit was Neva

623
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,890
Boyd change and they spent the rest
of that pregnancy looking at videos of

624
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:25,040
someone who was like their daughter.

625
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,390
And then an opportunity came two years
after she was born for them to drive

626
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:32,420
eight hours through the mountains from
British Columbia to Alberta in western

627
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:37,421
Canada to see in the flash someone
who looked like their daughter.

628
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,010
And when I saw nick and Brooke Interact,

629
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,040
I thought he is uniquely positioned to
motivate and Inspire Brooke in a way her

630
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:50,210
parents can't, in a way her sister
can't, in a way, none of us could.

631
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,870
And it's because of what he doesn't have.

632
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,710
His obstacle is now his opportunity.

633
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,570
That's the power of perspective.

634
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,820
I think that can be then obviously
related to the abortion discussion.

635
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,300
How can we change our perspective
in an unplanned crisis situation?

636
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,210
In another occasion where
I was on a college campus,

637
00:41:14,211 --> 00:41:15,740
a student came to the microphone and said,

638
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:19,610
my stepmom had an abortion because she
was told her fetus was going to die at

639
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:22,820
birth.
Are you telling me she was wrong?

640
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,690
And I first expressed sympathy to the
students saying that I was sorry for the

641
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:33,830
suffering that his stepmom went through
and I don't pretend to know what that

642
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:36,530
must've been like and I said to him,

643
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:39,020
you're a question is a fair one and
I'm going to answer it, but I said,

644
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:39,920
if you'll bear with me,

645
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:44,810
I believe I can best address your
question by engaging you in a dialogue by

646
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,830
asking you some questions. Would
that be okay? He said, sure.

647
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,473
I said,
okay,

648
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,050
well the question I have for you actually
involve setting aside the abortion

649
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:58,580
topic for just a moment and entering
into a thought experiment. I said,

650
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:02,900
I want you to imagine that someone you
love dearly on the opposite end of the

651
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:06,380
country calls you,
calls you today and says,

652
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,990
I've just been diagnosed with cancer and
I've been given four weeks left to live.

653
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,720
I looked at this student and I said,
would you wait until week three,

654
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,750
day six to hop on a plane and go say
goodbye to the person you love or I said,

655
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,580
would you take the next flight out and
savor every moment of every day of the

656
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:33,470
next four weeks with the person you love?
And he said, well, the second option.

657
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,220
I said, me too, and here's what
I think this says about us.

658
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,960
What do you think it says about us is we
recognize when we have a minimal amount

659
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:43,700
of time left with someone we love,

660
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,570
we want to maximize the minimal time.

661
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,150
We don't want to cut short the already
short time we have that's perspective.

662
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,100
So I said,
let's take that principle,

663
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:58,550
that perspective and let's apply it to
the situation your stepmom found herself

664
00:42:58,551 --> 00:43:01,070
in before that poor prenatal diagnosis.

665
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,160
She probably thought she had 50 years
with her child and in one moment of

666
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,870
hearing that news,
your baby's going to die at birth.

667
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:13,490
She went from having 50 years
to roughly 20 weeks. I said,

668
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,680
based on your analysis of
the thought experiment,

669
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:20,860
why would we cut short the already
short time we have left instead?

670
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:26,360
Wouldn't we want to savor every moment
of every day of the next 20 weeks with a

671
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:31,361
child that we love now upon the
birth happening in the trial dying?

672
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,670
Would there be sorrow, grief? Absolutely.

673
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,780
But if you have the abortion
and you want it to be pregnant

674
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:44,000
with there be sorrow and grief.
Yes.

675
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:48,950
So having the abortion instead of
carrying on 20 more weeks is not going to

676
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:53,330
spare sadness,
but it will rob you of the gift of time.

677
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,750
And that's again where we
want the power of perspective.

678
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,670
The final point that I wanted to address
this morning was that quality of,

679
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,440
of inspiring people,

680
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:08,030
which is to do the right
thing even when it's hard.

681
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,240
If you think about it,
that fits with your code of conduct.

682
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:14,570
I know you have a slogan here of don't
be evil. And when alphabet came to be,

683
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:18,110
it came and got a little broader,
uh, to do the right thing.

684
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,530
But we know that we should do the
right thing even when it's hard.

685
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,840
And I think that's relevant
in the abortion discussion.

686
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:30,770
If we think for a moment
about the circumstances that
a pregnant woman could be

687
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:31,604
in,

688
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,680
and if we think about the reasons that
were prompt someone to have an abortion,

689
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:36,600
we can acknowledge this is hard.

690
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,130
Magine being pregnant from
a rape and being in poverty,

691
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:43,410
having health problems,
uh,

692
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,140
just not wanting the child
or being really young,

693
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:50,520
having no support in each
of these situations. What,

694
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,120
wherever someone sits on the abortion
debate, what side of the fence they're on,

695
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:59,360
there's agreement to be pregnant and port
be hard to be pregnant and young would

696
00:45:00,221 --> 00:45:05,221
be hard to be pregnant from rape
would be excrutiatingly difficult.

697
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,540
There's no denying the difficulty
in these circumstances.

698
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:16,470
The question is what ought we
do when circumstances are hard?

699
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:21,010
Well, let's imagine the circumstances are
these, but not with a pregnant person,

700
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:22,840
but someone who's
parenting this born child.

701
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,510
Would it be easy or hard to take
care of this child and poverty hard?

702
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It would be easy or hard to to
care for this child and be 14 hard.

703
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,680
Would it be easy or hard to parent this
child knowing every day you look in her

704
00:45:38,681 --> 00:45:42,880
face, you're reminded her father
was a rapist. It would be hard.

705
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:49,120
Would we ever allow someone to end this
child's life because the circumstances

706
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:49,954
for the parent

707
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,830
or heart
wouldn't.

708
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,100
We would say we need to do the
right thing even when it's hard.

709
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,060
And so I would suggest in the
various encounters I've had that we,

710
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,690
that we have the same attitude
when it comes to this life.

711
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,730
Since we know this is a living human
being who according to article six of the

712
00:46:09,731 --> 00:46:14,530
UN ought to be considered a person who's
simply younger than the rest of us.

713
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:17,980
And since human rights aren't grounded
in age, they're grounded and being human,

714
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,120
then we ought to say,

715
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:24,121
here is we say there we have to do
the right thing even when it's hard.

716
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,230
And that brings to mind several people
I've had the privilege of meeting who I

717
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:34,231
believe by their stories have inspired
me to do the right thing when it's hard

718
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:36,610
in my own life,
the way they've done that.

719
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:41,190
And there's a few months ago I spoke in
Guatemala and I spoke alongside another

720
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,330
speaker.
Uh,

721
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:46,840
my friend here Lyanna Lyanna and I
met for the first time in Guatemala.

722
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:50,710
She speaks both spink Spanglish,
she speaks English and Spanish.

723
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,690
I on the other hand,
only speak English.

724
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:56,170
And so I had a translator
translate for the audience by talk,

725
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,820
but because she's spoken Spanish,

726
00:46:57,821 --> 00:47:00,040
that meant when she gave her
talk I couldn't understand it.

727
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,420
So it wasn't until we got
to the restaurant after
giving our first presentation

728
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:05,980
in, uh, in, in the hotel,

729
00:47:05,981 --> 00:47:08,740
we were staying in that evening that we
shared our stories and got to know each

730
00:47:08,741 --> 00:47:12,940
other. And as we were talking,
she mentioned that she
was 37 and I said, no way,

731
00:47:12,941 --> 00:47:17,170
I'm 36. And then a short while later
she mentioned that she had a daughter.

732
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,290
And I said, well, how old is
your daughter? And she said 25

733
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:26,730
and then I did the math and I thought 25
years ago I was 11 which means 25 years

734
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:28,091
ago,

735
00:47:28,091 --> 00:47:33,091
Leanna was 12 and Leanna told me her
story that growing up in Mexico City when

736
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:36,280
she was 12 one day,
two men kidnapped her,

737
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,980
held her for two days
and brutally raped her.

738
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,810
She got pregnant from that rape and when
she went to the doctor and discovered

739
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:44,021
this,

740
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:49,021
the doctors offered her an abortion and
Leanna asked the doctors if abortion

741
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:55,060
would help her forget the rape if it
would help ease her pain and suffering.

742
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,390
And the doctor said,
well no it won't do that.

743
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,470
And she realized in that moment that if
ending her baby's life wouldn't benefit

744
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:05,290
anybody,
she wasn't going to do it.

745
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:08,350
And Leanna said if abortion
wasn't going to heal anything,

746
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:12,640
I didn't see the point. She said, I
just knew I had somebody inside my body.

747
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,350
I never thought about who her
biological father wise, she was my kid,

748
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:23,220
she was inside of me and just knowing she
needed me made me want to get a job to

749
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:26,800
help her.
But in an interview Leanna did.

750
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:30,250
She shared that although that was
her attitude about the pregnancy,

751
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:32,830
the rape itself caused her
life to become a living hell.

752
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,200
No matter how many times she showered,

753
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:37,420
she could not get rid of the
feeling that she was dirty.

754
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,400
And so she started to entertain
thoughts or she thought about committing

755
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,060
suicide. But when she thought
about committing suicide,

756
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,500
she remembered she was pregnant and she
had to think not only about herself but

757
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:53,470
about the child.
And so she didn't kill herself.

758
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,970
And she looked at me in that restaurant
in Guatemala and she said to me,

759
00:48:57,971 --> 00:49:00,640
Stephanie,
I saved my daughter's life,

760
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:03,220
but she saved mine.

761
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,550
In another story of an inspiring person
I've met who I believe brings this third

762
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:10,630
principle to life,

763
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,650
I'm reminded of a young woman by the name
of Veronica who was a college student

764
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:18,370
who got pregnant unexpectedly.
And um,

765
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,540
her boyfriend wanted her
to have an abortion and her
friends wanted her to have

766
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:23,374
an abortion,

767
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,250
but she ended up telling her parents and
moving back home and getting support.

768
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,370
And she sent me this picture of
her and her daughter, Emilia.

769
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,150
And I'd like to read for you what she
said to me when she sent this picture.

770
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:38,440
She said, the picture I've enclosed of
Amelia, and I doesn't fully show my face,

771
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,510
but it's an important picture to me.

772
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:45,550
Emilia became very ill with respiratory
problems around seven months,

773
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,050
which meant a lot of nights
dealing with fever, congestion,

774
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,280
pain control,

775
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,390
and a sad little baby who kept waking up
due to having trouble breathing in her

776
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,740
sleep.
She said,

777
00:49:56,741 --> 00:50:00,550
I took this picture one night when I
decided to let her sleep on my chest

778
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,150
instead of the crib and she
slept throughout the night.

779
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:07,030
And so I did that every night until
she was better. And she said to me,

780
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:09,250
it represents what we do as mothers,

781
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,600
that we stop looking at ourselves
as individuals with needs.

782
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,260
And instead we begin to look at how we
can serve another and therefore love

783
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,673
another.

784
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,040
And with doing that she said
comes learning to love ourselves.

785
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,670
And finally I'm reminded
of my friend Debbie.

786
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,750
Debbie's story is similar to Leanna's
in Veronica Veronica's in that she was

787
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:44,060
unexpectedly pregnant,
but unlike Leanna's and Veronica's story,

788
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,650
Debbie had an abortion.

789
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,460
And she deeply regrets having made that
choice but realizes like all of us,

790
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,150
she cannot undo her past.

791
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:58,810
But you came convicted that if she had
regrets and she knew the impact of her

792
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:03,410
choice back then,
that she lives with now,

793
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:07,220
that she would have wanted
someone to tell their story.

794
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:12,700
And so she's decided to tell her story
to try to help people think differently

795
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,530
when it comes to the crisis they're in.

796
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,190
And so she travels to different audiences
and she talks about her choice and she

797
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:20,330
talks about regretting it.

798
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,710
And once she was in an audience where
a student had a friend on route to an

799
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:27,080
abortion clinic and he's
simply sent his friend a text,

800
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,760
there's a woman here who regrets her
abortion. And the friend texted back why?

801
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:37,490
And so this young woman was willing to
sit down with Debbie and listen to not

802
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:38,540
only Debbie story,

803
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:43,550
but give Debbie and opportunity to listen
to her and what her reasonings were

804
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,460
for abortion.
And she felt she had no support,

805
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,020
that she couldn't get through that
pregnancy and parenting. So Debbie said,

806
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:54,200
all support. You and your
friend here, we'll support you.

807
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,680
That girl didn't go to the
abortion clinic that day,

808
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,950
but she did go the next day to hear her
child's heartbeat and then she decided

809
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:07,880
to carry through with that pregnancy and
several months later this baby girl was

810
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:12,840
born and to wrap everything up
before we move it into questions,

811
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:17,030
they just want to leave you with the
thought that whether it's this teenage mom

812
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:20,480
who not only is delighted
that she has this baby,

813
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,470
but she encouraged another friend to
carry through with the pregnancy that that

814
00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:25,640
friend is grateful to have.

815
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:30,970
Whether it's this teenage mom or whether
it's Debbie or whether it's Lee Hannah

816
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,050
or Veronica,
whether it's little brook or her parents,

817
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:41,290
whether it's a captain Sullenberger
who prioritized the passengers on his

818
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:45,080
airplane, whether it's Nick
Vori church that you remember.

819
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:46,190
All these people in think,

820
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:50,840
you know they're inspiring because they
put others ahead of themselves because

821
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:55,841
they had perspective and because they
did the right thing even when it was

822
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:59,690
really hard. And that's the challenge
that I leave all of you with today.

823
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,830
Thank you very much.

824
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,510
At this point I would be happy
to engage you in a dialogue,

825
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:14,210
a conversation and a
question and answer periods.

826
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:18,560
So if you have questions about the topic
in general or anything I've shared,

827
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,870
I would be happy to answer them in.

828
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:25,500
Mark has a microphone over there
and in tea we'll take it around.

829
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,040
So

830
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,880
any questions?

831
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:31,890
I was wondering how do you suggest
creating a dialogue like this in an

832
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:36,600
environment which is almost entirely
for abortion? So how do you,

833
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:41,280
how do you even start this conversation
when you know there was such a strong

834
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:44,130
outward resistance to a
pro life point of view?

835
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,081
You don't,

836
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:48,440
hopefully it came through in the stories
that I shared that I think a lot of the

837
00:53:48,441 --> 00:53:50,840
times the way we start conversations,

838
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:54,350
whether we think it's an environment
that's going to be friendly or not so

839
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:57,890
friendly is to start conversations
with open ended questions.

840
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,730
So I will ask people,
what do you think about abortion?

841
00:54:01,731 --> 00:54:03,860
And if that might seem
like a really random,

842
00:54:03,861 --> 00:54:05,870
not so much lunch table conversation,

843
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:09,770
you could maybe find an article in the
newspaper or something that you read

844
00:54:09,771 --> 00:54:12,350
about online that somehow
relates and bring it up and see,

845
00:54:12,351 --> 00:54:16,640
did you see that article about
x, Y, or z? And it made me think,

846
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,270
what do you think about this topic?
What do you think about abortion?

847
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:24,650
And really seek to understand where that,
where that person is coming from.

848
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:28,460
And to give you an example,
once on an airplane, um, a
guy sitting next to me, we,

849
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:31,700
we shared what our jobs were and
he asked what I did and I said, I,

850
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,900
I go and give talks about abortion. And
he said, really? That's fascinating.

851
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:39,860
And I just looked at him and said, what
do you think about abortion? And he said,

852
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:43,700
I think it's necessary sometimes. And
I just asked another question. I said,

853
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:48,890
when do you think it's necessary? And he
said, like, cases of rape. And I said,

854
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:49,430
you know,

855
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:54,430
I agree with you that rape is a horrible
evil and we need to not only support

856
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,570
the woman who's been victimized,

857
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,670
but we need far more serious consequences
for the rapist. And then I said to him,

858
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,600
I have to ask myself a question though,
and the question I have to ask myself,

859
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:06,434
is this,

860
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,910
is it fair to give the death
penalty to the innocent child?

861
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:17,210
And his passenger looked
at me and he said, well, I
never thought of it that way.

862
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:22,130
And so I didn't go in boarding my
plane with the intention to, you know,

863
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,690
speak about abortion.

864
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,110
I just asked a few questions when
someone asks me what my job was.

865
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:29,690
Any other questions?

866
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,560
All right.
So I have a friend who says he's pro life.

867
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,920
Like if you were with a woman who's
pregnant here at rarely dare everything in

868
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:38,600
his power to persuade her to choose life.

869
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,700
But he says he wouldn't want to impose
that decision. So what else? What is your,

870
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,451
so that's,

871
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:47,610
that's a common perspective people have
is I feel this way and I might even

872
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:48,361
encourage you,

873
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:53,040
but I can't force my views on human so
far is I don't think the law, for example,

874
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:56,220
should reflect how I would live.
And when someone says that,

875
00:55:56,221 --> 00:56:00,540
I think analogies are helpful, I
would, I would ask a question and, and,

876
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:02,670
and draw an analogy out
of it. I would say, well,

877
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:06,720
would you say that you're
against rape? Yes. Uh,

878
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:11,550
and if someone was going to commit rape,
would you try to stop them?

879
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:12,780
Yes.

880
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,560
And do you think if you're incapable of
stopping them and they actually commit

881
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:20,790
rape,
that we ought to have laws that ban rate.

882
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:25,420
So there are consequences for that person.
And if they say yes, then I would say,

883
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:25,781
okay,

884
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:30,781
so you clearly think under some
circumstances we should have laws that say

885
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:33,730
certain actions are wrong.

886
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:37,960
So then why when it comes to abortion,

887
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:43,110
would you treat it differently if
abortion ends the life of a human being?

888
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,610
Now if abortion doesn't end
the life of a human being,

889
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,730
then I think we can call into question.
Should we have any laws against it.

890
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:54,240
But since we know we're dealing
with a human being that's living,

891
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,730
then if the act of abortion
ends that human being's life,

892
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,370
it's not enough for me to say,
I personally won't kill someone.

893
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:04,420
But if you want to kill someone, that's
you're right. If the facts are true,

894
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,320
if the evidence is there, we have to
go to its logical conclusion and say,

895
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,770
if this action end someone's
life, it's wrong. Not just for me,

896
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:13,000
but it's wrong for everyone.

897
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:17,350
And we ought to have laws against it
as we do with rape and other types of

898
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,300
murder and and other things like that.

899
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,470
So we can't determine whether we should
quote unquote force our views on other

900
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:27,100
people until we know what the
view is. Like, for example,

901
00:57:27,101 --> 00:57:29,530
a lot of times people say,
I support a woman's right to choose.

902
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,130
We have to finish our sentence. That's
not grammatically correct. Choose what?

903
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:33,970
It's hanging there.

904
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,420
I support a woman's right to choose what
color shoes to wear with her outfit.

905
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:40,840
Sure. What kind of ice cream
she thinks is the best. Sure.

906
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:44,590
But I don't support a woman's right
to choose to kill an innocent child

907
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:49,240
regardless of the child's age. So
in a similar way, if I said to you,

908
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:53,830
I support a man's right to take, you would
have to ask me to define what I mean.

909
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:58,210
Take what and if it's a support of man's
right to take his bag and walk out of

910
00:57:58,211 --> 00:57:59,860
the room,
totally okay.

911
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:03,610
But I don't support a man's right to
take someone else's bag out of the room.

912
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,590
So we need to define what we mean by
choice, by take by, by all of this stuff.

913
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,740
And if in defining it evidence leads us
to the fact that we're actually ending

914
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:16,750
someone's life or violating
a human right then,

915
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:21,780
then we have to create a structure legally
that bands that for the interests of

916
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:23,770
our fellow human beings.

917
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,110
Any other questions?

918
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:32,140
I haven't really quite formulated my
question on top of using that same analogy

919
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:35,130
then. Um, what could kind of,

920
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:38,860
what incarcerating a mother be when,

921
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:40,750
when we're talking about the issue,

922
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,250
the issue being that woman do not
have enough support right now. Um,

923
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,970
so what would, what good would, um,

924
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,400
making it illegal do for the woman and,

925
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:55,720
and showing her that there is support
for her? That there is like another way?

926
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:01,180
Very good question. So certainly I
would say it's not just one strategy.

927
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:06,170
Add the uh, you know, and I know
abandoning all other strategies, the,

928
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,860
the slogan I like to use is
make abortion unthinkable,

929
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:13,270
but in believing it ought
to be unthinkable based
on the evidence of dealing

930
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:16,190
with a human being and
believing in human rights, um,

931
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,200
believing it ought to be unthinkable
doesn't exclude me from saying I also

932
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:24,740
believe it ought to be. I do believe it
ought to be illegal and unthinkable. Um,

933
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,340
what would be the consequences for
woman who violates the law? Well,

934
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:30,620
the first point is no woman is
currently violating the law.

935
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,320
So we're not talking about,
for example,

936
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:36,440
putting women in jail
who had had abortions.

937
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,020
What we're talking
about is a hypothetical.

938
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:43,280
At some future point when the law changes,
what ought the consequences be?

939
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,160
And even when we say something is illegal,
you know,

940
00:59:46,161 --> 00:59:50,600
it's illegal to steal what
the consequences are for
any individual who steals

941
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,370
vary from case to case.

942
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:56,900
You might find a situation where a woman
has an abortion under emotional duress.

943
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:59,780
She does not actually is not freely
choosing it. It's against the law.

944
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:03,200
But someone's pressuring her or forcing
her to go there against her will.

945
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,510
So that would be one example.

946
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:10,550
Or you have cases like Andrea Yates where
you have a woman who drowned her born

947
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:13,790
children in the bathtub and believe
in her case, she was not found,

948
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,310
she was found not criminally responsible.
Um,

949
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,880
her actions were still wrong
and they're still unlawful,

950
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:24,290
but a case was made or could be made in
circumstances like this where someone

951
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:27,740
was not have the right frame of mind to
be fully consenting to the action that

952
01:00:27,741 --> 01:00:30,680
they were taking. So all of that
needs to be taken into account.

953
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:34,430
But the reality is the law
currently isn't against abortion.

954
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,470
And so what I think is very important
as efforts are made to have the law

955
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:41,930
changed to reflect human rights,

956
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:46,580
that all of us have the inalienable
right to life. In the meantime,

957
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:51,620
we have to offer support to
women. Absolutely. And there
are a pregnancy centers,

958
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:53,360
there are homes for pregnant women,

959
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,570
there are at nonprofits across the country
that exists to do that very thing and

960
01:00:58,671 --> 01:01:01,250
to not only journey with a
woman through her pregnancy,

961
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,150
but to really walk with her
after her pregnancy as well.

962
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,670
If she chooses to parent
rather than adoption,

963
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,970
she's going to need a lot of
support in these centers exist.

964
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:14,570
And I would say very much should
have our attention and support.

965
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:17,150
So I hope that was helpful.
Any final questions?

966
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,780
Or you're given giving an inspiring talk.

967
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,470
So you're kind of like that good person
quality at your that you're kind of

968
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,780
mentioning.
So I was going to ask a personal question.

969
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:29,140
What inspires you to be who you
are to give talks around the world?

970
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:33,270
Oh, well thank you. I, in terms
of what inspires me, you know,

971
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,370
I'm just speaking of
pregnancy centers there.

972
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:40,590
My mom volunteered at a pregnancy
center when I was a young child.

973
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:45,770
Both my parents were really active in the
pro life cause you could say generally

974
01:01:46,441 --> 01:01:49,250
speaking, but in particular my mom
volunteered at a pregnancy centers.

975
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:53,670
So when clients would come for pregnancy
tests I would often go with her and I

976
01:01:53,671 --> 01:01:56,940
would do it on letterhead while she
was in the office counseling the girls.

977
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,130
And when those clients gave birth,

978
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:02,130
my mom would go to the hospital
with flowers and I would come along.

979
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:07,380
And so from a very young age I saw that
there were women in crisis who felt they

980
01:02:07,381 --> 01:02:08,214
had no support.

981
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:13,320
And I saw that there were people like
my parents and my mom who would support

982
01:02:13,321 --> 01:02:17,790
them and love them through that difficult
circumstance and turn that obstacle

983
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:20,100
they were in into opportunity.

984
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:25,460
And that laid the foundation to really
convict me to want to use the skills that

985
01:02:26,491 --> 01:02:30,270
I had to help those who were
more vulnerable and in need.

986
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:33,900
And I went to university actually with
plans to pursue a different career.

987
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:38,610
But I heard an American speaker who came
to Canada and I was a college student.

988
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:39,710
His name is Scott clues,
and,

989
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:44,400
and he gave a presentation on
this topic that blew my mind.

990
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,800
And in that talk he said,

991
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:50,040
there are more people working
full time to kill babies.

992
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:54,090
Then there are working full time
to save them. And I'll admit,

993
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:55,410
when I heard those words,

994
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,480
I became very convicted that I want it
to be one of the people being a voice for

995
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:05,481
those who were entirely incapable of
raising their voices against what was

996
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:10,170
happening to them. And, and
a lot of things unfolded.
And here I am 15 years later.

997
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,210
Thank you very much.

998
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:15,950
Thank you very much.
That's great.

999
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,640
If you guys have any remaining
unasked questions, a,

1000
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,440
she'll be here or you can talk
to her in person. And again,

1001
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:27,140
we have copies of her book.
Love unleashes life.

1002
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,470
So thank you very much for coming
and for those tuning in as well too.

1003
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:31,440
Thank you.
