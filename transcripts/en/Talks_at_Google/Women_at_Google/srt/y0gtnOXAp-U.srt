1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,620
We have a very,
very special guest with us here today.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,040
Her name is Kristin Neff and we have
a very interesting topic for today.

3
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:16,900
So thank you so much for being here.
You're welcome.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,980
Let me just tell you,
I briefly

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,761
about,
um,

6
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:26,170
how I got involved with self compassion
and how it got to the point where it is

7
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:28,680
now, where it's really my life's work. Um,

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,350
it actually all started
not too far from here.

9
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:34,990
I was going to graduate
school at UC Berkeley.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,010
I'm getting my phd and
basically my life was a mess.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,550
I had just gotten out of a divorce.
It was very messy.

12
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:46,060
I was feeling a lot of shame.
Um, I was under a lot of stress,

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,180
not so much about what I get my phd,

14
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:52,000
but what's it going to get
a job after getting my phd?

15
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,270
That was a big stressor for
me. Um, and so, you know,

16
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,440
I was in Berkeley and I
had heard about meditation.

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,560
I had heard that meditation was good
for stress and there was literally,

18
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:05,290
I'm a meditation group just
down the block from me.

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,120
So I went to this meditation group.
Um, and really to my surprise,

20
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:14,230
the woman leaving the group at talked
about the importance of self compassion,

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,880
about how we had this ability
to be kind, supportive, caring,

22
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:22,990
tour ourselves. Um, when times
were difficult. Uh, and it was,

23
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:27,640
it was like exactly the message I
needed to hear in that moment. Um,

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,720
believe it or not,

25
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:32,500
I started changing the way we laid
it to myself instead of judge you,

26
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:34,150
myself and Jamie myself.

27
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:38,380
I started to try to be that
good kind support a friend. Um,

28
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,790
and it made a huge difference
almost immediately. Uh,

29
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,840
and then luckily I did get a job.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,900
I got a job at ut Austin where I am now
and then I decided I wanted to research

31
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:54,020
self compassion because I thought
it offered a lot of benefits. Um,

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,840
that self esteem didn't it?

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,010
I actually did two years of post doctoral
study with the self esteem we suture.

34
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,210
And while it was while I was working
with her, I realized self esteem,

35
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:08,670
although it was good for mental health
is pretty problematic. For instance, um,

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,340
the half high self esteem,
we have to be special and above average,

37
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,780
like everyone has to be at the same time,
special and above average,

38
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:20,860
which is basically a logical and
possibility, right? So, um, we, we,

39
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:24,760
we get involved with all these ego
games trying to raise their self esteem,

40
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:28,530
suddenly putting other people
down or getting ego defensive. Um,

41
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,350
the other problem with self esteem
was it's really contingent, right?

42
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,900
Self esteem is there for you
and things are going well,

43
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,990
but what happens when you fail
your self esteem, dessert shoe.

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,520
So as learning all this,

45
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,550
my postdoc and I was practicing self
compassion and seeing really what a stable

46
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:47,860
refuge self compassion was
in terms of self worth.

47
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,570
So when I got to ut Austin, um, I decided
I wanted to connect research on that.

48
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,123
So the way I,

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,230
I define self compassion is I define
it as having three main components,

50
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,330
right? This is, I'm
kindness toward oneself. Um,

51
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,980
a recognition of common
humanity and mindfulness.

52
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:08,050
A lot of people have
talked about mindfulness.

53
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:13,051
A mindfulness is actually embedded in the
construct of self compassion the way I

54
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:17,740
see it. So let me take you through each
of these a little bit more closely.

55
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,750
So the ideas was self compassion.
Again,

56
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,540
we treat ourselves with the same kindness,

57
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,541
care and concern that we showed a good
friend as opposed to harsh self judgment.

58
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,860
You know the Bible says do unto others
as you would have them do unto you.

59
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,263
Good idea,

60
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,920
but really not such a good idea to do
on the others as you do unto yourself.

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,210
Because most of us are
shockingly crew author ourselves.

62
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,970
We say things to ourselves kind
of mean, harsh, cruel shaming,

63
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:52,700
things that we wouldn't say to
anyone we cared about that. In fact,

64
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:56,260
you probably wouldn't even say to
someone we didn't like very much, right?

65
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:59,170
If you actually start to tune
into your internal dialogue,

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,160
most people are surprised by how
hard they are with themselves.

67
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,950
So the ideas with self compassion,

68
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,590
we start changing the
way we talk to ourselves.

69
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:13,570
We start changing the way we relate to
ourselves. We didn't be kind, caring,

70
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:18,430
patient, understanding the way you are
with a friend as opposed to inpatient,

71
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:22,030
cold and cruel, right? So self kindness.

72
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,650
It involves first of all,

73
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:28,030
soothing and comforting ourselves in
times of struggle the way you might with a

74
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,580
friend who was upset or a loved one.

75
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,410
It also involves supporting and
protecting ourselves, right?

76
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,840
So self compassion. It's not just
like touchy feely, more fuzzies.

77
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,110
Self compassion can actually be
quite fierce. They can say, listen,

78
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,930
I need to stand up for myself.
I need to protect myself.

79
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:48,250
I need to draw boundaries.

80
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:52,060
Sometimes that's really part of being
a good friend who yourself is also

81
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:56,950
standing up for yourself when you need
it the most. Okay, so self compassion.

82
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,730
Basically the sum up,
what compassion is,

83
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:05,731
I'm technically compassion is defined
as concern with the alleviation of

84
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:09,100
suffering and mass.
The thing with self compassion as well,

85
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,510
it means we are actively concerned
with their own suffering and we say,

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,130
what do I need in the moment?

87
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,150
And then we try to give
ourselves what we need to leave.

88
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,310
He ate her suffering by the way,
just like a little footnote,

89
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,200
when I use the word suffering,
I just mean any sort of emotional pain.

90
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,130
So when people hear the word suffering,
they think that Jesus dying on the cross.

91
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,120
That's not the way I'm using it. So
it, that's a connotation for you.

92
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,220
Just recognize when I
use the word suffering,

93
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:38,650
I just mean any moment of emotional pain,

94
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,420
which from my point of view is worthy
of a compassionate response. Okay.

95
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,020
So self kindness in a way is the most
salient aspect of self compassion.

96
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:54,100
But there's also a very important element
and the self compassion that helps

97
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,920
differentiate it from self pity,
right?

98
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,200
We don't like people who
are lost in self pity Dewey.

99
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,950
So what's the difference between
self compassion and self pity?

100
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,490
There like near enemies they look kind
of similar but they're actually radically

101
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,580
different.
So with self compassion,

102
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,610
we recognize the imperfection is part of
the shared human experience that every

103
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,310
single person in the world isn't perfect.
I mean,

104
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,210
you may have a few people you really like,
you think are close,

105
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,400
maybe his holiness the Dalai
Lama or some author you love.

106
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,090
But I share even they probably
have their bad days, right?

107
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,420
We know no person is perfect
and no one means perfect life.

108
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,190
Okay,
so we know this logically,

109
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,430
but what happens emotionally almost
fail or we make a mistake or we feel

110
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:47,240
inadequate about something is we feel
like something has gone wrong, right?

111
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:52,190
Think about it, I failed. Something has
gone wrong. This isn't supposed to happen.

112
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,100
It's,
it's kind of an irrational assumption.

113
00:06:55,101 --> 00:07:00,101
But in the moment we feel as if everyone
else in the world is living a perfectly

114
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,430
normal problem, free life.
And it's just me who's failed,

115
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,980
who's gotten dumped by my
boyfriend or whatever it is.

116
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,540
Now this is a problem because
not only are we suffering,

117
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,490
we feel all alone in our suffering.
So self compassion, remember,

118
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,170
wait, this is normal. This is
what's supposed to be happening.

119
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:24,140
No one ever said I wasn't going
to fail or experience hardship.

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,630
And I'll just tell you a little personal
story where I saw how powerful this can

121
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:33,070
be, the switch in my own life. Um, so, uh,

122
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,550
if you ever read the book, when you read
the book, you'll find out. And my son,

123
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:38,960
Rowan,
is artistic.

124
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,770
And I remember when he
was about four years old,

125
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:46,220
I have a very clear memory of taking
him to the park and there were their

126
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:50,200
mothers, their with their kids and you
know, all the other kids were playing,

127
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,560
laughing, interacting, you know, here's
rowing on the slide. Just stimming away,

128
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,570
right?
Not Interacting with the other kids.

129
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,250
And I started going down the path of
self pity, right? I started thinking,

130
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,570
you know, why me? Why can't I
have a normal happy relationship,

131
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:08,270
easy relationship with my
child like everyone else.

132
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,590
But I caught myself because I had been
practicing self compassion for many years

133
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:16,550
at that point. And I realize is
that Christian, wait a second,

134
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,750
you're assuming that all the other
mothers and kids on the playground,

135
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,250
you're assuming that all these mothers
are going to grow up to have perfectly

136
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:29,720
normal problem free relationships with
their kids. Are you kidding? You know,

137
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:34,370
surely they may develop other mental
health issues or physical issues or maybe

138
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,860
just have a very conflict
built relationship.

139
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,400
And I realize actually in
fact what Unitus United,

140
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:47,300
all the mothers are on the playground
that day was that we struggle with our

141
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:50,510
kids and we loved them anyway
and we do our best and this is,

142
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,820
this is what separated me
from the other mothers.

143
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,040
This is what connected me to the other.

144
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,450
So the second I pulled myself out of
that rabbit hole of self pity and started

145
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,780
giving myself self compassion, you
know, it's hard to be a parent.

146
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,880
It's a challenge for all of us.

147
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,210
Then everything got reframed and it
really gave me more emotional resources to

148
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,230
deal with the situation.
Okay,

149
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,120
so common humanity is key
and then mindfulness, right?

150
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,760
So as I said,
we've heard a lot about mindfulness.

151
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,620
I know Google's really into mindfulness.

152
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:27,621
Mindfulness is really the
foundation of self compassion.

153
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,410
Okay.

154
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,410
So mindfulness is basically being with
where it is in the present moment without

155
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:35,730
resistance. No, of course.

156
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:40,530
When what's happening in the
present moment is suffering
or going through a hard

157
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:43,440
time. We're having difficulty,
we're struggling in some way.

158
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,770
We actually need to have the courage
to be present with what's happening in

159
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,560
order to have compassion for ourselves.
And more than that,

160
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:57,210
typically what happens is when things
are difficult, we were in a process,

161
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:01,890
like I call over identification that
some were fused with the storyline of

162
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,320
what's happening.
We're lost in the storyline.

163
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,190
So in order to have compassion for
yourself and one of the reasons it's so

164
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:12,270
beneficial is you actually have to
step outside of yourself and say,

165
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,830
wow, you're really struggling. Are you
okay? What do you need in this moment?

166
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,160
And that kind of stepping outside yourself
to form a self self relationship is

167
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:26,940
one of the things that gives you emotional
balance needed to make wiser choices.

168
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,200
Okay? So those are the three
components, self kindness,

169
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:34,800
common humanity and mindfulness.
And actually hopefully have time.

170
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,710
Want to give you a little sense of what
these feel like in your body because

171
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,170
these are all inner concepts.

172
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,840
First of like give you a taste of
what self criticism feels like.

173
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,810
Okay? So please everyone, if
you're eating, just put it
down for a second. Uh, uh,

174
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,220
make two fists in front
of your body like this.

175
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,250
Go ahead and give him a good old squeeze
and please do not release them until I

176
00:10:59,161 --> 00:10:59,994
say you can.

177
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,713
Okay?

178
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,970
It's keeping your fist like
this for a few moments.

179
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,450
And as you make this gesture,

180
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:16,840
just notice what I'm mood
state does this evoke in you?

181
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:21,310
What does this bring up for you?
How was your mind in this posture?

182
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,080
Yeah,

183
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,680
defensive stress.
Feel stressed.

184
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,280
Sorry. Tension. What'd you
think? Aggression. Right? It's
pretty uncomfortable, right?

185
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,480
Okay. This is what self criticism
feels like. You might even say echo,

186
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,130
literally beating ourselves up.

187
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,390
Most of the day we go around
with this attitude to ourselves.

188
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:47,920
Stress Resistant, clash,
clench, aggressive, right?
We aggressive toward herself.

189
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:48,911
Okay.

190
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:53,911
Now finally you have my permission to
open your hands and just let them raise to

191
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:01,470
the ceiling.
Okay?

192
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,420
So what shifts for you when you do this?

193
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,910
Relaxed and God

194
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,280
relief. What else? How
does this feel? What?

195
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,840
What changes in your mind
compared to before? Open.

196
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,040
More spacious, right? Feels lighter. Yes.

197
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,790
So this actually is a metaphorical
gesture for mindfulness.

198
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,380
What happens when we stop resisting
life and we just opened the way it is.

199
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,750
There's a lot of spaciousness.
A lot of room there.

200
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,920
Now if you put both arms
in front of you like this,

201
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,323
right?

202
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,910
Okay. So what, what comes up for
you when you make this gesture?

203
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,080
Sorry, what? Faith.

204
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,393
Warm.

205
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,500
Welcoming. Yeah. So in a way,

206
00:12:55,501 --> 00:13:00,270
this is the gesture of common humanity.
When we give and we see, we welcome,

207
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:03,900
we embrace other people, not
just so self focused. Right?

208
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,060
And now if you put one hand over the
other like this and place both hands over

209
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:14,030
the center of your chest,
right? And savings.

210
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,240
Pause for a moment.
Really feel the warmth of your hands.

211
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,190
Okay.

212
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,520
Feel the touch of your
hands on your chest.

213
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,650
And so checking in, um, what
mood state does this evoke
in you? How does this feel?

214
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,410
See, confident. Comforting,

215
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,080
comforting.
Are you going to say something

216
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,160
kind? It feels kind, right? So this
is, um, a gesture of self kindness.

217
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,290
You might say this act of
being there for ourselves. Um,

218
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,510
but remember that self compassion isn't
just comforting and soothing and there's

219
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,290
another stance. It kind of represents what
we're doing. Um, and you're all sitting,

220
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,300
but so you can see that if you don't,
you don't have to, but you know,

221
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:09,610
the horse dance and martial arts kind of
this ground opposed your knees are bad

222
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,160
and you've got your
center of gravity right.

223
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,810
Self compassion also gives you a center
of gravity so that you can support

224
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:17,321
yourself,

225
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:22,321
remove as you needed or
even defend yourself without
being knocked off balance.

226
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,770
So one of the things self compassion
gives you is the ability to get through

227
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:30,070
difficult times with the
sense of balance and support.

228
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,010
So that's kind of what it
feels like in your body. Um,

229
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,060
just to say, okay. Um, you
might be thinking, okay,

230
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,641
sounds good,

231
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:47,110
but we have a lot of misgivings as a
culture about self compassion and when we

232
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,420
are raised thinking this is a good idea.

233
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,050
What are some of the we have as a culture
and maybe yourself or your friends

234
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:58,670
that you hear expressed.
Yes, absolutely. Yeah.

235
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:02,570
The number one actually misgiving
about self compassion is that it will

236
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:05,660
undermine your motivation. There'll
be lazy you won't, you won't.

237
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:07,580
You lose your edge. Yeah. There's,

238
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,550
there's lots of other misgivings
that we just heard. For sure.

239
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:14,330
It's such a good thing.
Right?

240
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:17,360
So just letting yourself off the hook.
It's an excuse

241
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,770
that it's a weakness.
Yeah, that's for sissies.

242
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:26,790
I remember once I have a New York Times
article came out about my work and I

243
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,030
really thought all the comments
would be good. I really did.

244
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,330
About a third of them weren't. And
I've got comments like, oh great,

245
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:36,960
just what we need a nation of Susie's
right. So people think it is for sissies.

246
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:40,740
It's weak. Yeah. Maybe like
selfish. It's selfish, right?

247
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,470
I already supposed to be focused
on compassion for others.

248
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:45,930
What do you mean give
compassion for myself? Right.

249
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,030
So there's a lot of very
common misgivings. Um, uh,
very, you know, used to be,

250
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:54,100
I would, I could give you
lots of very well argued, um,

251
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,590
the reasons why I think these
misgivings are misconceptions,

252
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,630
but actually now we have the research
to really address all these misgivings.

253
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,820
So just a little chart. You can see I'm
back in 2003 there. I publish a first,

254
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,060
um,
theoretical article on self compassion,

255
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:16,320
what it is and I quit it to skill to my
trip and now it's just exploding and we

256
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,560
couldn't even keep up with the research
is absolutely amazing. And so we've got,

257
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,850
we know a lot now about self
compassion and how it works.

258
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,840
So just to say first of all a self
compassionate as strongly predictive of

259
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:34,160
wellbeing. Some people who are more self
compassionate or who are helped, um,

260
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,080
taught to be more self compassionate
and they tend to be less depressed,

261
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,330
tend to be less anxious and they're less,
lot of people suffer from shame,

262
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:44,310
suicidal ideation,
um,

263
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,090
at the same time they're happier and
they're more optimistic right there.

264
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,370
They're more hopeful about their future.

265
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,880
So this kind of overlaps with self esteem.

266
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:58,130
We also know that self esteem is good
for wellbeing people high self esteem.

267
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,940
I also you know,
have better mental health.

268
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,890
The difference between self esteem and
self compassion is it first of all self

269
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,190
esteem is based on social
comparisons often, right?

270
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:11,310
You have to even better than others
to be thought of high self esteem,

271
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,421
self compassionate.

272
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:15,630
And you just have to be like a
wreck like every other human being.

273
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:18,780
You don't have to be better than anyone,
right? You just have to be human.

274
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,200
And also the sense of self worth link
with self compassion is much more stable

275
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,260
than self esteem.

276
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,150
So we did one study where
we track people's sense of
self worse for I'm 12 times

277
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:30,984
over eight months,

278
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,530
I'm a self esteem but went up and
down based on how your day was going,

279
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:36,120
your latest success or failure.

280
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,540
So if compassion was a much more
stable source of self worth,

281
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,070
it's there for you actually.

282
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,970
Precisely when self esteem desert shoot
and that's when you fall flat on your

283
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:48,840
face. Do you make a mistake or you're
struggling in some way? Um, yeah.

284
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,720
So it's self compassion week,
right?

285
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,590
What we're finding it in fact is it,

286
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,090
I feel comfortable
because I'm a little bias,

287
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:01,410
but I feel comfortable saying that
self compassion is probably one of the

288
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:05,550
biggest sources of strength, resilience
and coping you have available. Right?

289
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,900
So lots of research,

290
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:10,680
people going through divorce or when
Eddie came out of people coming back,

291
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,560
veterans coming back from
Iraq and Afghanistan.

292
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,940
And what they find is the
way people treat themselves.

293
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:22,200
And these hard times, you know, the level
of self compassion, support, inner inner,

294
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,380
um, beat an inner allies
and poster, an inner enemy.

295
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,580
That's what predicts whether or not
they do things like develop PTSD.

296
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,170
I'm nine months later. So self compassion
will help you get through hard times.

297
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,090
It's a strength. Absolutely
not a weakness. Um,

298
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,960
linked to healthier behaviors.

299
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,000
A lot of people think self compassion
means being self indulgent, you know, oh,

300
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,500
it'd be nice to myself.

301
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,640
I think they'll have that bowl of ice
cream and then another and another.

302
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:53,790
And you know, is that being
nice to yourself? Right?

303
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,820
It's actually not self indulgence means
choosing long term harm over short term

304
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:02,700
pleasure. People are self
compassionate. They want,

305
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,020
they want to levy their own suffering.
So they do things like they exercise more,

306
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,690
they eat better food,
they go to the doctor more regularly,

307
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,220
they take care of themselves.
So it's self compassion,

308
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,210
a selfish, um, I'll say if you
guys are pretty young crowd,

309
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:21,000
some of you are probably like on
doing the online dating thing.

310
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:24,450
I Dunno what app she got these days,
but you're probably maybe on the market,

311
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,500
you can actually take the self
compassion test on my website.

312
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,980
So I would suggest getting their
score before meeting for coffee.

313
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,920
Maybe not.
But regardless,

314
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,050
the idea is we know that people who are
more self compassionate are rated by

315
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:44,250
their partners, is being
much better. Relationship
Partners, they're more giving,

316
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,530
they're more intimate,
they're less controlling,

317
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:49,950
they're less aggressive in
the relationship. So in fact,

318
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:53,220
what we know is that when you
give yourself what you need,

319
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,610
when you have this pool of
compassion to draw on for yourself,

320
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,900
you actually more to give to others.
So at least the less selfish behavior,

321
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,490
that more selfish behavior.

322
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,840
And in fact we also know that people
who are more self compassionate,

323
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,480
not only are they more
compassionate to others,

324
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,170
they're more able to sustain
compassion for others, right?

325
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,720
So if you have this pattern where
I'm giving, I'm giving, I'm giving,

326
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:17,910
I'm giving to my friends,
I'm giving to my partner,

327
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:21,900
I'm giving to my children and you don't
recharge your own batteries and you

328
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:25,450
don't give yourself what you
need, you will burn out. So I'm,

329
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:29,190
a lot of the research I'm
doing now actually is like
teaching as self compassion

330
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,800
to caregivers to help
them prevent for now.

331
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,610
So I just want to have a
little more detail on this one.

332
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:39,860
The idea how it's linkedin
motivation cause this is the
one people just say this,

333
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,230
there's a lot of research on this because
I think a lot of researchers that no,

334
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:47,830
this can't be true. Surely
not. But it is, right? So, um,

335
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,170
we have lots of research showing,
first of all,

336
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,270
people who are self compassionate
and their standards are
just as high. You know,

337
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:58,470
they, they also want the best
for themselves. The differences.

338
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,100
What happens when a self compassionate
person does it meet their standards?

339
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,570
Right? So a self critical person
when they fail, beat themselves up.

340
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,970
Oh I'm terrible. I can't, I
should have gotten a ride.

341
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:13,660
And they like this whole slew of
self judgment and self criticism,

342
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,730
which does two things. A, it
undermined yourself. Confidence,
right? When you think,

343
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,590
oh, I'm a failure, I'm full of shame.

344
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,850
Shame is not exactly the most
motivating mindstate we can have.

345
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,390
So undermines herself competence.
And what happens is we become,

346
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,400
we become afraid of failure.

347
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,810
We developed performance anxiety and
it actually undermines her performance.

348
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:39,230
This, this process of self shame
and self criticism, self compassion.

349
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,820
On the other hand,
when you know it's okay to fail for spa,

350
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:47,080
you can recognize that you fail because
you know, yeah, okay. It's safety. Okay.

351
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:48,820
I own it.
It really messed up there.

352
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,780
But just because I failed
doesn't mean I am a failure.

353
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,210
So self compassionate
people are much more, uh,

354
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,860
much less likely to be afraid of failure.
And when they do fail,

355
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:04,240
they're much more likely, um, to try
again and to keep on trying. Okay.

356
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,480
So for instance, they just study at
Uc Berkeley where they had people,

357
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,500
they gave these students one of those
impossible tabulary tests that everyone

358
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:15,220
failed. And half the students, they
told them to be self compassionate.

359
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:18,760
They gave them self
compassion instructions. The
other half they said, hey,

360
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:21,690
don't worry about it. You must be
smart. You got into Berkeley. Right?

361
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,960
And then they had a second
vocabulary tests and they made it,

362
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:28,630
how long did the students
study for the second exam?

363
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,740
So the ones who were helped to be self
compassionate spend a lot more time

364
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:35,890
studying and they kept trying
even though you know, the, the,

365
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,360
the potential for failures there because
he had this resilience and the strength

366
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:44,840
to deal with it. Okay. I want to
teach you a little practice, um,

367
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,160
because I'm hoping that you guys can
actually some point in your day to day or

368
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:52,850
the next week,
um,

369
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:57,851
can actually put this into practice and
see how it impacts how you relate to

370
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:02,260
yourself in times of struggle because
it's more than just conceptual.

371
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,790
This is actually a practice.
Okay. So if someone comes in,

372
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,720
I think about 10 minutes, I just
kicked him out. Okay. All right.

373
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,810
So,
um,

374
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:18,811
I invite everyone to close your eyes
partly just because I want you to be able

375
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:23,110
to go inward and I don't want you to
feel like other people are looking at you

376
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:26,740
because I'm going to have you make
a few funny gestures. Sorry. Okay.

377
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,863
All right.

378
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,870
So with their eyes close and actually
the first thing I'd like us to do is see

379
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:38,460
if we can find a type
of supportive gesture,

380
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,410
physical touch that feels supportive.

381
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,040
And some people really like the
hands on the heart touch I used,

382
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,920
but actually a lot of people don't
like that. It feels vulnerable.

383
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:50,780
It doesn't really affect them.

384
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,110
So I want us just to see if we can find
some sort of touch that feels good for

385
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:00,440
us. So why don't we go ahead and start
again with the hands on heart like we did

386
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:03,100
before.
All right.

387
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,020
Just noticing how that feels.

388
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:13,030
A lot of people love this gesture.
It feels safe and comforting and soothing.

389
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,930
Um, but as I said, a lot
of people don't like this.

390
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:19,150
It feels weak or feels vulnerable.

391
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:24,880
So some other variations you can do is
you can try putting a fist on your heart

392
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,030
it fist of like strength, courage, power,

393
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,600
and then place the hand
gently over the fist,

394
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:33,760
right?

395
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,240
Some people like this,
oftentimes men like this gesture more.

396
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,163
Okay.

397
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,970
Um, you can try putting
both hands on your belly.

398
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,010
Okay.

399
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,660
Right.
Supporting your belly

400
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,140
and then both hands on your face.

401
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,470
Okay. So just take a moment to see if he
can find some touch that works for you.

402
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,100
Um, it's amazing if you have
a self compassionate touch,

403
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:07,300
it cuts through all the mental chatter
and you can go straight toward kind of

404
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:08,710
emotionally giving to yourself.

405
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:12,580
So just experiment a little bit or
eyes are still closed and for now,

406
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:15,190
choose something that seems
to work kind of. Okay.

407
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,073
Yeah.

408
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,240
Sound a lifelong commitment and just
try it out for now. I'm going to need,

409
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,900
we're going to use this in the
next exercise. Okay. So what,

410
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,270
why eyes are still closed and I hear
the noise. So people are coming in.

411
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,463
That's all right.

412
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,080
So what I would invite you to do
is see if you can think of, um,

413
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,140
a real situation in your life right now.

414
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:39,650
Yeah.

415
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,650
That's causing you some stress or
struggle or some emotional difficulty,

416
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,730
okay.

417
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,690
Right? This may be a
relationship issue, work issue.

418
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,130
I'm a health issue,

419
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,720
right?

420
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,620
Um,
don't,

421
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:58,310
don't choose your most overwhelmingly
difficult problem because we're just

422
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,030
practicing. We don't want to overwhelm
ourselves. There's something, this wheel,

423
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:05,390
something that's, you know, you can kind
of feel the stress of it in your body.

424
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,830
So taking a moment to
think of this situation,

425
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:13,770
right?

426
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,860
Call it into your mind eye.
You know who said what.

427
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:17,720
Okay.

428
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,970
Uh, what happened? What are
you afraid might happen?

429
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,310
Okay? So see if you can make it real.
Bring it into the present moment.

430
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,220
Then I can get to say a series of phrases
designed to evoke the three components

431
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:40,120
of self compassion. Um,
so the first phrase is,

432
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,520
this is a moment of suffering.

433
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:45,810
Okay?

434
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,650
Okay. This mindfulness we're being,
we're being aware of what's happening.

435
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,010
But that language may not be the best
for you. You can say something like,

436
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,720
this is really hard right now,
or I'm struggling.

437
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,640
Yeah.

438
00:26:59,640 --> 00:26:59,971
Okay.

439
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:04,971
So we want to use our mindfulness to
just neem and become aware of the fact of

440
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:09,450
what's happening, which is
this is, this is difficult.

441
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:12,810
Okay?

442
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,051
Okay.

443
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:18,051
The second phrase is a
suffering or struggle.

444
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,210
Stress.
It's a part of life,

445
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,310
right? So we're just
remembering our common humanity.

446
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,900
This is normal to feel this way.
Things like this happen,

447
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,790
they hurt,
but it's normal as part of being a human.

448
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,950
I'm not alone in feeling this way.

449
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,060
Okay? And then, so for the
third component, self kindness,

450
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:48,300
I'd invite you to adopt
whatever gesture you found.

451
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:52,410
Fields kind of comfort, name,
hand on heart or elsewhere,

452
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,530
just on heart,
hand on stomach,

453
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:59,250
whatever seems like it gives you
that feeling of being supported,

454
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,303
right?

455
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,120
And so at the third phrase is,

456
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,780
may I be kind to myself?

457
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,923
Right?

458
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,700
So what does this mean? It's asking,
what do I need in this moment?

459
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,840
And seeing if you can kind
of wish that for yourself.

460
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,440
Maybe you know,
what you need is patience,

461
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,140
courage,

462
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,710
or maybe we need is to accept
yourself that little bit more,

463
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,390
right? Just asking yourself, what do
I need? And wishing that for yourself.

464
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,413
Okay.

465
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,130
Um, and if, and if you're getting
a little stuck with the language,

466
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:53,870
is often really useful to think,
you know,

467
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:58,871
what would I say to a close friend
who was going through the exact same

468
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:02,180
situation I'm going
through, right? We're off.

469
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:05,180
We're kind of naturally more
compassionate to our friends.

470
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,650
So thinking about what you would say
and also maybe the tone of voice,

471
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:12,680
you would use the warmth
that would be in your voice.

472
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,083
Okay.

473
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,990
Right. And then, then just
try it out with yourself.

474
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:25,430
See if he can speak to yourself the
same way you would speak to a friend.

475
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,410
You cared about the same issue.

476
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:44,851
Okay.

477
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:49,650
And then letting the practice go
for your hands back by your sides.

478
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,170
Um,
you can open your eyes.

479
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,323
Okay.

480
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,390
So this is called the
self compassion break.

481
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:05,290
It's one of the kind of most handy dandy
tools from the mindful self compassion

482
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:10,270
program we teach. Um, but the idea is in
the moment of struggle, not like you know,

483
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:13,830
in a separate time when you're
meditating or you can do it then too,

484
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,730
in the heat of the moment,

485
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:19,300
you remind yourself of the
three components of compassion,

486
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,570
being mindful that you're having a hard
time remembering this is part of life is

487
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:26,080
not just me,
this is,

488
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,180
this is part of being human and then
bringing kindness to yourself. Right.

489
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,670
It can often feel weird at first.
Absolutely.

490
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:38,230
It often feels very strange to speak to
yourself like you'd speak to good friend.

491
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:41,920
It feels, it can feel fake and phony
at first just to normalize that,

492
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,730
but eventually you start to form new
habits and it starts to feel natural to be

493
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:53,200
kind to yourself as opposed to awkward
and if you really work with this

494
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:57,850
practice, if you really
work on integrating self
compassion into your life,

495
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,910
what the research shows is that,
like I said,

496
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,470
it's been a tremendous
source of resilience, coping,

497
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,470
self confidence and motivation.

498
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,400
There's also research now showing it's
good for your physical health or immune

499
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:13,510
function.
For instance.

500
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,610
I was just curious about your view on
cynicism and sort of ways that that might

501
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:23,230
undermine sort of the overall
structure. Yeah, so again,

502
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:24,370
in our culture,

503
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:28,090
the that because a lot of people
think that self compassion is soft.

504
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:32,050
They kind of cynical about like, oh,
all this hearts and flowers stuff. Um,

505
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,430
so it is, it is a block, right?
And for some people, I mean,

506
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,330
I'm really comfortable, calm myself,
sweetheart, I'm mushy, I have a son.

507
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,620
But a lot of people aren't.

508
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:45,190
So the really important thing is to
find language that works for you.

509
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:49,340
Like do you got your back? I mean,
that can be whatever, you know,

510
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,230
be a wing man,
whatever you want to language it.

511
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,590
It doesn't have to be warm,
but absolutely, you know,

512
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,760
it's cynicism,
right?

513
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,020
Is it going to be better for you to
support yourself or to undermine yourself?

514
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,840
I mean, Duh. You know, it's so funny,

515
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,750
her culture somehow thinks
that by cutting yourself down,

516
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,210
that's going to help you.
Obviously it won't.

517
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:12,490
And all the research
shows it won't as well.

518
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,690
So if you want to do your best
and you can be as dry as you want,

519
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:19,180
you don't have to be warm
and mushy regardless.

520
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:23,440
You want to be your own support system
as opposed to pulling the rug out from

521
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,280
underneath yourself, which is what most
of us actually do with self criticism.

522
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:32,560
So cynicism is there and people just
have to find out for themselves as a

523
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,650
worker, not basically.
Yeah, absolutely. Yes.

524
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,980
Thanks for coming today.
Tried a

525
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,980
variety of different styles of meditation
past to try and calm my mind and calm

526
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:50,420
down that voice that's constantly
running and criticism and just find it

527
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:54,680
challenging to kind of break past that
and make it a pattern and a habit.

528
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,630
What tips do you have any in your approach
towards self compassion and working

529
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:03,830
at self compassion to take some of the
early steps or things to keep in mind

530
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,600
about the process?

531
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:09,870
Maybe too often I've expected I'm going
to have this instant breakthrough. Um,

532
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,920
how would you advise someone to
go about it and make it work?

533
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,470
Absolutely. So the first thing is we
can't get rid of the voice, right?

534
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,810
The voices there. We didn't choose
to have the voice. A lot of us,

535
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:23,270
especially depending on our
family history and you know,

536
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:25,070
we have the voice more deeply than others.

537
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,520
The first thing to do is recognize that
your inner critical voice is actually

538
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:35,990
trying to help you. It's not doing a great
job of it, but it's trying to help me.

539
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:40,730
Usually the inner critic is trying to
point out some danger, danger, danger,

540
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:42,230
don't do that. Don't do that. You know,

541
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:44,780
if you've done that one
problem wouldn't have happened.

542
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,940
So you might think of it is like a three
year old trying to help you in the only

543
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:53,180
language it knows how,
which is the language of self criticism.

544
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:57,920
So when you recognize you can
even just try saying like,
thank you. Um, I hear you.

545
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:01,700
Okay, I see what you're trying to
point out. Um, but then the, the,

546
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,660
the only problem with that self critical
voices that it's counterproductive

547
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,680
because by using the harsh language and
the harsh tone and it actually doesn't

548
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:14,630
help you. So I, you know,
acknowledging the inner critic
and then just saying this,

549
00:34:14,631 --> 00:34:18,290
that or another part of me that
also usually wants the same goal.

550
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,250
I believe that we all have an inner
compassionate self and it's not just the

551
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:26,810
spiritual thing. We know like you know,
evolutionarily that we all are the brain,

552
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:30,860
the human brain is wired for compassion,
is part of our biological makeup.

553
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,880
So we can tap into that part of herself,
which is usually a little wiser.

554
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,390
And also think, you know,
what does this part of myself,

555
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:41,360
the part of me that knows how
to be supportive, good friend,

556
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,060
what does this have to say
about whatever's going on?

557
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,200
So don't try to fight the self critic.
Really see if you can turn toward it,

558
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:51,980
appreciate it for how it
was trying to help you. Then
just don't let it, you know,

559
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:56,970
be the only voice in your head. Hopefully
it can have a little more room to,

560
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,070
to, to lead in some other
voices. Yeah. So it really,

561
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:02,210
it really is our friend.

562
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:05,840
It's just what I think of it as like
a tangent mean two year old, you know,

563
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,900
it's a low on also on.

564
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:13,100
The other good thing is just to tune
in to the pain of self criticism.

565
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,590
You know, it hurts, ah,

566
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:21,130
the term tenderness toward this very
human process of self criticism as well.

567
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,920
And please do not beat yourself
up for beating yourself up. I've,

568
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,710
I've gotten emails from people
said, thanks for, you know,

569
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:31,190
give me one more thing done bad at self
compassion. You know, I was like, oh,

570
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,950
that's not what I meant.
Right?

571
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,370
So we want to be kind about the process
and it's slow and if you have a family

572
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:41,700
history with this is what you were
raised with, it will, it will go slower.

573
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,010
Just allow yourself to be a slow learner
and be patient and being patient and

574
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:51,210
understanding with the self critic
that actually is self compassionate.

575
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,330
In your last response, you
actually mentioned, um,

576
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,220
this young child's mentality and that was,

577
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,580
that could lead into my question is do
you have some suggestions for teaching

578
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:03,770
self compassion to young kids? Yeah. Um,

579
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,430
so I'm for that. I think that the
number one best way to do it of course,

580
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:09,750
is to model it.
You know,

581
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:14,751
a lot of parents are so good about not
harshly criticizing the kids and trying

582
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,570
to be supportive and then they dropped
the glass on the floor and say, Oh,

583
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:23,070
I'm such an idiot. You know?
So really being conscious
of what you're modeling, I,

584
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,570
I really believe that if you, uh, hourly
model, self compassion and moments,

585
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:31,150
a mistake or something, kids
will pick up on that message. Um,

586
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:36,170
the other cool thing is that all human
beings are brains are wired for emotional

587
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:40,530
resonance. We pick up on what other
people are feeling. So believe it or not,

588
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,770
if you are really self critical,
rounder kids,

589
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:49,320
you kids will notice the self
criticism and respond to it.

590
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,890
I'll just give an example. If my son
were all in, right? So when he was, he's,

591
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,450
he's doing great now,
but when he was younger,

592
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:56,820
he would have this
horrible autism tantrums.

593
00:36:56,821 --> 00:37:01,140
Like just really off the charts.
And if I,

594
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:05,080
you know, and sometimes he didn't when I
got you rotated. Oh my God, you're right.

595
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,010
I must, I blown it. Or I triggered
him. I didn't know what to do.

596
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:11,250
And they got really frustrated
with myself. He would ramp up.

597
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,890
It's like he would read my emotions.

598
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,390
So what I learned to do when he would
throw an all muddy tantrum is I would just

599
00:37:18,391 --> 00:37:22,140
flood myself with compassion. This
is so hard right now. You know,

600
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,450
I'm here for you and
make sure he was safe.

601
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:29,410
But like 95% of my attention
was on me and never audibly,

602
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,750
he would pick up on that and he would
start to calm down because he would read

603
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,950
my mind state. So as a parent, you
know, that relationship is so close.

604
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,570
If you embody another term for it,
use for self.

605
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:47,190
Compassion is loving,
connected presence, kindness,

606
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,790
common humanity, mindfulness,
loving, connected presence.

607
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,280
So if you just sync when
you're around your kid,

608
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,380
how can I embody a state of
loving connected presence
that we'll do a few things.

609
00:37:58,381 --> 00:37:59,820
First of all,
they'll feel your loving,

610
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:04,260
connected presence will also mean your
parenting is that much more balanced and

611
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:08,260
wise, et cetera. So, um, that's
kind of step one and you know,

612
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,310
there probably are techniques to develop,
but I haven't done that yet.

613
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,110
That's what, that's,
that's, that's what I do.

614
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,200
Hi there.
Thank you so much for coming.

615
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,400
I'm so glad that you asked that question
because my question is on the same

616
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:24,790
lines of [inaudible] for kids.
So I actually work in education,

617
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:29,780
I focused on educators. So I'm curious,
you know, what, what research you have or,

618
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:30,730
or as an academic,

619
00:38:30,731 --> 00:38:35,731
what you guys have done as far as helping
support educators implement compassion

620
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,870
and also,
so that's the first part.

621
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:42,871
And then the second part is how can we
as educators are individuals that are

622
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,840
really helping these individuals,
um,

623
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,360
help with cyber bullying and
the implementation of self
compassion for kids that

624
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:52,870
are being bullied online.

625
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,760
Right? So there's a lot there. Um, so
in terms of what we have for teenagers,

626
00:38:57,761 --> 00:38:58,720
so we've developed,
my,

627
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,020
my colleague Chris Cromer and
I have developed something
called the mindful self

628
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:04,030
compassion program.
If you're interested,

629
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:08,620
you can go to center for msc.org we've
developed a teen version of that that we

630
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:13,240
can teach the teens. Um, right
now like, like in spring,

631
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:17,980
I'm the local Austin School district asked
me to come in and help their teachers

632
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:22,960
learn self compassion to present burnout.
Not a lot of research yet it's coming.

633
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,440
Um,

634
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,640
and one of my dissertation
students actually is doing
this dissertation on cyber

635
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:31,620
bullying. The idea being that
if you can help people, victims,

636
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,130
he was more focused on victims,

637
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:37,330
help people and be more self compassionate
when they're bullied instead of

638
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:40,690
retaliating with more bullying,
which is the normal pattern,

639
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:45,250
the actual deescalate the conflict.
So we're, we're working on it. Yeah.

640
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,590
But we aren't quite there yet.

641
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,950
Yeah. To go back to self
compassion. Yes. Uh,

642
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,870
I often when I feel hurt by somebody,

643
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,920
feel compassion for them thinking,
oh,

644
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,850
they must be going through hard time.

645
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,330
Is it okay to mix these two self
compassion and compassion for others?

646
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,160
Or it should be only us.
When we concentrate.

647
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,890
You can definitely, ideally the
idea is that it's this easy flow.

648
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:18,160
Compassion for me.
I really feel her compassion for you.

649
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:19,690
You must have stuff going on.

650
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,560
We actually teach you a practice called
breathing compassion in and out. Um,

651
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,070
so you do maintain both.
Um,

652
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,510
but if you only have space for one in
your [inaudible] only have enough working

653
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:33,220
memory pits for one person.

654
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,480
I would suggest starting
with yourself because again,

655
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:40,300
when you build the resources for yourself,

656
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,540
then you can have more to give to
the other and more importantly,

657
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,190
this sustain giving to the other.

658
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,340
But it doesn't have to be
either or by any means. I mean,

659
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:51,610
common humanity's common humanity.
You're a human. I'm a human.

660
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:53,350
This hurts you hurt.
You know,

661
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,940
ideally that's where we're
focused is just having compassion.

662
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,860
Typically what we do is we cut ourselves
out of the circle of compassion.

663
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,440
We treat ourselves
radically different lead,

664
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,610
then we treat others and that's a problem.

665
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:11,140
We want to create ourselves the same way,
at the same kindness and care.

666
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,910
Thank you so much for being here

667
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,570
and thank you all for being here.

668
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,243
Russia,
oh,

669
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,150
I've got the self compassion break
and other meditations and exercises.

670
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:25,290
I'm a website.
Just Google self combat.
