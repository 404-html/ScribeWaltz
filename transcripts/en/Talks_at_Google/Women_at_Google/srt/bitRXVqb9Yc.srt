1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,620
Let me begin by introducing Joanne Lipman.
Um,

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,040
she has achieved great success and,
uh, in in the world of publishing,

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,640
a beginning as a reporter at the
Wall Street Journal on to being an

4
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:23,760
entrepreneur, uh, at the Wall
Street Journal in Cayenne,

5
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:28,710
Conde Nast and starting new editorial
properties within those organizations.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,790
Uh,

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,790
she moved on to Ganette where she
ultimately became editor and chief of USA

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,000
Today and the chief content
officer, um, of, of,

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,920
of Guinot overall. So,
uh, also interestingly,

10
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:48,630
I had the tremendous pleasure of
getting to know Joanne over the last,

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,370
uh, year and a half, um, as we
were both members of the, uh,

12
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:58,371
of the Knight Commission on Trust Media
and democracy and where frankly at the

13
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:01,620
latter stages of completing that work,

14
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:05,500
and we'll publish a report sometime
in the next few months. Um,

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,820
which simply to me says that Joanna is
obviously not shy about taking on very

16
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,310
challenging questions. Uh, so you know,

17
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,530
what's the future of gender
equality in the workplace?

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,980
So what's the future of democracy
in the world of the Internet? Uh,

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,580
these are vexing problems.
Uh, and, um, they don't,

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,380
as we know, have necessarily
simple solutions. They have
constructive approaches,

21
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:33,390
but not necessarily simple solutions.

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,610
So we're here to talk about about Joanne's
book. By the way. There, there will be,

23
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:41,250
we do have several dozen copies available.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,450
It is available also on kindle or
a book. That's what she said. Uh,

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,820
what men need to know and women need
to tell them about working together.

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,340
So let me just open up by
saying these are as we know,

27
00:01:56,341 --> 00:02:00,330
very challenging times for our
society in, in many, many ways.

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,370
Um, these are also very challenging
times at Google. Um, as we well know,

29
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,300
and this last hour is
ample evidence of that, uh,

30
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,550
of the work we need to do,
um,

31
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,850
of the justifiable concerns that
many of us have about the urgency and

32
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:22,380
addressing these challenges.
And I hope today, uh,

33
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,770
and I get verklempt I hope
today an indication of our,

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,380
of our cultural commitment to
addressing them. Um, and again, it, it,

35
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,220
it's not over in the day. Uh, but I
do think there's symbolism, um, uh,

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,050
uh, to what happened today and, and
hopefully symbolism that has long value.

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,940
Uh, I might come back
to that later. So let's,

38
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:48,090
let's get into this joint and I,
I think your book,

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,180
and I'd strongly urge you to
read it. It's filled, uh, with,

40
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:56,070
with a tremendous amount of
information, um, examples, data,

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,340
uh, about the environment
we're in. Uh, and,

42
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,260
and Joanne does an excellent job of,

43
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,050
of illuminating those issues
of unconscious bias, um,

44
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,570
of how women feel in the workplace,
uh,

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,090
of how they're often perceived in the
workplace in ways that we know they should

46
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:17,830
not be perceived. Um, uh, and
as typical with these sessions,

47
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,980
I will,
after the first two or three or so,

48
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,180
open it up to all questions. Um, but I, I,

49
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,800
let me start off with a few and I want to,

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,660
your book makes her,
I think,

51
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:34,750
a really important point that
in addressing these issues,

52
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,770
it's how do we take
constructive approaches? Um,

53
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,080
how do we look more at the
do's and the don'ts? Um,

54
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,540
and I think we'll come back to that
several times in this conversation.

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,530
So let me just start off. Um,
you know, based on your work,

56
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,160
based on even what you might know
at a fairly high level about Google,

57
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,150
what, uh, what are the several
things that you would advise Google,

58
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:05,170
advise Googlers, uh, male or female in,

59
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,290
in guiding that evolution of a,
of a gender equal culture? Sure,

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,370
sure.
So first of all,

61
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:13,750
thank you guys for having me and thank
you for having me today of all days. So,

62
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,890
um, I was actually got here just
as the walkout was happening,

63
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:22,480
so I got to be a part of it and I,
and I was so energized by it.

64
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,590
And I also, uh, I've been following
Google, walked out, I'm on Twitter,

65
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,460
I'm watching this,
this cascade around the world,

66
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:32,230
which is amazing to see.

67
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:37,231
But what I loved being outside with all
you guys was how many men I saw and how

68
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:42,850
many hello male allies and,
and knowing Googlers like Richard.

69
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,220
Um, and that is actually why I
wrote, that's what she said. And,

70
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:46,721
and they're actually,

71
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:51,040
the reason that I wrote the book in
the first place is because I grew up,

72
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,930
you know,
my first two decades of my career,

73
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:57,400
I spent at the Wall Street Journal where
almost all of my colleagues were men.

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,670
My sources were man,
uh,

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,510
my mentors were all men and I had a
very good experience in a very male

76
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:08,570
dominated organization in a male
dominated industry. And, um,

77
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,200
and yet as I rose up the leadership ranks,

78
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:15,070
I started getting invited to more
and more on these women's leadership

79
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:17,190
conferences. And, um,

80
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,130
at a certain point I just became a
little bit frustrated because these

81
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:25,060
conversations were phenomenal.
Women's conversations with one another.

82
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,980
When we talk amongst ourselves,

83
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,710
we talk all the time about the issues we
face at work. And I don't mean just the,

84
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:34,420
the extremes of sexual abuse,

85
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,370
but the every day things of being
marginalized and overlooked,

86
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,050
interrupted, not taken it seriously, not
taken as seriously as the guy next to us.

87
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,570
And we talked about it all
the time with each other,

88
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,070
but men are not part of that
conversation. And, um, and so I actually,

89
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,510
the book grew out of a piece.

90
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,780
I ended up writing for the Wall
Street Journal called women at work,

91
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,930
a guide for men and in which I say,
and this is the point of the book,

92
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,690
women talking to each other.
It's a great conversation.

93
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,980
It's half a conversation and the
only way we're gonna get, you know,

94
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,000
that gets us to half the solution.

95
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,470
So the only way we solve this is for
us to all understand we need to work

96
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,340
together and bring men into the
conversation. So at a high level,

97
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:20,300
that's the most important thing.
That was amazing to see that today.

98
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:24,710
I also love seeing men here,
which is great. Um, and,

99
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,690
and I'd love being invited here.
Um,

100
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:30,550
I've been talking to a lot of male
dominated organizations. Um, you know, uh,

101
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,710
there are so many things that we can
talk about and I actually have a cheat

102
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,920
sheet in the back of the book on 10
things you can do right now to close the

103
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:37,780
gender gap.
But there,

104
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,030
it really breaks down into things that
individuals can do and things that

105
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,260
organizations can do.

106
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,000
And just to talk for a moment
organizationally because
I do think a lot of the

107
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:51,830
things that were on those five changes
actually mirror things that I recommend

108
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:55,100
in the book. Um, I, uh, things like, uh,

109
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:59,480
gender wage gap analysis
that is transparent I think
is very, very important.

110
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:03,890
There's a law now in the UK that just
went into effect that companies must

111
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,720
report their gender wage gap analysis.

112
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:10,340
And would anyone like to take a guess of
how many companies in the UK pay women

113
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,290
more than they pay men? Zero. Exactly.

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,610
Zero.
Well,

115
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:20,120
it's really important to know that
information so that you can act on that

116
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,620
information.
Um,

117
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,570
there are companies as well that
actually build it into compensation to

118
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,860
incentivize not just hiring,
but training,

119
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:35,030
recruitment and promotion and retaining
diverse talent, not just women,

120
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:39,110
but all diverse talent. I think
that that's very helpful. Um,

121
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,810
and then there are things
that we as individuals can do,

122
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:45,680
but the bottom line for organizations is
it really, it must come from leadership.

123
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:48,080
This is something I've learned.
I've been traveling around the country.

124
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,320
And I think the frustration that led to
the walkout today was a frustration in

125
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:58,130
that it's not that, you know, there's
thousands of women who have walked out.

126
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,240
It's not like thousands of women
have been sexually abused at work,

127
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,560
but I think it's,

128
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:08,030
it's the signal that that sends when
you have some bad behavior at the top,

129
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:08,930
the,

130
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,530
the signal that it sends to the rest of
the organization and through the culture

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,950
is that if you have that
kind of behavior at the top,

132
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,060
then what does that say about how we value
women in the rest of the organization?

133
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:22,550
And that translates into
things like respect,

134
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:26,060
which there's a huge respect gap between
men and women that has been documented

135
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,380
in the research.
Um,

136
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,360
and it's those kinds of things that I
think that we really individually we all

137
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,310
can address. As you point out,
often a role modeling is key.

138
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,960
Absolutely. And, and awareness is key. I
mean, I talk a lot about unconscious bias.

139
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:42,591
When you read the book,

140
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:46,940
there's actually a chapter focused
on Google and its efforts to combat

141
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:47,751
unconscious bias.

142
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:52,751
And I spent time with a fabulous
unconscious bias expert in your New York

143
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:57,160
office, Brian Welly, who's
absolutely great researcher. Um,

144
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,570
but I think that the question really yeah,

145
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,760
in unconscious bias is it's so important.

146
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:04,170
You have to be aware of it all the time.

147
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,720
And I know you guys have
unconscious bias trainings, um,

148
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,490
but a couple of hours of training
does not transform a culture.

149
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,100
And so there's so many things that,
um,

150
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,870
that we need to be aware of just in
everyday life. Um, unconscious bias,

151
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:21,090
I'm sure you all know what it is
because you've all been trained, right?

152
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:24,270
It's the biases we have that
are buried so deep inside of us.

153
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,220
We don't even realize they exist and we
all have them. Men, women, black, white,

154
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,750
no matter what.
We all have them

155
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,900
deeply about. Our tribes are in a
sense that sort of sense of tribalism.

156
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,950
It is. It is. And so we don't always,
we're not always aware of how that,

157
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,880
how that impacts us, but,
but just as a couple of,

158
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,970
for instances, um, you know, women,

159
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,930
it turns out women are interrupted
three times more frequently than men.

160
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,040
The Northwestern actually did a study of
the Supreme Court of the United States

161
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,950
and found that these females,

162
00:09:55,951 --> 00:10:00,280
supreme court justices are interrupted
three times more frequently than male

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,670
Supreme Court justices. Um,
another thing that they'd probably,

164
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:07,110
every woman here has
experienced, um, is, uh,

165
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,750
that thing that happens when
you're in a room. Generally,

166
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:13,930
if women are in a minority in a group,
in a meeting,

167
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:18,380
which has certainly happened to me many
times, and most of you probably, um,

168
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,330
it is true, your voices aren't heard. Um,

169
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,440
there's this research shows that if
you make up 30% or less of a room, um,

170
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,550
the women's voices are there.

171
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,950
They're literally like the ear is
tuned to the male voices in the room.

172
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,130
So, um, how many women here,
I've had that experience, right?

173
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:41,080
Where you say something in a meeting
and it's like nobody heard it. Crickets,

174
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,000
right? And then two minutes later a guy
repeats exactly what you just said and

175
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:50,560
everybody throws at him. They're like,
Dave, great idea you had Dave. Right?

176
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:51,580
Well that I,

177
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,180
that's happened to me a million times
and I used to think it was just me,

178
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,560
but it turns out it is in the research
that is actually something that is very

179
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:00,940
common to almost all women.

180
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,640
Okay. You mentioned, um, training,
unconscious bias training.

181
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,940
One of the things that I was surprised
to learn from the book was the research

182
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:16,550
that tells us that diversity training
doesn't work and that it's in fact

183
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,410
counterproductive. Um, you know, it
felt counterintuitive to me, but,

184
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,970
but also as you went into it wise,
um,

185
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,090
and so I think it'd be great for you to
explain like, why is that the case? And,

186
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,760
and,
and more importantly,

187
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:35,000
what do you think that tells us about
how we guide our workforce force in,

188
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:37,160
in building a gender equal culture?

189
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,791
Yeah.
Yeah.

190
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,420
So there actually research a Harvard
professor by the name of Frank Dobbin did

191
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:46,290
this research where he looked at,
and this was at a traditional, um,

192
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,630
diversity training.

193
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:52,631
So he looked at 30 years of diversity
training at more than 800 companies.

194
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,390
And he found that for two groups,

195
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,510
for women as well as
for black men and women,

196
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,420
that not only did it not work,

197
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,010
it actually made things worse for
those two groups. In other words,

198
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,690
those companies, those two groups would
have fared better in those companies,

199
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,000
had there been no training at all.

200
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,820
And he dial delved into
the reasons for this.

201
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:18,520
And there were a variety of reasons.
Um,

202
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,940
but one of them was that,
um,

203
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,010
it was resentment on the
part of the primarily white
men who were subject to the

204
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,790
training.

205
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,000
So I went back and found some of these
traditional trainers and one of them

206
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,930
actually said to me, look, when we started
diversity training about 30 years ago,

207
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,980
um, it was in response
to lawsuits and he said,

208
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,000
and our process basically was beating
white guys over the head with a two by

209
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:47,140
four and trying to make them feel guilty.
And he sent out a big cry.

210
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,250
And even better, so
the, the, the, you know,

211
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:56,251
it had exactly the reverse of the intended
effect that actually has in gendered

212
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,470
and led to the rise of
unconscious bias training.

213
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,840
Because the idea with unconscious
bias training is we all have it.

214
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,210
We're not trying to make
you feel guilty about it.

215
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,300
We're just trying to help
you interrupt it. Um,

216
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,670
but I think the issue with
unconscious bias training you do,

217
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:14,050
you still do have people including a, you
had a situation here at Google as well.

218
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:17,860
You do have people who still feel
like they're getting beaten up. Um,

219
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,800
but I think the larger issue
really is simply unconscious bias.

220
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,380
Training is not in and of itself a fix.

221
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,680
It is a piece of a culture
and that culture really is
that that's what we really

222
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:34,450
need is a cultural overhaul. And that's,
that's not specific to Google. This is,

223
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,510
this is our corporate life in this country
really needs to have an overhaul in

224
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,060
how we interact with one another.

225
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,220
You can't help but think there's,
there's,

226
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,970
I mean there's something very deep in
that, I mean, you mentioned for instance,

227
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,220
just the dynamics of how we guide
irrespective of this issue of how we give

228
00:13:57,181 --> 00:14:01,500
criticism to people saying performance
reviews in your k in one of the things

229
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:05,670
you mentioned in, and also in terms of
being too shy about giving harsh guidance.

230
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,350
But to me though, I think the
larger lesson is that is, um,

231
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,580
which I think we learned in all kinds
of ways in terms of parenting is like,

232
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:19,581
it's always so much better to give an
individual and guidance to how they can

233
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:25,101
succeed and assume they will succeed
rather than telling them about all the

234
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:28,830
things they've done wrong and assuming
they will continue to do it wrong.

235
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,910
Right. Yeah, I would totally
agree with that. I would add in,

236
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:36,170
there was some research that shows
us some of the biases that creep into

237
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,700
performance reviews. So,
um, one actually is, um,

238
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,670
and this, this stunned me actually,
I'm sorry, but for the in,

239
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,220
in writing the book I traveled
around the country and the,

240
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:50,450
and the world seeking are primarily men
in positions of authority who are trying

241
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:55,160
to close the gap. And the first question
because I wanted to learn from them,

242
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,360
you know,
what are the strategies,

243
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:59,750
like what are success stories and
strategies that we can all learn from.

244
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,450
But one of the, the first question
I would always ask them is,

245
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:07,451
tell me what perplexes or frustrates
you about the women who you work with.

246
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,350
And I was stunned by how
many of these men said,

247
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,150
I'm afraid she'll cry.

248
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:19,700
Now it is actually true that younger
women do cry biologically speaking more

249
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:20,534
than older men.

250
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,220
But the interesting thing is these
men were afraid that they would

251
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,610
unintentionally say something
to a subordinate female
and unintentionally hurt

252
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:35,630
her feelings. But here's the
thing, the research tells us,

253
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,550
and actually any woman in this room will
also tell us that when a woman does cry

254
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,130
at work,
it is not because her feelings are hurt,

255
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,860
it is because she's pissed off.

256
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,680
She's furious.

257
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,610
A woman crying at work is
actually treating much the
same thing as a man yelling

258
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,600
at work. But these executive men,
it has a serious consequence,

259
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,360
which is actually catalyst did this
survey of executive men and said,

260
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:02,960
what might stand in
the way of you, um, uh,

261
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:06,250
supporting gender equality at work and uh,

262
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,990
something like it was a
more than 70% of them,

263
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:13,820
I think it was 74% of them cited fear.
And part of the fear was,

264
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:17,120
you know, fear of loss of status,
particularly among other men.

265
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,590
But part of the fear was fear
of saying the wrong thing. And,

266
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,170
and what that led to and
other research has shown this,

267
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:29,000
is that these men who were in positions
of authority are afraid to give candid

268
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:32,660
feedback to women in the way
that they give it to men.

269
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,920
And what that results in is women
getting many more of these, um, um,

270
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,100
evaluations that talk about
their personality. Um,

271
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,670
and often have a personality critique.
You know,

272
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,440
she's abrasive or brash or
aggressive in a bad way.

273
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,250
Um,

274
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,250
versus men who tend to get
very constructive performance
oriented critiques.

275
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,680
And again, that's another
thing. It's very subtle,

276
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:01,430
but what that ends up doing is giving
men more of the information they need to

277
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:03,110
succeed and the women aren't getting it.

278
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:09,240
You're getting too many insights about
unconscious bias into our cultural biases,

279
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,500
um, into stereotypical
models of male behavior,

280
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,440
stereotypical models of societal
behavior for that matter.

281
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,970
And like you mentioned in the
book that you wear high heels, uh,

282
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,210
to in a sense puts yourself
closure on more equal footing,

283
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,620
which interestingly resonated
with me and that I, uh,

284
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,600
I'm not a particularly tall guy.
I've,

285
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,500
I've raised a lot of money from
venture capital firms and the,

286
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,130
the end of that process is always you
presenting to the full partnership.

287
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:42,150
But there Monday meeting and these
are talk about macho ego driven rooms.

288
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,650
It's like way up there and
the ethos and VC firms is,

289
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:51,430
it's the idea is one thing,
but it's all the CEO, um,

290
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,010
in, in a pretty extreme way. And when
I would go into those presentations,

291
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:58,680
I would literally sort of puff myself up.

292
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,270
I would stand several inches taller.
I would get closer to people,

293
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:07,650
I'd use my arms, I'd speak
more loudly. Um, you know,

294
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:11,880
to kind of present myself in the
way they were expecting to see me.

295
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,260
Um, and I think there are obvious
techniques that work for all,

296
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,830
but I couldn't help in thinking about
that saying, in fact, my wife, by the way,

297
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,880
she jokes, she's like, you're the only
five, nine guy who thinks he's six, two,

298
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,620
um, but we're a six PC.
But does that, is that,

299
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,410
are we playing into patriarchal
models with that? I mean,

300
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:35,850
to what extent is it about patriarchal
models or is it about societal models and

301
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,670
how does that matter to
what we're talking about?

302
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,420
Yeah. Look, I mean we,

303
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:44,421
it would be great for us to be able to
wipe out all of these kinds of concerns.

304
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,360
Like, like that right. It would
be terrific. But until then,

305
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,220
there are strategies and,

306
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:55,221
and what you experienced is what women
experience every day and often many times

307
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:59,370
a day. So, um, so I actually
in the, in the research,

308
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,850
so I do wear high heels everyday and I
always thought it was because I worked

309
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,180
around men and I wanted to have
a physically larger presence.

310
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:11,460
But it turns out that taller women
earn 8% more than shorter women.

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,460
Women who wear makeup earn
more than those who do not.

312
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,670
Women who are thin out earn those who
are heavy and people generally men and

313
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:23,360
women who were better looking
for more and taller. Right?

314
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,290
Hi, is it fast? Yeah. Yup.

315
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:29,130
It is an actual, it's a thing. It's
a real thing. Um, but for women,

316
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:33,300
grooming actually counts much more.
And there was this great calculation.

317
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:35,130
Debora spar,
who was the president of Barnard,

318
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:38,010
calculated that over the
course of her career,

319
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:43,310
a professional woman will spend a total
of five full years longer than her male

320
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:48,990
spouse or a colleague getting
ready for work. Like the hair,

321
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:53,010
the makeup, the, you know,
just maintenance. And we
talked down. Fascinating.

322
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:57,320
But again, it's, it's the, the,
the world that we live in and, and,

323
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,870
and including Google,
I mean the,

324
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:03,750
the work world that we live
in was created by men for men.

325
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,180
And so women are in a,

326
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:10,320
in a sense trying everyday there's a
thousand things we do, some conscious,

327
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:13,650
some unconscious to try and fit
into the world created by men.

328
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,060
And a huge reason why I wrote, that's
what she said was to make men aware.

329
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,450
I actually gear the book toward men even
though, I mean it's for women as well,

330
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:22,260
obviously.

331
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,220
But I really want to bring men in and
to understand what some of these issues

332
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:30,030
are just so that they have an
awareness of it. Because you know,

333
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,910
women are leaning in so
far we're falling over. Um,

334
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,540
but the man who I spoke to were awesome
and these are guys who realize that they

335
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,770
have to reach out as well. It's not
just a one sided thing. And I think,

336
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,800
I do think that there's been a little bit
of a too much of an onus put on women,

337
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,420
particularly these past few
years, that it's all on us, ran a,

338
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:53,910
we have to demand to be paid what we're
worth. We have to go out there and, and,

339
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,510
and, and, um, you know, fix the
patriarchy. Ah, but in fact,

340
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:02,230
it actually, this is a two sided
equation and we need the men to,

341
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,570
to recognize that as well and join us.

342
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,810
I'm going to move to the audience.
Um, there's a question on the dory,

343
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,090
um, that I think relates to what
we're talking about here. Uh,

344
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,331
this person says,

345
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:19,290
you've talked about differences in the
ways that women and men typically present

346
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:23,300
their thoughts, suggestions
versus declarations. Uh,

347
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,130
not all men and women
present in the typical way.

348
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,630
How much of the lack of respect for
those approaches do you tribute to the

349
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:34,980
approach itself? The technique
versus speakers? Gender?

350
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,860
Yeah, that's a great question. And the
first thing I would say is that, so,

351
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:43,861
so it is documented that women do use
more hedging language than men do.

352
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:46,990
And that would be things like,
I hate to bother you, but,

353
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,770
and this might be a
stupid question, but, um,

354
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,270
we use more up speak like when we ask a
question when we made a statement, um,

355
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,530
and we apologize all the time
and we are not sorry. Uh,

356
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,900
but we will use that verbal tick and
we're highly aware of these verbal ticks

357
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:04,750
and we try like tracing to,
to counteract them.

358
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,810
But the other thing I will say is I've
heard from so many readers if that's what

359
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:12,100
she said, who are, because all of
this applies not just to women,

360
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,810
but to pretty much anyone who is
in an underrepresented group. Um,

361
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,710
and so much of the research I site
also deals not just with women but with

362
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:21,700
underrepresented groups.

363
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,420
And one of the groups of
people have readers who that
I have heard a lot from is

364
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,550
introverted men who say,

365
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,090
all of these behaviors
are my behaviors as well,

366
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:35,680
and I suffer from the same consequences.
So I think it's, it's relevant,

367
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,460
highly relevant.
And,

368
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:41,860
and that's why it's so important to be
aware of it because it is right now.

369
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:46,780
It isn't the norm of behavior and women
have spent many years trying to fit that

370
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:51,640
norm. And what we need to do
is have men be aware and women,

371
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,180
all of us kind of be aware of these
different communication styles and just be

372
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,014
more,

373
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,210
yeah,
sensitive to,

374
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,060
I want to be specific to it and I'm
going to take the next question from the

375
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:03,180
room so you get your thoughts together.
Um,

376
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,070
couple of things there.

377
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,180
You mentioned in the book about
how important mentoring is. A,

378
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:15,290
you mentioned how often
senior men are uncomfortable,

379
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,890
concerned about perceptions
in mentoring younger women,

380
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,330
which frankly had kind of
thing as a cop out. Um,

381
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:27,300
I think if we can as professionals figure
out how to manage that dynamic, then,

382
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,520
you know, probably you shouldn't
be doing what you're doing.

383
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,530
But just put that aside. Um,
in, in my own experience,

384
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,730
I particularly in Mike more
advanced stage as it were,

385
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,780
meaning I'm old. Um, um, I, I do enjoy, I,

386
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,470
one of my great pleasure that Google
trying to coach people. I say try.

387
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:50,630
I don't know how good
at it. I am, but, but,

388
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,890
but I've also sense that in this
engineering centric culture,

389
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,000
um,
uh,

390
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,710
it's not just about men and women and
it's not just about women in this regard.

391
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,270
Um, that, uh, there are many folks
here who are, who are introverted,

392
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,780
not self assertive. Um, um,

393
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,210
but the question I have for you is,
is

394
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,600
I mean today and I try to coach women in
pretty much the same way as that coach

395
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:19,190
men.
Um,

396
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,900
but are there different approaches that
one should take place or is it just

397
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:25,340
about different sensitivities?

398
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,450
So first of all,
100% agree with you about being a cop out.

399
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:33,780
There's on, there are men out there who
say up like, yeah, no, me too. I can't,

400
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,110
I'm never going to talk to a
woman. I can't mentor a woman. Um,

401
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:39,570
and that's just bullshit. Sorry,
I have no patience for that.

402
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,620
That's generally men who
aren't mentoring women anyway.

403
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,070
But there are many,
many different ways to mentor.

404
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:50,220
And I think that the big
differences and that we are,

405
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,280
we know from the research that women tend
to have mentors who give them advice.

406
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,210
Men tend to have what are known as
sponsors who can get them promotions.

407
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,400
And so actually the,

408
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,730
that Harvard Research I mentioned earlier
thank dob and when he was looking at

409
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:09,870
what are solutions that work versus
the old fashioned diversity training,

410
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,920
one of them was formal
mentorship programs. And the,

411
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:16,230
the idea with a formal
mentorship program is,

412
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:19,980
it's not that I am mentoring
Susan because she's a woman.

413
00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:24,210
It is because I am mentoring whoever
it is because they are in my field.

414
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,450
And very often what ends up happening
is senior women end up being paired with

415
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,230
or, or sought out by other women. Um,

416
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,040
but they're not in the same
field. They can't help. Right.
And it's, it's, you know,

417
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,920
it's not gender mentoring
gender. It is, you want,

418
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,490
you want to be mentored by somebody
who can actually help you advance.

419
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:47,130
And I think that's the, that's
the big, big difference.

420
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,040
Is there a question in
the room I think is this,

421
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,420
um,

422
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,020
I think what you're saying
is so interesting because
when I look back over the

423
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:58,070
course of my career,

424
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,470
no one has done more for me in
my career than white men, right?

425
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,880
And I work with so many women and
I offered my mentorship to them and

426
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,660
sponsorship and in certain cases as well.
And when I often hear is,

427
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,570
is like there's just not enough
females in leadership positions.

428
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:18,650
So I just don't have any mentors. I
don't have any sponsors. And you know,

429
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:19,431
my thought there is,

430
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:24,350
is like it doesn't have to be a woman
like look to these men because they are in

431
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:27,170
the positions of power and
they will do a lot for you.

432
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,940
And I wonder if it's sort of, there's
an oversaturation of just like these,

433
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:36,320
these men don't have enough time to, is,
there's few of them I would say, who are,

434
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:40,670
um, as connected to sort of women in
the way that the women want them to be.

435
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,950
And I'm wondering, you know, how do we,

436
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,330
what can we do to enable more men to
understand how women need to be mentored

437
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,940
and what they expect from sponsorships?

438
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,080
Because so much of it comes back to
your point around women in a lot of

439
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:59,430
underrepresented groups actually don't
get the critical skill based feedback

440
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:02,190
that they need. They're not
getting skill-based mentorship.

441
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,720
And that continues the vicious cycle of
people not sort of understanding what

442
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:11,010
really needs to happen because there's
a fear of hurting feelings or that

443
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:13,190
sensitivity.
So it's that,

444
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,070
yes, you made a great point. And, and um,

445
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,670
and that it actually there what you're
talking about is why this department

446
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,750
professor said these formal programs are
actually more effective. And in fact, um,

447
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,250
there are a couple of organizations
that I cite in the book that,

448
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:29,840
that put into effect
these formal programs.

449
00:27:29,841 --> 00:27:32,210
And they found that it helped
with retention and promotion,

450
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:34,460
not just of the people
who are being mentored,

451
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,060
but it helped with retention of the
people who were doing the mentoring,

452
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,260
which is also really interesting.
Um, but yes, I think we have to,

453
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:46,130
we have to think about that. Skills
based mentoring. We have a tendency,

454
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:50,540
all of us as humans to gravitate toward
people who remind us of ourselves.

455
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,850
And that has been a huge issue. Um,
one of the, one of the solutions,

456
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:59,550
one of the things that my recommendations,
and that's what she said, um,

457
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,440
is to have a Rooney rule.
So you guys know what the Rooney rule is.

458
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:06,230
If it's in football,
if you have an opening,

459
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,430
you need to have a diverse slate
of candidates to choose from.

460
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,350
But what I'm recommending
and what I learned from the
men who I interviewed was,

461
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:16,340
that's not enough.

462
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,540
You actually need to have a diversity of
people who are doing the interviewing.

463
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,050
And that goes to whether they're
thinking about looking at somebody to be

464
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:26,810
promoted or filling an opening,

465
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:30,380
you need a diverse slate of people because
if you've got a bunch of white guys

466
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,380
who are evaluating a
diverse group of people,

467
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,320
you still do not get an optimal result.
And,

468
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,940
and the other thing I will say is so
many companies that I visit with say, oh,

469
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,770
we really want women in our senior ranks,
but we can't find any.

470
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,880
And to them I say, and to Google,
I say, look, in your junior ranks,

471
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,460
look what are you, what's
happening there? Right? What?

472
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:57,110
Look at who are the people who are
coming in? Look at every single level,

473
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:00,410
especially in those low, lower
levels, leading to middle management.

474
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,280
Look at every level and see who are
you promoting it, who are you not,

475
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,390
who are you losing and who are you not
because there's leakage in there and

476
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:12,890
there's people who are being passed
over who, um, who should not be.

477
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,370
Um, and I think that that, and
it doesn't, if you do that,

478
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:20,250
it's not going to take you that long
until you've grown your own leaders. Um,

479
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,660
I actually, I had a, um, so
I spoke at a consulting big,

480
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:28,130
one of the big consulting firms and I
had dinner afterward with a table of 10

481
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,050
senior women at this consulting firm.

482
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:35,350
And they went around the table and all
of them had been recruited by other major

483
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,960
consulting firms and because they
were already at a senior level,

484
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,010
and that's the problem.

485
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,290
If we're just shuffling the
same too few women at the top,

486
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,970
we are not going to get anywhere.
Right. I spoke to a bank that, um,

487
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,170
that before I,

488
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:53,290
when I did a little bit of research and
I found that they had made a commitment

489
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:58,090
to gender equality in 1982 I'm
speaking to her room. I said,

490
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,600
most of you guys here
were not born in 1982.

491
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,290
You had plenty of time to get
yourself to gender equality,

492
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,620
but they're losing the women on the way
up and they're not growing their own

493
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:11,320
leaders.
And I think that is so essential.

494
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:12,760
Not enough companies are focused on that.

495
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,670
Yeah. I think that's so true. By
the way, one of the things I think,

496
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,480
again, I'm trying to facilitate
mentoring and mentoring programs.

497
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,323
MMM.

498
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:28,020
One thing I, I, I feel it also important
to recognize is, is to encourage people,

499
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,620
oh,
um,

500
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:35,220
encourage people to ask
someone for mentoring. Um, uh,

501
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,840
you know, not be shy about that.
I mean, when you think about it,

502
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,580
it's actually kind of a nice ego
inflating thing if come on says it says,

503
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,860
can you help me?
You know more than I do.

504
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:48,840
You've been around the track a few
more times. Um, that, uh, it's, it's,

505
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:54,240
that's a, that's a very simple path
if you can be comfortable doing that.

506
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,520
So that's the key is if you
can be comfortable. I mean gas,

507
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,680
I agree that's a great idea.
But I think again,

508
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:03,490
it puts the onus on the person
with less power and we've,

509
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:06,850
we put too much onus already
on the people with less power.

510
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:10,030
We need to go more on the
people with power. And in fact,

511
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,830
while I was writing the book and I was,

512
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:16,660
I can add and it actually changed the
way I manage and I started realizing that

513
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:19,750
when we had openings, and especially
like with internal openings,

514
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,110
I'd have all these guys who
would put their hands up for it,

515
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,770
but there would be women or
or minority Pete, you know,

516
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,530
people of color who were not
putting their hands up, who should,

517
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,630
would have been very qualified in the
pool. So I took it on myself to say,

518
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,970
cause I was in the middle of this
research, I was like, wait a second.

519
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,670
So I would like actually
going in the newsroom and,

520
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,940
and talk to people and bring
them into my office and say, Hey,

521
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:44,380
I see you didn't put your hand up.

522
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,460
You should know that you were
qualified to be in this pool.

523
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,230
Doesn't mean that you would get the job.

524
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,880
And I'm not telling you you have to put
your hat in, but you should know that.

525
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,080
And if you're not interested,

526
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,990
let's talk about what you might
be interested in down the line.

527
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,480
And I realized belatedly,

528
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:06,481
I think that it was really my
responsibility as a leader to go out and,

529
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,760
and make sure that these people who have
talent are given these opportunities

530
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,990
and it shouldn't always be on their head.

531
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,203
Excellent point.

532
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,970
I'm going to move to our verge. Oh, we
have a [inaudible] virtual audience.

533
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,540
Thank you.
Um,

534
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:28,930
sometimes at an individual level we will
see managers behaving in ways that are

535
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:34,430
not as agregious as firing,

536
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,760
but still are kind of leading
outcomes that decreased diversity.

537
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,563
And

538
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,250
I have thought about speaking up many
a time and I've had male mentors for me

539
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,650
who cared about me personally,
who advised me not to speak up,

540
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,540
that it would hurt my career.

541
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,890
And one of the few times
that I did choose to do that,

542
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,270
suddenly I, I did feel some,
some pretty bad consequences.

543
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,680
So what is your advice to people who
are seeing things that are in the gray

544
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:18,830
area? Yes. Should they actually,

545
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,750
what kinds of actions are
actually productive? Cause
I haven't figured it out.

546
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,220
Yeah. I, this is where allyship
is so important. I mean,

547
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,850
what you're talking about is so
common in all organizations. Um,

548
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,380
and this is, I talk a lot about
different kinds of allies,

549
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:39,430
women with women or with men. Um, but
that's what's so important. I mean,

550
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:43,420
I think one of the issues particularly
that women face is particularly if this

551
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,020
behavior is directed at them
and, and, and maybe it does,

552
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,060
it doesn't rise to the level of firing,

553
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:53,830
but it is demeaning perhaps
or, or, or dismissive.

554
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:58,600
Um, and the women feel like, Ugh, I got
to figure out how to deal with this.

555
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,620
And that's where allies come in. Um, in,
in the case that you're talking about,

556
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:04,540
I would have hoped that the
mentors would have, would have,

557
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,630
they would have stepped up and intervened.
And that's,

558
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,610
that's the kind of behavior that we
want to encourage that kind of allyship.

559
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:11,831
And I,

560
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:16,831
and I tell people that your ally
can be somebody at your level.

561
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:18,970
It can be somebody in
a different department.

562
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:20,560
I have found in different organizations,

563
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:23,440
sometimes I have been approached by
somebody who doesn't report to me,

564
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:27,110
who was not in my department to
tell me about some sort of, um,

565
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,790
behavioral issues with the manager.
And it's really important to do that.

566
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:35,200
And one of the reasons it's important
is because I can say almost every time,

567
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,610
maybe every time that has ever happened
to me where I'd been approached about

568
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,890
with somebody says,
I don't want to bring it up to my boss.

569
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:46,870
But almost always the person they're
talking about has a history of bad

570
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:49,000
behavior.
And they,

571
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:53,350
so you need to surface that so that
the person can be either talk to

572
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:57,820
disciplined, dismissed, whatever,
whatever the correct course of action is.

573
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,100
Too often we, we stay quiet. And that's
why it's important to have that ally.

574
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,980
And I'm sure Richard, you've probably
had this situation to people, you know,

575
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,140
you're, you're like, you're
one of the good guys, right?

576
00:35:08,141 --> 00:35:11,800
So I can imagine somebody coming
to you and confiding in you,

577
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,860
but I would imagine you wouldn't tell
them to be quiet. You would try and,

578
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,930
no, I mean, and I, you know,
I can't say it was like no,

579
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,410
always with the perfect techniques are,

580
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:24,360
but you have so many of
those circumstances. I mean,
it's understandable that,

581
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,223
that,

582
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,510
that the individual construct confronting
the manager is not likely to achieve

583
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:35,050
the best result in both ways for that
matter and ended up with a consequence you

584
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,780
don't like, which is why you, you'd like,

585
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:42,570
do you think that that organizations would
have people and mechanisms to address

586
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:47,430
that cause in that context? Um, you know,
depending on the circumstance, yeah,

587
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:51,090
there are ways to address that and there
a drays to west or address that without

588
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:55,580
the individual being in a sense brought
into the equation. Right, right. Yeah.

589
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,470
I can give it bad
behavior. It, I, you know,

590
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,130
I don't have to declare who
complained, uh, there, you know,

591
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,760
there are lots of clever ways to
deal with that. I think if you, if,

592
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,880
if you try,
and actually two quick ones because I'm,

593
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,410
these both worked in real
life. So one was, uh,

594
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,790
I was talking to a senior executive,

595
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:16,940
I was out on book tour and
the senior executive, a big
consumer products company,

596
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,130
um,
came up to me to that to tell me,

597
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,630
he said he had a team senior team and he
said there was a woman on his team and

598
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:26,540
she was like a real ball buster. She was
great. Like he didn't worry about her,

599
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,810
but she came to him privately and said,
Hey,

600
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,540
have you noticed that when
we are in our meetings,

601
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:37,550
there's this particular guy who every
time I opened my mouth he shuts me down or

602
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:41,330
cuts me off or takes credit for my idea.
And this boss said,

603
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,830
actually I had not noticed, but once I did
we need, he said, we made a secret pact.

604
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,190
And the secret pact was I was going to
be on the lookout for that behavior.

605
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:52,640
And every time I saw it I was
going to intervene and back her up.

606
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,760
And he wouldn't have known
had she not mentioned that.

607
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,090
And one other example in which
happened with me was somebody not in my

608
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:04,070
department came to me at an
organization. And, and said,

609
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:08,480
I don't want to complain to my own boss,
but there's a particular guy who is,

610
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,960
is dismissive. And I know another
woman who quit because the way he,

611
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,180
they didn't like the way you treated,

612
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,830
but it's not like he's hitting
on us or anything like that.

613
00:37:15,831 --> 00:37:19,590
It's just dismissive beer.
So I actually went to, um,

614
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,590
a friend in HR and the friend said,

615
00:37:21,591 --> 00:37:26,591
I'm so glad you came to me because
that particular guy has a record.

616
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,200
I didn't know that. Um, but
that's why it's so important.

617
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,060
Like they needed this information,

618
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:35,480
they needed to know this information so
that they could take the proper action.

619
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,510
So I mean, in some cases, what I've
done at night, you know, again,

620
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:43,740
it's so much depends on the circumstance
is in providing that feedback to the

621
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:46,220
individual as you sort of like
multiply it, right. Instead of like,

622
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,280
I'm getting feedback. Yeah. Yes.

623
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:52,030
And it's not necessarily singular
and getting feedback. Yep.

624
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,450
Obviously that doesn't work in all
circumstances and I get that. I don't, I,

625
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,750
I think one of the last ones
are just like, you know,

626
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:01,410
Richard Di you use a lot of
foul language. Uh, you know,

627
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,790
some people aren't comfortable with that
and I see some people I work laughing.

628
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,010
I haven't yet mastered this solution
to that, but I'm trying over here.

629
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,510
Hi. Um, so I have a question, um,

630
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:20,110
about when working towards
closing the gender gap,

631
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,200
how do we make sure that people that
don't identify as gender binary fall

632
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:27,280
through the cracks?

633
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,620
That's a great question. The,
the, and I make a real effort in,

634
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:35,350
that's what she said to look at research.
That is it.

635
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,200
The book itself is gender,

636
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,380
but I make a real effort to
look at underrepresented groups.

637
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,120
And I think what you're
talking about people there,

638
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:46,630
you're talking about fall into the
category of underrepresented groups. And,

639
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,430
and that did,

640
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,130
if you're talking about people
who are not gender binary, um,

641
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,650
people who are people who fall into
other, you know, religious minority,

642
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:57,550
I mean there are,
there are,

643
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,610
there are a lot of people
who unfortunately experienced
these same issues and I

644
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:08,590
think a lot of the same strategies hold
and I was very cognizant of that as I

645
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:12,630
put together the cheat sheet. I'm at
the end of the book for, you know,

646
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,260
recommendations and things we can do.

647
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:19,261
And I'm actually working as we speak on
updating the book for paperback to look

648
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:23,650
separately for individuals steps.

649
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:27,010
We can take an organization's steps
that organizations should be taking.

650
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,880
Thank you. Um, I'm going to go
to our virtual audience. Um,

651
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,780
how much of a company's actions are
attributed to it being self serving?

652
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,460
A quote I've heard is that human
resources will help someone as long as it

653
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:43,530
doesn't go against the
interest of the company.

654
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,660
Yeah.
So I think that your allies,

655
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,200
when I'm talking about
allyship is not necessarily HR.

656
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:54,310
Hr does have a role in
protecting the company. Um,

657
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,720
I what I,

658
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,750
what I strongly feel is the best
way to overhaul the culture.

659
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,340
And it really does have to
start with the leadership.

660
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:06,220
The leadership has to not just talk the
talk, but they have to walk the walk.

661
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:10,420
They have to model the behavior and
um, and they have to sh, you know,

662
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:13,440
and I also think that, um, um,

663
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:18,450
incentives need to be modeled as well
to incentivize the right kinds of

664
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:23,920
behaviors. We all react according to
incentives and if our incentives, um,

665
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,540
have nothing to do with, it's kind of the,
yeah, the, the inclusion and diversity,

666
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,370
then we're not going
to pay attention to it.

667
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,320
And I've met some amazing Dni
professionals in my travels,

668
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,970
but they alone cannot change a culture.
Really only the leadership can do that.

669
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,663
I'm to,

670
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,240
I'm going to probe a little bit more to
that because it's obviously it's, it's,

671
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,210
it's actually, it's absolutely true that
companies operate out of self interest.

672
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,030
I mean, they should, it's the nature
of, uh, of its existence, uh, you know,

673
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,020
rewarding at shareholders, so on
and so forth. To me, the, the, the,

674
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,040
the objective indeed the opportunity is
how do you guide that to be more self

675
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:09,100
enlightened, uh, or uh, in enlightened
self interest is what I'm trying to say.

676
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:14,101
And you talk a lot in the
book about examples of how
companies are stronger when

677
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:15,850
they have a gender diversity,

678
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:19,120
how they design better products
when they have gender diversity.

679
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:22,610
So to me that's the
enlightened self interest. Yup.

680
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,460
How do you build a talented workforce?

681
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,630
Absolutely. Absolutely. So every
piece of research shows you,

682
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:28,830
and you've probably heard some of this,

683
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:33,650
that and gender balanced leadership
and the gender balanced organization is

684
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:36,530
actually more successful
by every financial measure.

685
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,260
And that goes for your board of directors.
You know,

686
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:42,980
companies that have the most women on
boards are more financially successful

687
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:46,790
than those with the least companies with
gender balanced leadership outperform

688
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,760
those without, by a factor of, you know,

689
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,690
like a double digit percentage
in terms of return on equity.

690
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,340
But also workgroups,

691
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:59,180
gender balanced work groups
are better at problem solving.

692
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:01,880
They're more creative when
it comes to solutions.

693
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:05,750
There was even this research that showed
that they are more accurate in solving

694
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:09,620
a murder. Um, there was this
research where they had to,

695
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,940
they had is an all male,

696
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:14,510
all female and mixed gender group and
they gave them a real life murder case to

697
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:16,780
solve.
And um,

698
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
both single sex groups had so much fun
with this exercise and they agreed very

699
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:26,690
quickly on who the culprit was and they
were very confident of the results.

700
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,280
The mixed gender group took longer.
It was less fun.

701
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:34,520
There was more back and forth.
They were less confident that the result.

702
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:37,310
But guess who was right? They
were right. They were right.

703
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:41,750
Because you need that input from a
variety of perspectives to really come to

704
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:43,430
your ultimate best solution.

705
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,130
So another question
from the audience.

706
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,090
While Google strives for diversity,
it can be a challenge.

707
00:42:52,091 --> 00:42:57,091
When Rankin file managers do not value
diversity of opinions or recognize

708
00:42:57,311 --> 00:43:00,610
employees who approach problems
from a different perspective,

709
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,620
how can that be managed?
Now,

710
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:07,270
actually this kind of hits home with me
because this is something where I feel I

711
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:11,980
often have to kind of remind myself to um,

712
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,960
in gender multiple opinions and frankly
breakthrough my own thinking. I mean,

713
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:21,961
I think there's is interesting
psychological element
that as any of us become

714
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,360
more confident in what we do,
um,

715
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,390
more confident in whether it's
leadership skills or knowledge,

716
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:33,420
you also inherently kind of start to
close your mind a little bit and it takes

717
00:43:34,481 --> 00:43:38,470
effort to break through. I don't
feel like I've mastered that at all.

718
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,480
Yeah, I think that that is a
great point. And they, the, um,

719
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:46,910
that's part of the diversity that that's
part of the awareness factor. I mean,

720
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,910
being aware that you tend
to like, you know, I,

721
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:55,490
I've been in organizations where they say,
oh, the boss really likes brassy women.

722
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,030
Well, what if you're a quiet woman?
Right? Uh, you know, the, the, you,

723
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,840
you really have to check yourself.
And again, I do think that, um,

724
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,470
this is an issue that we see a lot of
in companies where you have sort of

725
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:09,410
enlightened leadership, particularly in
big companies, enlightened leadership.

726
00:44:09,411 --> 00:44:11,660
But then you hear, you know
what, it's not trickling down.

727
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,690
I have a manager who doesn't value
what the company is valuing in terms of

728
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:20,720
diversity of opinion,
diversity of, of approach.

729
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,360
And I do think, again, that is why
it's so that's why I think our, our,

730
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,770
we have these intractable cultural,

731
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,190
um,

732
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,140
which is what leads to things like
today where we had thousands of people,

733
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,580
um, on the walkout in the walkout. Um,

734
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,710
but ultimately sometimes that's what
you need to move the needle to actually

735
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,790
affect change.

736
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,480
At the beginning of the talk,

737
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:52,481
you mentioned that women on the leadership
trainings and conversations can be so

738
00:44:53,661 --> 00:44:55,340
valuable for that audience.

739
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,090
You also mentioned the statistic about um,

740
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,800
women getting interrupted in mixed
company and also diversity training

741
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,820
backfiring.

742
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:10,160
So I wonder how do you recommend that we
bridge those divides besides just sort

743
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:15,161
of waiting for male allies to
self identify and proactively
approached the group

744
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,220
in order to learn more about
the women's perspective?

745
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,970
Right.
So I actually advise women's Erg,

746
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,480
employee resource groups to invite men.

747
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,410
You don't have to invite them all the
time. But there is a great example of a,

748
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:33,020
of a firm, um, where, um, uh,

749
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:38,021
I heard that was a very male dominated
company and they had a women's meeting.

750
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,620
It's not,
it's not company as big as Google.

751
00:45:39,621 --> 00:45:43,640
So they had all women's meeting for all
of their North America operations and

752
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,710
they decided we're going to
have just a women's meeting.

753
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,840
And then the few senior women said, you
know what, for a portion of this meeting,

754
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:52,940
we're each going to invite a senior man.

755
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,480
And it turned out that those invitations
were so coveted that all the senior men

756
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:02,660
were like lobbying to get invited
and like, did you get invited? Right.

757
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:03,740
It was like a big deal.

758
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,810
And the beauty of that was
that these senior men came,

759
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:11,810
they wouldn't have thought
of volunteering themselves,

760
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:16,580
but when they were invited in to hear
this conversation, they were able to,

761
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:21,140
first of all, they were able to hear
what's going on with the women. And,

762
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,510
but secondly,
and I think this is just as important,

763
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:28,040
they were able to create these bonds
and relationships with the women in the

764
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:32,330
firm and they were exposed to the
junior women in the firm as well,

765
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,620
who they normally would not have
really interacted with. So that means,

766
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:41,310
and this is what they found, that,
um, when it comes time for, you know,

767
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,330
big assignments for the,
the, the star assignments,

768
00:46:44,331 --> 00:46:48,710
when it comes time for promotions, these
younger women are now, they're known,

769
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,510
they're top of mind. And it actually helps
with, um, bringing them all together.

770
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:57,410
So, so I do think that there we have
to kind of, we, we have to bring in,

771
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,620
in both sides here.
And when I go and talk to women's groups,

772
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:04,840
I always ask them to invite some man. I'm,
I'm speaking tomorrow at, um, there's, uh,

773
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:09,310
a women's power summit in
Hollywood. So I'm going to La, um,

774
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,240
to talk at this meeting,
but,

775
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:16,270
but I am in the one session where it's
about men and we'll be talking with men

776
00:47:16,971 --> 00:47:20,540
and men are invited into the group because
I feel really strongly like that's,

777
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:25,040
uh, that, that that's where we need to
go. And the men are excited to be there.

778
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,980
Boom. You, you spent so much time on
this but could get ton of research.

779
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,100
Um, what surprised you? What, what,

780
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,770
what challenged your own
assumptions and conclusions?

781
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,790
So I, you know, a lot, but
I would say one of the,

782
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:44,920
probably one of the top issues that I
found as I was doing the research and

783
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:48,160
there's about 50 pages of
research notes in the back. Um,

784
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:53,110
as I was diving into the research, I came
across so many of these issues that I,

785
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,560
my entire life have
thought they were just me.

786
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,930
I thought it was my problem and just me.

787
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,850
And I was stunned to find there is that
it is not just me that is common to

788
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:07,660
women and it's common to people in
underrepresented groups. And, um,

789
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,030
so I think that was probably
the biggest surprise. Um,

790
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,700
and then the other part of it on the plus
side was it really did change the way

791
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,950
I behave as a manager,

792
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,570
both in terms of things like being
really focused on the people who are not

793
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:25,550
raising their hands, um, for a job. Um,

794
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,010
and also being really focused on who is
in the conversation when you're talking

795
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:32,800
about who should get a promotion
or who should get a bonus, right.

796
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,080
Understanding that we need
that diversity of opinion

797
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:43,380
being nor the questions on the door here.
How was,

798
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:46,080
how was the experience with the book
impacted you in the sense of the next

799
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:48,960
chapter of your own career? I
mean, you know, you, you, you,

800
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,410
you achieved great
professional success and we,

801
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:53,340
the organization's leadership positions.

802
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:57,500
This is a very different role
that you're in. Uh, you know,

803
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:01,560
so where do you see this taking
you professionally? Personally?

804
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,880
Yeah, it's been fascinating.
So since the book came out,

805
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:08,590
I've actually been speaking, I've
been kind of nonstop, I'm talking,

806
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:13,360
speaking weird meeting when organizations
and what happened was I started the

807
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:16,210
book three years ago, so
as long before me too, um,

808
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,690
and then me to happened and I doubled the,
on the plus side,

809
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:24,691
there is a growing realization
among organizations
including very male dominated

810
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:28,600
organizations like this one that we
haven't done enough and that there are

811
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:31,450
things that we have tolerated
that we shouldn't be tolerating.

812
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,580
And there is a lot of soul searching about
how do we, what do we do about it? So,

813
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,790
um, I've been, I've, I've been, um,

814
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,630
unexpectedly I expected I would write the
book and go on book tour for two weeks

815
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:48,040
as one does with a book and instead it's
just been sort of endlessly rolling.

816
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:48,940
Um,

817
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,450
because there's a lot of interest among
these organizations in trying to crack

818
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:56,320
the nut of where do we go next
and how do we solve this issue.

819
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,960
I will also tell you,
I have some frustrations in that.

820
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:03,640
It's been a year since me too,
since party Weinstein. Um,

821
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,690
and, um, there's been a lot
of talk, which is great.

822
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,340
There has not been enough action.
And again, I come back to the,

823
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:17,140
the, um, the walkout today,
which I've found so inspiring.

824
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:20,620
But what the walkout is doing is,
is it is a microcosm,

825
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,670
macrocosm of what I am
seeing around the country.

826
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:29,671
As I talk to companies in other industries
who are saying exactly what you guys

827
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:34,520
are saying, which is okay,
we hear you, that you're,

828
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,540
you're, you're saying the right
things, but we need to see action.

829
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:42,560
We need to see movement.
And that is not, um,

830
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,460
that is not unique to Google that I
am seeing that all over the country.

831
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:50,260
And in fact, um, globally as well. I've
been traveling internationally as well,

832
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,960
talking about the same issues and
seeing the same, the same conversation.

833
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,510
I do hope that,
you know,

834
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,440
you're thinking and expressions on this.
Um, it can help move that toward further.

835
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,970
Obviously these aren't,
this is not likely to be a short battle.

836
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:12,010
Um, so I so appreciate what you've
done, what you've shared. I mean,

837
00:51:12,011 --> 00:51:12,850
as I said at the beginning,

838
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:16,600
I think these are just
extraordinary challenging times,

839
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:21,140
divisive times in so many dimensions
in our society and, and, uh, you know,

840
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:25,870
fart gender equality, the
situation politics. Uh, you know,

841
00:51:25,871 --> 00:51:29,530
I still believe that the only way
we can address divisions is to,

842
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,640
is to find way to build bridges,
is to find way to talk across the divides,

843
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:37,330
find the right language, the
right solutions, the right
constructive approaches.

844
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,310
Um, you know, this has been an interesting
and challenging time at Google.

845
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:46,930
I've worked here for nearly 10 years
and I've, I've always believed that.

846
00:51:46,931 --> 00:51:51,490
I do believe that it's a very
different company than most. Um,

847
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,720
it's a company that cares about
principles, that cares about its culture,

848
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:59,740
which doesn't mean it's perfect. Uh,
it's not in fact, I won't ever be,

849
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:04,290
and I think we act always assume
that our culture is not perfect. Um,

850
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,630
but I do think our only way forward is to,
is to engage,

851
00:52:07,631 --> 00:52:12,080
to challenge each other's perspectives,
uh,

852
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,920
challenge each other productively,
constructively,

853
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,120
give them paths to success. Um, uh,

854
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,250
rather than just assume failure.

855
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,540
There are also some things,
and I know we're running out of time,

856
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:28,190
but there are also some things that
are very, um, specific to technology.

857
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,050
Um, so I will just like on just two
quick ones, what, you know, one is, um,

858
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,610
just in terms of, um, algorithms
and who, who's doing the coding,

859
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:41,210
um, whose code is accepted.
Uh, you probably know this,

860
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:43,400
but there's been some
blind blind taste tests.

861
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:47,530
So there was one done with get hub,
which has open source coding. Um,

862
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,030
and when coding was submitted anonymously,

863
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,560
women's code was accepted
more often than men's code.

864
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,930
So you could conclude that
women are better coders. Um,

865
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,650
but when names were attached to the code,

866
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,610
men's code was accepted at a
greater rate than women's code. Uh,

867
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,450
there was an engineer at Facebook who
did a similar experiment who clay and

868
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:11,730
Facebook disputes this, but
this engineer claimed that, um,

869
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,850
a code written by females at Facebook
was 35% less likely to be accepted than

870
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:18,560
code written by men.
And then,

871
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:22,640
then the other piece that that works
into is your algorithm. So when I,

872
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,630
when I go out on the road,

873
00:53:23,631 --> 00:53:26,520
I have like a little PowerPoint that
when I talk about unconscious bias,

874
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,960
I show just Google image
searches for various things that,

875
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:35,910
that show partly our unconscious
bias. Um, as a, as a,

876
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:39,830
as a, you know, one example is
while I was writing the book, um,

877
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:45,140
I just did a search for CEO and image
search and it was all men except for one

878
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:50,070
woman.
And the one woman was CEO Barbie.

879
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,560
And that is a,
that reflects our own unconscious bias,

880
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:59,010
but it also is spit out
to us by an algorithm.

881
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:01,800
And the algorithms are largely
written by men. So, you know,

882
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:04,410
we have these very ingrained,
not intentional,

883
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:08,100
but sort of ingrained issues that
I think also are specific to tech.

884
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,100
And then one other that I would
mention is just simply, um,

885
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,510
in working on the book,

886
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:16,860
I spent time here and I spent time in
the Chelsea office in New York. Um,

887
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,540
and I loved it and I had a great time,
but I come from a male dominated world.

888
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:26,550
Um, but I noticed that, you know, to,
to, to go to the cafe in New York,

889
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:30,670
you pass the Lego Room, you pass the
game room, you know, you're, and I,

890
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,130
and I at the end,

891
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:36,480
after spending time and hearing about
all the great things you're doing to try

892
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,700
and get to gender balance,

893
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:42,150
I just spoke to a group of women
in the New York office and as it,

894
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:45,480
just as we're walking through that office,
I said,

895
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:48,120
I see the guys in the game room. I said,
do you guys ever go to the game room?

896
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:50,730
And they're like, are you kidding?
We want to be taken seriously.

897
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:53,790
We would never do that. And, and
it's just these little things.

898
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:57,210
And it wasn't like they were
complaining about it, but,

899
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,430
but it's a very gendered environment.

900
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:02,700
And it just made me wonder
because it really was decorated.

901
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:05,430
I had the sense of Deja
Vu and I swear to God,

902
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:10,460
I finally realized that the Google office
was decorated like the bedroom of my

903
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:15,060
10 year old son. And, and
it made me wonder like,

904
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,340
what would happen if the Google office
were decorated like a stereotypical 10

905
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:24,660
year old daughter with purple and pink
and fluffy things and glittery guns,

906
00:55:24,661 --> 00:55:25,261
right?
Like,

907
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:28,410
how would the men feel if that's the
environment they worked in every day?

908
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:33,420
So there's these, these, uh, you know,
it's not intentional at all, but it does,

909
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:33,950
it itch.

910
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:38,950
It sort of has an impact on the culture
at large and how women feel and how

911
00:55:39,181 --> 00:55:40,980
comfortable they feel in the culture.

912
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:46,030
Again, thank you. Usually
for what you've done,

913
00:55:46,031 --> 00:55:50,680
for all the work you've done
and for sharing that with
us today and, and, uh, uh,

914
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,340
hope we might have a conversation a
year from now, two years from now,

915
00:55:54,341 --> 00:55:58,060
three years from now, and we might
see progress having been made.

916
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,960
Fantastic. Well, thank you
for having me. Thank you guys.
