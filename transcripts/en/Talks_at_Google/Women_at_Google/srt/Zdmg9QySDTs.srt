1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,170
Good afternoon everybody. Today for the
toxic Google series we have with us,

2
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:14,160
Lauren May bury the lead singer of the
band churches as well as the rest of the

3
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:16,320
band who will be playing
a musical set at the end

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,730
coming onto the scene,

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,260
coming onto the scene two
years ago with their song lies.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,730
There's subsequent single, the mother
we share as well as their debut album,

7
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:35,440
the bones of what you believe
helped propel churches to
the top five of BBC sine

8
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:40,441
of 2013 and award winning appearance at
south by southwest and a worldwide tour.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,170
Please join me in welcoming churches.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,800
[inaudible].

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,800
Now,
most recently,

12
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:57,850
I think a lot of the audience is expecting
to see you guys at outside lands. But,

13
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:01,810
uh, I hear there was a little
issue. Don't bring it up. No. Okay.

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,850
No, we're still quite silent
about it to be honest.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,700
From what I heard, it was
the airport's fault. So

16
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,480
yeah, it was a catalog of
disasters within an airport. Um,

17
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,250
and then there was quite an upsetting
bit where me and Martin got on the plane

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,500
and could see everybody else at the gate,

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,490
but they wouldn't let them on the plane
even though we could see them in the

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:20,980
window.

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,220
And then we sat on the runway
for 45 minutes while they
offloaded all their bags,

22
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:28,810
but they weren't allowed in. The
Dick is very upset, but it's okay,

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,530
we're going to try and um,
get a show in San Francisco.

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,140
So at the store it was an extra,
but she not have one.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,070
We haven't figured out exactly when yet,
but,

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,710
well, I think we're all
looking forward to it then.

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,670
Yeah, no, it's okay.

28
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,120
We don't know when it might happen.
We hope will happen.

29
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:47,991
All right.

30
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:52,991
So a year ago you wrote an article for
the Guardian about the perils of being a

31
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:56,810
front woman in a band
in the social media age.

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,240
Now as a band born on the Internet,

33
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:03,380
I take it that social media and be
able to communicate with your fans is

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,620
incredibly important to you guys.
But at the same time,

35
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:09,620
this also opened up some avenues for,
you know,

36
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,820
abusive comments well beyond just
normal musical criticism. Uh,

37
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:17,300
could you talk a little bit about how you
guys use social media to interact with

38
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:21,920
fans and the experiences that led you
to write the article for The Guardian?

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,930
Yeah. Well, I guess for
us, we came about, um,

40
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,860
getting signed in a kind
of reasonably [inaudible].

41
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,350
We didn't go about the traditional kind
of a tour to the UK for her many years

42
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,640
and then tour of Europe and so on.

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,960
We came to a lot of people's attention
because of online streaming and blogs and,

44
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:44,510
um, people just passing the songs to
each other on social networks. So, um,

45
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,670
we operated on,

46
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,740
signed for quite a long time and it
was just important for us to use those

47
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:53,910
things as a medium to communicate with
people, give them information. And, um,

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,120
I kind of grew up in the MSN era of being
on like band message boards and street

49
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,410
teams and things like that.
So from my point of view,

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,300
social networks for those are kind of
like online street teams, I guess. Um,

51
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,480
and there's been definitely overwhelmingly
positive parts of that for us. But, um,

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,110
cause we oversee that ourselves. I suppose
when you're logging in to do all the,

53
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,191
do all those things,

54
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,220
sometimes you get a little a rape threat
over your breakfast and that's fine.

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,630
But um, well it's not fine I
guess is the point. So, um,

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,520
we just kind of posted a screen grab of
like an example that we got sent. Um,

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,700
and it wasn't even some anything terribly,
terribly offensive. And I was like,

58
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:37,750
this is just generally the tone of
some of this stuff. Please stop. Um,

59
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,200
and then the Guardian gives us the
opportunity to expand on it a bit. Um,

60
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,230
and I think the response was generally
positive to us from people in vans or uh,

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,430
people in the shows. But, um,

62
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,700
I don't know if it changed the
world in any revolutionary way,

63
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,070
but I guess a speaking of it
is probably quite helpful.

64
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,010
And then figuring out the old people
actually it'd be with you on the world

65
00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:01,270
isn't actually just full of horrible
abusive Internet trolls is good too.

66
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,104
It's good to know.

67
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:08,350
So Youtube just recently changed its
policy on allowing anonymous names for a

68
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,230
leaving comments. You can now
leave in a comment anonymously.

69
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,790
I want to know your opinion on why
they're, you know, that will affect any,

70
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,970
do you think that'll affect anything or
is this something that's going to happen

71
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:23,900
regardless of if a people's names
are associated with their messages

72
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,190
so they can,

73
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,510
he's not making you
leave one's anonymously.

74
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,060
I have never actually left a comment on
youtube in my life ever decided like,

75
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:35,770
well, it'd be weird thing to do.
Um, but um, yeah I don't know.

76
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:38,980
I guess I was thinking
about this earlier and it's,

77
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:43,981
but like I think for me it was like it's
a bit personal responsibility and then

78
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,700
who's responsible for that? If people
are posting abusive things, who,

79
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,580
who's the full guy for that?

80
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:53,500
Is that the children networks or is
it the person or like should like law

81
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,770
enforcement be talking about
that? The who is responsible. Um,

82
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,000
and I think where people are allowed
to be anonymous kind of means that they

83
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,640
feel like there's less of
a follower or something.

84
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,600
And I feel like to an extent when
people are on the Internet, no offense,

85
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,860
because I know you guys are
the Internet. Um, they kind of,

86
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,580
there's a certain level of
where you are removed from that.

87
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,070
So maybe you don't feel as much
personal responsibility or something.

88
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,900
I'm not sure I'm worried about that.
Okay.

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,160
Uh,
you also talk about one of the,

90
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,620
this problem stemming from kind
of a lack of empathy on the, uh,

91
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,800
on the side of the people who are
leaving the comments. Um, you know,

92
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:35,360
here at Google we have
a very global reach. Uh,

93
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:39,450
and I was wondering if there's any
suggestions you have for either Google or

94
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:43,680
really the industry in general about how
to kind of promote a sense of empathy

95
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:45,660
in our,
in our applications and you know,

96
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:49,560
we're really changing the way that people
interact, bring it online and you know,

97
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:53,130
it'd be great to kind of bring that sense
of wellbeing that we have in real life

98
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,993
online.

99
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,040
Yeah.
I guess anything like that is helpful.

100
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,890
I think trying to train
the tone of conversations,

101
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:05,300
but I guess in my mind it's
more the stuff that we received,

102
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,090
it just a more exaggerated version
of what happens in real life.

103
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,160
So it's a kind of chicken
and egg thing for me.

104
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,210
Does that reflect society
or does a society reflect
or it's kind of hard to tell

105
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:16,410
which,
but um,

106
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,040
I don't think that threatening and
abusive content exists only online.

107
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,360
People probably wouldn't say as
much of that right to your face.

108
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:26,870
But then there's a reason like why people
think it's okay to say those things

109
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,440
because there's a certain thread
throughout society then makes people think

110
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,160
that's fine.

111
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,670
Like it's not like the only time I've
ever had anybody say anything offensive or

112
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:35,900
sexist to me is in this band,

113
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:39,500
on the Internet that happens to people
at the time I am what was coming out of a

114
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,970
subway in Glasgow and somebody,

115
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,900
it was like the last time we at night
and someone showed me his penis and said,

116
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,620
do you think you're too good for it?
Darlin which is funny now maybe.

117
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,850
But at the time I was like,
hmm,

118
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,090
I was like 21 coming home
from work and I was like,

119
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:57,440
it's not funny when you're there on the
receiving end of that so to speak. Um,

120
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,260
so I don't on what do you say? I
was like, I can't, like I have no,

121
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,900
I'm like five foot two.
It was like 1130 at night.

122
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,360
He's a massive guy and had two other
inmates with the warm I specifically by

123
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:13,190
that. So, um, yeah, maybe he goes around
leaving horrible comments on the Internet.

124
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,220
I don't know. Or maybe he's busy doing
it in real life. It's hard to say

125
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,360
like,
so for obviously you chose to,

126
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,830
to speak up a part of the article is that
you're not just going to quote unquote

127
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:26,720
deal with it,
uh,

128
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,530
as a lot of people told you to do when you
wrote the article originally, uh, what,

129
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,680
what side of the problem do
you think stems from, from say,

130
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:39,120
other female celebrities or other women
in general? Just kind of dealing with it?

131
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,780
Um,

132
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,290
cause I feel like people wouldn't tell
you to do that if it wasn't the majority

133
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:47,370
of the people who are just kind of
dealing with it. Uh, so to speak.

134
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:49,380
And what problems stem from that?

135
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,750
Well, I guess, um,

136
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,930
I think it was confusing for me was
that like most people were supportive of

137
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,343
what we were saying,

138
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
but there was a definite strain in the
conversation where people were saying

139
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,970
like,
the onus is on,

140
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,150
the onus is on us to accept it and
deal with and things like that.

141
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,600
And that to me is just like a followup
from a victim blaming culture where

142
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:11,280
people are like,
well it's up to you to deal with it.

143
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,430
It's not up to those people
to not behave like that.

144
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,410
It's up to you to suck
up and deal with it.

145
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,130
And I guess the thing that I was
finding, I was like, it's bad.

146
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,100
It's awful if that's happening to you
when you're using the internet in a

147
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:23,940
personal capacity.

148
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:27,750
Cause everyone has the right to use the
internet to seek out knowledge and you

149
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:31,440
know, do nice stuff on the
Internet. But, um, I was like,

150
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:33,570
this is something we're doing
in the course of our employment.

151
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,140
So if I want to be in a band
and have a social network,

152
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,280
then I need to accept that.

153
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,570
And I think that's a queen pretty
confusing way to look at it.

154
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,000
Um,
and also,

155
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:48,450
I suppose probably a lot of people don't
want to talk about that because I think

156
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,910
it paints you in a certain
light or something like that.

157
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,890
But I guess for me it was like these are
things that we think personally anyway

158
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,020
and something you we're coming up against
in your day to day job and then your

159
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:58,854
day to day life.

160
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,510
So I don't really see why you should
have to sacrifice doing things that you

161
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:07,590
would normally do in order to appease
what I hope is a minority of people.

162
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,160
And so, uh, at least in terms
of the Google properties,

163
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:16,000
we can detect and delete comments that
would probably be considered abusive

164
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:16,834
pretty easily.

165
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,010
But at the same time was that obviously
you wouldn't see them then and that

166
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:23,680
would give you some sense of relief.
But is there,

167
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:26,290
do you think it's only going to encourage
the problem if people feel like they

168
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,930
can leave these comments and then they're
actually going to be deleted before

169
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:33,820
they show up? So that you know, kind of
generates anger on, on and, and you know,

170
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,480
mean harboring feelings towards you, you
know, on, on the side of the commenters.

171
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,910
Do you think the leading these comments
would help fix the problem or is it

172
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,380
um, I don't know, like, um,

173
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,530
I thought about it a lot when we were
trying to figure out how to deal with it.

174
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,910
And so it was like,
yes,

175
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:55,180
it does make me feel better if
I don't see any of these things.

176
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,810
But then I was like the option then in
order to not see those things as to not

177
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,870
partake in that part of the job
and not do that. And I guess

178
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,100
the always kind of, uh, gets,

179
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:09,640
gets my back up quite a lot when people
bring up the freedom of speech thing.

180
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,720
I like, well, freedom of hateful
speech is that, is that a load?

181
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,270
And then I think there is a freedom
of speech issue. But I don't,

182
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,790
from my point of view,
it's not the commenters freedom of speech.

183
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,340
It's our freedom of speech to
go about doing what we're doing.

184
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,510
And in order to do that,

185
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:27,130
then your have to exempt someone talking
to you like that. So I don't, um, yeah,

186
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:28,550
whenever people bring up the Yep,

187
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,300
I can see what I want because it's a
free world and I'm on the Internet,

188
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,550
but you should feel free to say what
you want but not be a prick. I don't,

189
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,130
I feel like that should be like me.

190
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,760
You need to write that into like the
European Convention on human rights or

191
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:45,610
something. Freedom of speech brackets. But
not if you're, but um, yeah, I don't know.

192
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,650
I guess you can't, how do you change it?
And I think it's great that, you know,

193
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,300
companies like yourselves are trying to
make a statement on something like that.

194
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,170
But I feel like there's probably quite
a long way to go before it trickles down

195
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:00,820
into actual day to day attitudes.

196
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,870
You talked about some of the,
uh,

197
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,110
like the story you had of experiencing
this in real life as well.

198
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,340
Would you consider kind of these abusive
comments online and evolution of,

199
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,660
of catcalling or you know, other
kind of street harassment? Uh,

200
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:17,670
or is this kind of its own separate thing?

201
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,210
I think it's probably
a volts from the same,

202
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,560
the same beginning point
that the middle senses,

203
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,530
it comes from the same starting point.
I think the same kind of attitude, um,

204
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,610
that if, uh, if a woman
is in a public place,

205
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:34,430
then she's up automatically
opening herself up to these things.

206
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,690
But I guess the distance,
um,

207
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,540
created between people on the
Internet helps people. Maybe.

208
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,920
I've never had anyone see to my face,
you think this is where your culture,

209
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:47,720
you will know this until
I come run and rape you.

210
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,400
But they'd do something Internet.
If someone said that to me in real life,

211
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,970
I'd would be very alarmed and you would
obviously report them to the police.

212
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,150
But if it's on the Internet and then
people are like, oh, it's, you know,

213
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,220
it's just the Internet says harmless,
it's fine. You're like, mm. Hmm. Is it,

214
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,100
um, so either kind of before you
wrote the article or afterwards,

215
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:10,930
did you have any mentors either in
the industry or in your life that had

216
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,800
previous experience with something like
this and we're able to help walk you

217
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,060
through it?
Or is that,

218
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,320
is that something that you think maybe
the music industry or earthy things in

219
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:22,540
general need to have accessible?

220
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,923
MMM,

221
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,920
I guess I didn't really have,
um,

222
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,290
didn't really speak to
anybody about it in that way.

223
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:33,970
I guess there's always people have
admired in terms of musicians and how they

224
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:36,510
conduct themselves professionally
and things like that. But, um,

225
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,850
I guess it would have been good if
Lou was like a kind of how to guide.

226
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,590
I wrote that you could be like,
what was this? Right. I got to Dok,

227
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,780
we'll score it at that page and then, oh,
right, okay. Just ignore it. Okay. Um,

228
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,950
but yeah, I don't know. An atheist,
that's probably why it was, um,

229
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,770
it was so confusing,

230
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:57,340
I suppose because although ever we're
really supportive of each other.

231
00:12:57,341 --> 00:13:00,550
I am the only woman in this band and
they've always been in bands with very

232
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,420
supportive guys, but I've always
been the only female in those bounds.

233
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,780
Although people can empathize with you,

234
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,850
I guess it's not as threatening
because it's not directed at them. Um,

235
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,310
so I dunno,
I guess

236
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,320
I'm not sure like women experience that
on some level at some point in their

237
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:20,291
lives.
Definitely.

238
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,410
So I guess maybe you learned from
the textbook of life or something,

239
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,303
I'm not sure.

240
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,490
Have you found that these problems have
stemmed more from any specific social

241
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,540
networks in general?

242
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,840
Or is it kind of a broad thing
that you've experienced everywhere?

243
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:39,220
Like is it harder to be a prick
and 140 characters on Twitter?

244
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,990
Sometimes they are quite inventive
I suppose, but we generally, um,

245
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,370
we've mostly, I would say the
worst one is Facebook, I think.

246
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,440
Which is strange to me because there's
technically more anonymity on Twitter

247
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,730
because you don't need to use your real
name. If your account gets deleted,

248
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,540
you can make another one
like I many hours later.

249
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,480
Whereas I suppose with Facebook they
want you to use your real name if you do.

250
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know. Um, um, but yeah,
that's definitely where most of the,

251
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,000
the comments were coming in.
And also because we still had other point,

252
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:13,180
the direct message function
on which, um, I think he,

253
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:16,540
that's in another further removal
for those people. So they're like,

254
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,840
we're contacting you on the Internet and
it can't be seen by other people so I

255
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:22,270
can see it directly to you.
Whatever I wish to see.

256
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,990
Obviously we figured out how to turn that
off now, so that's much better. But um,

257
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,350
yeah, even now if you post like I think
a reshared an article that was um,

258
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,150
on Ma make website and it was
about an advert in sound on sound.

259
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,100
There was advertising
microphones and it was like, um,

260
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,370
a naked woman like from the side with her.

261
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,580
Like you could see her ass and
stuff in it. And I have two meals.

262
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:48,100
Like that's not what's that got to
do with advertising microphones.

263
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,580
But it was a really interesting article
that the guy who used to run drone,

264
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:56,810
his own drop and then underneath it
people would just like shut up and go back

265
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:59,030
to doing what you're supposed to be doing.
Like I don't want to read this.

266
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,800
I want to come here and listen to music.
I don't want,

267
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,840
why are you talking about this shit?
It's not relevant.

268
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,450
And I was like that articles about music,
I think that is relevant.

269
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,540
But just like seeing all kind of unfold
again. You're like, oh there they go.

270
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,760
That's fine.
But it's great.

271
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,700
I guess the good thing for us now is
that if people know where we stand on it,

272
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,500
they kind of self police
a little bit more.

273
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,570
So rather than us having
to go on and be like,

274
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,660
look at user won't year and goes through,
um,

275
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,990
people can have a more of a discussion
about it. So I guess that's positive,

276
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,950
but I don't really know how much
that actually changes people's minds.

277
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:27,784
I buy things.

278
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,760
So do you, do you ever respond
directly to these comments?

279
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,650
Maybe in the beginning when you were,

280
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:38,040
when you first started receiving them
or you generally just try to steer clear

281
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,900
basically any advice you'd have for, for
people who receive these sort of things?

282
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,040
I think it's a difficult line to tread
because my instinct tells me that every

283
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,510
time somebody says it,

284
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:53,511
then if you were threatened and you need
to go in on the offensive and just call

285
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,830
people out on it,
but I suppose

286
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,680
I've got quite a busy day and most days
and they don't have a huge amount of

287
00:16:01,681 --> 00:16:03,870
time to troll through and be
like, oh great, that's happened.

288
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:07,770
Most upon them would be like, what would
your mother say? Things like that. But um,

289
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,160
yeah, I don't know. I guess it's just
trying to gauge it on a day to day basis.

290
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,450
I think it was before we
made any comment on it,

291
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:19,260
it was taking quite a bit of a personal
tool to constantly be the person that

292
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:22,800
has to be like, no, stop it. No, stop it.
Or just, there's a little got to finals.

293
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:26,130
I'm just going to delete the, delete
the comments and ban, ban the users.

294
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:29,550
But can't ban people from life.
So that's a problem.

295
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,590
That sounds really like area and then
like get them on, put them in a bin.

296
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:34,424
But I don't mean that

297
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,120
in the article you tread pretty lightly
around the word feminist. You, uh,

298
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,910
kind of treated as if maybe you know,

299
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:47,690
there some connotations that you don't
want to associate with yourself. Um,

300
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:51,290
you make comment that you don't hate
men in general, that you're speaking,

301
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,110
you know, feminism in terms
of equality for the sexes. Um,

302
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,650
do you think that the term in general
has kind of become unfriendly and

303
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,270
um, well I think the star of the sentence
sentences. I am a feminist because I am,

304
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,780
and I feel like all the cabinets I put
in after that word to counter what people

305
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:12,080
say to you when you see that, they're
like, oh, so you hate men then, oh, well,

306
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,790
all these other things. And
you're like, no, I don't know.

307
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:17,180
It's just a stereotype that has been
made to discredit what people are saying

308
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,800
about it, I think. Um,

309
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,790
so I have no problem identifying is
that because to me it means somebody who

310
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:27,770
seeks equality between all people. It's
not about making women better than men.

311
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:31,370
It's not about, um, you know, like
Oh, white middle class woman's agenda.

312
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:35,990
It shouldn't be about that issue to be
about generally society being a bit less

313
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:38,360
shit sometimes I think.
Um,

314
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,740
and I think there's lots of great examples
of people who are making something

315
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:45,020
like that more accessible to
people because I guess for me,

316
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,790
I learned about it through,

317
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,480
through music and then I kind of figured
out what those people were reading and

318
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:56,481
who they were influenced by and that's
how I got into like feminist literature

319
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:57,360
and stuff.

320
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,100
But if you can feel really the kind of
like academic and strange in that regard.

321
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:03,840
So I think the Internet has
been really helpful for that.

322
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,100
Like things like feminist thing and
jazzy bell and stuff, making it more,

323
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,040
um, not even necessarily pop culture
based, but just more conversation,

324
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:13,820
conversational.

325
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,350
And I'm like hopefully more representative
of more people because it's about

326
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:21,590
your everyday issues.
So it shouldn't just be like in a book,

327
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:22,424
in a library somewhere.

328
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,350
Okay.

329
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,350
And the,
uh,

330
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,500
kind of what prompted me to reach out
to you guys in the first place was a,

331
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,290
an article I read in the January
issue of Pacific Standard. Uh,

332
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,910
it's about a writer,

333
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:39,190
Amanda Hess who kind of covers
her experiences with these, uh,

334
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,610
sort of comments. Um, she kind
of talks about how she, you know,

335
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:47,780
she receives these comments where people
are threatening to come to her house,

336
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,240
uh, which you know of happened
in a real life experience.

337
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:52,780
If you went to the police with
that, they would, uh, you know,

338
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,070
get a restraining order that
it take some sort of action.

339
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,370
But because she received these
comments, uh, on the Internet,

340
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:02,780
the police kind of brushed it off. Um,
they, I acted as if it wasn't important.

341
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:05,870
They told her to get back in touch with
them. If someone actually shows up,

342
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,220
which seems like there's a lot of room
for something bad to happen there.

343
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,170
Do you think as we, as we transitioned
to more digital interactions that we,

344
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,310
that we risk kind of losing some of the
standards and etiquette that we've kind

345
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:22,160
of built up over the years and that,
you know,

346
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,270
some of the safety might disappear
as these things go online.

347
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,650
I Dunno.
I guess the,

348
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:33,070
as the technology develops
in society changes,

349
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,240
then laws need to adapt to cater for that.
Um,

350
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,080
bicycles right now is a pretty big
gray area because if they're like,

351
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:45,310
they're like,
no physical threat has happened upon you,

352
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,470
then what can the police
really do about it?

353
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:50,950
But then I just think it adds to the
people feeling more alone and more

354
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:54,610
vulnerable and more
isolated. Um, and I suppose

355
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,400
the thing with, with that is
even if like, I guess Amanda has,

356
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:01,930
you can find her own lane.
She's pretty well known,

357
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,840
but even if it was like a
conventional stalking thing,

358
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,690
the victim still doesn't have,
I think that's what she says in the piece.

359
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:11,110
Like the victim doesn't have the anonymity
of the person that's abusing them.

360
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,170
Like, because they are the known person,
whether they're a well known person. No,

361
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:16,510
we're just,
you know,

362
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,110
you don't have to be a journalist or
in a band or whatever to encounter that

363
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:23,920
kind of stuff.
So I guess something,

364
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,230
something needs to be done to
figure out what to do about that.

365
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:29,320
But who knows what it is.
I don't know.

366
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,280
We'll try to figure that out.

367
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,120
Yeah, please. You guys are in charge
of the Internet and so go fix.

368
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,420
I like to open the questions
up to the audience. Uh,

369
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,000
there's a microphone back there.

370
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,800
Hello. Hi. Um, I feel like we spent
a lot about policing and things,

371
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:54,400
but even with police, bad things
still happen, right? Um, you know,

372
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:57,070
bullying in playgrounds, for example,
if it's physical abuse, right?

373
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,710
And we can police it as much as we can,
but the police don't stop.

374
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,450
I'm under the assumption that,
you know, not an assumption,

375
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:07,960
but this is emotional abuse, right?
You being emotionally abused. Um,

376
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,980
this sort of parallel would be a
bodyguard or our physical body guard is a

377
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,330
celebrity.
As a wellness person,

378
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:16,920
you have a body guard who protects you as
you move around the physical world. Um,

379
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,470
do you think an emotional
body card fee on the Internet,

380
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,660
is there reasonable response?

381
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,163
MMM,

382
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,020
I think that if they existed that would be
nice. But it's pretty abstract. But, um,

383
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,720
I don't know.
I guess that's the gain of that.

384
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,030
You have to kind of do that job yourself.

385
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,300
And I think it's like
separating the personal anguish
sounds really pathetic but

386
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:46,640
anguish, uh, from, um, from the
profession professional side.

387
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,870
Um, so we'll try not to make a knee jerk
emotional response to something and then

388
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:55,250
just do the kind of, okay. Block
user, like go through that process.

389
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,410
But um,
yeah,

390
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,170
I suppose it's more difficult to deal
with it cause it's not like a tangible

391
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,550
physical thing.
You,

392
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,890
there's no way of going of like just
putting somebody bigger in the middle

393
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,600
because there really isn't that.

394
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,480
Hmm. Okay. Thank you.

395
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,550
That was a hard question.
I wasn't prepared for that.

396
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,870
Hi. So I just want to maybe
switch gears a little bit,

397
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:19,290
but I had a question for you guys.
You mentioned at the beginning, um,

398
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,400
how your band started,

399
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,810
like sorta started off with the music
blogs and social media kind of spreading

400
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,240
your name and even your,
the way you spell it,

401
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:30,200
you did it specifically so that you
can, you know, kind of stand out on,

402
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,380
on the Internet.
Um,

403
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:36,150
how do you sort of see the music
industry and vans that you see coming up,

404
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,100
you know, that are just
starting out, you know,

405
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:43,101
utilizing these blogs and social media
and the Internet more so now maybe in the

406
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,860
past. And do you see that sort
of increasing, you know, given,

407
00:22:46,861 --> 00:22:50,460
given the rise of how many people are
kind of plugged in in the digital age

408
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,571
nowadays,

409
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:56,250
but is that something that you guys kind
of support and promote or is it more so

410
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,200
kind of band by band and,
and however they, you know,

411
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,080
want to want to spread their name?

412
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,340
Um,
I think for me,

413
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:07,150
I guess as a case by case basis and w
the blueprint in the works for one person

414
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,640
won't work for somebody else.
Um,

415
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,780
and I think certainly for me when I
remember being in bands like pre, pre,

416
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:17,680
I'm having a nice space that was quite
interesting when you didn't have to like

417
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:20,210
put your posters on my space
when in light with that. Um,

418
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,300
and I guess you just promoted it in
different ways. Um, bicycles, no,

419
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:28,060
it's kind of unorthodox if a band doesn't
have a Facebook page and things like

420
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:31,600
that and you think those things are
differently important tools for us to

421
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:32,411
communicate with people.

422
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,580
But I've always been the person in the
band that runs social networks for bands

423
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,450
when I've been in them and I try just
as hard at the social networks from my

424
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:42,780
other bands, but they didn't, uh,

425
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,010
I guess they didn't connect
with people in that same.

426
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,070
So I like to believe it's about the
content as well as the way that we pitched

427
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:52,760
it. But I think, um, generally speaking,

428
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:57,761
the music industry is probably having
to adapt a lot to incorporate all these

429
00:23:57,951 --> 00:23:58,731
new technologies.

430
00:23:58,731 --> 00:24:01,750
And I think for a long time people
were just drawn to stand like the,

431
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:03,650
like a little dot boy with
his finger in the dam being,

432
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,090
I don't know if that meant for it
makes sense here, but um, yeah.

433
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:11,660
And then just kind of saying no to the
progress because it was changing the way

434
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:15,560
the industry worked. But I feel
like you can't stop that process.

435
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:16,341
It's just going to happen.

436
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:20,780
So the way that labels and things
operate and the way that I even radio and

437
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:24,410
things like that we'll have to
change because you can't stop,

438
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:27,080
cannot be internet and her,
it's too late. So, um, you know,

439
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:30,500
there's a lot of good things have come
out with that. Like without the Internet,

440
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:34,670
we wouldn't have been able to cover as
much ground as quickly as we have and it

441
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:35,504
makes it,

442
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,400
I think it makes it a lot more democratic
in some ways because if you have a

443
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:41,390
certain amount of technology,

444
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:44,330
you can make things at home
in your bedroom and share
them online and you don't

445
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:48,380
necessarily have to go through that filter
of in getting the guy in the suit to

446
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:52,150
listen to it and sign off on it before
you can release it because you can sell

447
00:24:52,151 --> 00:24:54,470
for at least on the Internet.
And that's pretty powerful.

448
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,050
Okay,
thanks.

449
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,310
These are hard. I don't, I looked at
the sheet earlier and I was like, man,

450
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,430
it's fine. Coming from
left field, I don't know.

451
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,820
I have a few questions from some of
the people streaming this as well.

452
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,120
What are the most effective actions
you've seen men take to combat misogyny on

453
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:15,954
mine?

454
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,260
Um, I think that's an
interesting one because, um,

455
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,260
when men speak to other men about it,

456
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,340
I think sometimes I've seen that be a
lot more effective because when I talk

457
00:25:27,341 --> 00:25:28,390
about it, people could be like, oh,

458
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:30,790
well she's saying that because she's a
woman or because she's a feminist and

459
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:34,180
blah, blah, blah, and it's personal to
her. And I don't agree with that argument,

460
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:38,530
but it's easier to discredit me that way
than it is to a man who's saying that

461
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:42,040
to you. And I think for me, like, um,

462
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,000
I've gone to meetings with like feminist
groups in Glasgow and then be like, hmm.

463
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,080
Not For me because one of
the conversations was it
was like a feminist book

464
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,960
group at University in one
of the conversations was
whether we could read books

465
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:56,440
that were written about feminism by men.
And to me, I was like, that's a complete,

466
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,371
it's completely backwards.

467
00:25:57,371 --> 00:26:00,040
I don't want to sit here and be a part
of that conversation because it's not a

468
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:03,310
conversation to be had in a room full of
people who already agree it should be a

469
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,340
conversation that
everyone's having. So, yeah,

470
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,970
I think if everybody can be involved
in trying to make society a tiny,

471
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:12,370
tiny bit less rubbish sometimes,
then that would be good.

472
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,740
This from Eric,

473
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,940
would you use something like a spam filter
that automatically labeled aggressive

474
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,950
emails and a more generally,

475
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:26,510
what do you think about the role of
technology and reducing online massage ne.

476
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,450
Okay.

477
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,283
Um,

478
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,800
I guess spam filter is probably useful
in Sofar as then you wouldn't see as much

479
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:40,360
of it, but it doesn't necessarily deal
with the root problem because then it's,

480
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:43,560
I guess it's a way of you dealing
with it rather than going to where it

481
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:47,730
originated and trying to stop it
happening in the first place. Um,

482
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,580
I guess all right.
I Dunno.

483
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,740
Like I think for me technology is
really has been really useful because we

484
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:58,980
traveled so much and it enables me to
keep in touch with people and work on the

485
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:03,450
move. And in the same way it does for
everybody, you can, you know, just simple,

486
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,710
tiny things that make the day
easier and better. And, um,

487
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,850
I think that's a really powerful thing
and I don't want to send to make it sound

488
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:15,780
like I'm poopooing the internet or
anything cause I'm definitely not. But um,

489
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,280
yeah I think, I guess I don't
know about technology necessarily,

490
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:21,480
but kind what we were talking about,

491
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,700
the Internet has definitely opened up a
conversation about feminism and misogyny.

492
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,780
Yes. It's probably spiked it
a little bit as well, but um,

493
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,130
if people are talking
about it in the same forum,

494
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,180
then that's probably a good thing.

495
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,260
I feel like you should grade all my
answers or something. I don't know.

496
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,870
Uh, we have a music one as well. Uh,

497
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,980
where do you stand on subscription
music services given that many prominent

498
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:47,750
artists have spoken out against them,

499
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,200
what do you think we could do to
improve relations with music creators?

500
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,320
I guess that's a pretty, that's
a pretty controversial topic. Um,

501
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,070
and I think that every
artist is completely entitled
to have an opinion on it.

502
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,400
I guess for us it's more difficult to be
very strident about that stuff because

503
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,900
without streaming
services on the Internet,

504
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:13,800
probably people wouldn't have heard as
much about our band. Um, and there was a,

505
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:17,540
a gas the other day where the songs came
off Spotify in Mexico and people got

506
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:21,350
very upset and I'm like, Ooh, sorry,
I go back and fix it. But, um,

507
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,430
I suppose that that's weird
in a way because then you're
like, oh, well you don't,

508
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,280
she don't have my help them,
you can't just and listen to it.

509
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,970
But then I guess it's just a
product of the time to an extent.

510
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,900
Like I didn't grow up in an era where
music streaming was at prominent.

511
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:40,970
I remember like getting like one one,
I think I did,

512
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,870
I've only ever illegally downloaded one
thing and it was worn during the same

513
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:48,290
period. We'd have to leave the
computer on for like three days. Um,

514
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,930
and I remember having to debate to debate
with my mom when we were turning the

515
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:53,940
computer off and I was like, it's
almost there. It's almost there. Um,

516
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,990
and it was just because I couldn't
physically get the song. It was like,

517
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,640
I think it was like a letters to cleo
cover of cheap trick or something that was

518
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:05,840
in a film and I really wanted it but
couldn't get it. Um, so I guess I don't,

519
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,220
can't relate huge amount to
music streaming in that sense,

520
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:13,880
but I guess it's about
making,

521
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,320
making all that stuff fair on the artist
because somebody somewhere is making

522
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:19,250
money out of those things,

523
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:22,070
but it's definitely not the people
who make the content that's on it.

524
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,200
So I guess if there was a
way of making those streams,

525
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,510
I dunno, somehow feeding the, the
gain back to the people who've paid,

526
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,830
paid in time and money to make
that cause I guess, you know,

527
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:40,280
at the end of the day someone is trying
to make a living off doing that. Um,

528
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,960
I don't know. I don't know how to, how
to fix it. I don't know what to do.

529
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,480
Audience Question.

530
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,290
Um, so I have a question about what you
see the role of the rest of the online

531
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:54,320
community is in kind
of combating misogyny.

532
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:58,250
Because I know sometimes people say
if you comment defending someone,

533
00:29:58,251 --> 00:29:59,570
that brings more attention to it.

534
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,580
Do you think that there's a role that
everyone on the Internet can play and sort

535
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:05,750
of, you know, defending women,

536
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:08,270
defending people in general
against these kind of comments?

537
00:30:08,271 --> 00:30:11,660
Do you think that brings more
attention to it in a positive way?

538
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:15,800
Or do you think that hurts the cause by
cycling back the focus to those negative

539
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:16,634
comments?

540
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,120
Okay.

541
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,450
I Dunno,
I guess maybe I'm an antagonistic person,

542
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:25,570
but for me it was like the,
the ignoring thing.

543
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:27,590
Like when you were a kid and your
mom was life, so that's really,

544
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:29,710
and you just ignore them. Um, it doesn't,

545
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:35,350
I guess I don't think that that theory
works here because if you ignore it,

546
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,940
then people aren't going to be like,
oh,

547
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:38,890
they're ignoring me because I've
done something really offensive.

548
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,980
They're going to think that you're
ignoring them in a kind of, oh, well,

549
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:46,930
fair enough, kind of
way. Um, and I think if,

550
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,930
yeah,
if people can be respectful of each other,

551
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,290
obviously I'm not saying that you should
go in and we a horrible like awful

552
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,540
person in return because then
that's just an eye for an eye.

553
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:59,770
But I think if people can call each
other right on those things, then that's,

554
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,270
that's what useful. Um, and
also even in the last like year,

555
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,170
18 months or whatever,

556
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:09,670
I've noticed loads more stuff about
feminism and mainstream media and that,

557
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:10,870
I dunno,

558
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,410
is that a trend of what people are writing
about or are the just more willing to

559
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:18,190
talk about it and more people are thinking
about it? I'm not sure. I hope so,

560
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,400
but um, yeah, hopefully it
won't like disappear again,

561
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,360
like it kind of feminism is the new
black and then it's gone. Thank you.

562
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,273
Hi.

563
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:31,770
Um,

564
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,770
you mentioned that you like feministing
and jazz bowel and I see them sort of as

565
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,830
a more palatable or
relatable form of feminism,

566
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:44,730
especially for like our generation,
which I think is changing a lot.

567
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,530
What about them do you really like and
how do you think people can sort of pull

568
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:53,040
elements of that and to the own their
own content that they're creating online?

569
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,340
That's an interesting
question. I think, um,

570
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,140
for me people like Jessica Valenti are
really important voices because she's

571
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:03,160
obviously very intelligent,

572
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:07,300
hadn't has studied the academic side of
all this so she knows she knows all the

573
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:11,080
theories and she knows all the kind of
the texts that you should check out.

574
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:14,230
But I think the fact that she's taking
that and putting it in a real life

575
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:15,150
situation and the,

576
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,610
the tone in which you rates and is
really relatable and she's talking about

577
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:22,900
things that we've all experienced
and I think feminist thing's really

578
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,540
interesting because they talk
about high court rulings on things,

579
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:30,541
but then they also talk like have opinion
pieces on things like things that are

580
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:35,620
happening in pop culture or things
are being talked about in the news.

581
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,350
And I think just kind of having that
kind of dialogue is really helpful and it

582
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:40,960
feels like a nice,
quite,

583
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,420
quite a useful community
rather than somebody telling
you things and being like,

584
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:49,170
you think this bid kind of raise questions
and accept comment in return. Um,

585
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,820
and I think that's just makes it
makes you think about stuff. Um,

586
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,970
and I think what, certainly when
I was growing up, I didn't really,

587
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,010
didn't really have a huge
number of friends that would
be interested in the same

588
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:02,420
kind of things.
Um,

589
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:07,450
and I think only within the last few
years really of a fund as many like minded

590
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:09,110
women.
Um,

591
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,910
we kind of make the joke that I started
like a women's collective in Glasgow to

592
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:17,440
make more friends, to make more
friends who agreed with me. Um,

593
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,340
but I think that has been very important
because it's just a thing we have where

594
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:25,390
we run live events and have a radio
show and podcast and things. Um,

595
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,910
just focusing on women arts
and music and things like that.

596
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,410
And for me that feels like a positive
thing to do because otherwise I feel like

597
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,240
I'm constantly thinking
about the negative things,

598
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,380
the things that are the horrible things
are happening and constantly happen on

599
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:43,310
all levels by can I want to try and
change the dialogue in my mind and make it

600
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:47,540
something more positive and having
people to talk to her about those pretty

601
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,660
helpful. So you don't feel like you're
the only one and you're like, Oh God,

602
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,680
is that, it's not fine. Am I overreacting?
Nope. Nope, it's fine. So yeah,

603
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,120
community is key.

604
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,010
Do we have any more audience questions?

605
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,770
Hello? Um, so, uh, I remember a while ago,

606
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:15,300
like a comedian once said that
there's a strong power and comedy and

607
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:15,901
communication,

608
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:19,200
especially when it comes to tough topics
and need something along the lines of

609
00:34:19,201 --> 00:34:22,650
like, if I make you laugh, then maybe
you won't be as threatened or defensive.

610
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,930
So sometimes I think of
that with music as well.

611
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,080
So I wondered if you'd ever
address these kinds of topics,

612
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,640
topics and your music or maybe you
already have with your lyrics are a bit

613
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:36,960
cryptic. So sorry. Um, I guess

614
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,480
for like, when, I guess when we write
music for me, like I just write about,

615
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,390
it's like I can have personal perspective,

616
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:48,750
whether that's on personal events that
happened to you or a personal perspective

617
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:52,080
on something that's happening externally.
Um,

618
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,790
but I suppose the lyrics
are pretty cryptic,

619
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:58,590
so you probably can't tell
from any of that. Um, but yeah,

620
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:00,810
I guess the personal is
political to an extent.

621
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,230
So the political is personal
and vice versa. So, um,

622
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,650
there's probably elements of that and
the stuff that we're writing about by,

623
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:10,860
I don't think there's necessarily any
anthem's in the same way there is on like

624
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,180
a Latigo record or something.

625
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,460
All right. Uh, well thank you for
coming today. Thank you for having us.

626
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,660
[inaudible]

627
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,330
we're back. Um, and this time
you guys get to actually speak,

628
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,960
so that's nice. Yeah. He had never
gets, we don't let him speak.

629
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:49,380
No. Yes, we are a bank. Old Churches.

630
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,820
[inaudible]

631
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,200
[inaudible]

632
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,380
[inaudible]

633
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,980
[inaudible]

634
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,833
no.

635
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh,
we can just

636
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,680
choose any

637
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:28,370
open
give you

638
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,270
say we can change,

639
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,410
we can change.
Oh

640
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,663
no

641
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,580
thanks guys.

642
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,060
We are going to play a couple more songs.
Um,

643
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,170
I feel I'm not directly due to pelvic
stuff, public speaking, to be honest.

644
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:20,940
It makes me quite worried.
Uh,

645
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,560
so if there's a more of a Bronto and
the voice than isn't this debate,

646
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,920
it's just left over from that.
Me,

647
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:31,740
I'm just looking for someone that
will let me go on one of your slides.

648
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,333
Yeah.

649
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,620
If there's anyone in this room in this,

650
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,640
if there's what have you that I expected
so surely someone can make it happen

651
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:41,474
for me.

652
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,543
Yeah.

653
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,670
Come all the way here from
Scotland in the name of feminism.

654
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:46,600
Let them on the slide.

655
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,123
Okay.

656
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:18,360
You better and from me seeing you

657
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:27,110
gonna come for you all that I have

658
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,050
a break here. Tiny, tiny.

659
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,130
I never believe,
but I see

660
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,500
uploading your lesson,
uploading your lesson,

661
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,373
sleep.

662
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,890
There is no other way

663
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,850
to get good swing at me.

664
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,940
So full flow.

665
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,770
I tried water.
Are

666
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,520
you stuck in
my back?

667
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:59,560
Did you
sleep to see

668
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,870
I was not a park and swines

669
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,340
there is no other way.
Say Good,

670
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,150
good swing at me.

671
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,950
So finally we agree.
We're promise

672
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:27,490
butter
Burger Britain.

673
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,180
It is, you know,

674
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,000
it's also easy.

675
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,200
There is no other way.

676
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,700
Take a swing at me.

677
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,290
So finally we were promised,

678
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:32,703
well

679
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,163
thanks guys.

680
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,550
We are going to go, we're going to play
one more song and then we're going to go.

681
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,150
Um, I need to rehydrate cause I was
white. It was a lot Joe's experience,

682
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:31,470
but it's okay. It's not your
fault, it's just psychology.

683
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,320
But thank you again for having us.

684
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,080
Thanks for letting people
look us up on you on you.

685
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,580
It's been very helpful to us.
Um,

686
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,150
one thing is he's running,
he's running.

687
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,250
Yeah.
But yeah,

688
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,480
thank you for having us and for letting
us come and chat about stuff like that

689
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:55,314
because um,

690
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,580
I think it's really awesome of you guys
to do that and make it be less of a

691
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,620
marginalized thing and thanks

692
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,990
[inaudible]

693
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:16,763
never,

694
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,850
I keep my lips shut.

695
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,130
I'm the only one.

696
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,760
I would always be free.

697
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,123
Easy.

698
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:57,280
We're the only ones.
I bet you, even though

699
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,200
you put your head,
it's a service.

700
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,510
Can see

701
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:24,863
liver,

702
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:41,340
liver.
