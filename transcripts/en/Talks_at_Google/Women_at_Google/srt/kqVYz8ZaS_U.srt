1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,640
By welcoming a very
special guest here today.

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,570
[inaudible] editor in chief
of the national, um, Mina,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,110
you've been a political journalist
for a very, very, very long time.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,760
How did it all begin and what was the
genesis of your career, if you will?

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,331
Right.
So first of all,

6
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:28,320
thank you so much for being here and thank
you Joyce for not only hosting me but

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,770
Google has been really kind to the
national since we relaunched last July.

8
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:36,120
So it's very nice to continue our
relationship. Um, you know, I'm,

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,690
I'm your rocky British and I think for
many people who are from countries,

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,700
um, the either suffer war
dictatorship or whatever,

11
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:47,700
it really dominates your
life in different ways. Um,

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,960
unfortunately I count myself as lucky
because we left when I was a child.

13
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:53,160
We left Iraq when I was a child,

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,290
but still politics kind of has
shaped who I am and where I came to.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,390
And in a way, I think that's
what determined my getting
involved in journalism.

16
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:07,230
I want things to understand more, but
also cast a light on certain issues. Um,

17
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:11,340
so really I think it has to do with the
fact that I'm Iraq key and I also love

18
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,040
storytelling.
So combining the two together.

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,770
So political journalism,

20
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:20,160
I don't think there was ever a
time when it was easy or risky.

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,690
Would you say that being a political
journalist today comes with an even higher

22
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:28,890
set of risks and challenges then in the
past or was there never an easy time?

23
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,430
I don't think there's ever an easy time,
but again,

24
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:36,660
I think if we're talking about the Middle
East and North Africa at the moment,

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,020
unfortunately half the time that people
are thinking you're a journalist,

26
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:44,130
you have to be a war correspondent
and that's, that's really difficult.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,160
I remember the first journalism story I
ever wrote in political Jerusalem was in

28
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:54,981
2002 and it was the 1 million person march
in London against the upcoming war in

29
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,290
Iraq.
And I remember at the time thinking,

30
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,950
I really should be going to Iraq to
cover this, but I'll be really frank.

31
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:02,731
My parents were like,

32
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:05,550
there is no way on earth you're
getting to Iraq and you know,

33
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:09,840
you're staying here and you're safer
here. And so forth. And to be fair,

34
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,740
I remember thinking,

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,280
I'm a less lesser journalist for not
being out there on the front line.

36
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,910
And I had a great mentor who's still a
friend and who actually now writes for

37
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:20,460
the, for the national, which I'm
really proud of, but he was, you know,

38
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,830
this big John List and I hadn't worked
with him. And he said to me, me now,

39
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,670
not every journalist has to be a war
correspondent and war correspondents do

40
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:31,090
incredible work and credible stories, but
you can still do, you know, the other, um,

41
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,160
types of stories. And I said, well,

42
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:35,490
what I really am interested in is the
policy side and the thematic side.

43
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,050
And sometimes,
fortunately,

44
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:40,700
especially with what we're seeing at
the moment with UN failures and, um,

45
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,290
other problems with the
international community,

46
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,800
you still want to write about those and
explain those and also have the contacts

47
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:50,820
and the sourcing and piecing together
a story. So that's the field I went to.

48
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,330
And you know,

49
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,630
I studied history at university partly
because I wanted to know how did we get

50
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:58,410
here in order to frame anything that
I'm going to bring writing about. Um,

51
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,800
and so, so that's the
difficulty of one. If you're,

52
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,810
if you're a war correspondent,

53
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,260
I think the dangers are so much
more today than they were 15, 20,

54
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:12,160
30 years ago. It's incredible. And I
think that journalism is poorer for it,

55
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,120
especially as we're trying to understand
what's happening in different conflict

56
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,970
zones around the world. And
that suddenly, you know,

57
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,390
having a flak jacket that says press,
you're almost a target.

58
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,280
Whereas before that would be your safety.
So I think that's one concern. Um,

59
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,160
but the local journalists of course
also carry different types of risks.

60
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:30,994
So you know,

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,360
where do you cross the line that can
get you the only in trouble who can get

62
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,850
your organization in trouble and so
forth. And of course now, you know,

63
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,390
it's funny because before sensors,
if you're working in a,

64
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,300
in a newspaper and it just have to skim
the newspaper and things could pass.

65
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,350
Whereas now,
you know,

66
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:48,310
with one keyword alert search can
unravel a whole host of things.

67
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,570
So it's changed for sure.

68
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,370
And do you feel that being a political
journalist in the Middle East and also

69
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:57,340
being a woman poses an
extra set of challenges?

70
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,430
I think every job has its own challenges.

71
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:05,440
And I think in journalism you
have different challenges,

72
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,980
especially as we see disruption that's
happening in the media industry and

73
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,230
trying to figure out how
do you get the right story,

74
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:15,190
the pressure now to get a story out even
if you haven't double sourced or triple

75
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:18,490
sourced for confirmation.
Being a woman, yes,

76
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,950
of course has its own sets of challenges.
And I also think,

77
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,370
especially in the Middle East,
um,

78
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,850
there's certain conceptions
about women in media.

79
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,490
And I remember when I first said
I wanted to go into journalism,

80
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,290
my mother was quite this approving, um,
and not because of me, but she said,

81
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:35,471
you know,

82
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,380
you'll find so many challenges and how
you'll be perceived as a woman and so

83
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:42,870
forth. Um, she quickly changed her mind,
which was good. And my father taught me,

84
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,290
they were really encouraging,

85
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,830
but they were concerned because they
felt that in our societies there's a

86
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:52,510
certain element of prejudice against
women and in the media sector,

87
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:53,410
I think that's changed.

88
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,410
I do think opening up of everything
from the variety of outlets we now have,

89
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,740
television has changed,
but it's a bit of that perception remains.

90
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,020
And do you feel there's
a good representation?

91
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,420
And we did journalism today of women.

92
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm very proud of the national there is.
Um, but I think across the board, no,

93
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,580
and we still, we still
face, uh, challenges.

94
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,180
I think there are still issues
primarily to do with, um,

95
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,180
gender gaps in pay for sure. That, I think
that's one of the biggest challenges.

96
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,200
And,
um,

97
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,380
compensation is really important because
that's got to do with confidence,

98
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:29,530
has got to do with how you feel that
you're being valued as journalists

99
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,500
irregular, you know, regardless
of your gender or your sex.

100
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,400
So it's still a huge issue and across
the board, across the world. Okay.

101
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,360
So if we were to dig in a
bit more into your career,

102
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:44,680
what was the hardest interview
you've ever had to do and why?

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,360
So I was thinking about this,
cause you said to me,

104
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,040
you might ask about the hardest interview.

105
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,130
So I was really thinking about this
and there are so many different ones.

106
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:56,170
One that was really difficult for me,

107
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,350
but then I was really proud of was
interviewing the daughters of the lady who

108
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:03,680
was killed in the suit square,

109
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:08,390
that famous black water incident
in Baghdad when you had,

110
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,740
um,
suddenly these young girls were orphans.

111
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,850
Their father had died previously.

112
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:18,050
Their mother had worked as a driver to
try to get some sort of income to come in

113
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:22,220
and she was shot with several
other civilians by black water.

114
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,730
And so I went to interview them in Jordan.

115
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,240
It was really difficult because
there's three, it had to be told,

116
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,650
but they were so emotional.

117
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:31,100
And I was also getting emotional and I
was trying not to because I felt like,

118
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,310
but they also wanted to show
them empathy and I felt it.

119
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,980
It was really difficult to,
to interview them and took a long time.

120
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,370
And I went to visit them several times
before I could even write something or

121
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:40,971
have them open up.

122
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:43,820
And it's always difficult with these
human interest stories because you want to

123
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:48,260
tell their story, but you all, we also
don't want to pry. And there's a sense of,

124
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:51,110
you know what, right? Do I have a complete
stranger? They've just met to say,

125
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,220
how'd you feel about your mother? How do
you feel about what's happening in rock?

126
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,880
Where is your future going? So that, that,

127
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:59,330
for me it was emotionally
really difficult. And then
there are difficult people,

128
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,540
like the officials that you
end up having to intervene.

129
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,260
They're not really interested
in giving an interview.

130
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:04,760
So it's like you ask them a question,

131
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,560
they'll give you a one word answer and
you're like, why am I doing this? Um,

132
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,560
but they're, you know, they're part
of the job, but the one, the one that,

133
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,620
the ones that are difficult or
emotional ones actually for me.

134
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,910
And if you were to do
one more interview again,

135
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,610
was it that was a person you've
interviewed, who would it be

136
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,380
with somebody I've already interviewed,

137
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,380
flustered Nodi Maliki,
former prime minister of Iraq.

138
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,710
I answered him when he was prime minister
and I do quite tempted to interview

139
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:34,070
him again and see where we were. Um, I
think that would be quite interesting.

140
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,180
Great.
Okay.

141
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,890
Um,

142
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,890
so there are Gallup polls in the u s
that show a significant drop in trust in

143
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:46,450
mass media in America,
but um,

144
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,960
many, many would argue that this
does not apply in the Middle East.

145
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:53,900
And a lot of research shows that trust
in mass media is still very high.

146
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,960
What would you say about that?
What are your thoughts on it?

147
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,200
Is there a continuous trust in mass
media and are part of the world?

148
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,530
I think there is more trust because the
alternatives in especially the Arabic

149
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:13,000
language had been so weak
and are so untrustworthy.

150
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:17,950
So I think that's why actually more legacy
media, traditional media, mass media,

151
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,300
um, trust is there because
the alternatives and when
we've seen that mount of

152
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,550
really, um, shoddy fake news,

153
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480
like it's so obvious that this is fake,

154
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,720
that people don't catch onto it in the
same way that you've had in other places

155
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:34,270
that more sophisticated.
I also think there's,

156
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,920
there's more trust because in some way
we almost know the biases of different or

157
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,960
editorial lines of
different organizations.

158
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:42,520
So people know that when
they're coming to it,

159
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,790
kind of what they're receiving and then
they make their judgment call. Whereas,

160
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,270
especially in the U S I find it
fascinating when I speak with American

161
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,040
journalists,
there's this thing of you know,

162
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,740
where objective and I
genuinely don't believe that.

163
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,060
I think everything is subjective.
The headline, we choose a subjective,

164
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,810
the photo we choose to be on the front
page or the top of your homepage is

165
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,420
subjective. Everything's subjective.
Whereas in the u s for the longest time,

166
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,320
it was always,
no,

167
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:08,130
everything is objective and it's a
level playing field and it's not,

168
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,260
and it doesn't necessarily have to mean
that you have a bias with ill intent,

169
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,560
but I think you do have biases
based on your knowledge,

170
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,930
on your personal experience,
on who's actually in the newsroom,

171
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:16,764
who's making the shot.

172
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,130
And so I think in the u s there's less
trust now because people bought into this

173
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,710
idea that everything's objective
and suddenly they're like, oh no,

174
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,160
it's actually not. And
it's hard to be. Um,

175
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,020
so I mean,
now you are British Iraqi,

176
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,940
you grew up in Sweden and you
lived in Australia and the UK.

177
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,110
What should we know about Mina that we
won't find an a quick search on Google?

178
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,050
Um, I think one of the things
that when, when I first speak,

179
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:46,080
people are always like, oh, where
did the accident come from? Um,

180
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,420
and I first learned to
speak English in Australia,

181
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,020
so I had a proper Aussie accent,
but I lost. But I was a child.

182
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:55,780
We lived in Australia and then I left
Australia and I lost my Aussie accent.

183
00:09:55,781 --> 00:09:58,040
So I guess that's one thing
most people don't know about me.

184
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,930
Well you can always get it again after
living in the UAE with such a mixed

185
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,810
community you can,
well you know it's funny cause my,

186
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,740
this accent is from years of living in
Saudi Arabia and then they moved to the

187
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:14,700
UK when I was 15 and I never
picked up a British accent.

188
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,190
Whereas my sister who's older picked
up a British accent. I don't know,

189
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,020
maybe I watch too much Hollywood.
Um,

190
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,640
so you were appointed editor
in chief last year of four,

191
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,474
the national.

192
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,440
And one of the things you said where you
want to take a new and fresh approach

193
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:35,400
to news. What did you mean
by that? Well several things.

194
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,270
I think the most important part of any
news organization newsroom is the team

195
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,430
and how you're putting together different
teams and what capabilities and how

196
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:46,800
you're equipping them and think what's,

197
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,290
and this is a challenge and we still
haven't cracked at the national.

198
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,100
And the continued to work on it is
how we make sure that you give each

199
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:55,890
journalist the chance to, you
know, whether they're editing,

200
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:59,580
whether they're using multimedia with
they're writing chance to develop

201
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:01,710
different ideas because
you need expertise,

202
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:05,490
but you also need them to break
out of it. So for example, um,

203
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,700
we try to make sure that everybody has
the chance to write about either of their

204
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,020
favorite books or you know,

205
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:14,190
and they could be genuinely writing
usually or just a sub editor every day,

206
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,620
but then they have the chance to
write about sports or so forth.

207
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,280
So giving them a more rounded
approach to telling stories.

208
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,550
And that's what we hope to do with the
nationals. That's one element of it.

209
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,140
The second element also of it is
getting that balance between, yes,

210
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,650
we have to be up to date,
but we're never going to be a newswire.

211
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,730
So there's that and that's
for many newspapers. There's
that tension now, right?

212
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,890
Because you want to be the
first person to break something.

213
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:38,910
But that's not really our,

214
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,300
our raise on death death is to make sure
that we're giving you and analysis why

215
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,980
do you care about this?
Why is this story important?

216
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,510
And so getting that balance
right of also how, where,

217
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,520
and we have an integrated newsroom so
people are working towards our digital

218
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,000
outlets, but also the actual
physical print newspaper.

219
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,820
So taking that approach of one,
it's integrated and two,

220
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,470
how are we understanding reader behavior
and therefore making sure that our

221
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:08,680
stories are being updated and developed
in a way that suits the reader to come

222
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:12,190
back and have fresh stories but also not
getting into this rat race of we have

223
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,140
to update every two
minutes or five minutes.

224
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,890
And I must say,
I'm not being biased here,

225
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:19,200
but the national's website
is probably one of the,

226
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,680
one of the greatest new sites out
there today covering the region.

227
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,660
And if you haven't listened
to the nationals podcasts,

228
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,240
you should definitely
try it out. It's, it's,

229
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:29,940
it's really good and it's a
good chance to go deep and have,

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
have long form conversations. Um,
thank you for saying that. I mean,

231
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,890
the thing with the podcasts and

232
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,910
other things, you know,
we relaunched a July,

233
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,010
2017 and we had a very short
time to turn things around.

234
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,110
But one of the things is, for
example, on the podcasting,

235
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,660
there were people who never sat

236
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,330
behind the microphone before.

237
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,260
And so we really nervous about it and
we gave them basic training. I mean,

238
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,094
it wasn't something

239
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,750
long over months. We didn't have the time,
a few days of it, but giving them an,

240
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,540
equipping them with skills and
then seeing who wants to do it.

241
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,550
So rather than assigning people say
you have to do this, you have to,

242
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,400
that it was people coming forward and say,
actually, yes, I think I could do that.

243
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,810
And seeing that they have the skills.

244
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,630
So that's been actually one of the
things that I'm really proud of,

245
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,420
the national that we've tried new
things and people have been, you know,

246
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,970
great journalists want to tell
stories in different ways. Nicknames.

247
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,370
So news consumption is becoming
more fragmented and more,

248
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,960
um, you know, um, digital than
ever before. How does that,

249
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,250
how are you guys receiving this at the
national and what are you doing to,

250
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,170
you know, to change it and to
transform into digital? You know,

251
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:36,730
that's the big question I think for
all newspapers. And so part of it,

252
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:39,340
like I said, is understanding
what our readers actually want.

253
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:41,550
And you will know this,
um,

254
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,960
is your core loyal group of readers who
will always come to the national and you

255
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:49,100
know, they've downloaded our app
when they wake up in the morning,

256
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:49,940
they have to look at other,

257
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,450
or they go to the website and there at
the moment comprising about 50% of our

258
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:58,451
readership and a little over
50% are coming through search.

259
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,270
Um, and of course Google being
the primary resource for that,

260
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:06,050
but also coming through social
media and sharing. And so, you know,

261
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:10,370
you all know this, all these changes
happening to what makes you read a story.

262
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,080
Is it because someone you trust?
Again,

263
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:14,690
it goes back to I'll know if trust has
sent it to you and therefore you think

264
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:15,524
it's worth your time.

265
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,730
So we're trying to develop way that we
have our core readers and we grow our

266
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,810
base of the loyal readers
that will always come back.

267
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,690
And then also catering for those people
that are finding us because of a certain

268
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:29,840
topic we've written about
through search or social media.

269
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:33,110
So that's something that you never had
to worry about in newspaper before.

270
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,880
And um,
it just 15 years ago you would,

271
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,770
you would be,
what's the front page?

272
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,630
How are we making sure that we've got
a good spread of news over 40 pages?

273
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:46,070
And you're kind of,
that was it.

274
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:49,730
And now it's completely changed in terms
of prioritization and also you can't

275
00:14:49,731 --> 00:14:54,731
control how you're going
have that experience with a
reader if they're coming to

276
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,570
you only through search or social,

277
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,380
but you want to keep them on the page
in order to stay engaged and actually

278
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,101
think, hey, yes,

279
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,100
the national has more to offer me then
this immediate story that I'm going to.

280
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,720
So that's really part of our every
day in terms of how were curating the

281
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,870
homepage on the website,
how we're creating a curating the APP,

282
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,580
what we're putting out through
our social media feeds.

283
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,210
And I always say we have five outlets
now at the national we have the paper,

284
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,340
which I'm very proud of,
but it's only in the UAE.

285
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:23,190
So I only see it if you're in the UAE,
you've got the website,

286
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
which again is the main
source of our readership.

287
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:29,450
Now you've got the APP
and we have the Ereader,

288
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,210
which is just the basic kind of readership
and that's what people a people go

289
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:33,730
for. But we have the more, you know,

290
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,080
sophisticated app that
actually is more curated.

291
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,340
And then we've got our social media feeds
and then we've got the fifth element,

292
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:44,360
which is our very specific products like
our newsletter that lands in your inbox

293
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:48,380
every morning and our podcasts and our
some at times we have videos that are

294
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,071
purely video.

295
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:52,040
There's no other story to go with it
cause we're also expanding our multimedia.

296
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,600
So though, so working across those
five everyday is very challenging.

297
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,261
It's not easy,

298
00:15:57,261 --> 00:16:00,500
but it's also keeping that priority
of saying that's how we're reaching a

299
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,430
greater readership.

300
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:05,540
Now do you envision a day where you will
start distributing your print paper,

301
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,730
Africa quests that you know,
I don't want to,

302
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,510
I don't want to stop distributing print
paper but I have to envision it because

303
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:18,520
if that's where the market will go,
then you have to be prepared for.

304
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,800
I don't think that's going to
happen. Um, for various reasons. One,

305
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:25,670
I think there is still something to
be said about reading a newspaper.

306
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:30,080
Now whether my niece is three years
old and when I go visit my sister,

307
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,480
I always take the paper with me and I
put it in front of her so she can play

308
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:35,490
with it because I'm thinking if we can
get children to play with newspapers,

309
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:37,880
they're going to enjoy reading it.
Like we enjoy reading newspapers.

310
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,170
Now when I worry about is that most
toddlers and young children now are always

311
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,590
just holding a device so they won't
even know what to do with the paper.

312
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,440
So my niece and nephew
are being indoctrinate. My
nephew's a year and a half.

313
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,740
So he's still got a year or two to go,
but my niece is totally indoctrinated.

314
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,690
And so I think that experience, as long
as people find joy in and having that,

315
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,111
you know,

316
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:00,140
it's an experience having your coffee
and your morning paper and all of that.

317
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:02,240
So long as that exists,
then we'll stay.

318
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,880
We'll stay good because I think we're
competitive newspaper and people want to

319
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:07,170
read us. However, if with
time people's behavior,

320
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:11,270
it just no longer includes that little
ritual, then it's very hard to keep up.

321
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:16,640
It was, we have our very own
homage of, of, of newspapers
at our, at our reception.

322
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,550
You'll go in and you'll see lots of
print papers decorating our reception.

323
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,370
Um, so I'm going to, we can start to warm
up with the questions from the room. Uh,

324
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,630
I will ask my last question
here and at somewhat of a,

325
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,440
of an existential one with spread
of misinformation that, you know,

326
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:36,500
we're seeing around the world today.
What,

327
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,830
how do you see the future of journalism?
Uh,

328
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,650
I know you wrote a piece for the world
economic forums that the future is

329
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,820
credibility,
right?

330
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,320
But how do you see that rolling out the
future of journalism in an age where

331
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,380
there's more and more miserable

332
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,233
commission?

333
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:57,350
I think as awareness is raised about
this issue of this information,

334
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:01,100
I do think people are more aware today
than they were maybe two years ago. Right?

335
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:03,710
So I think as more and more
of that becomes a problem,

336
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,180
it actually works better for journalism
because you go back to the basics of

337
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:11,960
journalism, which is, you know, how did
we get the story? What's her source?

338
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:15,830
What's the credibility behind
it? Um, you know, can I,

339
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,900
can I tell all aspects of the story if
I've missed something about the aspect

340
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:22,220
story, am I making my reader aware and
so forth. So I think that stays true.

341
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:25,070
And if you get that right with time,
people will come back to it.

342
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,270
Now how you're competing with,
you know, I say as a newspaper,

343
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:34,271
we compete with everything from Twitter
to Google news to the economist,

344
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,660
which used to be,
no,

345
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:37,880
if you're a newspaper Nooyi who
cares what the economist is writing,

346
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:39,320
but now you know,
they're distributing here.

347
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,620
And we're also trying to reach an audience
that's sitting in the UK or the u s

348
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,780
so that,
um,

349
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,340
that change means that you have to be
strong in your journalism in order for

350
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:52,700
people to come to you rather than fake
news. That's just being shared around.

351
00:18:52,701 --> 00:18:55,610
So I think there's more awareness and
I do think it's, it's a challenge now,

352
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,750
but with time,

353
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,900
people are beginning to know that if you
take a screen grab of a tweet and you

354
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:01,520
haven't sent me the actual team tweets,

355
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:04,610
it means the screen grab is something
that's photoshopped and fabricated.

356
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,700
We're still not there, but I think
more people are becoming aware of that.

357
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,810
So it's also part of our job as
journalists to raise awareness about that.

358
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,000
And I do think that
media literacy with time,

359
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:17,360
we'll actually be part of people's
education, like to be well rounded.

360
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:20,300
You're going to have to understand just
like we talk about financial literacy,

361
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:23,240
I think we need to talk about media
literacy and understanding information.

362
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,570
And if that really kicks in, which I
think it's beginning to in certain parts,

363
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,040
then it holds realism. Good stuff. Great.

364
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,250
That's a great final words.
Um, questions from Davao.

365
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,763
Thank you for joining

366
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,640
us today.

367
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,370
Wow.
Um,

368
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,060
okay.

369
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,650
I guess it depends where here is.

370
00:19:56,651 --> 00:20:01,651
So I would probably first talk about your
rock because I'm a single issue voter.

371
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,870
If I was in the U S I'd say I'm a single
issue voter cause everything goes back

372
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,150
to Iraq, which was, you
know, rightly or wrongly. Um,

373
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,300
and I think with the rocket
was just failed leadership.

374
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,890
And I think unfortunately for rock I
can say that with absolute certainty,

375
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:17,980
knowing the ins and outs of it all.
But I think also when you, as you said,

376
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:19,450
you know, I studied history.
When you look at history,

377
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,780
the impact that leadership can have at
taking you on the right course of the

378
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:27,040
completely wrong course, especially
when many of our societies are top down.

379
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,320
So how the top goes
can really impact that.

380
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:32,290
I'd say that that's probably
my immediate answer.

381
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,970
My second answer of how did we
get here is also a lack of vision.

382
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,690
Not knowing where we want to be in
four years' time, five years' time,

383
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,560
20 years' time, rather everything
was so immediate and reactionary.

384
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:46,600
And I think that's been
one of our pitfalls.

385
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:50,840
But I hope that I can say to her
where we got to here as women, um,

386
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,730
as societies that there are
some progressive elements
that we don't necessarily

387
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:59,731
always see because me as a political
journalist always thinks of the current

388
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:01,410
affairs status,
which depresses mate.

389
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:05,440
But when you think about also society
and how we've been able to either build

390
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:09,940
bridges or push back against stereotypes,
then that's also showed the strength,

391
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:13,570
the strength of people. And I think, um,
we've been really lucky with immigration.

392
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,030
Um, unfortunately now we're
seeing a trend against,

393
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:19,480
but I think with immigration both
ways, um, people coming to the region,

394
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:23,470
leaving from the region, so forth,
we've seen some great dynamic,

395
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,530
I think, you know, leaps and society.

396
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:30,280
And so that I would say is also people
movements and people's mobility has been

397
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,140
a good thing when it's not forced,
of course,

398
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,830
international women's Day
with your audience. Nationals,

399
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,540
a SPEC file.
Sorry,

400
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,100
Eh, again, you know,

401
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:58,580
I think we talk about the Middle East
and it's so different from country to

402
00:21:58,581 --> 00:22:02,840
country. And so it is kind of
incredible here. Cause I, you know,

403
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:06,050
this is the first I moved to
upper lobby on the 1st of March,

404
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:08,600
2017 is the first time I live
in the Arab world as an adult.

405
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,940
So I've been going back and forth. I've
actually never lived here as an adult.

406
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,790
And so I had friends, I had
colleagues contacting, you know,

407
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,980
are you going to struggle as
a woman? They said, actually,

408
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,610
it's been amazing because I'm actually
in a country where I feel comfortable as

409
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:22,250
a woman and I genuinely mean that this
is not because the camera's rolling,

410
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:23,630
I genuinely mean that.
And that's amazing.

411
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,080
And I'm not sure how many other places
that could say that about. Right. And I,

412
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:30,380
and I go into ruminate and I find that
most times people are gender blind,

413
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:33,800
which is really rare anywhere in the
world. Um, and you said that, you know,

414
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:36,800
we're talking about Middle Eastern women
and there is that stereotype of either,

415
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:38,750
you know,
it's like this curious,

416
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:42,800
mysterious veiled oriental woman
that still exists in today's world,

417
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:46,160
which was crazy or the opposite that,
you know, they're old trailblazers,

418
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,820
but then there are women that are being
left behind partly because of our wider

419
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,030
societal and political problems,
especially for example, um, you know,

420
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,140
they always talk about the
impact of war on society.

421
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:00,560
So in some ways it forces women to go
out and perhaps take jobs they wouldn't

422
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:01,500
have taken before.
You know,

423
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,070
we saw that of course with World War
II and the impact it had on Europe.

424
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,350
And part of that is happening,
but at the same time,

425
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,650
war is actually making women's rights
and certain parts of the Middle East

426
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:14,570
really regress. So they're often,
it's linked to, you know, fear,

427
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,630
intimidation. How can you
eliminate women? And you know, I'm,

428
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,560
my father's family's from
Muslim in Iraq and you know,

429
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,470
mostly it was subjected to horrific
reign of terror under dash.

430
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:32,030
And so the only difference between my
cousin's and my father left and their

431
00:23:32,031 --> 00:23:33,110
father had been ends basically.

432
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,830
And so the way that it was actually
women and how they were forced to get

433
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:38,480
completely covered up in their identity,

434
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:41,120
stripped from them and they couldn't work
and they can do all these things that

435
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:44,930
that targeting of women as we're seeing
is actually making them regrets because

436
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,530
after a dash goes or you know,
different extremist elements go,

437
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,980
it's still really hard to break out of it.
So it's really a mixed bag.

438
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,320
But in terms of international
perceptions of Middle Eastern woman,

439
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,320
unfortunately it's still so
stereotypical and quite shallow.

440
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,120
Thank you very much. I have a
question around kind of being fidgety

441
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,240
and in order to get the attention in
order to capture the attention of the

442
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:13,841
audience,

443
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:18,841
what we're seeing now in my view is
images and stories that are really shocked

444
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:23,330
value.
And I'm not talking about fake news,

445
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:27,730
I'm talking about things that are
really happening. Shocking images.

446
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,030
What's your view of that?
Is this valid?

447
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,950
Yeah.
Um,

448
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:39,530
I think probably the serious story
is one that increasingly we're seeing

449
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:40,980
shocking images,

450
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,250
partly because of the brutality and
how horrific the situation is there.

451
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,790
But partly, and this term really
frustrates me as a journalist.

452
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,830
You get people saying,
we have reader fatigue,

453
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:52,290
so we need to shock people into
caring. And I say, first of all,

454
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,640
I'm sorry you're tired.

455
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:56,040
Did that people are dying and
their lives are being destroyed.

456
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,650
I find that really offensive
as a term. But anyway. Um,

457
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,770
and then the second thing of actually,
you know what those shocking images,

458
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,400
if you don't already care, I honestly
don't think that's gonna make you care.

459
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,360
It may make you stop and say,
okay, why do I, you know,

460
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,700
make you stop and I don't think it's
going to make you care or move you to act

461
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,790
because it's more brutal
or more shocking. Um, so,

462
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:17,430
so that's kind of the approach we've
taken up the national at the national,

463
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:18,370
we have really,
you know,

464
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,290
really strict guidelines in terms of what
we're actually publishing in terms of

465
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:25,470
photos, in terms of
headlines. Um, you know,

466
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:28,470
it's really difficult
because you see this image.

467
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:30,870
I think most of you will conjure up now,
you know,

468
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,900
the buddies of children wrapped in white
shrouds and it's been really hard for

469
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:37,470
us because people were
like, oh, well, you know,

470
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:40,290
it tells a story of course Palestine.
We had these images for decades,

471
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,900
we've seen them coming off Palestine
and it's always been a thing of, okay,

472
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:45,240
but when does the dignity of
that child and their family,

473
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,160
this isn't their choice to be published.

474
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:50,190
And also the shock element should be
about the fact that it's happening.

475
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,590
We can't be so graphic
that we desensitize.

476
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,300
It's difficult because now everybody
can be a publisher because if I don't

477
00:25:57,301 --> 00:26:00,600
publish it, somebody else's going to put
it on, you know, whatever page it is,

478
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,030
whether it's a Facebook page or
their own website and so forth.

479
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,290
So then do you lose out the, the
attitude we take up nationals, fine,

480
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:10,740
we can lose out,
but I think we need to shake people from,

481
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,140
from complacency. And it can't be done
by abusing actually the victims. So,

482
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,590
but it's, it's constantly a conversation
that we have in our newsroom.

483
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,390
Sure.
Um,

484
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,330
so that's of course one topic
that comes up a lot. Um,

485
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,500
and I have to say every outlet that I've
either worked for or been a guest of a

486
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:51,890
panel of has its own guidelines and
own issues that come up and they're

487
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,570
different. You know, there are
different, whether it's commercial,

488
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,950
whether it's political, you know, we
go back to the point of, uh, Isis,

489
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,080
do you call them isis that I
should [inaudible] state. You know,

490
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:04,670
I used to go on the BBC many times to
discuss it and they'd be so angered

491
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:06,660
because they'd say Islamic state and like,
it's not the Islamic state.

492
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:08,070
And the anchor would
be looking at me like,

493
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:09,850
can you just like leave
that discussion until later?

494
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,840
Because we need to get to where we say
late. So, you know, there are those,

495
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,900
that's one thing. And then there is the
issue of freedom of expression as such.

496
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,040
And I think freedom of expression as a,
as a concept is,

497
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,400
is different in different societies.

498
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,540
And it's really interesting because
recently I was speaking to an American

499
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,540
official and the way she was speaking
about freedom of expression is completely

500
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:28,111
different from how,

501
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:30,600
for example in the UK they'd speak about
freedom of expression and the whole

502
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:33,660
first amendment and so forth.
And then in our region it's,

503
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,890
it's much more about looking at journalism
as being responsible journalism and

504
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,770
that has its pluses and its minuses.
Because again, going back to that point,

505
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,860
I do actually think that there are
certain constraints that we placed on

506
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:44,940
ourselves that we have to,

507
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,910
and then there are certain trip
tricky topics and that it would be,

508
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,010
I think wrong, a
disingenuous to say. Yeah,

509
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:53,080
it's absolutely the same whether
you're in the Arab world or abroad.

510
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,010
I think it's difference the, and
China's the front and Russia, um,

511
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,240
it's a constant juggle.

512
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,600
And one of the things that you
have to think about is one,

513
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,930
the safety of the people
who work for you too.

514
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,580
What is the longevity of your,
uh, establishment? So for example,

515
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,151
again,

516
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:12,660
you'll have certain entities that are
commercial entities that you want to stay

517
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:16,260
on the right side off one way or the
other to make sure that you can continue

518
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,320
and that's not the national
but for other enterprises.

519
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,290
And then there's the politics and I
think you have to be really careful about

520
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,950
what you do and how you write about.
But in all seriousness and honesty,

521
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:28,770
it's not a constraint for us because
actually there are clear editorial

522
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:31,050
guidelines that I adhere
to the I believe in.

523
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:34,120
And then the newsroom also adheres to,
um,

524
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,390
and is happy with it in
terms of the battle of ideas.

525
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:38,880
Where do we stand in the Middle East?
And especially in the Arab world,

526
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,750
the situation wherein the right
now in terms of, you know,

527
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,630
do we believe in enforcing
religion into politics?

528
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,100
Do we believe in the use of arms outside
of state rule and all of that stuff.

529
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:53,990
And so we have, again, clear lines on
that and that's where we stick to. Um,

530
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,500
so for us,
that's how we approach it.

531
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:59,070
I think for others it comes down
to what's politically acceptable,

532
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,340
what's politically unacceptable.
And there are very few, you know,

533
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,140
people always ask me what
are the red lines? I'm like,

534
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:06,330
honestly there are no red lines of such,

535
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:09,990
but there's an understanding
of our societies and where,
where we're publishing.

536
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:12,750
And this goes back to the digital
element because sometimes you're writing

537
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,320
something that will work for a reader
that's in your immediate vicinity.

538
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,050
They'll be completely different
if they're Australian. Um,

539
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,740
and so we think about who's our core
audience and horror core readers and we,

540
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:27,500
and we stick with that.
So large.

541
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,880
You choose to ask the questions.

542
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,360
I touched the party museum literacy,

543
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,250
looking at your general Arabic
speaking public in the Middle East,

544
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,280
obviously I have my own opinion about
the quality, the literacy we have.

545
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,460
I'm wondering what do you think about it?

546
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,530
Do you think there is high media
literacy in the Middle East?

547
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:49,640
Because we know that there's good quality,

548
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:53,350
so there are many air journalists
who are doing excellent work,

549
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:58,270
but there was also a lot of journalists
for doing horrible work. Yeah.

550
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,520
So what do you think about Arab media
literacy and if you can improve it or if

551
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,320
you all, do you think it's, if you think
it needs approvement, what would you do?

552
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,770
Yeah, so, so when I say
media literacy, I mean like,

553
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,770
so I'm just making sure we're, we're on
the same page. When I say media literacy,

554
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:16,250
it's basically all of us,
how we understand news and
how we're consuming it.

555
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:20,750
So it's for the reader or the consumer
or the viewer. Um, I don't, again,

556
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:22,550
I think it's varied
from country to country,

557
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:25,400
but they don't think there is a high
level of media literacy in the Arab world

558
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:28,430
or internationally. But if we're sticking
to just the Arab world, absolutely not.

559
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:31,790
There isn't enough understanding
or awareness. He, you
still get people saying,

560
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,530
I read it on the Internet.
Okay, congratulations.

561
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,740
Well and to that, um, and
so, so that's, you know,

562
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:42,650
that's partly because technological
change has happened so quickly,

563
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,770
but partly because it's not part
of our school ethos to like,

564
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:48,710
actually this is not something
that you teach in schools. Again,

565
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,730
if people have strong history
classes and they understand sourcing,

566
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,850
then it gets ingrained with that.
But most of it,

567
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:58,910
unfortunately in most of the Arab world
history curricula is not taught that way.

568
00:30:58,911 --> 00:31:01,940
It's not taught for critical thinking or
questioning that this actually happened

569
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:05,180
the way I'm being told it's happening.
So it's completely different. Um,

570
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,970
so we don't have high media literacy.
What would they change about it?

571
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:10,760
I would honestly bring in
classes into schools. Um,

572
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,070
I would open up for more
journalists to go and speak.

573
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:13,970
When I was living in the UK,

574
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:17,120
I would often go to schools and you
can't actually in the u s I did this,

575
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:18,500
spoke at schools and so forth.

576
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,320
It's much more difficult here to actually
have the access to go and speak about

577
00:31:21,321 --> 00:31:21,441
them.

578
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:24,740
So I would do a program where I would
have schools partner up with journalists

579
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:27,710
to go and speak about these. And again,
just simple things like sourcing.

580
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,410
How do you see if a photo is
photoshopped or otherwise?

581
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,080
Because I think that's a life
skill that's really important. Um,

582
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,690
so I would start quite young,
but then also older,

583
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:38,030
just simple things like you can't say,
I read that on the Internet.

584
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:39,830
What does that mean?
And sometimes people don't even realize,

585
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,100
but when you have that conversation
and be like, Oh yeah, I, you know,

586
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,870
I wrote an article for a shuttle
also at my former employer,

587
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,860
still people call them with them.

588
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:49,280
And I wrote an article that was really
popular a few weeks ago cause I said,

589
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,210
you the reader, have a responsibility
for what you're sharing. You know,

590
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,950
you get these, what's up
messages that says in Arabic
come out, we'll find a need.

591
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:59,660
Come on. What I'd done. And it
basically says as I received it,

592
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,420
as I go there and it's like what
you, and it's rubbish, right?

593
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,040
What they're sending it makes no sense.
And you're like,

594
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,190
how can you send this and then just write
back and say it's just what like, oh,

595
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:07,430
you know,

596
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,130
I held no responsibility because you
actually do all the resources that you're

597
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:12,060
sharing it. So then
you know, to get it to,

598
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,740
to tell people that they actually
have a responsibility as publishers.

599
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:16,850
But also distributors.

600
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,630
Wow.
Lots of questions.

601
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,310
Oh,
this was interesting.

602
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,783
Good.

603
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,680
Yeah. Oh my God. So many. Okay.
So here was this, uh, wow.

604
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:38,820
I should remember this. 2011, I
want to say, yeah. 2011. Okay.

605
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,810
So I,
um,

606
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,710
interviewed American officials during
the Bush administration times and the

607
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:50,030
Obama Times, the Bush
administration people were so
much more accessible. Right?

608
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,150
And they had, they had
no red lines. They would,

609
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,460
the only thing they would have as you
only have this site, this timeframe, um,

610
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,170
I interviewed Obama and Kerry and
they were so difficult because Obama,

611
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:03,860
they wouldn't even let me go see him.
So we did it actually by phone. Right?

612
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,830
So they wouldn't, and I said, I'll fly,
I'll come anytime they want. They said no.

613
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:09,890
And they wanted to control it completely.
And the same was true actually when I,

614
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,260
although Carrie was more fun
because he actually was like,

615
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,750
he was trying to be like, we've known
each other and I don't know him,

616
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,700
but where's,
or the wound that was really controlled.

617
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,680
It was absolutely controlled. The
questions were controlled. Um,

618
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,350
and it was really disappointing to be
honest. Um, with the Bush administration,

619
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:28,700
I did an interview, um, Bush or Cheney
by interviewed many others and honestly,

620
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:30,380
they would just,
the only constraint would be the time.

621
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,450
Like you have half an
hour do you want you want.

622
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,910
So they really control the message
and they believed, you know,

623
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,730
I worked in Washington
from the beginning 2009,

624
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:42,731
so end of 2011 they believed that all
we need to do is tweet something out or

625
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:48,710
send you an SMS of what saying we're going
to send you a speech that he's, he's,

626
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,570
he gave and that's it.

627
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,730
I had only one background briefing with
the White House the entire time I was

628
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:58,790
there. And then I had a couple of other
interviews like with Ben Rhodes and other

629
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,360
people,

630
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,570
but they really controlled the message
and I think it was to their detriment

631
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,500
internationally.

632
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,673
Wow.

633
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,360
Um, like I said, it's, it's the, um,

634
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,640
the only difference between me and my
cousins is that my cousins didn't leave

635
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,440
and I did.
Um,

636
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,390
but it's also incredible how resilient
they are and how much fun they are.

637
00:34:27,391 --> 00:34:31,620
You know, I saw them recently, a few of
them for people from the Middle East.

638
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:34,890
Like we say, I have a cousin and there's
like 45 of them minimum, like genuine,

639
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:38,070
I think I have like 47
cousins. Um, and so,

640
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,060
so it's incredible how similar we are.
And I think, you know, again, that's,

641
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:45,240
you know, blood, it's incredible. You
know, some of my cousins I hadn't seen,

642
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:50,090
my family was an exile from 1990 to 2003
so I didn't seem family for that long

643
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:53,520
and we went back to Baghdad at the
end of 2003 and it was incredible.

644
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:55,110
Like I'd seen them just last weekend.

645
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:58,410
So that's amazing how like
through inheritance in
three or your, I don't know,

646
00:34:58,411 --> 00:35:00,390
your parents' upbringing and so forth,
you're so similar,

647
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,270
but life would have been so much more,
so much more difficult.

648
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,440
I definitely wouldn't have had most of
the opportunities that I've had. Um,

649
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,500
but I would say in terms of confidence,

650
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,540
I see that in my cousin's in
terms of aspirations and so forth,

651
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:20,020
it kind of hasn't beat them
down. All that, the craziness
that's happened in Iraq,

652
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,720
you know,
if you are from my generation,

653
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,290
you were born at a time when there's
the Iran Iraq war, you finish that,

654
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,690
then you had the Kuwait invasion,
you finished that,

655
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:30,150
you had the years of sanctions,
you finished the years of sanctions,

656
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,140
you go into the 2003 more, you go into
sectarian strife, you go into isis.

657
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:37,890
And here we are today. So you know,
people who of that generation,

658
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,250
and especially actually for,

659
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,990
for many men who were slightly older
who actually had to be drafted into the

660
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:45,210
army,
it's heartbreaking because you know,

661
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:48,770
the years that they spent being
drafted into these senseless wars. Um,

662
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,280
so I think if I had stayed
in Iraq and if I was a man,

663
00:35:51,281 --> 00:35:54,930
that would have been actually that
much worse. Um, but at the same time,

664
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:59,020
I think I would probably be very similar
in character because of what my parents

665
00:35:59,021 --> 00:35:59,860
have instilled in me

666
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,683
question

667
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,650
that
on texting

668
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,203
would be,

669
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,720
journalists will actually push the button.
Yeah.

670
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,420
Yeah.
It costs them to being explosive.

671
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,450
Yeah. And we do on
certain things. So again,

672
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:43,590
it's a fine line and it's a negotiation.
It's a negotiation with yourself,

673
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:45,000
with your editor.
It's not an ego.

674
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,260
There's no external power that comes and
tells you do, do not. You know, we don't,

675
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,020
I mean, I definitely the Emirates,
we don't live in that landscape.

676
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,630
I think it's different depending on
the country, your rent. So there's no,

677
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:58,030
but it's one, it's an appreciation
and understanding, um,

678
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,740
of what would be acceptable,
what isn't acceptable. Um, but,

679
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,370
and I mean to political power is
the only two to audiences, so,

680
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,290
so it's your own understanding,
socio negotiation.

681
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,360
There are things that you choose and
you say, no, I'm going to push on this.

682
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:13,260
And we have had issues like that.
And to be frank, I mean touch with,

683
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:17,190
before I jinxed myself, um,
since July 1st until now,

684
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:19,950
there's not been one thing that you've
had somebody turn around and say, no,

685
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,420
you cannot write that.
Now.

686
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,720
Does that mean that we're careful
and therefore we haven't pushed?

687
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:26,670
I think we have pushed on certain issues.
I mean,

688
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:29,040
I don't know how frequently read national,
but we do try,

689
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:33,720
especially on issues that we think are
of public interest and, and that is,

690
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:37,290
it's kind of like our guiding force.
But again, I don't mean to belittle it,

691
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,100
but I just don't,

692
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,420
it really isn't that big a constraint
once you know what you want to be out

693
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:44,490
there saying I'm why you're
working in the Middle East.

694
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:47,700
I mean there is a joy to working
from here to be able to say there's a

695
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:52,290
publication coming out from the Arab
world that is able to tackle issues,

696
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:56,460
you know, social issues,
but also political issues,
question certain things. Again,

697
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,950
no easy,
we're not going to do it irresponsibly.

698
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:01,050
But there a joy in being able to do that.

699
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,793
Yeah.

700
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,130
Any more questions? Okay. I guess last
question. This is going to be a fun one.

701
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,550
Oh good, good, good note to end up.

702
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,170
Good positive note to end on.
So we're having,

703
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,330
you mentioned that media right now we
access videos where our phones before we

704
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:26,950
have to wait to wait by
the newspaper and all that.

705
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,150
So if you get to define one kind of like
logical advancements or like something

706
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:37,671
in the Internet of things
that would basically either
had people to reach out to

707
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:43,360
India or to read the media or to be more
informed and to get actual news instead

708
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:48,170
of fake news. Um, what would be like
your dream you device or you mentioned?

709
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,350
Okay. So, so I have to answer is
because my first answer is, did you,

710
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,620
did you guys ever see the
movie minority report? Right.

711
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:59,920
So that image of Tom Cruise, yeah, it was
Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise, who's in Emirates.

712
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,840
Um, some cruise holding the newspaper
that gets updated automatically,

713
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,520
which I guess is like
the modern day tablet,

714
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:07,890
but I wish it could be a
newspaper that gets updated.

715
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:10,290
So that's like kind of my crazy dream.
If I could have anything,

716
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,140
my newspaper would stay updating
while still being in newspaper. Um,

717
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,350
but if I can't have that,
my second thing is,

718
00:39:16,351 --> 00:39:19,080
I guess is exactly the point
that you said about fake news.

719
00:39:19,081 --> 00:39:24,081
So if there's a way that we can
distinguish trusted news sources and not

720
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:27,480
trusted, or even if they're trusted,
kind of like, who's the ownership?

721
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:30,090
Like let people know, what's the
ownership, where is that coming from?

722
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,601
What does that,

723
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,910
but there's a way that we can signal
that so people know what to take.

724
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:35,580
I want us to take that would be

725
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,300
the dream. Great. Um,

726
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,190
Amena on behalf of all Googlers,

727
