1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,080
So my name is Vanessa Foxo Lockin. Um,
but I write under the pen name Sam Blake.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,330
Um, and that's with a very good reason
that it's, Natalia is just discovered, oh,

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,960
Lochlan is quite hard name to pronounce.
Um,

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,050
and obviously it's a very long name and
to fit it onto the cover of a book would

5
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:20,260
be a bit of a challenge.
Um,

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,060
so when I started writing my agent and
I sat down and we had a little think

7
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:27,690
about it, um, we wanted to work at a
name that would work internationally. Um,

8
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:32,040
so now I'm Sam Blake, but I'm here
today as both with both hats on.

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:36,930
I'm here as Vanessa and I'm here a sound
like, um, because I started writing,

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,480
I'm originally in 1999.
Um,

11
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:42,470
I don't know how many of you guys maybe
have always felt like maybe you wanted

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,310
to write a book.
I think a lot of people do.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,330
And I was one of those people
and I really had that sort of,

14
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:52,200
always had that feeling since I was quite
small load. Really. I'd write, I read,

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,980
I read huge amount. And, um, I sat down,

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,820
my husband won't say literally went
sailing across the Atlantic in 1999 for

17
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:03,570
eight weeks, and I was at
home and my own, um, long,

18
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,850
dark winter evenings cause
it was November. And, um,

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,480
I had an idea for a book and I
sat down and started writing yet,

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,990
and this is back a long time ago
before I could even use a computer.

21
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,000
So I was writing it out longhand.
Um,

22
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:17,550
and I've just started really working in
a job where I was starting to learn to

23
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:20,260
use a computer. It makes me sound
like a total dinosaur. I know,

24
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:23,720
and I were in here and Google
of all places. Um, but uh,

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,920
started writing long hands.
It was going into the office,

26
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,890
the evenings on the weekends
to write it up. And, um,

27
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:32,880
it was a book called the poison tree.
Um, and it features a detective. Um,

28
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,610
I'm quite lucky that my husband
and fat works the Guardian,

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,710
so I have an access into sort of
the police side of things, um,

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,590
and how that whole world works.
And, um, I had this idea,

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,670
so I literally just started writing and
obviously thought cause you do when it's

32
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:51,630
your first book and I've actually all
your books that it was amazing because you

33
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:52,710
just, you'll, I think,

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,010
I think one of the key things about
writing is that you need to be optimistic

35
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:58,150
and you need to be positive.
Um,

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,260
and you have to believe in your book
because if you don't believe in your book,

37
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:04,860
who else is going to believe in it. Um,
and so obviously thought it was fantastic,

38
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:06,600
finished it and sent it out.

39
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,810
Made the first absolute cardinal
error when it comes to writing a book.

40
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,990
Literally put the last full stop
down and then started sending it out.

41
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,070
And I sent it everywhere.

42
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:18,570
I sent it to agents and publishers all
over the world and it was rejected by

43
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,280
everybody all over the world. Um, and I,
but I didn't, it didn't really put me off.

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,810
I kept going.
Um,

45
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,950
I had an idea for a second book and so
while it was out there being rejected, um,

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,020
I kept going, okay. Writing,

47
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm Stephen King talks about in his book
on writing about his rejection because

48
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,040
rejection is one of those things
that happens in writing. Um,

49
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,970
it happens a lot in life obviously, but
it particularly happens in writing. Um,

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,570
and Steve Martin King talks about
putting all his rejection slips on a nail

51
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:50,430
above his desk in his book. I didn't
click keep mine, I didn't collect them.

52
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,520
I didn't want to keep that
negative energy in one place. Um,

53
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:57,060
so I have them scattered all around the
house and I remember doing a workshop a

54
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,070
few years later and somebody
held up a slip at the firm.

55
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,350
One of the Irish publishing has,
I've got one of those,

56
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,760
just one of those add to the collection.
Um, but I kept going, kept writing. Um,

57
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,260
and I suppose one of the things I knew I
needed to do was improve and get better

58
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:15,430
and learn the techniques of
fiction writing, which are really,

59
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:16,730
really important.
Um,

60
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,750
I don't think I really knew that there
were techniques when I started writing.

61
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,860
Um, I knew we all learn English in school.
I did a degree in history. You know,

62
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:27,490
I've written creatively for
school essays and my a levels,

63
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,970
I think my a level essay was
about bees. Um, and so, you know,

64
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:34,330
you think you can do it and you
read, obviously everybody reads. Um,

65
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,010
so you keep on going.

66
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,500
But I didn't really realize that actually
there were things that will actually

67
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:39,370
make the fiction better.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,820
And I did a workshop down in dingle
with a lady called Judy Parsons.

69
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,860
And that workshop really helped me hugely
because it really proved to me that I

70
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,940
could write and people, you know,
my peers and other writers. So yeah,

71
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,600
actually you do know what you're doing.
Um,

72
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,000
but it also showed me what I didn't know
and how much I needed to improve and

73
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,610
how much I needed to learn.
Um,

74
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:03,730
and that's really how inkwell came about
and probably how I got to where I am

75
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:07,750
now. Um, so I set up, I
wanted to do workshops,

76
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:11,500
I wanted to do on, to do more workshops.
The weekend the Judy Parsons, as I say,

77
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,580
was down in dingle. And to get there I
had to fly. My parents are from the UK.

78
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:19,570
I had two small children, then I had to
do, you know, frozen stuff in the fridge.

79
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,220
I had still the notes,
the whole lot.

80
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,160
So it was a major operation getting
away and that really wasn't an option.

81
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,150
And with my husband working shifts,
I couldn't get out to an evening class.

82
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:31,540
So I was looking at this problem, you
know, I need you to learn how to write.

83
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,780
Could 20 classes, what would I
do? I decided I'd start my own.

84
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,290
So I got in touch with a friend of
mine who's a writer and said, look,

85
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,610
I've had this idea,
you know,

86
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,270
there must be other people out there
that want to do one day intensive fiction

87
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:47,970
writing workshops. And um, she put
me in touch with some authors. Um,

88
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,220
and cause I was working in
event management at the time.

89
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,490
I was able to sort of bring all those
skills into play and I set up something

90
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:58,640
called Inkwell, which started off
literally as one day workshops. Um,

91
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,130
and my original plan was to do workshops
on a Saturday because that's when

92
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,460
you're free and almost people
are free and uh, all day.

93
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,940
And they would just be once a month and
they would be just once a month during

94
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:12,390
the winter because my kids are off during
summer. And obviously, and analogy,

95
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,790
we have very long school holidays. So
I wanted to make sure these, I mean,

96
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:16,930
these workshops were absolutely,

97
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:21,370
completely geared to me that will gear to
me learning how to, to write better. Um,

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,880
and it turned out once I got them up and
running and I found a hotel and I got

99
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,340
my, my methods sorted out. Um,

100
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,670
because I think it's really important
when you are learning anything and when

101
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:33,060
you're doing that type, you're
in that type of environment, um,

102
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,750
that you bond with the
person who is speaking.

103
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,900
So I always made sure that I had
two speakers at every workshop. Um,

104
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,140
because if you don't bond with one of
those people, it can ruin the day for you.

105
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,030
And so for me, it's very
important to get that mix. So I,

106
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,950
I got my mix working and it turned out
that I wasn't the only person in this

107
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:51,490
situation, but actually an awful lot of
other people wanted to do the same thing.

108
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,090
Um, and inkwell became hugely
successful. I bought a huge network.

109
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,920
I had people coming from
Switzerland and India.

110
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,590
I had people coming from the UK
obviously cause it's nice and close, um,

111
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,730
to come to these workshops.
Um,

112
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,900
I used always use bestselling authors
because I'm a great believer that,

113
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,890
you know, you don't, you don't lick it off
of stone. If you get to be best seller,

114
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,250
there's a good reason for it. Um, and so
that's really how inkwell started. Um,

115
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,320
and all the while I was
doing the workshops,

116
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:17,210
obviously I was learning
how to write that in myself.

117
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,390
I think I've probably sat through more
workshops and most people living because

118
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:24,160
I've been to the mall and I sit
in the back taking notes. Um,

119
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,620
I kept going and then I discovered
that the writing dot I eat domain was

120
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,920
available. And um, I
thought this is great.

121
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:33,740
I have this newsletter that I was
sending out to my inquiry people,

122
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,070
main core writers,
and in each newsletter that went out,

123
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:40,250
I talk about competitions and festivals
and different things that are happening

124
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,490
and what was going on in the writing
world. And every single time I sent it,

125
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,060
literally I press send somebody,
get it, and they go, oh,

126
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,340
did you know about this one?
Did you know about this?

127
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,390
I'd literally get three or four
emails straight back saying, well,

128
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,580
did you know about these? And
I didn't. And I thought, well,

129
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:56,030
if I'm the person who's supposed to be
trying to coordinate this information and

130
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,140
I don't know what's going on,

131
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,770
then how's anybody else out in the
country know what's going on? Um,

132
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,030
and there was really,
at that point,

133
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:05,930
there was no central point for
literary information in Ireland.

134
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,830
Even though we are this amazing, literally
nation, we've got Mann Booker winners.

135
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:14,160
We've got Nobel laureates where a
fantastic story telling nation. Um,

136
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,410
but the wasn't that central point.

137
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:19,240
So I've discovered the writing dot age
and was available and literally put ink

138
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,990
on newsletter into a website and created
writing dot. A um, it's still going.

139
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,930
It's an online magazine.
We update daily with information.

140
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:31,220
It's got features in it. It's got, um,
competitions. Just everything really,

141
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,730
me as an aspiring writer wanted
to learn and wants to know about,

142
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,000
has gone into writing. Dot.
Hey you now. Um, and I,

143
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,380
I love meeting writers and then
saying, you know, I read writing a tie.

144
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,080
It still amazes me. Um, maze may amaze me.
We don't know. Ryan told me that he was,

145
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:48,030
he goes there every morning and his wife
has to tell them to get off it. That's,

146
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,790
that's real reward. Um, so while
all these things are going on, um,

147
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,420
one of the things that was happening
with inkwell was that obviously the

148
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,150
recession hit island,
um,

149
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,500
and literally the bottom fell
out of my business overnight.

150
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,430
So the workshop side of the
business completely collapsed. Um,

151
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,090
there were quite a high end. They
weren't cheap. And, um, you know,

152
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,050
it was one of those moments for anybody
who's worked in a small business will

153
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:12,800
know that you,
you're,

154
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,650
there are moments when I think in
venture capitalism they call it pivoting,

155
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:18,620
but it's that moment where you go,
it's not working. We need to think,

156
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:19,460
rethink this.

157
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,510
And so one of the things that happened
literally that night when I realized

158
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:24,890
there was no more business,
um,

159
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,020
was that I looked at all the
things I'd been doing. Um,

160
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,960
and the works or something,

161
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:33,260
giving him the things that we're
really working in the company. Um,

162
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,950
and one of the things that was working
was the scouting side of bit. Um,

163
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,470
I had built lots of
relationships with publishers,

164
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,510
lots of relationships with the editors.
Um,

165
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,270
and all the way along the line I was
meeting new authors and we had new

166
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:47,320
manuscripts and I was really
enjoying reading them,

167
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:50,030
but I also discovered the most quite
good at spotting the successful ones.

168
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,090
And so I was sending them
out to the publishers and
they were getting published.

169
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:54,950
I will send them out to agents
and they were getting picked up.

170
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,540
And so basically I formalized
that side of the business.

171
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,980
I could see that's where we needed to
go. So, um, I became literally scout.

172
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,390
I formalized the arrangements with various
agents that I work with in the UK. Um,

173
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,440
I bought on board a whole
load of different authors
from different genres, um,

174
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,660
who were able to give people,
readers reports.

175
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:15,900
One of the things that happened to me
through this process was that I'd met an

176
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:18,960
editor and um,
she quite liked like the work that I was,

177
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,600
the book that I was writing all the time
and it was probably a book number three

178
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:26,030
at that stage. And um, I, she'd given,

179
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,400
she sent it out to her readers and those
readers had given me feedback on my

180
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:32,490
work and that there was enormously useful.
Um,

181
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,960
one of the problems of being a writer,

182
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,810
it's very easy as a scout to read
somebody's work and be able to see exactly

183
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:39,360
what you need to do with it. There
was an editor at that, I say easy.

184
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,560
It isn't easy, but you know, you're,

185
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,160
you can see what needs fixing with
your own work. You can't see it at all.

186
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,940
You can't see it. It's so bizarre.
I think it's because when you write,

187
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:51,510
you have the images in your head and my
job is to take the images from my head

188
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:54,690
and turn them into words and the page,
they were forming images in your head.

189
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,410
But because I can see the picture,
I might have forgotten to tell you that,

190
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,340
you know, Fred blogs that just walked in
the back door, then you've got one leg,

191
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,160
cause I know he's only got one leg,
but if I haven't put it on the page,

192
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:10,080
you can't see it. So that from a writer's
perspective, um, is a tricky one.

193
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,970
Um, so raw writers need is people to
help is to people to read their work.

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,240
And so I have a lot of authors now who
worked for me who do what we call readers

195
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,050
reports.

196
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,140
So they will read a finished book and
they will look at the plot development and

197
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:22,920
the character development,

198
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,280
all of those important things and help
an author move it along and bring up to

199
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:28,320
the next level. Um, so that's sort of the,

200
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:31,440
how the publishing consultancy side
grew literally as a result of the,

201
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,940
of the bottom falling out of the
business. Um, and is now very successful.

202
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,680
Um, and really the literary
scouting side is what brought me on.

203
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,500
So while I'm building the businesses, um,
and doing these various bits and pieces,

204
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,920
I kept writing. Um, and I think it's
absolutely essential for people. Um,

205
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,560
or for everybody. I mean, the literal,

206
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:54,340
the best advice I was ever given was just
keep writing. Um, signing Beckett said,

207
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:57,150
you know, fail, fail better,
just keep on failing. And that's,

208
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,340
and I think that's what it's all about.
It's that it's,

209
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,950
it's improving and improving,
improving.

210
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:05,130
Malcolm Gladwell talks about 10,000 hours,
you know,

211
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,660
that you need to hit that 10,000 hours
in order to reach the tipping point. Um,

212
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,530
and that is so true and it's
true in writing as much as
it is in everything else.

213
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,330
Um, so I kept going, I was
busy writing away and I,

214
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,550
one morning I had coffee or something,

215
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:24,730
coffee with one of the agents I
work with in London and um, he just,

216
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,750
we found a book,
I'd found a book,

217
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,490
sent it to him and he sold it
for a lot of money. And, um,

218
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,320
he was very successful agent and we
were sitting down having a little cup of

219
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:38,490
coffee and common garden and I had a book
with me on the counter and was put by

220
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:39,570
a friend of mine.
Could Alex Barclay,

221
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,780
it was proof copy of one of
her books and he saw, you know,

222
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:44,190
you're reading Alex
Barky. I said, well, yeah,

223
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,210
she's been really influential on my
writing because in fact this is a trade

224
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:49,680
secret.
I completely stolen.

225
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm Alex [inaudible] system of plotting
and planning because she hasn't worked

226
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:54,520
out and I literally have taken,

227
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,020
she taught me how to do it and like that's
what I use. So, um, he said, oh, you know,

228
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:02,620
you're, you're, you're eating
her. And I said, yeah, very
inflection. And he went, Oh,

229
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,050
do you? Right. And somewhere
in the midst of things,

230
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:08,000
one of the things I think
certainly for me, um,

231
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,570
and probably for the people that wear
lots of different hats and different

232
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:14,650
businesses is that it's quite difficult
field to understand what you do. Um,

233
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,550
so sometimes I'm industry consultants,
sometimes I'm a website managing person,

234
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:23,080
sometimes I'm an author and I'm
also the chair of Irish pen and I'm,

235
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,540
I do lots of different things.
And this Simon Cohen,

236
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:30,370
who is my agent now hadn't grasped
obviously the bit, the most important bit,

237
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,870
which was the writing. So he said to me,
what you're working on? And I said, well,

238
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:38,110
I'm working on this book. It's called, uh,
it wasn't called the, the little bones,

239
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:40,690
then it's called the dressmaker. And, um,

240
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,130
it's about the bones were
baby turning up in the,

241
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,360
of her wedding dress and the detector
who has to find out what happens.

242
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,170
And he went, oh, I'd like to see
that. And I had one of those moments,

243
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:54,460
the total paralysis, because this
is this massive agent in London.

244
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,320
He's works for a huge company. There
are Hollywood talent agency. And, um,

245
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,500
he wants to see my writing, which
sounds amazing, brilliant opportunity.

246
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,090
But then as a scout,

247
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:07,540
I'm thinking if I sent him my
work and he absolutely hates it,

248
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,810
I completely shot myself in the
foot. I mean, it's, you know,

249
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,060
what happens if it's a
disaster? It's like, okay, yes,

250
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:15,520
I can find on people's advice.
You can't write myself a,

251
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,350
but I'm under this illusion
that perhaps I can.

252
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:20,440
So I had one of those moments
of like, oh my God, literally.

253
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,540
But fortunately there was, we had a happy
ending. Um, because when you did like it,

254
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,950
I read it, the book right
the way through the next day.

255
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:29,050
And I'm getting emails saying,
you know, when you're sending it,

256
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:32,770
when you're sending it. And then she did
send it and thank God he did like it.

257
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,710
And even better, he was able to
sell it, which is also a bonus.

258
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,670
So the first book came out in, I've now
forgotten the year 2016 I think, um,

259
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,060
little bones.
Um,

260
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,580
and that is the story of the baby's
bones in the head with a hammer wedding

261
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:49,930
dress. Um, and that story
really came about because I'm,

262
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:51,970
Stephen came towards him,
his book on writing,

263
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:55,660
which for anybody who is interested
in writing and, um, you know,

264
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,300
wants to go that way.
It's absolutely the Bible.

265
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,750
It is the best book possibly ever
written on writing. It's fantastic.

266
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,060
And every single published author I
know has it on their shelf. Um, so in,

267
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,720
in that book he talks about great story
being the collision of two unrelated

268
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:13,440
ideas,
how he talks about how with books,

269
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,640
how to completely separate ideas came
together and creates the new idea created

270
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,740
story. Um, and that's really what
happened to me with little bones.

271
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:25,630
I'd seen an rt documentary
years ago, um, about, um,

272
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,190
a serving girl or girl who,

273
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,980
who I thought was a serving girl has
turned out she works in a rubber factory.

274
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:33,760
And I went to go do the investigation
who had left Ireland in the 1930s and

275
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:36,970
she'd gone to the UK because she was
pregnant and she wants to hide the

276
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,100
pregnancy.
And um,

277
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,970
she found herself we're living in the
landlady's house or working in a factory

278
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,100
and you know,
unable to cope the situation.

279
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:48,460
And what happened to her was that she
actually had the baby in the middle of the

280
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,950
night in a room that she shared with the
12 year old daughter if her landlady.

281
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,520
Um, and obviously you can
imagine the state she was in. Um,

282
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,360
she went to the bathroom,
sort herself out and when she came back,

283
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:03,290
the baby wasn't breathing. So she wrapped
the baby up. I now know in a blue dress,

284
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,160
cause I went to find all the,

285
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,480
the court details and she put the baby
into a suitcase and put it in under her

286
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:12,980
bed and went back to Ireland a Christmas.
It was just before Christmas,

287
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:14,870
went back to Ireland or
Christmas to talk to her priest.

288
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,690
And in that time that she was away,

289
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,840
the baby's body was discovered and
she was one of the last people to be

290
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:24,860
convicted of infanticide in the UK.
And for some reason this just,

291
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,230
I call them light bulb
moments when you are,

292
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,810
when you see something or you
hear something or you know,

293
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:32,420
you can be as TESCO's looking at some
of these basket or overhear something on

294
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:35,330
the train and you get this little light
bulb moment thinking that's really

295
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:38,660
interesting and that this
thing stuck with me, the baby,

296
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:42,910
the suitcase under the bed. And then
I was driving back from the airports.

297
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,380
Then a few 10 years later,
I think possibly,

298
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,420
and I was put on the radio and
Artie has documentary about, um,

299
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,610
a chap who had written a play
called the country, a dressmaker.

300
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,110
And his play was one of the, one of the
places saved the Abbey Theater from, from,

301
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,120
um, total disaster. And he
had died. He was a very,

302
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:05,990
very successful playwright, but he
died destitute, um, in an apartment,

303
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,960
a little room up in cable
street in Dublin. Um,

304
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,260
and what he'd done is he'd left all his
plays in a suitcase on his bed and there

305
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,360
was a suitcase as the
connection in my mind. Um,

306
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,110
and this is a few years ago now when I
started working on it before they built

307
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,400
the m 50, and they were, I think,

308
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,830
32 sets of traffic lights
between my house in the airport.

309
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,120
So it was a long drive. And on that
long drive, by the time I got home,

310
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,800
I had been thinking about dresses,
had been thinking about dressmakers,

311
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,820
been thinking about unplanned pregnancies,

312
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,800
and I'd come up with the idea that
perhaps, um, the girl, Mable, Agnes Regan,

313
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,780
I think her name was in, uh, in England.

314
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,060
The one thing she wanted was
that was a wedding dress.

315
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,130
And so by the time I arrived home,

316
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,020
the bones were in the
hem of the wedding dress.

317
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,530
Now I didn't know until I was two
thirds the way through that book,

318
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,950
how they actually got there.
I knew they were in there,

319
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,400
had a really clear impression of it.
I had the people starting to map sketch,

320
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,880
sketch out in my head. Um, but I didn't
really know how they got there at all.

321
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,930
And it wasn't until I started writing a
piece of witness testimony in the book,

322
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,680
um, that I realized and I remember
emailing it's Barkley Pet Dallas market,

323
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,440
I know why the bones are in the
wedding dress. And she's like, yes.

324
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,850
And it's funny when you write crime
you have to plot to a certain extent,

325
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:21,590
you have to plan to a certain extent
because of all the things that you know,

326
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:24,080
plots are quite twisted for any
of you have read no turning back,

327
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:27,590
which is the most recent sand lake.
Um, it's quite a complex plot.

328
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,920
There's two or three different storylines
going on in there and making sure that

329
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,550
those things dovetail together
and that the right bits,

330
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,970
the left and the right places as part of
that plotting process. Um, and as I say,

331
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:39,830
I've stolen Alix,
Barclays system of plotting.

332
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:44,330
So I use this columns across the page
and make my notes in it as I go along.

333
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,650
But often with writing and most
importantly with writing is allowing the

334
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:55,470
characters to breed on age and allowing
them to speak to you. And when they do,

335
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:58,770
when they take over the story and when
they start to do things that you don't

336
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:01,920
necessarily expect that some
stories really, really happening.

337
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,180
And that's what happens in little bones.

338
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:07,110
And I found out about the bones and in
fact to no turning back the ending of

339
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,990
know Talia bridger lending know no
turning back. There's totally different,

340
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,140
there was a different,
everything was different about it and um,

341
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,940
it doesn't feel quite right. Um,
I'm a great believer that your,

342
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:20,010
when you write,
you're using your subconscious mind.

343
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,620
And I remember Joseph icon over at an
event I was at was talking about, um,

344
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,770
how the character sort of float in
the ether above your head a bit.

345
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,270
And as a writer you're sort of channeling
them. It's a very strange process.

346
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,190
Um,
but it is a bit like that.

347
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:37,500
It's like they're all actually
out there that every book,

348
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,590
every character and every book is actually
floating around out there somewhere

349
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,320
and they're just waiting to find the
person to channel through to tell their

350
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:48,060
story. Um, and so certainly was
finding when you find cat colony,

351
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:49,460
the detective,
um,

352
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,500
she came to me pretty much fully formed
kickboxing detective and with the

353
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:56,700
various stories,
you,

354
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,170
your subconscious mind is the thing that
really works and if you're going wrong

355
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,480
or, um, people talk about
writer's block a lot,

356
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,660
I really believe that writer's block
is your subconscious mind putting the

357
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:10,290
brakes on. Um, and certainly in my
second book, which is got in deep water,

358
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,690
I got stuck writing that about
two thirds of the way through,

359
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,900
even though I had my plot, worked out,
my plans and all the rest of it. And, um,

360
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,120
I realized I had gone wrong.

361
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,140
And then when I went back to fix the
bit that got where I'd gone wrong,

362
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,300
I realized I'd actually gone
wrong earlier than that even.

363
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,540
So there were two twists
in it, the were wrong. Um,

364
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,720
and I think it's understanding
that is really important.

365
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:34,490
So for anybody who is writing, um,
and does find that they get stuck, um,

366
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,760
there's usually a very good reason for it.

367
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,740
As I was coming in here
on the dark this morning,

368
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:42,030
I've just started a new book and it's
about Sentara stuff happening in London

369
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,790
and I've just realized that the,
um,

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,380
the reason that's not working
as us as something a bit offer,

371
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:48,600
I haven't been able to
work out what it was.

372
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,770
And I think I've got my chemistry wrong.

373
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,500
So I was texting my daughter on
the train coming in and saying,

374
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,850
do you know anybody who's
good at chemistry? I need to
check on me chemicals. Um,

375
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,700
so that's that. I think that's really,
really important element to understand.

376
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,050
But at one of the key things,

377
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,070
one of the key things with writing
I suppose with anything in life, um,

378
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,890
is to just embrace it,

379
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,360
enjoy it and try and try certainly for
new writers to get to the end of the

380
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,100
manuscript, it's, it's really,

381
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:16,890
really important to try and write that
first draft right the way through to the

382
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:18,660
end.
Because very often,

383
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:21,490
and this is sort of I suppose the
scouts end of things speaking, um,

384
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,650
the first three chapters of the manuscript
on really the first three chapters of

385
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:27,480
the book. They're not the
first two chapters. The, you,

386
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,730
the reader will necessarily see,
um,

387
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,100
because it takes a while
to get into the story.

388
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,340
And so it can quite often it can be,
especially with a new writer,

389
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,780
it can take a while for
you to get into the store.

390
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,610
And I know certainly little bones, um,
had a whole long prologue. There's a bit,

391
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,360
it's now, there's one
paragraph in the, in the start,

392
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:47,610
a little bones in the first chapter.
Uh, we're an artist called [inaudible].

393
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,060
He talks about this piece of work that
she's working on and her family and

394
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:53,260
things like that.
And that was the prologue,

395
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:55,790
but that was two and a
half thousand words. Um,

396
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,800
but it was something I needed to write
to find my way into the story. Um,

397
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,020
but it wasn't something that you
necessarily all needed to read.

398
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:04,960
So that has ended up now down as one
paragraph, but it's just very interesting.

399
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,940
One of the absolute crucial
things I suppose to understand
but also to know as a

400
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:13,870
writer is that it's the reshaping
and the rewriting of the manuscript,

401
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,230
which is the bit that makes it happen.
Um, once you get the story down,

402
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:21,100
you lay it down, it can be
a bit of a muddle. It can
be a mess, bits cannot work.

403
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,540
Um, but it's really, um, it's that
reshaping, it's the editing. It's the,

404
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,680
the rewriting that is absolutely crucial
to making it into something that people

405
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:33,670
want to read. So how are we doing
for time in Italia that we were good.

406
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,411
We,
um,

407
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:40,300
so I suppose one of the
key things as well, um,

408
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:44,170
in terms of crime writing it's plot.
Um,

409
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,510
but at the same time,
this character,

410
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,020
which is absolutely essential
unless you have good characters,

411
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,540
why would you want to read on? Um, so
plot plot is very, very important. Coming.

412
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,920
Those two unrelated ideas, um, are,

413
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,400
are absolutely essential to try
and bring them together. Um, but,

414
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,150
but story is all about character and you
need to be able to empathize and really

415
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:07,570
love that character in order to want to
read the story. Because as an author,

416
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,600
I'm asking you not only as part
with your cash to buy my book,

417
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,380
but I'm asking you to part with that sort
of six or seven hours of your time. Um,

418
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,940
and that's an important contract. So in
order to deliver a story and to deliver,

419
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,600
um, something that makes you want
to keep turning those pages, um,

420
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,740
character is absolutely vital.

421
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:26,560
And understanding your characters and
knowing them as really, really important.

422
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,050
Um, and characters change, they develop,

423
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,330
they can develop while
you're writing the book. Um,

424
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:33,880
I was blessed with cat colony
because she came fully formed.

425
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,970
And one of the things about
writing theories is that it's,

426
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,410
when you go back to the next story,

427
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:41,440
it's a bit like going to meet your friends
in the pub because you know them so

428
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:46,000
well, you know what they're going to say
and sort of the, the cost if you like,

429
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,310
is already there. So it's a bit
like writing a Sitcom, isn't it,

430
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:52,990
where you know everybody already and then
you just have to apply the story. Um,

431
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:56,150
so writing a series is fantastic from
a writer's point of view because you

432
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:59,290
couldn't really get into the sort of
the plotting end of things. And I think,

433
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm hoping I get better with each book
and I think no turning back is probably

434
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:05,920
one of the best so far. Um, but
literally book I've just written, um,

435
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:09,640
and hopefully will be coming out towards
the end of this year or early next year.

436
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,050
Um, it's a whole new cast
as a standalone. And, um,

437
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,680
so that meant a whole new set of
characters, a whole new story. Um,

438
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,910
it's about two women who meet our plane,
um,

439
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:22,480
and discover that they have men in their
lives who aren't doing everything they

440
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,910
should for them, um, and that they
can help each other out a bit, um,

441
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,550
to right the wrongs. Um, and that's
a whole new, whole new set of people.

442
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,020
Um, and again, it's, it's, it's developing
those people. It's getting to know them.

443
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:38,080
It's knowing their background
and names where they come from,

444
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,040
all of the things that make you, you. Um,
and I think for anybody who's writing,

445
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,480
I always think one of those,
you know,

446
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:47,210
when you meet somebody for the first
time and you form where we talk about

447
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:47,601
psychologists,

448
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:50,570
so it's about where do you form an
opinion in the first 30 seconds of meeting

449
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:53,250
somebody, what does it do you
see? You maybe see the, hey,

450
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:54,740
you see what color jumper they're wearing.

451
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,230
You might make assumptions
about them from their footwear,

452
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,820
Sherlock Holmes fanatic, but he was
always looking at people's shoes. Um,

453
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,250
and they're the impressions
that you form with character.

454
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:08,660
So it's very important when
certainly for me as a writer, um,

455
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,790
to get a feel for those characters,
to know what they look like.

456
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,780
I use storyboards and, um, I go around
the Internet and I go to magazines.

457
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:16,340
I find pictures of the characters,

458
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,490
the people who look like the
people who are in my head. Um,

459
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,410
and they can come from all
sorts of strange places.

460
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,620
The sample poor guy from New
York who's on Tinder and I not,

461
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:26,270
not where I used to enter subsea.
I'm happily married,

462
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:30,230
but I'm who I found on the search who
is the spirit of one of my characters in

463
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,550
the next book.
So he's up there too,

464
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,900
so they can come from
anywhere and they're just,

465
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,800
there's just like a private
reference point for me. Um,

466
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,870
and I find that really
useful. Particular, I suppose,

467
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:41,510
cause I'm busy because I'm working and
I'm doing the various bits and pieces

468
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:45,250
with the, um, running quell and
helping you rice all the time. Um,

469
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:50,120
and moving around a lot. Um, I don't, I,
I don't get to write every single day.

470
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,300
I mean biters talk about writing every
day and that that's really important,

471
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,080
but it's not always feasible.
Um,

472
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,090
I try and write as often as I can
and try and stay in the story,

473
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:02,570
but I find storyboards are really
useful for me because I've got a visual

474
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:06,770
representation of who everybody is and I
stick that I have make up a big a three

475
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:10,430
one. And it's partly as procrastination
because I think as an author,

476
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:13,340
when you start off with a story and you've
got this big blank thing in front of

477
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:13,910
you,

478
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,490
you spend a lot of time not actually
writing anything and just knowing that you

479
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:17,720
should be doing something.
But anyway,

480
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,650
I spent a lot of time at historicals
and I put them on my desk and that means

481
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:23,590
that those characters are
calling out to me. So whenever,

482
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,190
wherever else I'm doing that,

483
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:29,030
those people are there looking
at me and I'm literally saying,

484
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,530
come tell my story. Um, and I really,
really, I find those that are really,

485
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:37,910
really useful part of the process.
Um, so we've, where we go to questions

486
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,640
perspective or an unpublished writer,
everything looks really,

487
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:47,360
really bad. Uh, so the first question is
like, how do you actually stop writing?

488
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:50,890
Because every time you're finished
vizio draft it Kinda looks good,

489
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:52,060
but then you read a book,

490
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,480
like you read a really good book and
you look at your draft and it's awful.

491
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,890
You start writing again, it never stops.
You sent it to an editor at Detroit,

492
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,100
gives you back the comments you've
worked on Samhsa trust looks good,

493
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:06,550
but then you look again at it in
a month's time. It's awful again.

494
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,060
And the second question is,
uh,

495
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:16,150
given first, right and like
everyone a thrust frightened
is soft. It's, it's fine.

496
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:18,820
Like y'all need to
improve and work on what,

497
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,690
what do you do with your first
trust to just touch them off to you?

498
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:26,550
Like is there any reason to self
publish those? Is there any uh,

499
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,790
reason to send them to magazines
or whatever? Like what do you do?

500
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:34,940
Visit first draft that you know, there
are like in your head like, so sorry,

501
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,990
your children, you've walked
in down force such a long time.

502
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,480
What do we do with them?
How do you give them up?

503
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,920
I think the first thing is to
try and work on your book, um,

504
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,600
until you can't see anything else wrong
with that. So you got to a point, yes,

505
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:49,860
because that is the whole point.

506
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:52,360
The whole process is that every time you
go back and you see something else you

507
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:56,430
want to fix, so keep working on it.
And it might be a long process. I mean,

508
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:59,110
I said I started writing in 1999.
Um,

509
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,720
it took me 15 years now to actually get
a deal. Now it was five bucks later. Um,

510
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,020
but um, it was a long time. Um,

511
00:27:06,021 --> 00:27:09,750
and the best advice I was ever given
was just keep writing and you only get

512
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:11,130
better.
Going back to Malcolm Gladwell,

513
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,910
you only get better through writing and
you only find your voice through writing.

514
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:15,451
Writing,

515
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:19,870
I'm also publishing is always looking
for what's called voice unique voice. Um,

516
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,710
we don't need another J K Rowling. It
doesn't mean we don't need another swab.

517
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,020
We'd love to have another deck here
early and a lot of the Stephen King but

518
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:27,000
didn't, I mean we've already got
one so we don't need another one.

519
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:32,001
So finding your voice and your unique
voice is really important and you only do

520
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:36,330
that literally through putting words
on the page. Um, so in terms of drafts,

521
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,840
the rewriting is vital.
That polishing process is vital.

522
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,220
I think you have to just keep on going
until you cannot see anything else that

523
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:45,031
needs to be changed.

524
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,700
When you get to the point where you just
don't know what else you can do to it

525
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:51,750
to make it better. And that can be a long,
long time. It could be 10 drafts later.

526
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:56,250
I mean I'm, I'm on what book
published book for now. I'm
just, I've just finished,

527
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:57,330
I'm onto the next one.

528
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,510
I've written probably four or
five complete books before that.

529
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:05,511
So I'm looking at having written nine
books of 100,000 words each and I still on

530
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:08,850
the book I have to sent in its draft six.
So it's,

531
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:12,720
so that drafting process is
vital all the way through. Um,

532
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,550
so when you get to the point
where you can't say anymore,

533
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,870
you don't know what else to do to it,

534
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:20,871
then then the opportunity then as an
option to get professional help and see if

535
00:28:21,181 --> 00:28:23,910
you can get somebody like an editor
to read it and try and improve it.

536
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,050
If you get to the point then where you
think it's, it's done, it's ready to go,

537
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,640
it's at that point,
then send it out.

538
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,060
Absolute is publishers to agents
and see how you get on with it.

539
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,500
The thing with self publishing,

540
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,100
self publishing is wonderful
because you can actually find,

541
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:41,340
you can get out there, you can
get books out there, those drafts.

542
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,361
At the end of the day,

543
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:44,850
there's an awful lot of writers in the
world and there are only so many books

544
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:46,280
that can be published.
Um,

545
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:49,080
and so there's always going to be more
writers than there are people with the

546
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,690
capacity to publish.
So I think self publishing is amazing.

547
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:54,240
I know some people who have been
incredibly successful at it.

548
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,750
The key is that you need
to see it as a job, um,

549
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,110
and approach it very professionally and
understand that the marketing and the

550
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:04,230
editing and the cover needs to be to
professional standards because you're

551
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:07,770
competing with, you know, published
books out there on the shelf.

552
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:12,060
So it's all about learning that whole
process. Um, so self publishing is great.

553
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:12,811
Yes,
absolutely.

554
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:16,740
If you send it out and you can't land
an agent and you can't land a publishing

555
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,440
deal with it necessarily,
absolutely self published,

556
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:20,370
I sell probably one of my books,

557
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:23,670
I wrote a romance and in Romancey
there wasn't really crime,

558
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,580
sort of dark romancey thing
called true colors. And um,

559
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,370
I'd had that had another agent long,

560
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:33,230
long time ago and she sent it out and
I got what we call rave rejections.

561
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,850
Self published the wall, everybody, cause
I'm ready for rejections where somebody,

562
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:39,960
they love your book. Um, but nobody
can find a place fresh or they can't,

563
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:43,150
they're not actually quite in a position
to buy it even though they love it. And,

564
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,810
um, I felt that that was a great book and
I decided and I'll get out there and to

565
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:50,770
see, you know, absolutely self
publish it too. Um, so there's,

566
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,770
and there's different these days,
there are different routes for writers,

567
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:58,060
so you can be a hybrid, right? You can
do both. Um, so absolutely send it out,

568
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,300
work on it till you can not see any more
things that can be improved then get

569
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:05,710
professional help,
then send it out.

570
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,830
If it's still not jelling
with that particular book,

571
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,660
then absolutely look
at self publishing it.

572
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,290
The key was self publishing is
that again, as I say, you're,

573
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,130
you're competing with the
publish books that are out there.

574
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:19,610
So it needs to be of the highest possible
standard that you can get it. Um,

575
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,460
and you can't take back negative reviews.
You know,

576
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,820
if it goes out on Amazon and you know,
there's,

577
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,220
we haven't had a proof read and
there's masters of Typos in it,

578
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,710
somebody's going to tell you
and you can't change that.

579
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:33,300
So it's really important to be as
professional as you can about it. Um,

580
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,230
but it's an exciting world.
I think as,

581
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,790
as one of the most exciting things about
writing is the fact that, you know,

582
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,610
you can do anything, you don't know
where it's going to take you. Um,

583
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,820
publishing's always looking for something
original that's looking for a new

584
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:48,670
voice. It's looking for a new concept. Um,

585
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,510
they're looking for authors,
Debbie authors that they can build,

586
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,110
they can put marketing behind. Um,
and you know, to break you out.

587
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:57,880
So they're looking at was for
what's called a breakout book,

588
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:00,190
which is a big story if you can,
if you can do that.

589
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,640
And sometimes I think it's important
for people to understand it.

590
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:05,290
Sometimes it isn't your first book
that gets published quite often.

591
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:09,750
Your first book is that learning
ground. You know, it's, you
know, if we started, um,

592
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,530
the back to the 10,000 hours,
I'm,

593
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:16,090
a friend of mine has a great analogy
when she talks about playing football and

594
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:19,390
how you guys all learned, we all learned
football in school and, you know,

595
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,110
people go out, you know, kids go out and
they kick a ball around on the green,

596
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:26,320
outside the house, put the
jumpers down for goalposts. Um,

597
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,800
but none of those people expect to go
and play out play for AC Milan and the

598
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,050
next morning. You know, and I think
one of the things with writing,

599
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:34,870
certainly all the things I did
with that first book way back when,

600
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,810
was that when you write,
you think it's going to be the book,

601
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,140
it's fantastic and it's amazing and that
you're going to be out there playing

602
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:41,974
for AC Milan.

603
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,510
But it's that learning process that
takes time and you're doing all the right

604
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:49,960
things if you're keeping redrafting and
you're doing absolutely all the right

605
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:53,680
things. So just have to keep on going.
Just keep writing the best advice.

606
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,090
I have a quick question about
your writing process. Um,

607
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,320
would you usually write every day for
force yourself to write everyday or would

608
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:09,481
you perhaps wait for when you're inspired
and would you also wrote in the right

609
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:13,570
order or would you maybe write
a random dialogue for example?

610
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,850
I think that's a really good
question actually because I'm,

611
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,870
I'm a really organized person and I
need to write in a linear fashion.

612
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,840
So I have to start at the beginning
of the book. And end at the end. Um,

613
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,970
other friends of mine don't
write that at that at all.

614
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I don't know how they do rich,

615
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:28,300
but they are obviously their minds
work in a completely different way.

616
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,550
And they would write like a scene.

617
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:32,140
Like if they suddenly want
to write a fight scene,

618
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:35,020
they'd write that from the end and then
something else from the beginning and

619
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:38,680
then they put it all together. Um, I,

620
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:42,020
I use tool called scrivener and quite a
lot of authors use scrubbing up and to

621
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:43,160
collect the bits together.

622
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,250
I actually just use it for my research
so that I can put stuff into files and

623
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:49,340
then find them again. Um, and um,

624
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:51,800
so if you do write in
that out of order way,

625
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:53,580
then that can be a really useful tool.
Um,

626
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,200
personally I write in a very
linear fashion, um, and I
do try and write every day,

627
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,860
but it doesn't always
happen. Um, I think about,

628
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,190
I think you think about your book all
the time when you're working on it. So,

629
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,680
like I was saying, coming out in
the dark, I wasn't actually writing,

630
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:08,790
but I was doing some,
I was plotting in my head,

631
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:12,110
I was thinking trying to work out
where I was going with the story. Um,

632
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:15,470
and I think as a writer it's always
there with you and it needs to be always

633
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:19,820
there with you. I remember
somebody emailed me once
and, um, long, long time ago,

634
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:22,790
and she said, Oh yeah, I'm going on
holiday so I'm going to take, you know,

635
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,631
I won't be taking the book.

636
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,730
I won't be able to work on that because
I'm going on holiday. And I thought, well,

637
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,980
if you're a writer,
you write all the time.

638
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:32,300
I drive my family marriage cause I write
on holiday and I, it's my thing. I love,

639
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:36,380
it's the thing I love to do most.
And um, so I, yeah, so I sit there,

640
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,290
I get up at six o'clock in the morning
when I'm on holiday and that to me it's a

641
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,900
couple of hours typing away
as the thing to do. Um, yeah.

642
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:45,370
So I try and write everyday. If
I'm not writing every day, I um,

643
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,070
I'm thinking about it when you're
under deadline is different and should,

644
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,780
one of the key,

645
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,480
I suppose one of the crucial things is
that when you don't have a contract,

646
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:55,580
when you're an unpublished
writer as I was,

647
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,510
you have the luxury of time and it's
really difficult to recognize that because

648
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:01,490
you're desperate to get published
in a desperate to get the deal.

649
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,450
But you have the absolute luxury of time
you can spend as long as it takes and

650
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:08,220
make that book the best that it can be.
If it's not that book,

651
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:11,210
it might be the next book or the
next book, the next book, but that,

652
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,430
that you've got all the time
in the world to do that.

653
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,660
When you get under contract and you
something get deadlines and you suddenly

654
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:20,960
find that actually your,
your you've written book won.

655
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,780
Cause that was fine that you have that
written and then all of a sudden you've

656
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,270
got to write book too.
Um,

657
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,130
and then you've got to come up with an
idea for book three and then you might be

658
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:30,590
launching. What happened to me
was I was launching book too,

659
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:33,190
and trying to finish book
three at the same time. Um,

660
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,190
and suddenly you might have to write,
I had to write 30,000 words in nine days,

661
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,710
wants to get book three finishers as
partly what they end and had to be

662
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:43,970
completely rewritten. But, um, you,
you just, it's a whole different world.

663
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,970
So I think enjoy that time. And um, yeah,
so when I'm under contract and when,

664
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,420
when you're an entrepreneur,
you're under deadline.

665
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,230
It's much more every day it's like
this is the thing I've got to do. Um,

666
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,951
and it actually,

667
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:59,240
it helps if you're in the zone and you
can stay and it's much more than trying

668
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:01,460
to write bits and pieces,
but you do train yourself.

669
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:05,720
I think you train yourself to write,
to suit your lifestyle.

670
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,150
So,
um,

671
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,020
I wrote at least 2000 words and one of
the books on plane to Frankfurt Book Fair,

672
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,080
um, leaves here at what, seven
o'clock in the morning. So it was,

673
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,880
it was an early start. And, um, you know,
I've written on trains, I write and cafes,

674
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:22,010
I write everywhere and
noise doesn't bother me.

675
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,830
One of the things I do
do is I have a sour,

676
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,370
tend to have a soundtrack for each book.

677
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,470
So Cat Conley is obviously 24 a lot
younger than me. She listens to pop music.

678
00:35:30,471 --> 00:35:33,080
She's, she's 24 year olds. So I have a,

679
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,710
like whatever's in the charts
is her soundtrack at the time.

680
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:40,530
So I would make a soundtrack for each
book and I plug my earphones in and stick

681
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:41,364
them in and they,

682
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,820
that helps drown out everything else
that's going on in my head as well as the

683
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:46,680
noise around me. Um, so that,

684
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:49,530
it means I can really focus on the book
and when I hear that sound than I know

685
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:54,330
I'm in the zone for writing. This book
is about a woman who was an ex ballerina,

686
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:58,080
so it's the Moscow symphony and I'm,
and I'm using that for, for this one,

687
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:59,100
for the soundtrack,
for this one.

688
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:01,050
The next book I done all of
that soundtracks going to be,

689
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,550
I know you're just starting it,
so we'll wait and see.

690
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,990
But I find that enormously useful
because it just, it helps. Helps. Yeah.

691
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,600
Look out,
look out the sound at wherever you are,

692
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,630
but also what's going on
in your head. Um, yeah,

693
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:16,470
so I think in one of the things about
writing is that it's really worth

694
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:20,610
listening to writers, lots of
different writers because we all do,

695
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,630
we all do the same thing and we
all use bits of the same technique,

696
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:26,850
but we all have developed
them in our own way.

697
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,010
And there's no right or wrong way to,
right.

698
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,350
So some people write
bits all over the place,

699
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:34,320
some people write organically and
they don't plot. Some friends of mine,

700
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:39,321
Monica Mcinerney wrote and her telling
me she about 40,000 words of a book and

701
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,520
in totally the wrong direction,

702
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,570
it was complete a complete like bull
wrong cause you had to literally delete

703
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:49,350
40,000 that's half a book. Right?
But in that for staff and words,

704
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:51,960
there were a couple of paragraphs
which are absolutely crucial to the

705
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:52,860
progression of the plot.

706
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,380
And she wouldn't have found if she
hadn't written the 40,000 words.

707
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,320
So nothing is ever wasted in writing.
You know,

708
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:00,780
it might be that you write a book
and it never sees the light of day,

709
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:04,770
but it's not what not wasted because
you've used that time and you'll create,

710
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,730
mine has been working on it. Um, and
you know, it's, it's really, really,

711
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:11,580
really vital. So, yeah, so
technique listened to writers,

712
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,150
find out how everybody else does it,
find out what works for you,

713
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:19,710
and then you can, um, you can draw in
and devise your own way of doing things.

714
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,890
Um, that works with your lifestyle. Some
people have little kids and they can't,

715
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,100
you know, they can only write.
I used to, I mean, right, Jim,

716
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:28,260
my daughter's nap time and my daughter
would only sleep for 20 minutes at a time.

717
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:31,650
So I think I learned quite early on
to 20 minutes. And when you've got,

718
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:34,280
when you've only got 20 minutes,
it's amazing what you can do. Um,

719
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,550
you block everything else
out. So, uh, yeah, everybody's
different. But yeah. Find,

720
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:39,600
find the way that works for you.

721
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,060
You mentioned the luxury of time and
still young in my district for 13 years.

722
00:37:48,061 --> 00:37:51,860
So what's your advice for someone who
just wants to get thing out there but it

723
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:55,530
doesn't want to be dealing with loads and
loads of details like cover design. Oh,

724
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:57,390
ESPN this thing,
that thing.

725
00:37:57,391 --> 00:38:02,160
Some other detail as most Googlers.
Just want to get a tech out there.

726
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,450
Dot. Not really interested in making
a whole bunch of cash out of it. Okay.

727
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,433
It's like got a day job.

728
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,440
You want people to read it. Yeah.
Okay. So if you want people to read it,

729
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:12,750
then you can't, there are lots of
companies who do all that for you,

730
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,110
so you don't have to
worry about any of this.

731
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,790
You just go to one of them and
they will that professional. Um,

732
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,960
I can give you the names as a couple,
two or here in Ireland are very good.

733
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,590
They come back from trade backgrounds
and they understand the business. Um,

734
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,750
but things like, um, yeah,
getting a good cover. Um,

735
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,070
it's crucial because that's how it reads,
recognizes a book. You know yourself,

736
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:30,810
when you go into a bookshop,
you pick the book up,

737
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:34,350
depending what the couple of sites
turn over and lead the back to open it,

738
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,940
read those first few paragraphs.
So those things have only really,

739
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,410
really important. Um,
so yeah, if you, if you,

740
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:42,460
you're at that point where you
don't want to be bothered with it,

741
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:45,880
the doings of the makings that,
but you've done that,

742
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,200
you've already done
your best and making so,

743
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,690
and I think I would probably just get a
company to one of the companies to come

744
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:52,880
who do that professionally to do it
and they'll do it properly for you and

745
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:56,450
they'll, they'll get your
great cover, they'll help you
with a blurb, um, and then,

746
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:59,800
and then you can still self published.
So you're still doing it yourself. Um,

747
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,640
but do send out to the trade first,
you know,

748
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:03,710
do get it again and there
just to have a look at it.

749
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,120
I'll get a reader's report done on it.

750
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,290
So you know that what you've got
there is the right bit. Um, and then,

751
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:13,750
and do look at, think about another
story too. You know, that the,

752
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:18,410
I suppose that's really important is that
if you are, um, everybody's different.

753
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,260
I mean like maybe you only want to write
one book and that's fantastic because

754
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:22,390
you have obviously,
um,

755
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,510
and actually getting to the end is a
massive achievement because there are lots

756
00:39:26,511 --> 00:39:28,820
of people who want to write books and not
very many people actually finish them.

757
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,590
Um, but, um, if you are writing and
you finish one book can keep thinking,

758
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:35,810
think about the second one
because if you do get a contract,

759
00:39:35,811 --> 00:39:39,130
it won't be for one book, it be
for a minimum of two. And um,

760
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,110
you need to have that,
that next idea really should go,

761
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:42,170
it will make a huge difference.

762
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:46,140
We'll help you with this awful contract
deadline look. Um, so, um, yes,

763
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:47,660
I do keep writing, but no, absolutely.

764
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:51,620
People can help you out and
get it out there for you. Um,
but do you know, get, get.

765
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:51,831
Yeah,

766
00:39:51,831 --> 00:39:55,060
it's hard when you've spent a lot time
working on things to do starting today.

767
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,430
If you enjoyed that process, start
thinking about the next one, move on.

768
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:00,610
Hmm.

769
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,810
You usually give really good advice as
to those who are in the beginning of the

770
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:08,530
process and they really like
the idea about the storyboard.

771
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,780
So how it usually works,
for example,

772
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:15,430
it's like a detectives in crime movies.
Do this by thinking,

773
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:18,960
searching, put in together,
all the pieces for it. How,

774
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:21,790
how you would recommend
to use the storyboard.

775
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:26,740
Okay. Well I do, I, so I get the pictures
of the people and then the locations.

776
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:31,070
I spend a lot of time looking. I'm, I'm
uh, cause I'm a detailed person. Um,

777
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:34,600
I like to be in control of everything
and I'm really into the whole getting

778
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:39,220
everything right. Um, so I
would go to find the locations.

779
00:40:39,221 --> 00:40:41,200
I try and visit the locations.
If I writing about them.

780
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,590
I try and use places I've been.
So if it's inside of somebodies apartment,

781
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:46,000
I've been to the apartment and I,

782
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:50,310
but I do go onto these property websites
and I get people's floor plans. Um,

783
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,021
and I,
you know,

784
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:53,650
in the interior shops are different
people's houses and I put those into my

785
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,460
storyboard.

786
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,250
So it just means then if I'm writing
about somebody going into the living room,

787
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,020
um,
I don't forget that actually they can,

788
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,480
what they can see out
the window or I forget,

789
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,210
don't forget that the kitchen's off
this particular room as opposed to a

790
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,310
different one. Um, in theory,

791
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:07,990
when you get to the point where
when you're going to bring,

792
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,200
you have a copy editor looking at your
book and that sort of final editorial

793
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,750
process, they'll notice like if
eight people went into the left,

794
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:18,490
only four people came out, but,
um, or somebody is pregnant
for nine for 14 months,

795
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:22,690
I think one of my friends managed. Um,
but, uh, those, those type of details,

796
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,530
I think a great for a story board because
particularly locations because then

797
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:29,260
you can see where your people are.
Um,

798
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,290
I've got one character who I
think might live on a houseboat.

799
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,570
And so because we're very close to
grand canal dock has spent a lot of time

800
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:38,060
walking around Grand Canal dock,
getting pictures of houseboats,

801
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:41,180
trying to find the right layout for the
house, both for the story that I wanted.

802
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,530
And um,
I've got,

803
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:45,650
so I've got a whole houseboat lay out
on my and pitches of Grand Canal and

804
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,100
different places where they might have
stayed on my storyboard. Yeah. So,

805
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,500
so I just find them really
useful. I mean, in the film,

806
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:56,501
obviously people plot out the actual story
on storyboards and they use them for,

807
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,360
you know, an animation stuff. You
use them to actually tell the story.

808
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,070
But I just tend to have a static one,

809
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:04,940
which has like locations and sometimes
the dressmaker had bits of lace on it

810
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:08,090
from wedding dress and it
had, um, a deck of cards.

811
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:11,260
I think I had stuck on it and all sorts
of bits of just bits that were just,

812
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,450
I felt we were going to go into
the stories pooling the, I suppose,

813
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,040
the creator place. Yeah.
So by phone renucell

814
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,210
thank you very much. Uh, I
think, uh, that's all for today.

815
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,020
I really appreciate it. It was,
I think, very inspiring story.

816
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:31,021
And the toe is good when you can talk
to a person who has already a success

817
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:34,990
Korea and who can also share some
advices and does that give some tips and

818
00:42:34,991 --> 00:42:39,160
tricks and although small exercises
that are quite useful for many people,

819
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:40,270
thank you so much.
Bye.

820
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:45,710
Okay.
