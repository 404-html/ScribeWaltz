1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,840
Thank you for coming and thank Google
for providing a forum that people like me

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,700
making sure our ideas. So, um,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,770
first I want to do is tell you a little
bit about the ad. My pace series.

4
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:20,930
This was the first book in case
you guys did not see it. And, uh,

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,100
what caused me to be,

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,240
what caused me to start with at my pace
with this whole idea was at the time

7
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:30,320
Cheryl Sandburg and had
her lean conversation and
everybody was running with

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,860
lean in except for a fair chunk of my
friends. And people I knew who fell.

9
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:37,390
It didn't apply to them. And
the question was, is there,

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,780
is there a story to be told about women
who aren't on the Autobahn going full

11
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:42,620
speed ahead?

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Is there a story to be told about those
people who have a windy road with starts

13
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:51,620
and stops who were enjoying
life in a different kind of way?

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,180
And I could not find a book out there
that, uh, laid credence to that.

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,210
And so I decided that we
would write that book.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,300
And I had is my model and the back of
my mind that this I believe series.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,840
Does anybody know this? I believe, um,
it's really worth checking out some time.

18
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:10,220
So there are 500 word,

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,600
a very pithy pieces on different topics
that the high school students oftentimes

20
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:19,730
read. And you get a chance to see the
world. Too many different people's eyes.

21
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:24,380
But I knew that 500 words would not
capture the topics I was looking at.

22
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:26,480
So I said,
let's bump it up to a thousand words.

23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,510
Let me do some guidelines
and let me help people.

24
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:33,020
I wanted people who were famous and
people who don't typically, right?

25
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,740
I wanted to get those voices out there.
It's the voices of the people that we,

26
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,210
most of us interact with every day.
Uh,

27
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,220
and I had the goal was to see the world
through many different perspectives and

28
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,370
the end of the day to
expand the conversation.

29
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:49,520
So that time it was about leaning
in and the woman's journey,

30
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:51,980
which I since have learned it,
have been the woman's journey.

31
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,820
It should of been the journey because
we all have the same challenges of how

32
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:57,210
we're going to do it.
Um,

33
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,260
and then at the end of it all and some
way in that process we would discover

34
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:03,090
something about ourselves
and find some truth. Uh,

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,460
that would mean something to us and why
it's at my pace is because even though

36
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,860
we live in a fast paced society,

37
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,000
finding out these truths or working our
way through these issues doesn't happen

38
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,580
that quickly.
It's some organic process.

39
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:20,000
And my hope was that these books would
help foster a conversation that would get

40
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:23,630
us to that place that we can
feel good about the topic.

41
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,820
So that was the first book.
Um,

42
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:29,960
I continue to give lots of
discussions with groups on that. Um,

43
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,020
but the second book, so then what
was happening was I was thinking,

44
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,670
is there another book in me?

45
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,420
And My mother was in her 91st year of
life and she wasn't doing that well.

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,290
And so she lived in Denver and I was
applying and see her every five or six

47
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,500
weeks I would be there.
I was always driving her crazy with,

48
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,520
are you drinking enough,

49
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:54,050
are you eating enough and it has a PT
going and just like you're teenagers can

50
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:55,940
sort of shut you down and sort of turn.

51
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,790
She was basically in not
wanting to engage in that.

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,480
So I decided I would change
the conversation and I
wrote her a piece on one

53
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:07,450
lesson I took from her
life and its impact on me.

54
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,050
And that lesson was about
continuous lifelong learning.

55
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,450
In her eighties she was
still taking classes. Uh,

56
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,000
she had very young classmates in her
class. One of the, one of the classes,

57
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:23,160
they gave her a rolling backpack because
they were afraid that she would fall as

58
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,960
she tried to carry these books.
And uh,

59
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,450
so there's my mother's rolling
backpack that even in her eighties,

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,710
she's taking classes. And I
realize that for me, I'm always,

61
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,930
I wasn't always working on my own.

62
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:39,310
I worked in different
established companies and I
was always told how curious I

63
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,270
was, you know, that I,

64
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,780
and I think that curiosity and that
wanting to learn came from her.

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,470
So I wrote my piece and then she
loved it. And then I thought, well,

66
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,580
this is going to be my next book.

67
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:52,450
I'm going to go ask people to write a
piece on their mother. Only one lesson,

68
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:56,380
not 10 story based and
it cannot be mushy gushy.

69
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,990
That was just me cause I'm
not a big mushy gushy fan,

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,340
so it turns out that mushy gushy was
really not that much in the cards anyway

71
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,170
because people have very complex
feelings about their mothers.

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,000
Oftentimes, not always oftentimes. So I'm
going to show you the cover of the book.

73
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:17,230
This was the cover as you have it there
and my question to you is what do you

74
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:20,890
think?
I was thinking when I had a fledgling,

75
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,300
what they flower and a mother
bird looking down what?

76
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:26,680
What do you think was in my thoughts?

77
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,370
Okay, I'm going to help you guys.
Why Was it judgment. Gratitude.

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,650
Yeah.
I wanted this,

79
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,210
this fledgling had a flower and to me
was a sign of giving back a saying thank

80
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:46,800
you. Now it turns out that
sometimes it's not a flower.

81
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,840
Sometimes it's an olive branch.

82
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,900
Sometimes is putting your mother and
context and being able to explain her to

83
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:58,140
yourself and being able to
validate that relationship.

84
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,160
And I mentioned that I have guidelines
when I go through this with contributors

85
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,720
and this guideline,
I said,

86
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:08,010
you may not discuss your mom if it turns
out that you cannot get to that place,

87
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,040
that you can put her in context and
appreciate her then it's not the book for

88
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:17,430
you. And some people couldn't. I had
a one woman who wrote me and she said,

89
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:20,820
I've tried three times to write my piece.
It is still a rant.

90
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,780
So I thank you cause I'm
going to see a therapist now.

91
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,920
And I had um,
we were just talking about dogs.

92
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:32,940
I have a dog that I love dearly and I
went to take him to my groomer. I said,

93
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,910
oh by the way, I got this book, how
would you like one of these books?

94
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,010
And she's like, it's
about mom from like, Yep,

95
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,340
I have a really complicated
relationship with my mom. I'm like,

96
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,040
well you don't have to take it.
No, no worries. I was just, Oh,

97
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,440
I'll take you to them. I've been a
customer should probably felt obliged.

98
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,690
And then when I came
back the next go around,

99
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:52,440
she said to me that was so meaningful
because I have never been at peace with my

100
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:56,220
mom. I read the book, I wrote
a piece, she and I cried.

101
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:59,810
It was a very healing moment.
So I had a lot of things like that happen.

102
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,580
So what I want to do today is two things.

103
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:06,560
I want to talk about the flower and the
olive branch. The people who were just,

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,180
you know, had, uh,

105
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,410
sort of sheer appreciation
and the olive branch,

106
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,890
the people who really had to struggle
to put their mother in context.

107
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,460
And I give you guys a feeling I would
get my reading glasses so I can actually

108
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,170
read a little bit, uh, and give,

109
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,350
give you guys a feeling for what I
heard and what I took away from it all.

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,790
So we want to hear all of
branches or flowers first.

111
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,630
Okay. If you guys aren't voting, I'm
going from flowers. All right. So, um,

112
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,240
there's a story here called rough,

113
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,370
rough patch and rough patch is run by
Laurel Lloyd is a woman whose mother,

114
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:48,020
when she was young, all she wanted
to do was drama. Now her parents,

115
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:52,200
one was a teacher when was a nurse
and she lived in that stage of,

116
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,790
of living where parents seem to be able
to actually dictate what their kids did.

117
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,210
And so her parents said to her,
you can do drama on the side,

118
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,860
but you're not going to do that.
You're going to be a teacher.

119
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:03,170
That's a nice solid career.
You can support yourself.

120
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,090
So she taught but she didn't like it and
she ended up reverting back to drama.

121
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,420
And that's what she did. And then
one summer when she was doing drama,

122
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,510
she met what would become
her husband on the stage.

123
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,990
At the end of the summer they were engaged
and they then went ahead and had four

124
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:18,824
kids.

125
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,970
They left New York City and they headed
to Vermont and they raised their kids in

126
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:25,970
a very small town in Vermont.
He had a small hardware store.

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,440
She was a mom who did PTA and girl scouts.

128
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,760
And sort of additional role.

129
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,820
She didn't have too much time to
act on almost no time, a little bit.

130
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:39,821
Occasionally he was still doing acting
on the side and Laurel remembered that's

131
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,900
somewhere in the 20 year
mark of their marriage.

132
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:45,070
They hit this rough patch and uh,

133
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,580
at 23 years in their marriage they get
divorced when he was onstage and one of

134
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:51,920
his shows,
he met an actress.

135
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,720
They fell in love and that was
the end of his marriage to his,

136
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,350
to his wife. So Laurel
describes that moment. Um,

137
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,110
when she says about her mother,
she felt rejected and alone.

138
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,770
But at age 50,
she picked herself up and move forward.

139
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,570
In the years that followed,

140
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,260
my mother acted in multiple
theaters outside of our town.

141
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,390
She got a degree in counseling,

142
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,310
worked as a counselor and I local high
school and at a local shelter with teens,

143
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,730
she became the caretaker of a refugee
Guatemalan family helping to raise five

144
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:32,600
children while working at a, at
a Benedictine monastery. In time,

145
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:36,350
her relationship with my dad healed
and they often shattered when seen each

146
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,420
other in town.
Now,

147
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:41,720
the weird thing is that Laurel
telling the story as an adult,

148
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,870
she was married for 20 years,

149
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,730
hit the same rough patch and literally
23 years into her marriage at age 50,

150
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,320
she gets divorced.

151
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,890
Actually divorce goes through on the
exact day of what would have been her

152
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,950
parents' anniversary.

153
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,150
And so she's feeling all over again like
remembering her mother and the pain and

154
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:06,480
she got, she described,
um, with a young daughter.

155
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,350
It was inevitable that I'd be seen my ex
and eventually his wife because her ex

156
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:14,580
also had a, uh, had a new
woman who actually lived,

157
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:17,330
moved into the house.
What that Laura moved out of a,

158
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,830
so I braced myself and
put my best foot forward.

159
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,770
I went back to work and
began to rebuild my life.

160
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,440
Five years since our split, my ex and
I have moved beyond our difficult time.

161
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,210
My goal during the hurt of the divorce
was that we would find our way back to a

162
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:36,060
positive place and it has happened.

163
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,510
I even had Thanksgiving dinner at my
former home this past year with my ex,

164
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,560
his wife, her ex, their son, my daughter.

165
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,610
And some other guests. And then
she shakes includes, she said, my,

166
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,720
my friend stifled a gasp when I told her
I'd be having Thanksgiving dinner with

167
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:59,770
my ex and his wife.
But isn't that how it should be?

168
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Letting go of the adversity in our lives
appreciating the good and what was and

169
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:08,170
moving on in the end is
the children who win.

170
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,220
And that's the lesson that my mother
taught me with the grace and kindness.

171
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,650
She showered on those in her life.

172
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,500
A gift that I'll be sure
to pass on to my daughter.

173
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,300
So the same rough patch that her mother
had was the same rough patch that she

174
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:26,970
had and she was able to take her mother's
equanimity and strength and copied

175
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:30,910
that when she had her moment.
Um, by the way, this is,

176
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,420
feel free to ask questions
or interject a comment.

177
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,380
Am supposed to be
informal and interactive.

178
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,720
Okay, I'll give you another story.
That's what I call a flower story.

179
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,110
This is a shorter one. So, um,

180
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,570
the story is that, uh, at least freed
men who's in her seventies, remember,

181
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,950
is being in Maui, uh,
traveling with her husband,

182
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:02,070
super excited to get up early in the
morning and go tour tour of the island and

183
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:08,011
their upgrade early and they're stuck
in traffic because there is a big dump

184
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,950
truck filled with pineapples
that's blocking the road.

185
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,540
She had just filled with pineapples.

186
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,310
So she's sort of laughing
at the peculiarity up early
to go see the island and

187
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,790
who you are in traffic because of a,
of a truck of pineapples.

188
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,000
And she calls her mother who lives
in buffalo now. First of all,

189
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:28,480
she's on her cell phone. This is the 70s.
And her mother first was like in shock.

190
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,020
Oh my gosh, you're calling me from
Hawaii on our phone and Buffalo.

191
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:35,800
So that was sort of cool. Then when they
got through that, uh, Elise says, bye mom,

192
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:39,100
I'm calling you because we are stuck in
traffic because there is a dump truck

193
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:44,050
and in front of us filled with pineapples.
And so her mother says, well, Elise,

194
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,190
have you tried the pineapples too?
Which at least has mom, you know,

195
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,600
I don't eat pineapple,

196
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,570
at least describes herself as a person
who always fished the pineapple out of

197
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:57,100
any fruit before she would even start to
have the fruit cup. And her mother says,

198
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,100
Elise, be a grownup, try the pineapple.

199
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,080
So she actually decides to listen to her
mother and she tries to pineapple later

200
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,500
that day and she finds out the Lo and
behold the pineapple in Hawaii is way

201
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,660
different than any
pineapple she's ever tasted.

202
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,410
And then she later that day goes to one
of those gift stores where they can find

203
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:17,650
that exact kind of pineapple that
she can chip to her mother as a okay.

204
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:22,651
So she does that and she heads back
home and then two weeks later she gets a

205
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:27,160
call from her sister and buffalo and
her sister says that her mother has,

206
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,650
their mother has just had a stroke.

207
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,320
So at least immediately
goes to buffalo visit mom.

208
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,310
And at the end of the day she goes to
her apartment and she opens up the fridge

209
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:44,050
to go get some water.
And there she sees the pineapple.

210
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,430
I needin never to beaten by her mother
who can't swallow anymore, right there,

211
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,383
you know,
unwrapped.

212
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,560
And she has a very big learning
moment for herself right there.

213
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:56,470
And I'm going to say it in her words.
She writes,

214
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,460
I have a tendency to be rather
emphatic and my opinions,

215
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,290
some of which I may have formed without
a whole lot of reasonable evidence.

216
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,170
Every so often I am an a miss of holding
forth explaining why I would never ever

217
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:15,670
consider doing this or that.
And then I hear my mother cautioning me,

218
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,660
Elise, she is saying be
a grownup. So for her,

219
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:24,661
the pineapple was about opening up her
mind and really taking the world fresh

220
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,750
and not bringing her her
prejudices to that instance.

221
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,170
So those are some flower stories.

222
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:35,620
Anybody have a lesson they want
to share about their mother?

223
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,100
Something that they've took.
It was on the sweet side of life.

224
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,110
Do we want some olive branch stories?
Okay,

225
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:49,010
well we'll go for an olive
branch story. So, uh,

226
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,680
there's a story in this book
called emotional blinders,

227
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,090
and it's a story of a man named Martin
Abramowitz, who's in his seventies.

228
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,440
His father was a cutter for the triangle
shirt factory. Who knows what the,

229
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,180
who does anybody know about
the Red Triangle? Shirt
factory? Okay. So we have that,

230
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,800
that was a factory that it was a moment
of tragedy went up and fire and many,

231
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:13,970
many girls were, were killed. This,
I don't remember what the year was,

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,650
but it was early 1900.
His father was a cutter for the factory.

233
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,700
He remembers his father was not a, well
man, he was in and out of the hospital.

234
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,530
Mari remembers visiting him,

235
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,530
but not being able to go into the hospital
because they didn't like kids into

236
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:30,650
the hospital. He would have to be in the
outside, sort of at the window waving.

237
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,420
And Marty has an older
brother, 10 years older. Um,

238
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,080
so one day his mother tells him that
his father has gone to Florida to

239
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:41,260
convalesce.
Um,

240
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,190
and he sort of takes it at face value.
He remembers that day.

241
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,380
It turned out to be the
day of his dad's funeral,

242
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:53,000
but the mother has lied and told him that
the has moved to Florida to convalesce.

243
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,450
He says, I remember what I'm
sure. With a day of that funeral,

244
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,180
my brother walked me to school
on that rainy march morning.

245
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,040
I still see the expanding raindrop circles
in the pedals on our block and feel

246
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,970
the sadness is I put my boots and rain
coat away in the walk in closet at the

247
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:12,020
back of my second grade classroom and
that's all he remembers. No funeral,

248
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,790
no Vizard desert home,
no weeping mother,

249
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,780
no words of huge or hugs with
constellation or processing of any kind,

250
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,260
any proceeds along this path that his
dad is in Florida and two years pass,

251
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,310
no phone calls, no letters, no anything.

252
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,330
And finally he's goes to his
mother and he says, daddy is dead,

253
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,330
isn't t and what she is.

254
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,210
What he explains then as
the impact of that lie,

255
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,440
because I hit absorbed the
lesson and my mother's decision,

256
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,740
don't acknowledge death,
don't notice pain.

257
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't pay attention to any feelings.
A low level won't go away.

258
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:54,950
Sadness that you won't put it into words
works as a strategy to avoid pain and

259
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:58,180
get through life. But that has, uh,

260
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,460
an impact on I repercussion in his life
because he describes as an older person.

261
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,000
Um, he was a failed
partner, a failed parent.

262
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,620
He couldn't find any real energy for life.
He has a very active mind,

263
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:16,340
but something that was just a lethargy
about how he did life because he had so

264
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:19,040
learned to oppress his feelings.

265
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,770
And when I asked her if they
wanted to write a piece,

266
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,960
he wants to write a piece because it was
his chance to explain to himself and to

267
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:31,010
his children, to his grandchildren
why his mother did that.

268
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,480
And he saw it in a whole different light
and he was able to put peace, know,

269
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,650
find some piece of himself.

270
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:40,940
So I'm going to reach you how
he puts it in perspective.

271
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,220
He says, I have come to understand
Rosie's decision through a different Lens.

272
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,220
One that has a much more positive lesson.

273
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,700
A widow at 42 with one acting out
17 year old son and the other,

274
00:16:55,791 --> 00:17:00,590
a frail seven year old and no
income except social security.

275
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,250
Rosie seems to have put
on emotional blinders.

276
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,240
She never be wailed or situation.
Never looked for a man.

277
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,550
Instead she said about making sure
she could support her family by hand,

278
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,430
sewing labels on men's neckties.

279
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,180
My brother and I have that memory of
trying to keep up with her as she would go

280
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:22,790
full speed ahead navigating
the isles of Macy's,

281
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,190
not looking back to see if
we were even keeping pace.

282
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,760
So Rosie's decision to avoid pain was
also about getting on with the business of

283
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:32,444
life.

284
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,920
She was smart enough to know
that some instinctive level,

285
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:40,140
what she needed to do was to keep
her family and our lives intact.

286
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,490
I have enormous respect for her ability
to have done that and have taught me a

287
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:48,110
survival skill even as I'm
more her losses and mine.

288
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,870
So, um, I asked him why he, he wrote this,

289
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,320
I mean he's been living with us
for many years. I think for him,

290
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:59,520
he really wanted to codify
that experience, what it
meant to him at the time,

291
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,870
what it means to him now and how he
can love and respect her decisions.

292
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,810
Even if for a very
large chunk of his life.

293
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:09,540
It has some very
detrimental effects on him.

294
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,350
It's hard not to be judgmental.
Very hard.

295
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,210
Yeah. Right. And to see, I mean,

296
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,200
and also that older brother who knew,
right? Can you imagine being the brother,

297
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,420
the 17 year old brother,
10 years older,

298
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:29,940
who knew the [inaudible] had to
actually keep the lie as well.

299
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,720
So there's probably a lot
of ways to emp unpack that.

300
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:38,580
Then it was damaging and a lot
of ways. Um, I had a woman,

301
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,140
so I always try and these stories to
reach out to groups that are not Newton

302
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:46,220
Jewish. That's sort of my sweet
spot and Newton Jewish. But I try,

303
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,630
I try to reach out to other
parts of the universe. Um,

304
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,560
I was much more successful in the second
book in this book that I was in the

305
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:54,540
first book and successful
getting the third book.

306
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,260
So I reached out to a woman
who is from Ghana and uh,

307
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,420
her parents, uh, her mother
was a little more, um, on the,

308
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:07,890
on the social caste of society.

309
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,270
Her mother was higher on the rung than
her father. They lived in the, in Ghana.

310
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:15,950
Her father was a police officer
who made his way up to, um,

311
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,920
I think a military officer or some kind.
They had four daughters.

312
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,151
And uh,

313
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:26,151
at some point their parents get divorced
and she is now living with her mother

314
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:30,570
and her grandmother and she
misses her father terribly.

315
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,870
And so the father decides every Saturday
he's going to come visit the four

316
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:35,850
daughters and he's going to
have a good day with them.

317
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:39,690
And this happens routinely.
And so it's all very copacetic.

318
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,110
And then one Saturday when he's visiting
a military truck comes by and says to

319
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:49,680
her, father, you have to
go. And so he zooms away.

320
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:54,150
It turns out it was Ghana was in the
middle of a coup and he was on the side of

321
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,080
trying to repress the COO and he had to
go see if he could repress the COO in

322
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:00,720
the course of the coup.
He died, he was killed.

323
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,590
So now she has her mother,
her grandmother.

324
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,830
And then what happens is she married the
mother remarries and I don't know what

325
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,190
the name of this man is because he was
only referred to with a capital h as him

326
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,810
sort of like or Baltimore.

327
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:20,190
He shall not be named as
him and him is abusive.

328
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:22,410
And I'm not sure if it's
emotional or physical or both,

329
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:27,411
but he's definitely abusive and she is
very angry at her mother because her

330
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:32,640
mother never stands up for them.
The grandmother is a big believer in,

331
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,450
uh, has been, has a big believer in
faith and God goes to church every week,

332
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:39,960
sings in the choir and the
grandmother says to this woman,

333
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:43,350
you will find your salvation in the Lord.

334
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,150
You are meant to serve the Lord.

335
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:48,250
You will take your pain and all this
and that will be where you put it.

336
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,060
And so she does, she goes to church
and she sings and she loves all that.

337
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,800
And at a certain point she decided she's
going to the states because she has to

338
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,730
get away from him and she's angry at her
mother and she's able to come here and

339
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:03,670
she actually does become a reverend.
Now.

340
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,150
I asked her if she would write a story
about her mother. I didn't know all this.

341
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,710
I just know that she got an insane to me.

342
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:11,200
How about my grandmother kind of
write about my grandmother and I said,

343
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:14,710
well you can, um, but you know,
it's a book about mothers,

344
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:17,830
but if grandma's or what you want
to honor of, fine, we can do that.

345
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,940
And then I don't hear from her. And
as usually happens in, at my pace,

346
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,740
you put out a lot of,
you cast a big net and you get some eel,

347
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,430
but some people drop out
for different reasons.

348
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,420
And I thought she was going to drop out.
And then she calls me and she says,

349
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,610
I'm coming over.
And she walks into my door,

350
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,460
I'm out of my house and she's a reverend.
And she says to me,

351
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,860
the Lord has brought you to me.

352
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,750
And I thought that I was
like in a dreamland imagining
this. And she said, again,

353
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,850
the Lord has brought you to me
and I don't. Okay, what did I do?

354
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:50,851
And what I did was make her revisit her
past and make her find peace with her

355
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:56,410
mother. And so I'm going to read you
the end. She calls her peace, peace.

356
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,670
She actually called me recently and
said, um, I have some 30 somethings.

357
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:03,470
Can they write in your 20 something
book? I'm like, no, it was 20 something

358
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,810
but I do 30 somethings. I'll come back
to you. So here's what she writes.

359
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:11,980
At the end of peace, she writes,
it is over four decades later.

360
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:13,750
And today I am a reverend,

361
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,160
I have moved my mom to the
states and him has died.

362
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,960
I have two children. And while I am
not their friend, I am their ear.

363
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,580
I support and guide them. And my second
husband has also committed to them.

364
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,680
I think the Lord daily.

365
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,360
And I have forgiven my mom for not
supporting my sisters and me after my dad

366
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:36,550
died.
It has taken a while,

367
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,840
but I have found my peace and
hopefully she has found hers.

368
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,520
So that is a pure olive branch story
that is somebody who had a lot of

369
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:46,271
consternation,

370
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:51,271
a lot of anger and was able to in the
course of writing a piece find her piece.

371
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,760
So, uh, I think what's
interesting to me is I,

372
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,200
I speak about this book, uh, to
groups, synagogues, community places,

373
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:05,280
you name it. But I haven't had a
chance to take it into the work set.

374
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:06,490
And even though I wanted to,

375
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,670
and I think that the lessons are mothers
applies as much to work as it does and

376
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:16,671
to any community setting you could because
we take our lessons from our mom with

377
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:20,560
us for good or for bad. There they are
us. And that's what we bring to work.

378
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,940
And I had this lunch a while back where
I was telling him one of my clients

379
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:28,570
about the book and he
pulls out his cell phone.

380
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,050
Now he works at a technology company.

381
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:37,051
He has about 200 people in
his organization that he
manages and he shows me the,

382
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,630
whenever he feels um,

383
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,120
overwhelmed or just sort of
daunted by the challenges.

384
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:47,150
He looks at this note that his
mother hand wrote for him years ago.

385
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,330
So his mother was an
immigrant from Ireland.

386
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,660
She came over and when she
was 16 she knew nobody.

387
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,300
There was an Irish community
here in Boston that was helpful.

388
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,630
She became a clerk at Jordan Marsh and
she worked all the way up to executive

389
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:04,631
buyer and she wrote for her two kids
this thing called the ladder of success.

390
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,800
And she, he showed me, I think I will, I
can, I did. And it has percentages by it.

391
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,850
And so he looks at that handwritten note
when he feels like the world's just a

392
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:16,700
little bigger than he wants it to
be a little more, a little harder.

393
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,390
And when I asked him what that was about,
he tells me two stories.

394
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,240
The first story is that they went to
church every Sunday and when they went to

395
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:30,530
church there would be a series of people
from a halfway house in the back of the

396
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:33,800
church and the first thing she would do,
excuse me,

397
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,850
and she would go up and shake everybody's
hand and as part of the halfway house,

398
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,070
evidently that was unusual because most
people didn't do that and she offered

399
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:51,071
people afterwards rides home and
he said he took from that the the,

400
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,840
the way she was able to extend
dignity and respect to everybody,

401
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:58,190
no matter your lot in life and that
was something he wanted to make sure he

402
00:24:58,191 --> 00:24:59,024
copied.

403
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,160
The second memory he had was on July 4th
before they could go do the big parade

404
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:08,750
and celebrate. She said, you have to
clean up and it wasn't clean up inside.

405
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:12,230
The house was cleaning up outside and
it wasn't just clean up the lawn and the

406
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,350
sidewalk was going down the block
and seeing if there was any garbage,

407
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:19,340
any refuse to pick up because she wanted
him to understand that accountability

408
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:21,710
was more than just about your area here.

409
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:25,340
It was about really extending a much
bigger arm and being able to take

410
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,240
responsibility for a bigger piece
of the world than just your lot.

411
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,230
So he looks at this,
this ladder of success,

412
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,640
and he thinks about how he treats
people and he thinks about how he builds

413
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,100
accountability within his things.
And that's,

414
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:43,190
that's his lesson from his
mother that he takes into work.

415
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,100
So now I'm going to ask you guys,

416
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:50,000
is there a lesson that anybody in this
room can imagine that you'd take into

417
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,331
work?

418
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:55,130
Something that your mother has given
you that you can see a connection to and

419
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:56,150
how you behave at work?

420
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,890
My mother used to always say what
her mother said to her, which is,

421
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,130
if you can't say something nice,
don't say anything at all.

422
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,460
And I think that's really important
to sometimes to be positive,

423
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,000
not be overly critical,

424
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,410
and certainly think about it
before you're negative about stuff.

425
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,990
Right? Oh, that's a good one. Just
being positive goes a long way.

426
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,820
Oh, there's, there's a lot of lessons. Um,

427
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,660
there's a really funny story
in this book by Danny Brazel.

428
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,610
It's called always talking
and he describes his mother.
Actually. It's so funny,

429
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:30,460
I'm going to read you a
part of it and she just,

430
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,690
she's married to a quiet librarian.
He is very happy to give his wife the,

431
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,300
you know, the running of the house.
So he started off, mom loves to talk.

432
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,920
It can drive a person nuts.

433
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,900
My mother has received a piece of mail
that she did not feel compelled to read

434
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:50,520
aloud to anyone in the room. So
Danny, you remember Mrs a language.

435
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,860
She'll say she died four
years before you were born.

436
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,250
Why just received a letter from her
daughter. Let me read it to you.

437
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,400
And then she'll read about a letter
of someone I do not know about,

438
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:02,220
things I do not care about.
And like Walt Disney,

439
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,410
no matter what travail she described,

440
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,520
she always manages to find a silver
lining to create a happy ending.

441
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,420
And then she, he described being in
the car with her. She's always talking.

442
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,200
I don't ever remember sitting in the car
with my mother throughout my childhood

443
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,680
where she did not play some sort
of game with us kids. Hey Danny,

444
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:23,730
there's a Volkswagen bug she pointed out
while smacking me in the arm. Hey Dan,

445
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:26,820
I look at the license plates on the car.
How many different states can you spot?

446
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,550
Hey Daddy,
what sounds does your name start with?

447
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,570
I'd make a d sound and she would challenge
me if I'm sounding to started with

448
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:37,470
this sound dairy queen and
shout back donuts. Yes,

449
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:38,850
I wasn't obese child.

450
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,060
My poor father could never get a
word in or anyone for that matter.

451
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,310
When my mother began speaking,
so honey,

452
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:48,090
tell daddy who was on the plane with us
and as my father began to open his mouth,

453
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,930
mother would blurt out the
San Francisco giants and hey,

454
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,410
tell Danny what they says to you.

455
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,050
And Dad would make another
fruitless attempt to speak.

456
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,220
Mom would share the rest of the
story. So he says at the end, now,

457
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,870
mom always has something to say.

458
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,980
And I am now a motivational
speaker who gets paid to talk.

459
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,120
Who Do you think I took after?
Yeah.

460
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,110
Anyway, it's uh, I think if,

461
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,830
I think it's really interesting and may
be helpful to think about the lessons

462
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:19,820
that cut off. Let me listen to your
father give you, has given him.

463
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:22,110
But this book has it from
my mom dedicated to my mom.

464
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:23,400
So that was why I chose mothers.

465
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:28,401
But I think who we are at home is mostly
who we are at work and the lessons from

466
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:34,080
our parents are very much a factor
and who that person is. Uh, yeah. I'm,

467
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:35,820
I'm happy to take any questions.

468
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,610
I think you'd be more stories but you
got the book so you can read it yourself.

469
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,450
Um, but if you have any questions
or thoughts, I'm happy to take them.

470
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,360
I'll offer another story,
a lesson from my father.

471
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:46,650
Just cause you mentioned fathers.

472
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,800
I remember being a little
kid and complaining about
having to go to school and

473
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,360
I've got a 17 year old daughter now
and gives me the same thing about

474
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,920
complaining about going to school.

475
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,750
But when I was a kid and I was just so
upset I didn't want to go to school as a

476
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:04,470
waste of my time. I didn't like school
and my dad said to me, you know,

477
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,790
I go to work every day. I don't want to
go to work every day. You just do it.

478
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,600
Right. Right. And that kind
of stayed with me. Right.

479
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,920
Sometimes there's things
you got to do right

480
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,430
now. What you want to just not tell
the truth what you gotta do. Yeah, no,

481
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:22,240
that's true. Well, sometimes when we get
into these rooms, especially of signing,

482
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,620
when I've gotten through with a lot of
the sweet spot for me in this book is

483
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:29,890
Middle Age women who are contemplating
and trying to sort of think back about

484
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:31,210
their moms and about their life.

485
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:36,370
And it's just so interesting to see how
their decisions were driven by a memory

486
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:40,990
of their mother and what they take
with it. So, um, and my daughter,

487
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,410
I was saying to earlier,
some people were hearing,

488
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:45,220
my daughter wrote it wanting to
write a piece and I was like, no,

489
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:47,410
you don't need to write a piece. It's
not about me. It's about the world.

490
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:50,140
I didn't know that. I want to
write a piece. And she writes,

491
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:54,340
actually a really good piece,
a, even though I didn't
want her to, and her lesson,

492
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:55,510
I always said to her,
Naomi,

493
00:29:55,511 --> 00:30:00,511
responsibility goes up and credit goes
down and she works at Boston scientific.

494
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,100
And she always tells me that that's,

495
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,250
those are words that have always stuck
with her responsibility of credit down.

496
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,440
Because you know,
you're oftentimes in teams,

497
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:11,530
which don't give enough credit to
the people who are doing the work.

498
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:16,420
And it's very easy for someone
who is further up in the chain to,

499
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,620
to take the credit. Not that it happens
here, but I'm saying, but it would be, uh,

500
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,050
an inclination that, that you could just
be aware of. So I was happy to hear that.

501
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:28,720
Some words that, uh, I had said as
a mom actually made it into a piece.

502
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,680
Um, but it's good. So, uh,

503
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:35,710
I think if you guys are thinking about
a creative present for your mother,

504
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,670
you could,
uh,

505
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,720
give her a copy of the book or your copy
of the book and you could write her a

506
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:44,920
little note as people have done.
I had one woman who said to me,

507
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,300
I would not have been able to write a
piece for this book because I would have

508
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:53,460
been all about dissing my mom. So I
said, okay, tell me about your mom. Well,

509
00:30:53,461 --> 00:30:57,430
she's 94 and what does she do?
Well, she plays a lots of games.

510
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:02,260
Canasta she listed a whole bunch of games
that she plays and I said to her and

511
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,930
tell them I happen to know a little bit
about this woman and not a lot. I said,

512
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:08,650
tell me what you like to do a wash.
There's a lot. I play games too.

513
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,390
And she actually teaches game,

514
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:14,770
just one of her hobbies that she gets
paid to teach games. So I said to her,

515
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:19,771
and you can't find any gift to there about
your mother and her nineties and then

516
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:22,990
you read I think games player as well.

517
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,740
And then she saw me as a couple of weeks
later and she said to me, thank you,

518
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,430
because I'm actually going to
going to thank my mom for that.

519
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,340
And she didn't think she had anything
in her, but she actually did.

520
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,300
So that has come up in so many different
ways where people have had a chance to

521
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:41,140
thank their mother. So it's a late
February, last day of February,

522
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:45,180
managed days in May and you have a
couple of months you could ratio,

523
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,770
you could write your mother a little
note and I give her the book and she

524
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:50,530
probably would think it's about one
of the nicest presence she could have.

525
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:51,763
Hmm.

526
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,120
Thank you guys for coming. I know
you guys are busy. If you have,

527
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,700
I'm happy to take questions but if you
don't have questions and I'll let you

528
00:31:57,701 --> 00:31:58,690
guys get back to work.

529
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,610
I have one question.

530
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:08,180
Did you notice the difference mothers
and sons versus mothers and daughters

531
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,193
pieces?

532
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,110
Um, not so much. Actually.
I really, I really did not.

533
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,900
The men who stepped up and wanted
to write, we're for the most part,

534
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:20,920
men who were very comfortable sharing
their emotions and didn't have a,

535
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,410
so I would say that I
didn't see so much of that.

536
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:27,520
I actually originally thought this would
be a book about mothers and daughters

537
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,810
and my son who is my copy
editor, said, well, you know,

538
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,330
sending along or write
about your mother's too.

539
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,700
And it was like a new idea to me that
sounds what actually speak about their

540
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,260
mothers. And so then I went
running around, I'm like,

541
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:41,900
why catch us have two men in
the book or one man in the book.

542
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:44,330
So then I went around
and started asking men,

543
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:45,320
do you want to write about your mother?

544
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:50,321
And the biggest constraint was just
either time or people very uncomfortable

545
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:52,520
with their writing skills.

546
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,240
That's a big theme I have and these
books is people will say, well,

547
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,550
I have ideas but I'm not a writer.
And I always say,

548
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:00,970
you don't have to be a writer.
I will help you.

549
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,810
You gotta you have to have thoughts,

550
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,780
but we can take your thoughts
and we can make a piece.

551
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:08,540
And they're so happy afterwards because
they wouldn't have done it on their own.

552
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,990
Um, but yeah, but I think the,

553
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,150
I see difference in age more than
I see a difference in gender.

554
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,260
Yeah. The older you get, the
more appreciative it's everyone.

555
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,720
The younger stories are
angsty, you know. Um, so yeah,

556
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:29,360
I think that last comment about the
age thing seems to me, you know,

557
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:30,990
as you got older you,
uh,

558
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,590
you've experienced more life
and you bump into these things.

559
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:37,640
A lot of the lessons that I feel like
I'm starting to learn or as I understand

560
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,540
myself and go inside myself and
learn more about my own character and

561
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:44,080
personality and the way it
handle situations, right.

562
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,250
As we an appreciation for the
way my mom handled herself,

563
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:52,410
we went through a divorce, my father's
business went bankrupt, uh, uh,

564
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,040
before that and then,
and then she went through a divorce.

565
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:58,220
But the way she handled
herself, um, and the,

566
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,900
the one thing that struck me through this
whole thing was the way that she sings

567
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,320
all day long around the house
doing anything. And that Sensei, I,

568
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:11,450
I carry that same, uh, like
musical sentence with me. So, uh,

569
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:15,320
I just catch myself sometimes doing the
dishes while the kids are getting ready

570
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,990
to go to school and he's just repeating
it, doing the same kind of thing.

571
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:21,860
Any song, it could be one of the
kids tunes, it could be Abbo,

572
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:26,420
which my mom used to love or whatever it
is, and I'll do it sound like I'm crazy.

573
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:28,580
But then I turned around and to
see the kids doing the same thing,

574
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:29,361
walking around the house,

575
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,990
singing to themselves about while
they're doing tasks and it's just,

576
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,930
it's just a cascading like
genetic or just a crazy,

577
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,510
but that's a lovely thing
to pass through generation,

578
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,500
but to be able to write it.
Yeah.

579
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:42,590
And I think the age part of that is the
tie in there was that just being able to

580
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:46,160
recognize that you get to a certain
age where you start to see all these

581
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:50,930
different pieces of your mother and uh,
the things that you hated it one time.

582
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,550
You then you're either
experiencing it with your own
daughters or, yeah. Oh, sons.

583
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:59,540
Oh, uh, oh. You just learn more about
yourself and how you handled it. Yeah,

584
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,200
that's true. That's definitely true. Lacy.

585
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,020
Yeah, I'll just second that. But it
occurred to me that like, right. Um,

586
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,460
I was born when my mother was almost 30,

587
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,520
so I haven't gotten to the point yet
where I am really like doing any of the

588
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,030
things that I saw her doing.
Right.

589
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,110
I've been married almost four months
now and like I'm just starting to see

590
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:26,870
things where I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm
like doing this just like my mom or like,

591
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,310
you know, all these things she used
to remind me about. I'm like, oh I'm,

592
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,730
this is where it's useful.

593
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:37,280
Then I'm like just starting to be in the
kind of situations. But I saw her in,

594
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,123
right.

595
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,330
We love that as parents,

596
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,180
we love when we see that our kids don't
think that what we did was just crazy.

597
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:47,010
But there actually was some
reason behind it all. Well,

598
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,310
keep your eyes open for ways you're like
your parents and then if they're at all

599
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,220
flattering you can, um, let them know.

600
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,640
Cause it's always good as a parent
to have a moment of recognition.

601
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,200
Well thank you all for coming
today. I appreciate that. Thank you.
