1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,480
Okay.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,050
Thank you very much for,

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,360
for coming this afternoon and thanks
to Louise and Google food talks for

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,100
inviting me to speak. So, um,

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,770
I'm going to talk to you a
little bit about Orthorexia. Um,

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,210
any of you have any
idea what Orthorexia is?

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,740
Some of you are nodding some saying
no, not so sure. What, what would you,

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,050
what would you say Orthorexia wars.
What was your kind of,

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,070
what's your kind of definitely
the obsession with helping
you. Yeah, pretty much.

10
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,280
You've pretty much hit the
nail on the head there. It's
exactly what it is. So, um,

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,970
so yeah, it is, it's, I think
it's a really interesting topic.

12
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,420
It's a fairly new term.
Um,

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,940
it was only sort of brought to our
attention in 1996 when Steve Brotman,

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,030
um, he's, uh, a physician in, in the
states kind of identified it as a,

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,000
as an issue with a lot of his clients
who were kind of trying to be healthy.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,800
But I'd almost be quite at the
point where it was obsessive.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,820
So when you break down Orthorexia is it
is basically the obsession with being

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,930
pure of eating correctly
is the exact term. Um,

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,720
and I think it's come about because there
are so many kind of ideas around what

20
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,321
healthy is.

21
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:14,040
So it kind of like one of my questions
to you is what does it actually mean to

22
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,860
be healthy in 2017? I mean,
what, what are your thoughts?

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,880
Know I asked this whenever I do workshops
and I do workshops with schools,

24
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,770
with athletes, with coaches, um,

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,570
with school nurses a lot as well because
they do a lot of work around disordered

26
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:30,180
eating and sort of poor
relationships with food.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,220
It's really interesting what comes back.

28
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,100
So I'd love to know what you think
healthy eating is or what health,

29
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,140
what it means to be healthy in,
in 2017.

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,340
Yup,
Yup,

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,820
Yep. Yeah. I love the fact that
you've picked up on the term balance.

32
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:56,850
We'll go back to that at some point.
Anybody else want to add anything else?

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,760
Yeah,
yeah,

34
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,420
yeah. And I think one of the things I
want to make really clear here is, um,

35
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,970
sometimes people get the wrong idea
about what I'm trying to promote.

36
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:14,470
I am a Dietitian, so I do promote
a very healthy way of eating,

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,170
which does mean majority to lots of fruit,
vegetables,

38
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:21,430
whole grains actually in line with some
of the things that you do here at Google.

39
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:23,230
So it is,
it is what I promote.

40
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,480
What I want to bring to the attention
here is the actually sometimes in some

41
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,660
people we can get a little bit extreme.
And when it becomes extreme,

42
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:35,770
it starts to affect your
health and your mental health.

43
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,830
That's when it becomes a problem. And
that's what I'm seeing more and more of.

44
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:42,040
And so that's kind of what I want
to talk about today. So, yeah.

45
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,970
So one of the challenges I have as a
practitioner is that there were so many

46
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:50,170
messages about food. I'm sure every
single day you pick up your phone,

47
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:54,160
you look at magazines and there's always
something new. What should we eat?

48
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,720
Who should be follow?
What should we do?

49
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:58,690
And obviously while I'm a
big fan of social media,

50
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:01,990
I think it do lots of really positive
things and get some really positive

51
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:02,830
messages out there.

52
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,070
I'm also slightly nervous of it because
I think it creates influences that don't

53
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:12,100
always give us the right messages.
So I mean these are just a few.

54
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,880
I'm sure you know all of
these people. Um, and,

55
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,430
and I struggle with this because
on that page, on that slide,

56
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,960
there's not a single person who is
actually qualified to give out nutritional

57
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,750
advice.
So from my point of view,

58
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,870
when you are putting stuff out on
Instagram or you're doing blogs or you're

59
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:32,890
writing articles,
you're writing books,

60
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:36,690
even actually you're kind of
giving some misinformation and,

61
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,770
and the problem comes,
not to, majority of us,

62
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:42,280
majority of us can read something and
go, yeah, I'll take a bit of that,

63
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,200
but I'm going to forget about that.
That's okay.

64
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,690
The problem comes when you
are somebody that may be,

65
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:51,400
is a little bit susceptible to developing
a poor relationship with food. Um,

66
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,520
and again, I will go through
what that would look like.

67
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,120
So I guess some of the big trends that
are come out of the last few years, um,

68
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,960
eat clean, I think we all hear about
that is always hashtag he clean.

69
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,100
That's the big thing.
It's almost like a badge of honor.

70
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,020
I mean the number of of athletes and
clients that have come see me and they're

71
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:14,160
like, I always eat clean and they're
really excited about the fact that they're

72
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,010
actually saying that to me. And I'm
like, okay. And then really a bit like,

73
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,010
well you don't seem impressed. And
I'm like, well what does that mean?

74
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,090
What does eat clean actually mean?
Because from my point of view,

75
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,980
if I don't follow your rules,

76
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:30,550
then somehow it makes me feel like I'm
eating dirty, which I know I don't.

77
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,620
So for me,
labeling and terms and hashtags,

78
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:38,830
while they're brilliant and useful,
these things can be really quite,

79
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,870
they can be quite detrimental to a
lot of people. Um, so eating clean,

80
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:47,440
green juices, superfoods, these are
all things we hear about all the time.

81
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,460
And I am not for one second saying that
you shouldn't have a green juice and you

82
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,400
shouldn't eat foods that
are seem to be super.

83
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:58,390
Although I don't ever believe in a
particular one. Food being super,

84
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:02,530
it's more about your collection of foods
that then gives you a balanced diet and

85
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,600
all the nutrients you need.
In the same way,

86
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:09,601
I don't demonize any foods because I
don't believe one food group alone or one

87
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:14,290
food is what is going to cause
you negative health problems.

88
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,690
So some of the common misconceptions,
sugar,

89
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,350
let's talk about sugar.
What do we know about sugar?

90
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,750
What do we hear about sugar?

91
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,600
Anyone want to tell me what they

92
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,270
yeah,
yeah,

93
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,380
yeah, yeah, yeah. But then
you've got those sugars,

94
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,120
like fruit, sugars, stuff like that.
So, but your main conception of it,

95
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,520
as soon as you hear, should we go
straight to the bathroom? Yeah.

96
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,320
Yeah. Really, really, really good answer.

97
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:55,950
And the thing is for me is
that I think it's just been,

98
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,310
it's been blown out of
as well because again,

99
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:02,810
we have bloggers and influencers who
talk about refined sugar free and sugar

100
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:03,441
free cakes.

101
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:07,520
But then you look at the recipes and
they're full of maple syrup and coconut

102
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:11,000
sugar and that it somehow
is deemed healthier.

103
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,100
But actually the end of the day sugar
is sugar. Whether it is molasses, honey,

104
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,750
white sugar,
maple syrup.

105
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,500
And one of my biggest kind of challenges
to some of the bloggers and I have been

106
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:25,820
on stage with one. Um, but
I won't go there and um,

107
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,570
is the actually the end of the day
you say that white sugar is processed.

108
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,930
Well it's no different to removing the
SAP from coconut to make coconut sugar is

109
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,990
exactly the same process.
There was no difference.

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,780
So you cannot say the sugar,
you know,

111
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:48,440
white table sugar is processed and coconut
sugar isn't cause at the same thing.

112
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,130
Biggest thing about all of it though is
that they all give you the same amount

113
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:56,840
of energy per hundred grams and they
all are used in the body in exactly the

114
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:01,610
same way. The body cannot dif,
you know, cannot kind of go,

115
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,950
oh this is coconut sugar is better
for me so I'm going to use it.

116
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:06,770
And this way it doesn't,
it just literally breaks it down.

117
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,880
Uses it in the same way.

118
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,710
If you eat any product to access any
product to access of what your body needs,

119
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,660
it will get stored as access.

120
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,910
The only thing I would say potentially
in kind of kind of in defense of some of

121
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:24,260
these other sugars is that things like
maple syrup, honey, they are sweeter.

122
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,130
So potentially you could
use less potentially.

123
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,780
But that's probably the only thing I
would say. So otherwise that for me,

124
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,100
whether you're um,

125
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,210
using table white table sugar in it and
your cake or whether you're using honey,

126
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,950
it makes no difference. It's still
a cake. Enjoy it, embrace it.

127
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,800
Because actually there's nothing wrong
with having cake or dessert every now and

128
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:49,010
again. And that's kind of what I
want to get across. I don't have,

129
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,540
I get really cross when
I see people using, uh,

130
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,180
having a Brownie and there'll be,
it's brilliant.

131
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:58,790
It's really healthy for me
because not only is it sugar free,

132
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,580
it's also gluten free and it's
like it's still a Brownie.

133
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,450
It still gives you the same amount of
energy is still going to use and the body

134
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:09,200
in exactly the same way. I'm actually from
my point of view, if I want a Brownie,

135
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,600
I'm just going to be a Brownie.
Simple as that.

136
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,470
Similarly plant based milks.

137
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,460
Now I get a lot of grief about plant
based milks because people seem to think

138
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:22,930
that I'm like, you know, a real uh,

139
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,590
a real Nazi against them.

140
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,300
The only reason I struggle with plant
based milks is because they are promoted

141
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,860
in the wrong way.

142
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,110
There's nothing wrong with using alma
milk or milk or hemp milk or whatever you

143
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:38,060
want to use if you prefer the taste,

144
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:41,150
but don't kid yourself that you're going
to get the same nutrients as you would

145
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:45,020
from cow's milk. That's the only thing I
would say. So I'm not anti any of them.

146
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,030
You know, I, I, you know,

147
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:51,050
I would probably say that actually for
some people the taste of almond milk is

148
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,590
better than cow's milk.
They prefer it. Great,

149
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:56,760
but don't kid yourself that you're
going to get the same nutrients.

150
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:00,810
This is particularly I find with with
athletes because obviously when it comes

151
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,960
to working in within the performance
athletes that I work with,

152
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,460
milk is such an important recovery drink
because it's the right composition of

153
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,600
carbs and protein.

154
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,890
So if they then think they can recover
in the same way with almond milk,

155
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,581
they don't.

156
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:18,720
And you can see from the kind of table
that if you look at 200 mils of Alma milk

157
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:22,980
versus 200 mils of Skim Milk, almond
looks just pretty much expensive water.

158
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,520
So what I say to people
is by all means use it.

159
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,580
But don't kid yourself in thinking
it's got the same nutrients.

160
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,010
A lot of the milks,
I say milks,

161
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:35,400
I have to do this cause it's not really
milk is it? But a lot of the, the,

162
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:40,230
the plant based milks are fortified
with calcium now, which is a benefit.

163
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,850
Um, I did a talk two days ago
in Belfast and there was a,

164
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:49,410
a professor who's very big
on her bone health, um, uh,

165
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,480
research.
And one of the things that she came,

166
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,380
what she was talking about is the actually
the intake of calcium is so important

167
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:59,160
for our bone health. Um, and it
doesn't matter how you get it,

168
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,250
but it's really important if you are
below par, even especially when you're,

169
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:07,140
you're sort of in your early,
late teens, early twenties,

170
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:10,860
it can have a real negative impact on
your health and your sort of sixties and

171
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:15,570
seventies. So it's a really
important area. Gluten,

172
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,770
I've already mentioned gluten. Um, again,

173
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,700
I don't have an issue if
people want to be gluten free,

174
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,000
that's entirely up to them.
Um,

175
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,430
what I find interesting is that when
I first qualified as a dietician many,

176
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:32,490
many years ago,
nobody wanted to be gluten free.

177
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:37,491
Like celiacs hated being gluten free
because actually there wasn't an awful lot

178
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:41,700
of choice out there and the food's out
that they were provided were really high

179
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:45,660
in fat, really unpalatable and really
high in salt and nobody wanted to do it.

180
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:49,500
And now it just amazes me that we've got
so many different options that people

181
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,770
want to be gluten free because they
totally believe it's healthier.

182
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,070
There is no evidence in any article you
will read a proper credible scientific

183
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:02,700
article that is that glute being gluten
free will benefit you if you don't need

184
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:06,120
to be.
Obviously if you have a medical reason,

185
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,960
then of course you have to follow a
gluten free diet. And I think what again,

186
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,740
I find really interesting is that the
athletes and the clients I work with who

187
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,460
do have to be gluten free, they
really moan. They don't like it.

188
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,780
They still don't think it's fair. But
at the end of the day, um, you know,

189
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,850
I think it's just been highlighted as a,

190
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,770
a kind of a cure for
immune problems and um,

191
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,110
sort of digestive problems.

192
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Often the reason why somebody who goes
gluten free feels better is because

193
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:38,670
actually when you change
any aspect of your diet,

194
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:41,310
when you sort of decide you're
going to follow a new thing,

195
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,410
you become more mindful of what you eat.

196
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,840
If you become more
mindful of what you eat,

197
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,920
you get a balanced diet and actually
that's what makes you better.

198
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,210
That's what makes you feel better.

199
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,210
It's not necessarily that you've got
gluten free sugar free or you know, or,

200
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,210
or dairy free. It's actually the,
you just become more mindful.

201
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,330
And that's something that
I hope, you know, is,

202
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,080
is a message I really
want to get out there.

203
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,790
So what is the impact of this kind
of Hashtag eating clean or you know,

204
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,430
what, where does it come into?
How does it become Orthorexia?

205
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,800
So orthorexia as we said is kind of,

206
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,520
it's the obsession with eating
correctly is with eating pure.

207
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,540
And the problem is what might
start off as a really innocent,

208
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm just going to try and make myself
feel a bit better. I'm just going to eat,

209
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,660
just kind of talk chart, try
and cut out, maybe, you know,

210
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,360
cut out the takeaways or cuts out,
um,

211
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,790
the biscuits and cakes
every day or whatever it is.
That's fine. We all do that.

212
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,730
I have weeks where I go, oh my
goodness, I've eaten so much chocolate.

213
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:43,030
I really need to have two weeks where
I don't eat very much. That's normal.

214
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,781
That's not me.

215
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:48,100
Being obsessive when it becomes obsessive
is actually when you cannot deviate.

216
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,040
So when you start restricting and you,

217
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,630
you basically cannot deviate and it
starts having impact on things like your

218
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,770
social life.

219
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,100
So sadly I see lots of people that come
in to clinic and they think they're fit

220
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:07,060
and healthy. They think that, you
know, they're doing everything right,

221
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,730
but when they can't join
in with their friends.

222
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,940
And I personally find that really very
sad because for me food is more than just

223
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:19,330
fuel. Food is about relationships,
it's about networking,

224
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:23,800
it's about bringing people together. And
it's so important is kind of, you know,

225
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,690
when I sit at a table I can often spot
someone who's got food anxiety because

226
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,260
they're not joining in. They're so fixated
on whether they can eat this or not.

227
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:36,640
[inaudible] they kind of miss out on
that real kind of connectivity time.

228
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:41,050
With that, you know, with the people you
want to be with. I know when I'm, I'm my,

229
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,800
my job takes me all over the country
and Archie in different to different

230
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:48,550
countries as well. And I really miss
out on that time with my friends.

231
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:53,350
So usually the first thing I do when I
get back into the UK or back home is kind

232
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:56,710
of organize a meal out with some friends.
I don't care what we're eating,

233
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,170
I'm just there because I actually want
to spend some time with my friends.

234
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,180
But it's just nice to
do over food and wine.

235
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,760
So for me that's a really important thing.

236
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,050
So the problem we have is once you've
got somebody that's following these very

237
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:09,100
strict food rules,

238
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:13,030
they follow it because it makes them
feel very safe and controlled. It's,

239
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,330
it gives them something to,
to fixate on and focus on.

240
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,050
But it can also then start to create those
like vitamin and mineral deficiencies.

241
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,160
So if you go dairy free and
you don't replace it correctly,

242
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,440
you will end up with maybe a deficiency
in calcium and also potentially

243
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:30,274
phosphorous.

244
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,230
These are really important for bone
and teeth and also muscle contraction.

245
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,300
So that can be a problem.
You might if you decide to go gluten free,

246
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,540
you actually might find you
don't eat as much. Whole grain.

247
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,750
Actually whole grains are really
important for the gut biome.

248
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,800
And we all are hearing loads more about
how important the gut biome is and how

249
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:53,900
that can help your mental health and
how that can also help your digestive

250
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:58,010
system. But again, people don't realize
that these things are really important.

251
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,960
So from my point of view,

252
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:04,310
what people set out to kind of think
they're going to be healthier actually

253
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:07,490
makes them more unhealthy.
And this is what Orthorexia is.

254
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,450
And the problem is they can't step away
from it. They find it too difficult.

255
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,810
So I guess the question is why?
Why do some people,

256
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:21,110
like if you, if we, you know, we're in
it, we're in a room here full of people.

257
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,670
Not everybody in this room is ever going
to have any issues. Like often people,

258
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,550
like we said earlier, we'll want to, you
read all these new things, you think, oh,

259
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,590
I'll take a bit of that. But I'm
not bothered about that. Like,

260
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:33,050
if somebody said to me that you can
never eat chocolate again, I'd be,

261
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:37,040
I'd be completely and utterly
kind of distraught. So, you know,

262
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,960
but that's just,
that's just me.

263
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,520
So why do some people look
for thirdly answer? Well,

264
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,890
it's really about your
personality type. And again,

265
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,560
I'm not saying that everybody has got
this personality type is going to develop

266
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,620
an eating disorder because if I would
always write in the presentation thinking

267
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,130
that's actually me.
And,

268
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,370
and though I need to be really
careful about that, but, but yeah,

269
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,400
we know from studies that
generally speaking tends to
affect people who are high

270
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:12,100
achievers. They're very determined,
they're very self critical. Um,

271
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,420
they do have an obsessive streak in them.

272
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,440
That's kind of the biggest element of
it. Um, and they're very sensitive.

273
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,070
So what happens is that they
have that kind of, that,

274
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,080
that perfect framework for
where things can go wrong.

275
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,290
And like I said,
not everybody will.

276
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,720
And I think it's really important
that that I highlight that, you know,

277
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,520
you could have all those,
like I said,

278
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:36,890
you can have a work mostly on traits
and actually be completely fine.

279
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,630
A lot of it is to do about your
experience. So as we go through life,

280
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:46,220
we all experience different situations,
different circumstances,

281
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,620
and we interpret that in our own way.

282
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,650
It's our perceptions and it's those
perceptions that can then start to create

283
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:55,160
this very negative mindset.

284
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,750
And that's where you then find that
people are looking for something to help

285
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:00,830
them make them feel better.

286
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,200
And it's much easier to look
at food training, you know,

287
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:09,500
some other element is much easy to focus
on that and go, well, if I control that,

288
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:13,310
I'm going to feel so much better when
actually what they don't appreciate is

289
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:17,000
that a lot of the issues are going on
with inside them because they're high

290
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:20,570
achievers because they're people that
are always wanted to do the best.

291
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,380
They never know when that's enough.
They never know when that,

292
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,630
when they've hit that ceiling
and actually they're very,

293
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,940
very bad at accepting failure.

294
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,220
And this is why actually I see this a lot
in athletes because they are that very

295
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,690
driven personality type.

296
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,760
They hate failing obviously because
obviously to be a Olympic or Paralympic

297
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:44,990
athlete you have to to to kind of, you
don't need, you don't want to fail.

298
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,350
But actually the way I interpreted it
with my athletes is, but you know what?

299
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,780
It doesn't matter.
You learn from every experience.

300
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,810
So if you didn't do that well this
time, let's, let's, let's come,

301
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,990
let's reflect on it and work out what
went wrong and then we try and fix it for

302
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:58,824
next time.

303
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,330
And these are things I'd love to be seeing
in schools more because this sort of

304
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:07,090
mindset will develop in a school. This
is, you know, when you're, you're in,

305
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,880
you think about teenage boys,

306
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:12,750
teenage girls and the bullying and the
kind of chastising and stuff that can

307
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:15,510
happen.
This is when these things can be set up.

308
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,030
So while that might not be the
time you develop your problem,

309
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,690
if you are somebody that struggles with
your sense of self and your sense of

310
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:22,650
self confidence,

311
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,370
a lot of these things will be happening
a lot younger and it's only when you get

312
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:30,480
to a certain point there'll be one
particular thing that will trigger it.

313
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,890
But actually the,
the,

314
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:35,220
the process has started very early on
and that's why it's such a difficult

315
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:39,870
condition as well to help
because sometimes the feelings
and the emotions are so

316
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:43,320
deeply ingrained,
it's really hard to step away from it.

317
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,710
And it's much easier to focus on trying
to eat clean and the pure then actually

318
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:53,790
deal with that real negative kind of
emotion that's going on inside you because

319
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,110
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

320
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,680
So worried said all threats
in a session with being pure.

321
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:06,570
And Steve Bartman was the, was the, was
the MD that kind of um, identified it.

322
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,600
So what I wanted to do was give you a
little bit of an idea of what goes on in

323
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:15,120
the mind, like how it works because
none of this is intentional.

324
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,410
That's the other thing is that nobody
goes out to develop an eating disorder

325
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:21,780
because it's really a
very miserable place. Um,

326
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,440
but a lot of it is about just not feeling
that you're doing enough. You know, you,

327
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:30,750
you kind of like, you know, I don't
feel like I'm performing my best.

328
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,060
Well we could probably all say
that at some point. We can,

329
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:35,700
we already precut probably all
thing we could have done better,

330
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,500
but it's when you start acting on it,

331
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,600
when you think I need to do
something to change it, you know,

332
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:42,930
everybody else around me is so great
and it's when you do that constant

333
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,040
comparison. And I always say
to again, people I work with,

334
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,070
especially the younger teenagers
that I tend to work with,

335
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,480
there's a lot of comparisons.

336
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:56,220
And that's another way social media can
really come into play is that, well,

337
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:59,460
they're prettier than me. They're, they're
more successful than I am. They're,

338
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,880
you know, they've got, it looks
like they've got it all. Um,

339
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,700
I'll tell you funny story
many cause actually I went
through something like that

340
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:09,480
very similar yesterday but I'll tell you
about in a minute. But um, it was um,

341
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,890
but the problem is you can never compare
yourself to anybody else because we are

342
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:17,970
all unique. We are all individuals
and there is nobody else.

343
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,570
There's nobody else like me out there.
But I don't think there is a,

344
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,790
but there's nobody else like me. There's
nobody else like yourselves out there.

345
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,480
So comparing yourself to somebody
else is just a few tower way of making

346
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:28,620
yourself feel worse.

347
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,760
You can only actually
compare yourself to yourself.

348
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,380
So whenever I start to doubt things,
which is quite often I will stink. Well,

349
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,660
compared to a week ago,

350
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,930
I've now achieved this
compared to a month ago,

351
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,030
I'm on a power and that's a much more
kind of acceptable and more Cook Self

352
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,010
Compassionate Way, I guess of, of
looking at it. So the problem is though,

353
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,240
when you don't feel good enough,

354
00:20:55,241 --> 00:21:00,240
you're searching for something to make
yourself feel better. And often it does.

355
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,400
You know, in, in Orthorexia it's very
much about, well, if I eat better,

356
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:06,700
I'll feel better. We've all heard Evan
and we and we see all the books, you know,

357
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,510
eat this and you'll glow or do this
and you'll have loads of energy.

358
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,261
We all see it.

359
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:14,650
And of course we buy into that
because we're looking for an answer.

360
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,080
The thing is the answers within us,

361
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,270
because until you accept yourself
and be comfortable with who you are,

362
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:26,350
it's really difficult to move forward
from this. And this is why when you,

363
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,310
if you do notice these traits or
these symptoms or these kind of,

364
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:34,510
these emotions in people you
care about or even in yourselves,

365
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,400
please try and get some help early on
because actually the longer you stay in

366
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:40,240
this cycle,

367
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,600
the more entrenched these food rules
become and the more impact they start to

368
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:45,730
have and the harder it
gets to step out of it,

369
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,030
the harder it gets because the anxiety
of stepping out of it is just too

370
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,270
difficult to bear.

371
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,660
So the way I tend to kind of describe it
is that you're almost sitting on a box

372
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:58,871
of emotions.

373
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:02,590
It's like you're sitting on it so that
you don't let any of those negative

374
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:06,160
emotions come out. You don't want to
deal with them is like, absolutely.

375
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,950
When you soaked go through recovery,

376
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,970
you do have to jump off that box and
you have to let the emotions out,

377
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,990
which does mean you sent tend to
start to feel very uncomfortable.

378
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,210
Now I suffer with anxiety massively.

379
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,260
The anxiety I felt as I came off the
chip and walk to the Google offices.

380
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:26,050
I cannot tell you I, I'm I, you know,

381
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:30,010
I do really struggle with anxiety but
I've learned to manage it because I know

382
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,520
that it will pass because it does pass.

383
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,230
But it's very hard if you're somebody
who never allows herself to feel it

384
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,740
because you're constantly worried
about what we're going to be awful.

385
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:44,590
It's going to catastrophic cause
that's what the, the anxious mind does.

386
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,620
A cactus cat tracker
catastrophize is everything.

387
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,210
And so you don't want to do that.

388
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:54,220
But actually the only way to move
forward is to be comfortable with the

389
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:56,890
uncomfortable.
Similarly,

390
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,000
when you challenge negative
behavior with behavior,

391
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,860
that's when you change. But it's all
very, it is difficult. It's a long,

392
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:10,150
long process.
So

393
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,880
obviously when it comes to Orthorexia,
if,

394
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:20,350
when I'm working with people is trying
to help people understand that healthy

395
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:24,190
eating is not just about
what you put into your body.

396
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:26,800
It's not just about what's
on your plate at one time.

397
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,750
It's actually about the collection
probably over two to three weeks. So,

398
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,520
you know, you have a few bad days, so,
right, it's not the end of the world.

399
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,760
It doesn't mean you failed. It doesn't
mean you're a bad person. It's just,

400
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,590
you know,
it's a bit busy.

401
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,560
It's Christmas or it's
birthdays or actually you've
gone on holiday, that's okay.

402
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,590
It's fine to relax because the norm is
that you normally probably eat really

403
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:53,750
well most of the other times.
And then it all balances out.

404
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,140
So I try and actually really educate a
healthy attitude to eating rather than

405
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:04,820
healthy eating is actually a
healthy attitude to eating.
And I just think, again,

406
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,540
when we're teaching in schools and,

407
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:11,690
and kind of even in universities
where this is a really big problem,

408
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,680
that's what we should be teaching and
educating people is not always about,

409
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,490
you know,

410
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,890
the kind of the wheel and this is what
healthy eating is actually about the

411
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,730
attitude because that's what is
going to help people move forward.

412
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,760
So my final slide really kind of is that

413
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,690
the biggest thing is trying
to be comfortable with who
you are and it really is

414
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:35,040
about self acceptance.

415
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,250
And for some people that takes time
and actually takes a lot of inputs.

416
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:42,750
So majority of the people I work with,

417
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,470
I work alongside a psychologist
or a counselor because
the two things need to go

418
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:51,150
hand in hand. Um, some people can
do it themselves, some people can,

419
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,150
can make it, can turn
it around. But majority,

420
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:56,610
I'd say probably 90% of
the cases I work with,

421
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:01,790
it definitely needs both kind of
nutritional and psychological element and

422
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:04,530
sometimes more psychological
than nutritional.

423
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,200
Any questions?

424
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,293
Yeah,

425
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,610
thank you very much. So it
was really interesting. Um,

426
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,440
I'm going to kick off if that's okay.
So you touched on it earlier about the,

427
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,710
the younger generation
now as sort of adults,

428
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:24,240
I feel that we can make a bit of a better
informed choice and kind of research

429
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:28,220
and the media and things but
with children and kind of um,

430
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,450
I don't know,
secondary school age for example.

431
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:36,070
How do you think the best way is to
talk to her about their diet and to make

432
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:39,460
sure that they can make those educated
choices and then they're not being

433
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:40,720
influenced by the media?

434
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,170
I think one of the biggest things is
teaching them through, through food.

435
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,230
So you know, one of the problems
we have is that when you're in it,

436
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:51,760
like you look at secondary school menus
and things and they're not very good or

437
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:55,000
they're not sorts of comp, they're not
foods that maybe they're familiar with.

438
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,250
And that can be a real problem because,

439
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,550
I mean I've done workshops with young
athletes and we've done practical

440
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:08,340
workshops where I've brought things
like macro and avocado and things and,

441
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:10,240
and some of them are like,
well I've never seen that before.

442
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,330
Or what is it like literally
had no idea and you know,

443
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:17,460
you make them into things that
are palatable and easy to use.

444
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,560
I would never get somebody who's never
had macro to eat macro because I think

445
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:21,520
that's just quite harsh.

446
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:24,190
But actually what we did with the
blended it up and we made it into a macro

447
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:28,240
patty and interestingly,
all the,

448
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,900
all the children that had never had
it, probably only two were like, no,

449
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:34,300
I definitely don't like it. But the
rest of them were really like, oh.

450
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,000
And they went home and they were like,
I want to have this again.

451
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,920
So I think food needs to be quite a big
part of education in schools because I

452
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:44,610
think there's, there's a
lot of, it's, it's kind of,

453
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:46,650
sometimes it's like something that you
should just have to do and you'd have to

454
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:49,890
give the kids. But actually if we
feed our kids properly in schools,

455
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,940
they'll also concentrate better. We'll
get better productivity because again,

456
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:57,270
we know that if they don't
eat at lunchtime because
they don't like what they

457
00:26:57,271 --> 00:27:00,150
see,
then they're either eat loads of sugar,

458
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,350
which is going to make them kind of
peak and trough or they'll just skip it.

459
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,550
And the problem then is these are the
things that then start to create this kind

460
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:11,760
of negative relationship with food.

461
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:15,840
Because if you do have somebody who's
very vulnerable and they start skipping

462
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:17,070
lunch because they don't like it,

463
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,270
that becomes a behavior and that
becomes an acceptable behavior to them.

464
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,860
The problem we then have is that can then
kind of go into their other aspects of

465
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:28,530
their life. And before you know
what you do have somebody who's,

466
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:30,030
who kind of doesn't
really know about food.

467
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,520
So I think education's really important,

468
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:34,920
but not just what you
teach in the classroom.

469
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,980
Actually getting in there and and kind
of getting the kids to work with food,

470
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:44,130
taste, food, try different things.
But equally I think as I said,

471
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,140
there needs to be a lot
more on your sense of self,

472
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,060
especially as a teenager.
I mean,

473
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,630
God is probably one of the worst times
ever when you were a teenager, isn't it?

474
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,140
Because everything's changing.
You don't feel great,

475
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:02,910
you don't look great and we all know
that you will get through it and you do,

476
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,220
you know,
you do eventually look fine,

477
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,190
but at that point it's really,

478
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:11,910
really hard and you're so self
critical and I think that's,

479
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,230
that's something I would love to do more
of in schools is really kind of look at

480
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:19,770
how we promote a positive sense of self
because I don't feel there's enough of

481
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,150
that going on if I'm honest.

482
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,470
What is your opinion on every
diet that is based on calories?

483
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,990
When I went there like a year ago,

484
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:34,600
I spent three months on having a certain
amount of calories I could eat every

485
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:38,790
day. Meaning I was waiting everything
that I was cooking and I could only cook.

486
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,960
I could not go outside.

487
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,130
Not it was with like feedback.
Um,

488
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,740
and like taking a step back
on it. It sounds awful. Um,

489
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,400
but I've been there
and I'm wondering like,

490
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,460
what is your perspective on this?

491
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:56,540
There's like so many ways this
can go wrong. Yeah, actually.

492
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,210
So I actually very rarely talk about
calories when I work with my clients

493
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,760
because you're right, it
becomes obsessive. Again,

494
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:08,640
if you're working with
somebody who is obsessive,

495
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,520
as soon as you give them a number
or something to fixate on it,

496
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,790
it's what happens. And,
and at the end of the day,

497
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,470
the body is really quite,
um, it's quite an amazing,

498
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,000
it's very good at regulating.
If you, if you, if you let it,

499
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,370
it will work for you really well.
And that's again,

500
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:30,990
another big message I will say to people
is that if you just listen to your body,

501
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,720
it actually does tell you what
you need when you need it.

502
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,050
It's just that we've lost the art of
doing that because there's so much,

503
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,890
there's so much information, you know,
like, like for example, the sugar stuff,

504
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,160
everybody's trying not to eat sugar
because we've heard how bad it is for us.

505
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,450
But actually there are times when the
body and the brain can only work on sugar.

506
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,250
And so if you deprive yourself,
if you start to restrict
yourself, the body, we'll,

507
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,900
we'll kind of work against you.

508
00:29:55,901 --> 00:30:00,670
So what I often find is when
people severely restrict
their calorie intake less

509
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:01,840
than what they need,
now,

510
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,960
everybody in this room will have
a very different requirement.

511
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:07,510
But when they restrict their
carer less of what they need,

512
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,560
the problem you then have is
that when food becomes available,

513
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,700
the the body will try and eat to
access because it will say, well,

514
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:17,980
hang on a minute, I don't know
when you're going to feed me again.

515
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,820
So I'm going to take on as many calories
as I can that then then set up this

516
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,890
real negative cycle of,
Oh my God,

517
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:27,760
I've just eaten so much and that
it restricts again, and, and,

518
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:31,390
and actually what you need to do in
these situations is regulate your eating.

519
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,600
So I tend to educate people on getting
the correct balance of carbohydrates,

520
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:41,350
proteins, whole grains, fruits,
vegetables at mealtimes and snacks.

521
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:43,960
I'm not anti snacks.
I always have to eat every three hours,

522
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:48,340
otherwise I fall apart. So, you know,
I'm not anti any of those things. Um,

523
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,560
but it's right for you as an individual
because if you are somebody that say

524
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,900
doesn't x does exercise an hour a day,

525
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,410
your requirements are going to be much
higher than somebody that just sits at

526
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:00,520
their desk all day long.

527
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:05,790
And I think this is where we do get
some problems because we as Dietitians,

528
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,250
we talked very much about
moderation and balance.

529
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:12,910
And of course that's really boring.
It's not sexy. It's not exciting.

530
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:15,970
It's just a dull word and it is.
Um,

531
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,840
but balance is about what's right for you.

532
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,050
Now I have to be careful because
I don't get people saying, yeah,

533
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:26,560
but I don't need to eat sugar than ever.
Cause that's what balance is for me.

534
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:27,610
But that's not what I mean.

535
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:32,110
Balance is when I say that it's actually
about giving your body what it needs,

536
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:36,040
but also allowing yourself
to have the things you want.

537
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,240
Because when you suddenly go,
I do want that,

538
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:41,590
but I can't have it.

539
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,920
You set up a whole new mindset going
on almost like a deprivation cycle.

540
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,910
So it can go one or the other way.

541
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,840
You can either you end up people who
would just want that food and that's all

542
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,880
they can think about and they're
going to just eat loads of it.

543
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:00,180
Or The opposite side of that is
where it becomes a cozy anxiety.

544
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:04,970
So I think in your case, from what
I hear is that it became quite an,

545
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,550
and you know, if you step even one
calorie over what you were meant to have,

546
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,420
it became,
became a problem or it cause you anxiety.

547
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,200
Should we say not cook made a problem.
Now this is why also I don't like,

548
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't like truckers. I don't like
the online food truckers because one,

549
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,600
it's really difficult to get the right
thing of what you're eating and kind of

550
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:26,434
make it work.

551
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,500
The other thing is how does that tracker
know the actually today it might be the

552
00:32:33,771 --> 00:32:36,730
actually depending on,
on what's going on for you hormonally,

553
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,470
depending on what's going
on for you mentally.

554
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,560
Actually that day you do need a bit
more. The truck, uh, can't tell you that,

555
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,250
but your body can.
So when I reeducate people,

556
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:50,960
it really is about helping
them to see that eating is,

557
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,550
should be fun and enjoyable. And actually
the balance is kind of very much,

558
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:59,750
my principal is very much 80% of the
time I try and eat as well as I can,

559
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,040
which does mean that if I then wanted
to have a glass of wine or pudding or

560
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:07,340
chocolate, then I can and I
don't worry about it at all.

561
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,670
And that I would use for anybody whether
they're doing read loads of exercise or

562
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:14,480
whether they're not because you can,
it's, it's proportional to what you do.

563
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,370
Does that answer your question?

564
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,713
It does.

565
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,970
Hi. Uh, I have a question about
what you talked about too earlier.

566
00:33:24,971 --> 00:33:27,640
You kind of made reference to sugar and
how your body doesn't actually know if

567
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:31,570
it's coconut sugar, white sugar, but
is there something in the science,

568
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:33,040
and I'm asking you as a can nutritionist,

569
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,340
is there something in the science of
how your body actually metabolizes that?

570
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:39,640
Cause you do see that some sugars are
processed by your body differently,

571
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,480
such as raising your glycaemic
index, for example. Yeah.

572
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,000
Could you speak more to that? Yeah,
so yeah, I mean obviously some, yeah,

573
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,870
some do have a slightly
different glycaemic index,

574
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:52,710
but if you look at all the sugars
that we've been exposed to,

575
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,870
the differences my minute,

576
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,370
because at the end of the day they are
all simple sugars so they all affect your,

577
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,210
your, your blood sugars in
the same way. So um, so yeah,

578
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,240
things like honey for example might
have a slightly left glycemic load than

579
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:09,234
table sugar,

580
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,110
but we're not talking enough to make
the difference that we're being,

581
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,390
we're being told that. I think that's
the thing that it's really important to,

582
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,640
to understand is that the,

583
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,390
the messages were getting about being
sugar free and only eating honey and only

584
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:26,310
eating maple syrup, et Cetera, et cetera.

585
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,500
Actually then they're not significant
enough for it to be that to make that

586
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,720
change.
I have one more question.

587
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,890
Sorry,
I'm going back into your 80 20 rule,

588
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:41,490
but she just spoke about is there a
danger and people creating morality around

589
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:45,150
food. Then being like, oh, this is part
of that 20 or oh this is part of that 80.

590
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,500
I can eat freely for it.

591
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,790
Like do you see that that could also be
a kind of session or something like a

592
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:52,050
trigger in itself?

593
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,040
It's really good question.

594
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:56,950
I've never seen that because I
don't ever really spell it out.

595
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,460
It's kind of how I tend to,
I don't sit there going,

596
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,940
oh well I've eaten really well
for 80% of the day to day,

597
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:06,640
so now I can have my piece of chocolate.
I don't do it like that.

598
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,410
I kind of look at it overall.

599
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,850
So I tend to sort of know that
actually I do that naturally.

600
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,450
I don't have to think about,
it's kind of just what I do. Um,

601
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,830
so when I work with people,

602
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:22,450
I very rarely use percentages or numbers
because I know and then that becomes

603
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:25,660
obsessive and we kind of move away
from that. It really is about,

604
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:29,060
it's actually more about
that attitude to food. The,

605
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,750
I try and really work on
that kind of behavior change.

606
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,980
Um,
I think just

607
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,040
to go back to your
question about calories,

608
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,170
like when I found really
interesting about, um,

609
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:47,070
calorie restriction is that my
flatmate does it, and anyways,

610
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,380
it's a whole thing. But, um,

611
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,380
she will have her a certain amount
of calories for the day and then, um,

612
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,820
but she'll eat whatever she wants to make
up those calories. So I might eat way,

613
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,780
way, way more calories than she had, way,
way more, but more calories. But it'll be,

614
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:05,340
you know, through, you know, lean
protein and whole grains and whatever,

615
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,730
whereas somebody else might need way less
calories, but it could all be crisps.

616
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,840
Um,
so I,

617
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:14,010
what I find really interesting is like
the idea that when you restrict yourself,

618
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,281
you know,

619
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:17,250
we talk a lot about this stuff that you're
not getting the nutrients you're not

620
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:18,810
getting,
but is it,

621
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,590
does it also work the other way that you
might be getting too much of something?

622
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:26,370
Like people who aren't eating any
sugar, dairy or green, you know,

623
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,810
they're obviously not
getting those things,

624
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,950
but are they getting too much
protein and too much, um, you know,

625
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,750
other nutrients that,

626
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:35,970
because they're trying to make
up for what they're not eating,

627
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,070
like almost too much of the good stuff.
Is that kind of possible too?

628
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:39,840
I think.

629
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,270
I think the whole thing about balance
is that obviously if you increase your

630
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:47,570
intake of any other food group,
you would display something else.

631
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,810
So one of the things I really struggled
with when I'm working with athletes is

632
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:54,620
because they're trying to be healthy
and they're eating loads of vegetables.

633
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,690
They don't get enough carbohydrate,

634
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,280
they don't get enough energy in to be
able to perform because they're trying to

635
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:04,280
be good. And so, so that's
what I mean, like, you know,

636
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:07,970
it's kind of trying to get that balance
for everybody as an individual. So yeah,

637
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:09,920
you're quite right. Because
the thing is, again,

638
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,960
everybody's body will always be
trying to reach energy balance.

639
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,430
So no matter where you're at,

640
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,770
whether you're at the weight you want
to be or whether you're not the way you

641
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:19,604
want to be,

642
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,510
your body will always be working towards
getting energy balance to basically

643
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:24,830
maintain where you're at.

644
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,160
So that's why often when you do decide
to go on a very restrictive diet,

645
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,660
you can probably do it two or three days,

646
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,230
unless you're very extreme and obsessive.
And then you suddenly go to,

647
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:38,660
I can't do this anymore because
I'm just exhausted and an eye,

648
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,480
I'm hungry and I'm going to eat
that burger or whatever it is.

649
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,290
And you almost go the opposite extreme
because the body is always working

650
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:48,420
against that. It's trying to
keep you alive. Remember that,

651
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:51,980
that that's what the body's innate
thing is, is trying to keep you alive.

652
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:56,060
So when people do restrict calories,
it will slow down or the processes.

653
00:37:56,061 --> 00:38:01,061
So the thing I see a lot is it's
those silent things you don't see.

654
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,810
So for example,

655
00:38:02,811 --> 00:38:07,100
when somebody is on a very restrictive
diet and they restrict their calories,

656
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,920
the body slows down the digestive system.
So that can have a real,

657
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,950
a real impact on how your
body works in that respect.

658
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,030
It will, in females, it
will reduce estrogen.

659
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,870
So menstruation will stop because of
what he's going, well, hang on a minute.

660
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,680
I can't,

661
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,330
there's no way I can fall pregnant and
we produce now because there's not enough

662
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:32,360
energy in the system.
So it doesn't actually affect your weight.

663
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:35,560
And that's what's really interesting is
because the body will actually slow else

664
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:39,790
down to keep you alive. So it will,
you'll find that you can't concentrate,

665
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:42,490
you get cold, you know, you can't, you,

666
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,360
you can't really think straight.
It was all those different things.

667
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:49,480
You can't sleep. That's a big one. Um,

668
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,450
and that's something that people don't
always realize that actually when you

669
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,420
restrict your intake,
the body is doing everything it can to,

670
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,390
to kind of work against it so quickly.

671
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,830
One thing to pick up on though is
really interesting is that you're right,

672
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:05,920
some people don't change
in weight and they,

673
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,330
they stay the same and they
might not eat the best way.

674
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,190
They might literally make up their
calorie through Mcdonald burgers or,

675
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:18,610
or whatever. Um, their choice,
but that's not good either.

676
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,800
And that's not what I'm promoting either.
You know,

677
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:23,410
it really is about if
you eat the right things,

678
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:27,790
if you base your meals around wholegrains
and complex carbs and lean proteins,

679
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:30,900
you will feel full, you
will feel better. Um,

680
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,990
but that also means there is then room
for those little indulgences if you want

681
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:37,660
them. I think that's kind of the
message trying to get across.

682
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,410
Hi. Hi. And then we talk
about alternative milks.

683
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:49,870
What about something like goat's milk?
Is that as good as cow's milk or is that,

684
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,100
yeah,
I mean goat's milk

685
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,690
is fairly similar in composition
to cow's milk. So if I'm honest,

686
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:59,500
when I work with somebody that can't
really realistically can't have milk,

687
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,910
just just has a lactose intolerance or
a dairy intolerance or dairy allergy,

688
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,790
then you have to find them
something because you need
to get the calcium in. Um,

689
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,780
some people, goat's milk, we'll work,
it comes down to the protein or the,

690
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:13,840
all the sugar in the milk depending on,
on what the problem is.

691
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:18,460
So for some people, goat's milks fine.
Sheep's milk, good for other people.

692
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:22,210
Even those, there's so much crossover
with the proteins that if they are,

693
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,270
if it's that particular
protein that they can't digest,

694
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,650
then you have to find another alternative.
So in some cases it's Sawyer,

695
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,120
but we also know there's 40% it's for
people with severe dairy allergies,

696
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,430
there's 40% crossover.

697
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,780
So a lot of people that can't
have dairy can't have Sawyer.

698
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,720
And that's where it becomes problematic
because also then you're looking,

699
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,460
then you do end up looking something
like almond or, oh, um, and I said,

700
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:50,650
I don't have a problem
with people doing that.

701
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:55,651
But what annoys me is the man marketing
that it's on par because nutritionally

702
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:56,921
it's not.

703
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,620
So you just have to make sure that you
get your nutrition from somewhere else.

704
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,513
That's all.

705
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,760
Okay.

706
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,600
I have a lot of friends who swear by
intermittent fasting just eating two meals

707
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:13,340
a day and they're just
starving for 15 hours.

708
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,870
And that's something that I don't believe
in and I don't feel in the right place

709
00:41:17,871 --> 00:41:19,580
to tell them that they're
starving themselves.

710
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:24,050
But do you have any specific
advice for this area?

711
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:29,300
In a lot of the ideas you say kind of
contradicts that this is good for you.

712
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:30,134
So yeah,

713
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,040
again, intimate and fasting is one
of those ones that's been really,

714
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,630
it's been around for a long time,

715
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,080
but it became its heyday probably a
couple of years ago with the five two and

716
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,940
you know, and and that kind of thing. I'm,

717
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,710
I'm going to say I do use
intermittent fasting in some athletes,

718
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,270
but not in the five to,

719
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,300
because I don't believe in two days a
week where you eat only 500 calories

720
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:55,820
because your body is just
not in a happy place at all.

721
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:00,800
But what I do sometimes do for athletes
who were knee to particular body

722
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,860
composition or or wait and it's
just giving it is giving them a rule

723
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:06,920
unfortunately, but it helps them. You
do it for a very short period of time.

724
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,270
But what we do is,

725
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:12,110
is actually the intimate and foster and
where they eat for eight hours a day.

726
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,920
So we say between 12 and eight
and then they'll have 15 you know,

727
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:20,921
they'll have like the 16 hours of fostered
because we know scientifically that's

728
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:24,320
quite a useful way of
helping athletes meet weight.

729
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,700
But with anything I do like that it's
monitored and supervised and it's only

730
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:33,080
done for a very short period of time.
So with your friends doing the kind of,

731
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,100
if they're doing sort of
two meals a day and, and,

732
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,330
and that's all they're doing for start,
that's not intimate and fasting,

733
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:42,200
that's just fasting because intimate
and fast and would mean they do

734
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,780
intermittently. So they'd have
some days where they, well,

735
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:47,090
and other days where they
eat very restrictive.

736
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:51,230
I think what's interesting is that when
you look now at the data that's coming

737
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:52,064
through,

738
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,990
the people that were very big advocates
of the five two are struggling to

739
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,620
maintain it. It's not sustainable
because you then have two,

740
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,770
maybe three days a week where
you can't actually focus.

741
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:07,020
You can't actually contract.
You can't be productive. Um,

742
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,430
and that because your body
won't be on 500 calories a day.

743
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:15,440
So it's hard when you've got friends
and you're watching them and you want to

744
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:20,210
say something. Um, and I
think the only way you can
sometimes do things is, is, is,

745
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,680
is give them some sort of
tangible data. Like, you know,

746
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,130
did you notice that you
made a mistake there?

747
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:26,600
Or did you notice that you haven't got,

748
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:29,330
you're really tired or you're actually
really irritable and it's not much fun to

749
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:33,050
be around. It's, it's, I mean, you have
to be careful how you say that, obviously,

750
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:36,770
but, but it's that kind of is
that kind of thing. I mean with,

751
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,460
I mean they're often the
opening conversations I have
with a lot of my clients.

752
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,670
I don't go straight in there and go,
you've got a problem with food.

753
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,600
It's very much about asking those open
questions like, what's going on for you?

754
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:50,780
Like, why are you following that?
What, where, where's that come from?

755
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:53,750
Because it's really important to hear why?

756
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:58,340
Because that's something that they feel
really passionate about and you don't

757
00:43:58,341 --> 00:44:00,340
want to sort of kind of belittle.

758
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,670
You want to encourage them to open
and talk to you. So as a practitioner,

759
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,540
building trust with my
clients is the first step.

760
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,900
And then after that you can start to
then kind of really tackle some of the,

761
00:44:14,171 --> 00:44:17,570
the kind of what's going on for you.
Cause you'll probably find the, again,

762
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,420
there's a reason why your
friends are doing that.

763
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:24,890
If they are trying to maintain a certain
weight or be a certain way or look a

764
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:28,280
certain way, where does that
stem from? What's that about?

765
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,430
That's kind of how I'd go about it.
And Yeah.

766
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,770
Any more questions from anybody?
No. Thank you so much for coming in.

767
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,870
We really appreciate it.
