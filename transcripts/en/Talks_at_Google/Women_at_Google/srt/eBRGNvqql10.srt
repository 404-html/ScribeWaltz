1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,020
I'm really excited to introduce
some more into lamb today.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,810
She is here to discuss
your personal brand,

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,250
why it's important and what you
can do with it as some more.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,800
The lamb is the founder of some
more insulin coaching as a coach,

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,990
and first generation professionals.

She has worked with over 1000
clients to assess their career goals,

9

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,720
and manage their professional development.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,760
She's committed to and
involved in diversity and
inclusion initiatives and is a

12
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:44,020
frequent featured speaker and moderator

00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:47,290
topics such as managing cultural code,
switching,

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,750
supporting first generation professionals,

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,680
sponsoring women of color and
developing leadership skills.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,850
She has provided pro bono legal
services helping refugees,

generation professionals,
women of color and other diverse groups.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,330
Let's join in welcoming some
more insulin to the stage.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,050
Raise your hand if you
wake up feeling every day.

21
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:23,710
I can't wait to be my awesome self at work
here.

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,720
A lot of chuckles. No, raise your
hand if you want a wake, a feeling.

23
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,740
I can't wait to be my authentic
self at work. Awesome.

24
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:33,150
I've got everybody on there.

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,320
Welcome to authentically you taking
charge of your personal brand.

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,150
And before we dive into the program,

27
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:43,180
I want to take a moment to thank a
few people who made this happen. Uh,

28
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,430
neelay Mitchell, Kelsey bunch or an
Emily sorts for making this happen.

29
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:49,530
I know you guys are really busy.
Um,

30
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,560
and the fact that you're
taking this initiative to put
this together means a lot.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,190
So if you guys can stand up, um, and if
we can just give them a round of applause

32
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,550
for their hard work.

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,680
I'm going to also want to thank
Google for providing this.

34
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:09,480
I think it's amazing that a company as
great as Google that's known to be one of

35
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:10,291
the greatest employers,

36
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,310
it's still continuing to invest in its
employees by providing a space and the

37
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,870
resources to make this happen.

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,990
So we can just give uncle Google
a big round of applause too.

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,230
And I also want to take the time to
acknowledge each and every one of you for

40
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:29,680
coming live and also, um, uh,

41
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,550
connecting via live stream.
I know all of you are incredibly busy.

42
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:36,720
I was just hearing about your
long commutes for some of you. Um,

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,900
and you could be out there taking pictures
with the I bought or going to the gym.

44
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:44,920
And the fact that you're here says a lot
about you and your commitment to your

45
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:47,200
career.
So a big round of applause for you.

46
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,010
Um, I don't want to take this opportunity
to do something that I think we often

47
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:57,760
don't do, especially for people who
are high performers like yourself.

48
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,100
That's the reason why you're
at a organization like Google.

49
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,300
So I want you to trust me with this.

50
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,580
If you can raise your hands really
wide and while you're added,

51
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,950
try not to talk to person on the right
or left and just to give yourself a big

52
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:13,690
hug and say, I'm so awesome. I couldn't
hear you. Let's do together again.

53
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:18,130
One more time. One, two,
three. I am so awesome.

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,820
Yeah. And that's just a great reminder
for yourself. I love seeing the smile.

55
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:26,580
It's just that can give
you so much energy. I think
sometimes we're in Britain,

56
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,930
the busier doing and getting things done,

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,650
you forget to acknowledge how
amazing you are and how far you come.

58
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:36,640
So if you just have this practice once
a day, maybe first thing in the morning,

59
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,710
that'll really help jumpstart your day.

60
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,510
So when I started my career,
um,

61
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,950
I struggled very much in my career.

62
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,810
I had this mentality that I have to put
my head down and work really hard and be

63
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:53,590
humble and not bother anybody because
everybody's really busy who can relate to

64
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:57,880
this. Ah, it was like everybody in
the room, everybody is really busy.

65
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,390
And I was the first in my family to go
to college and to go to professional

66
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:04,660
school. They didn't really have anybody
I could talk to to say like, Hey,

67
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,300
I'm running into this issue.
How can I solve that?

68
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,650
So I became known for being really
reliable, really dependable.

69
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,700
And that was great because I got a lot of
good work. How many can relate to that?

70
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,950
That the reward of good work is more work.

71
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,170
It's like everybody in this room,
they're like, yeah, that happens. Um,

72
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,610
but on the flip side,

73
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:28,960
what was not so great about having that
reputation was that on Fridays at 9:00

74
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,470
PM when there was an urgent project,
guess who got to call me?

75
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,860
And I'm assuming a lot of you are
also in that shoes as well, right?

76
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,320
Where you're the ones who are known to
be reliable and so you're getting this

77
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:38,920
call.

78
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,040
And so what happens is it creates a really
frustrating environment where you're

79
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:46,600
feeling tired and overworked
and underappreciated
because people are so busy,

80
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:50,020
they forget to thank you or to really
acknowledge you for your contributions.

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,341
And at the same time,

82
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,310
what I saw is that when it came
time for raises and promotions,

83
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:58,390
I wasn't necessarily getting the
best raises, their best promotions.

84
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,300
And a big part of that was
because I kept my head down.

85
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,610
It didn't talk to anybody and I
didn't want to bother anybody.

86
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:06,910
So nobody knew that I was doing
anything right. Other than that,

87
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,170
I was getting things done
when they needed it done. Um,

88
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,200
and so I found myself in a place where I
was really frustrated and exhausted and

89
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,570
just really wondering what I
was going to do in my career.

90
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,540
How many of you at some point of
your career can relate to that?

91
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,180
It's like almost everybody in here.
Um,

92
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,650
and it wasn't until I worked with a
leadership coach where she helped me to

93
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:30,580
question my assumptions and my values
and what it meant to be humble,

94
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,060
what it meant to be authentic and
what it meant to be a hard worker.

95
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,900
And then to devise some key strategies
where I made some small changes in the

96
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,100
way you interact with people,

97
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,750
that had a huge impact that I was able
to see my life and my career transform.

98
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,550
And I was so inspired by the work that
she was able to do with me and that

99
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,650
inspired me to become a coach.

100
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,130
And now I have the privilege of being
able to help my clients go from being

101
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,460
stuck or frustrated or waking up with
dread or maybe feeling a little bored at

102
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,850
work to go from that space to being at
a place where they're getting that dream

103
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:05,420
job that they want to go into
that space where they wake up,

104
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,450
excited to go to work and they're getting
the promotions and the raises that

105
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,830
they so worked hard for and deserve
and most importantly to be happy.

106
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,610
And I really excited to be here to
share those strategies with you.

107
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,330
We have a short now 45 minutes together,

108
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:22,100
cause I know we started
a little a little late,

109
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,170
so I'm going to give you my best stuff,

110
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,720
but I also know that we won't
be able to cover everything.

111
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,650
I will try to reserve a little bit of
time afterwards for questions and then

112
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:32,990
we'll hang out afterwards if you have
questions that you don't want to ask in

113
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:37,010
the audience and one as privately. Um,
and if you have questions beyond that,

114
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,920
feel free to always email me at
some more and add some more insulin.

115
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,520
coaching.com I do read every
email that comes through. Um,

116
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:47,390
so what we're going to cover today
is what is your personal brand?

117
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,670
Why does your personal brand matter?

118
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,460
How does authenticity fit
with their personal brand?

119
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,110
And then with all that information,

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,390
what do you want to do
without personal brand?

121
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,593
Okay.

122
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,120
So what is a personal brand?
Anybody recognize who that is?

123
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,723
Yeah.

124
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,540
Yeah. Somebody raised their hand. Awesome.
Who is that person? Oh, Bruh. Yes.

125
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,710
Everybody recognizes Oprah. So when
you see Oprah, her picture right here,

126
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:16,440
her name, what are some words
that you associate with her?

127
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,840
Success. What else? Confident.

128
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,623
What was that?

129
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,970
Yeah, she's loved. Yes, she's loved.

130
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,480
So what did the con consistent theme that
you're hearing in the words are being

131
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:37,930
described to Oprah? Would you say
it's positive, negative, or neutral?

132
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,400
Awesome.

133
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,140
Positive. Oprah has a very strong personal
brand. And if you know her backstory,

134
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,510
she started from very humble beginnings,
right?

135
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,830
But she had a strong vision about
who she was and what she stands for,

136
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,210
and now she's been able to build this
amazing empire where in a moment's notice,

137
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:59,530
she can put you on her book club list
and go from an unknown author to be a New

138
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,300
York Times bestseller overnight. Now
some of you might say, well that's cool,

139
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,380
but that's Oprah. What does that
have to do with me? Similarly,

140
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:11,020
in your own career,
if you have a strong personal brand,

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,950
you can really have the ability to make
things happen and to help accelerate

142
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:19,450
your career. Or if you have a negative
association with their brand, guess what?

143
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,890
That can also prevent you from being able
to be promoted or being able to get to

144
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:27,460
work on projects that you might want
to have or even be able to have good

145
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:30,370
relationships with your coworkers.
It's not the value of a brand.

146
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,330
And I want to bring up an example
of one of my recent clients. Um, my,

147
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,910
one of my recent clients
that I worked with,

148
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,570
it's an attorney who works
at a tech company. How many
attorneys are in the room?

149
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,703
I got like,

150
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,310
like one person in the back,
any engineers in the room, ah,

151
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,890
go like all engineers 11,

152
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:51,040
it's going to be like the fight
battle between engineers and lawyers.

153
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,980
So a common story that hear from my
engineering clients is I hate talking to

154
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:59,640
those lawyers who can relate
to that. Like everybody, right?

155
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,780
There are roadblocks [inaudible] they
don't understand the technology and it's

156
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,430
really a waste of time.
Um,

157
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,890
so that's a common response to
hear from my engineering clients.

158
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,130
And then on the other,

159
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,890
countable to hear from my lawyer
clients as those engineers,

160
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,310
they're really smart. They're so
brilliant, they make amazing products,

161
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,550
but they have no clue how they're
screwing our company for millions and

162
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,610
bazillions of dollars because they will
ever talk to us when they're doing these

163
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:27,180
licensing deals or they won't
patent these projects. Right. Um,

164
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:30,570
and so this is a common conversation
that goes on between these two clients.

165
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,450
It's funny because I get to sit behind
closed doors with them and I'm like, wow,

166
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:35,730
this comes up almost
every single instance.

167
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,620
And so what happens is there's a cat and
mouse game where, uh, issue comes up,

168
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:44,610
lawyer calls, engineer, engineer, avoids
lawyer. And that loop kind of goes on,

169
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:48,930
creates a very frustrating situation
and we have basically zero productivity.

170
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,621
And in fact,

171
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:53,310
what I argue is negative productivity
because who would be frustrated in that?

172
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:56,130
How many of you would be frustrated
with that? It's like I see everybody,

173
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,650
almost everybody's hands up. Yes.
It's a frustrating situation.

174
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,580
So what you end up with is energy where
you're spending a lot of time being

175
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:06,780
frustrated with each other and not a lot
gets done and then something big might

176
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,420
go wrong because you're not communicating
and there's a communication breakdown.

177
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,190
So this particular client went in knowing
that this is something that typically

178
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:18,180
happens. And so what we'd devise in terms
of a strategy for him was instead of

179
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:21,810
approaching the engineer's only
when there was a problem, uh,

180
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,690
with the legal issues to actually
go and get to know the engineers.

181
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,650
So this lawyer went to a
lot of the brainstorms. Um,

182
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:30,540
sometimes he understood what's going on.
Sometimes we were like,

183
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,870
I don't know what this is,
but he made friends when he was there.

184
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:38,040
And what he would do with invite these
engineers to go to coffees or to go to

185
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,960
lunches.
And through this process,

186
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,810
what he was able to do is ask
them about their lives, you know,

187
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,620
actually care about them as a human being.
How about that rate?

188
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,510
And then ask them like, what are you
working on? What's going on there?

189
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,520
And point blank say,

190
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,760
what can I as a lawyer and our
legal team do to support you in,

191
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:59,700
to better communicate with you because
we're really here to partner with you and

192
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:03,660
we really want to help you.
Um, and through that process
and through consistent,

193
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:07,920
and this is a key consistent interactions
and this way he was able to develop a

194
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,980
really strong relationship with them.
And so instead,

195
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,660
now when he calls the engineers,

196
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,680
they actually pick up his phone call and
instead of being seen as a roadblock or

197
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,000
he's actually seen as a true partner.
Um,

198
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,280
and what's also really interesting is
that now the engineer's how problems they

199
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:26,820
actually call him and say like,
Hey, are running into this issue.

200
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,260
Do you think you can give us a hand?

201
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,040
And so through those positive
associations with his personal brand,

202
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,610
he was able to transform it from a
negative association of being a negative

203
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:40,440
roadblocks, right? To being somebody
who's positive and a true partnership. Um,

204
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,570
and so he's able to in
his day to day life,

205
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,630
decreased frustration and increased
productivity and have more time to be able

206
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:51,960
to, to rebel in the successes that he
has. And how does that benefit has career,

207
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,810
has supervisors now know him as
somebody who is a problem solver,

208
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,250
who can connect with others?

209
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,850
And so he becomes a goto person when
the legal team needs to work with

210
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,760
engineering team and you can see
that it's a win win for everybody.

211
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,560
So that's pretty amazing, right?
The power of your personal brand.

212
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:14,000
Um, so what I love for us to do
right now is to do an exercise. Um,

213
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,400
and in this exercise,

214
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,960
often what people forget to think about
is how our perceptions of what's going

215
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:23,620
on actually impacts our interaction.
So what I want you to do is to trust me,

216
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,590
is to close your eyes. I make sure
nobody pokes you from the side.

217
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,750
And if somebody does, I'll
go and hit the hand. Um,

218
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,730
and so to think of some colleagues
that you have that you work with,

219
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:35,440
either in your group or
outside of your group,

220
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,510
and then to pick one person in mind,

221
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,130
and if that person had to describe
you using three adjectives,

222
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,040
what are the three adjectives
that's coming to mind?

223
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,373
Yeah.

224
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,940
And I want you to sit with
those adjectives for the
next five to 10 seconds,

225
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,440
a little uncomfortable,

226
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,200
but I want you to feel what that feels
like when you hear those adjectives about

227
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,034
yourself.

228
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,960
Now I want you to open your
eyes and on your handout,

229
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,260
write down what those three
adjectives are in the section.

230
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:13,640
That's what is your personal brand.

231
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,150
So what we're going to do
now as partner activity, um,

232
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,070
I want you to find a partner,
a and a final partner.

233
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,630
Hopefully somebody you don't
talk to regularly because the,

234
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,340
the purpose of these types
of conversations is really
to meet somebody else as

235
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,540
well. Right? So find a
partner. Go ahead and pair up.

236
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,540
If you're on the right side,
my right side,

237
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,050
you'll be partner a if you're partner
a can you raise your hand? Okay.

238
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,960
And then if you're on the left side,
you'll be partner B.

239
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,720
And if you were doing front and back,
the person in front will be a,

240
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:55,280
and the person in back, we'll
be beat. Okay. So if your ace,

241
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:59,050
can you raise your hand?
Okay. So A's in this exercise,

242
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:01,900
what we're going to do is you're
gonna get a chance to, to,

243
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:06,520
to tell your partner what
the three adjectives are and
what feelings came up for

244
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:09,730
you as you were thinking
about these adjectives. And B,

245
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,340
what you're going to do is
practice active listening.

246
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,820
What that means is you don't get to talk,
you don't get to ask questions,

247
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,210
you actually don't even get to make noise.
You can nod your head.

248
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,480
But the idea is to really listen.
And if there is an awkward silence,

249
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,250
sit in that awkwardness, but allow a to
really describe what's going on for them.

250
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,930
Okay.
So you're two minutes starts now.

251
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,213
Okay.

252
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,910
Felt a lot of energy and positivity
and saw a lot of smiles. That's good.

253
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,350
So now be, you did such an
awesome job being a listener.

254
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,090
Guess what? It's your turn to
get to share. And a likewise,

255
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,690
please sit in silence and let the other
person just express their feelings.

256
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:21,800
And if there's awkwardness in the silence,
it's okay. Just let them keep going.

257
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,140
Okay.
So you're two minutes be starts now.

258
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,603
Yeah.

259
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,250
Wow.

260
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,430
So it sounds like there was a lot of
energy and enthusiasm and sharing.

261
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,180
Um, and what I love to hear
is what came up for you.

262
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,770
What were some of the adjectives?
How did it feel to actually share what,

263
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,880
what those agitated,

264
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,390
I just made you feel and what was
it like to be on the listening side?

265
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,630
Do you mind sharing what those two are?

266
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,600
Awesome.
You came back.

267
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,520
Okay. Taking initiative and being very
helpful. So very positive associations.

268
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,730
And when you thought about that about
yourself, how did that make you feel?

269
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,233
All right.

270
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,420
All right. Okay. He's like, um,

271
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,580
that's actually a common experience that
I did is a lot of people often don't

272
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:44,580
take time to really think about the
assumptions that they make about other

273
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:47,620
people and how those people
are perceiving them. Um,

274
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,430
and often the assumptions that we think
that other people are making about us

275
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:54,240
often or not as positive as what those
other people might be thinking because we

276
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,260
tend to be our worst critics. Um, I
love to hear a couple more shares.

277
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,233
Awesome.

278
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,040
Okay.
Okay.

279
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,010
So you thought it was interesting that
you had a more positive association of

280
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:22,130
yourself and your partner had
a more negative association.

281
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,820
Maybe we maybe more self
aware or grilling. Yeah.

282
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,560
More self aware of more
critical. What, what,

283
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:29,420
what was it that you found
interesting about it?

284
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,340
Yeah. Yeah. Um, and you know, here's,

285
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:38,550
here's why these associations
are really important.

286
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,850
It's that if you have a
positive perception that
somebody else thinks you're um,

287
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,670
you know, a good person or easy to
work with, when you see that person,

288
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:51,780
are you more likely to engage with
that? Thumbs up? Yes. Thumbs down, no.

289
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,260
Mostly thumbs up. Yes.
Yeah. Now on the flip side,

290
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,260
if you're like your partner where
you might think like, oh, I don't,

291
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,120
I don't think that person really likes me.

292
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,810
Or it was difficult to work with that
person. When you see that person,

293
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,870
are you going to want to engage with them?
No.

294
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,280
So this is the power of perception about
your own personal brand and this is

295
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:15,150
often a critical piece that people don't
think about is what are the assumptions

296
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:19,140
that are underlying that is impacting
our interactions with others.

297
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,440
And um,

298
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,470
I'll share a really good example of this
is one of my clients I worked with her

299
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:29,640
and she's really amazing across the board
with her peers and her sub ordinance.

300
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,300
She's seen as somebody who's really
amazing, wonderful to work with.

301
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:37,020
How many of you know amazing colleagues
like that? It's like everybody,

302
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:40,410
it's googled course. You've got to
know at least one person like that. Um,

303
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,590
but the thing is that she was being passed
up for promotions and raises all the

304
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:47,970
time. We were like, Huh, that's odd. Like
why are you being patched up all the time?

305
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:49,740
I don't get this.
Like you were really fantastic.

306
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,210
And what we uncover was that she never
talked to her boss and the only time she

307
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:57,630
talked to her boss was one,
there was a crisis or something urgent.

308
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,640
Does that sound familiar to everybody?
You can get a lot of head nods like, yeah.

309
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,510
Okay.

310
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,900
So now I want you to imagine if you were
her boss and you saw her trotting down

311
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:11,190
the hallway, hey boss, or you
don't want to talk to her? No,

312
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,610
because she's basically the
crisis problem person, right?

313
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,480
So you've just had this very negative
association with her and she also has this

314
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:21,480
very negative association with her boss
of light. He's always frustrated with me.

315
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:25,020
So when she goes in, she's not her
awesome, authentic self. Right?

316
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:27,300
Because her awesome authentic
self is somebody who's social.

317
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:29,520
He gets along with people
who wants to be helper.

318
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,880
But when she goes to her boss because
you have this association that he finds

319
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,780
her annoying or she's disrupting him
or bother him, she just freezes up.

320
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,050
And the only thing she goes to him and
is like, Hey, we have this problem.

321
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,600
Can we solve it? It's not making
for a really good relationship.

322
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,260
I see a lot of labs out there like look
at people like yeah, that's, that happens.

323
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,860
Yeah. And it's easy to imagine that
happening because we're all so busy.

324
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,840
So what I would challenge you to do, um,
and in what we did with our client was,

325
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,080
hey, when you're having your one
on one meetings with your boss,

326
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:01,380
which happened every two weeks for her,
it's to not only go in and be like, hey,

327
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,150
here are the five problems.
What are we going to do?

328
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,060
That doesn't set up a
very good relationship.

329
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,100
And some of you may
want to write this down,

330
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:11,250
but the key steps that we put in place
that really help her transform her

331
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:16,230
relationship was how about we start with,
hey, how's it going? Pretty normal. Right?

332
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:19,380
And that's actually something she does
with all her peers as well as the people

333
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:20,400
that she supervises.

334
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,030
It's a ten second interaction
where you can humanize yourself.

335
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,380
And in the second step that we did was
to also share what were the things that

336
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:29,214
were going well.

337
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,380
I cannot imagine that in your workspace
that only the sky is falling and you're

338
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:38,100
only having problems, right? There
are things that are going well,

339
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,030
but we often forget to mention the things
that are going well because it's not

340
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:42,990
urgent on our mind.

341
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,990
But it's still really important to mention
those amazing things that are going

342
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,520
on because doing so your supervisor

343
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,740
can know that you're actually
getting these things done.

344
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,780
And you're also reminding them like,
Hey,

345
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,990
I'm doing a really good job
here because we're busy.

346
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:57,550
And so if you don't remind them of that,

347
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:59,920
they're going to forget or they're not
going to be aware that you're doing that

348
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:03,610
good job. And then after you present
those positive things and say,

349
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,880
I think we should keep doing
these things because it's working,

350
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,460
then go into the challenges.

351
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,730
So what you've done there as you
set up a positive association.

352
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:15,580
So every time that you're going into
the office, he's not gonna be like,

353
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:19,600
let me duck and hide because all you're
coming to me with his problems. Right?

354
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,500
And here's the key thing. When you go
to your supervisor with challenges,

355
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,090
come up with a few solutions.

356
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,540
Maybe the solution is an I have the
answer that's going to fix all of this,

357
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,010
but at least have a here,

358
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,130
here's some two or three things that I
think we could research or here are some

359
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:35,470
people I think we can talk
to to help solve this.

360
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,710
So then what you do is you
change the association that the,

361
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,440
that your supervisor has
as you're the problem,

362
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:45,040
big crisis person to you're the person
who's going to come and share some good

363
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,010
news that I can also then share
with my supervisors as well.

364
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,400
Cause I love to share how while our
department's doing and how all my peoples

365
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,980
doing. Um, and if you
come to me with problems,

366
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,250
I know that you're also being very
proactive and like you over there,

367
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,890
you're somebody who's taking initiative,
right?

368
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,640
So you can see how your own biases
about what people are thinking about,

369
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:07,480
you can impact your interaction
with them and impact your career.

370
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,240
Uh,
now on the flip side,

371
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,540
what I want to then go into is why
does your personal brand matter?

372
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,940
Anybody know who that
is? Yeah, who's that?

373
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,390
I get a lot of laughters does everybody
know what a game of Thrones is? Oh,

374
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,990
it's only like half of the room.

375
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:31,120
I can't believe this unfathomable
to me that you don't know. Um, so,

376
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:31,760
uh,
I'm will,

377
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,620
I'm a Geek nerd and I love reading about
dragons and all these other things.

378
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,220
But just to give a high level overview
of game of Thrones is a book fantasy

379
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:42,310
series that has been
turned into an HBO series.

380
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:45,070
And this is one of my favorite characters.

381
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:50,071
Tyrian Lannister Tyrian is born into
this very powerful Lannister family,

382
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,440
which is fortunate and unfortunate.

383
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:56,320
Has father really hates
him and so does the sister,

384
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,030
but we won't get into her
on this particular story.

385
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,080
So Tyrian in the middle of the book
series finds himself in this really

386
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,520
interesting position where he's been
asked by his father to be the king's hand

387
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,500
and he has to to buys the king,

388
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,450
his nephew on strategies and how
to keep the country growing. Um,

389
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,370
and as many of you know who've
been following the series,

390
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,860
there's all these wars that are
breaking out everywhere, right?

391
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,720
Everybody is trying to be the key.

392
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,430
So teary and finds himself in his place
where kings landing has confronted

393
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,990
what's a battle and they are about
to lose this battle to the enemy.

394
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,680
But because Tyrian is
so smart and so witty,

395
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,210
he comes up with an ingenious plan and
with courage tries to fight to the death.

396
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,100
And what we find is that he actually
helps saves the country from being taken

397
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:46,400
over. So now you think,
oh, well if he's done that,

398
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:50,330
of course it's going to get
all these accolades, right? No,

399
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,790
what happens is his father,

400
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,820
because his father has this perception
that Tyrian is basically not reliable,

401
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:00,800
is you know, somebody
who drinks too much. Um,

402
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:05,030
and somebody gets under his skin and
is the cause of his wife's death.

403
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,820
And it has all these negative
associations about Tyrian.

404
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,660
What he does in fact as he actually
takes all the power away from Tyrian,

405
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,190
dismisses him and to add salt
to the wound, takes his lover.

406
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,740
I know it's very tragic, right? Um,

407
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,160
and this is what can happen if you're
not paying attention to your brand.

408
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,570
So we know how your own perception
of your association to your Brown,

409
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:32,360
how others perceive you might
impact your interaction. Now,

410
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:36,050
the other piece of your personal brand
is how other people actually see you.

411
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,910
And so if the person who is in charge
of your career getting the raises or

412
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:44,030
promotion or giving you projects,
or even if they're not,

413
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:46,490
but they're supposed to help you
as a colleague to get things done,

414
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:49,310
if they don't have a very
positive association with you,

415
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,720
no matter how hard you work,
no matter how long hours you put in,

416
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,700
no matter how great your accomplishments,

417
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,290
you could end up like Tyrian where you're
not going to be acknowledged or that

418
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,330
right? And that's a
tragedy. Um, because, uh,

419
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,040
obviously somebody who is saving the
country from being taken over by the enemy

420
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,580
should really get that accolade and we
don't want that to have happened to you,

421
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,430
but we see this time and time again.
How many of you can relate to that?

422
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,150
Where you're like,

423
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,100
why is that person getting a promotion
that I don't understand what they're

424
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:24,020
doing? A lot of head nods,
a lot of laughters there.
Okay, well we're like, ah,

425
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:25,790
you know,
I've been here until midnight every day.

426
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,150
Like everybody know that I'm alive. Like,
why? Why are you supplying stuff to me?

427
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:32,910
Right? Lots of hands that can
relate to that. And, and so that,

428
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,610
that's the reason why that one,

429
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:38,000
if somebody who is in charge or who
is there to collaborate with you,

430
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,280
if they don't have a
strong sense of your brand,

431
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,440
they're also not going to
be there to promote you. Um,

432
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,480
and so now you recognize how
important it is to have, um,

433
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,690
a strong personal brand and,

434
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:54,620
and to manage it because you can see
that it can impact your career. Um,

435
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,210
but why is there resistance to it?

436
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,860
There's often a resistance
to it because people, uh,

437
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,750
the most common response I get
is I don't want to be fake.

438
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,020
How many of you have that natural aversion
to like thinking about your brand?

439
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,350
I'm like, I don't want to
be faked some of you. Okay.

440
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,620
And what I would encourage you to do
is think about Oprah's lesson where she

441
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:16,820
says, I can be a much better Oprah
than I could be a pretend Barbara.

442
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,950
And the references is to this. When Oprah
started her career as an anchor woman,

443
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,920
the person she admired most with Barbara
Walters and what she would do it with

444
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:28,040
study Barbara and try to
mimic her when she's on TV.

445
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,780
And that was really exhausting.

446
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,890
And it wasn't until there was a moment
where she screwed something up and just

447
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:37,550
kind of laughed and let out a
sigh of relief that sh it hit her.

448
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,180
And there was a moment where their
light bulb went off and she said,

449
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,090
you know what? It's much better to
be me than to be a pretend Barbara.

450
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,340
And that was when her career took off.

451
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,330
So what I would encourage you to do
in thinking about your personal brand,

452
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,510
it's really not about making this where
you have to be fake or you have to kiss

453
00:26:57,271 --> 00:27:00,870
up or you have to change yourself so
drastically so that you don't remember who

454
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:05,010
you are. Because that would be really
exhausting to wear a mask every day.

455
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,360
What I am encouraging you to do
is to take a look and say, hey,

456
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,920
what is going on with my personal
brown about my own assumptions and how?

457
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:17,070
How are other people really perceiving
me and is that something I'm happy with?

458
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,600
And if that's not,

459
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,040
what are some small things that I
can do to make some big changes? Um,

460
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,080
so, uh, you know,

461
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,160
I've worked with a lot of introverts
and people who are humble and shy.

462
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,470
How many of you relate to being
an introvert, humble or PSI?

463
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,570
Three floors to the room. Okay. Almost
every everybody in the room. Um,

464
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,270
and often when, when I talk to them
about this is there's this like,

465
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,320
I just feel like it's too
much or I just can't do it.

466
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,850
Right? Or like I just don't
want to change myself in,

467
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:49,320
in what I would encourage you to
do is to not make this huge leap.

468
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,310
I'm not asking you to go from this person
who is more shy or there have to being

469
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:56,310
like, Hey, I'm the life of the party,

470
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,720
but to really take some small steps that
can actually make a big impact on your

471
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,440
career. And here's an example of where
you can make that big difference.

472
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,500
So working with the client
where he's really bright,

473
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:12,030
he's really great at what he
does, but he's not. Um, uh,

474
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:15,270
but when you ask who he is
and the company, everybody's
kind of like who's that?

475
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,390
And it's because he's keeping himself
really small and really quiet.

476
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,580
And so some of the things that we did
for him to help him change his own

477
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,450
perception of himself,

478
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:28,500
but also to help others see that his
brand is something that is strong and

479
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:31,840
something that's positive that should
be associated with, um, is, uh,

480
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,110
to make some minor changes.
So for example,

481
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:39,290
when he goes to the cafeteria to get water
or goes to a meeting to just actually

482
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:42,450
say, hey, how's it going to
the person standing around him?

483
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,140
It's a little awkward at first, but
it's just that initial step, right?

484
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,560
Because everybody's feeling a little
awkward. Um, and so that's one thing.

485
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,390
So just by doing that,

486
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:54,090
he was actually able to get to know
people and people knew his name.

487
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,400
So that was an amazing feat for him.

488
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,610
So after a month of doing that and feeling
more competence cause he's like, Hey,

489
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:02,640
I didn't die from that. People
actually said hi back. It was amazing.

490
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,740
What we then did was say,
okay,

491
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,770
what can we do now to up your
game just a little bit more.

492
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,390
So his interaction with people
are, hey, how's it going?
Good. How's it going? Good.

493
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,130
Okay.
That was good as an initial step,

494
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,200
but it didn't really
allow room for rapport.

495
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,440
So the next thing that we added
to his assignment was to say,

496
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,790
what's one thing you can say about the
work that you're doing that you can share

497
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:24,990
with somebody else that you love?

498
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,360
Because when you're positive and excited
and being authentically sharing about

499
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:32,670
what you love,
it spreads joy to everybody.

500
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,080
So what we added to his assignment was
to come up with one thing every week that

501
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:42,080
he wanted to share. So the interaction
became, hey, how's it going? Good. Uh,

502
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:46,120
I've been working on this feature and
I'm super excited to hear the feedback on

503
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:46,954
it.

504
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,530
The reception to that was a lot more
positive and it actually opened the space

505
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:53,800
to have a longer conversation, which was,
oh, with the feature about Blah Blah,

506
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:54,581
blah,
you know?

507
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:58,750
And so it really allowed him to go more
into what he was doing and to share that

508
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:03,220
passion. And over time, by consistently
doing that, people in his company,

509
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,000
we're actually able to know his name and
also know what he brought to the table.

510
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,080
And more importantly,

511
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:12,520
have a positive association with him
because he was actually excited about the

512
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:16,620
work that he was doing as opposed to be
knowing, no, not the guy who, you know,

513
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,660
never talked to anybody who didn't care
and didn't seem like he was invested in

514
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:20,494
the company.

515
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:25,530
Can you see the big difference of that
small thing can make a lot of head nods?

516
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,643
Yes.

517
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,250
And so that's what we're hoping that you
can do today is to find the things that

518
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:34,870
are authentically true to you.
You know that you're excited about,

519
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:37,930
that you're happy about the things that
you're working on that are good and to

520
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:40,900
share it in a way that
honors your contributions.

521
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,980
But also uplifts everybody around you.
It doesn't have to be this experience,

522
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:48,790
that negative or that it's fake.
And by doing so,

523
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,260
the good thing about that is that
when there's an issue involving that

524
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:55,180
particular project or that
particular assignment,

525
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,210
the first person they might think about
calling to help solve that problem and

526
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,280
that issue comes up is you. And so what
we're doing is creating value for you,

527
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:06,700
but we're also creating value for
other team members and then overall

528
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:11,080
productivity for the organization.
So,

529
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,890
um, so now you know what a
personal brand is, right?

530
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:18,220
It's an immediate association that people
have about you and they think of you

531
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:20,260
are here of you,
similar to what we saw with Oprah.

532
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,040
You see the positive consequences that
can have in your career like the lawyer

533
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,610
that I was talking about or they're
really negative consequences.

534
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:30,940
It can have your career like my favorite
character Tyrian Lannister and you see

535
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:35,941
that you can be authentic in your own
way and still manage your personal brand.

536
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,100
Then the next question is, well,
what do you want to do with that?

537
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,480
What I find is that a lot of times
people go back and say, well,

538
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,490
I'm inspired for a day and I'm going to
do something and then kind of drop off.

539
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,290
What I would encourage you to do
is to be consistent about this.

540
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:56,540
So three things that I would recommend
that you do that can make a big change as

541
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,930
one, go back and do the
exercise we did earlier,

542
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,900
which is to think about the people that
you're interacting with on a regular

543
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:06,400
basis and ask yourself what do you think
they're thinking about you and how has

544
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:08,110
that impacted your interactions with them.

545
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,210
The second thing is actually go out
and ask a few coworkers about that.

546
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,110
What are the three key adjectives that
comes to mind when you think of me?

547
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,860
What do you think are my strengths and
what would you like to see more of?

548
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,120
This can be scary because you're being
vulnerable and putting it out yourself

549
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:27,250
out there,
but this is also moment,

550
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:31,060
a chance formation because without that
information it's really hard to assess

551
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:32,830
where you are and whether
you want to make changes.

552
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,820
And then the last piece is this.
With that information,

553
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,230
what are you going to do about it?
You got to go home and say,

554
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:42,260
we know what it's cool but I'm
not interested in making changes.

555
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,430
Or you can make that decision
to put things in your calendar.

556
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,070
And all it really takes is 15 minutes
a week to make these changes. Um,

557
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,880
so that you can better manage
your personal brand. Um,

558
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,680
and I know that with change it's
always scary even if it's good for you.

559
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:02,210
And it reminds me of a story of
myself when I was in college.

560
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,950
I was a long time ago and I was
in my senior year of college.

561
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,540
I got an interview with this tech company
that at the time was really up and

562
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:16,220
coming and I was so excited,
I was researching the company,

563
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:17,600
I was practicing my pitch.

564
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,230
I made a list of 10 questions so that I
wouldn't be stumped at the end. Right?

565
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,230
I like cross the t's and
dotted the i's and I was like,

566
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:28,430
I'm ready for this interview sound like
jotting into the interview. And I'm like,

567
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,330
oh, it's super excited. So the guy says
hi, and we kind of Chit Chat a little bit,

568
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:35,380
a little talk. He goes into, uh,

569
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,710
the spiel about his company. And
uh, over the next 15 minutes,

570
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,270
he answers every single question
that's on my list. And then he says,

571
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,980
what do you want to know about us?

572
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,930
I could not come up with anything.
I was completely stumped.

573
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,930
So the question I asked and I'm
still embarrassed about it, is,

574
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,230
is it true that your company
offers good free food?

575
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,860
You got the what that
company was Google. Yeah. Um,

576
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:08,000
and I was mortified. I, it stayed with
me for awhile. I'm like, oh my God,

577
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:11,270
they must think I'm in the
most awful interview ever.

578
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:14,170
And it's not a great question
and I've thought, you know, it,

579
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,840
it was embarrassing and it was
hard to actually share it out loud,

580
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:21,590
I guess share this story because I think
that that situation could have stayed

581
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:24,050
with me and derailed me and kept
me in a place where I'm like, oh,

582
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:26,330
I'm never going to talk
to Googlers ever again.

583
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,920
I'm never going to do anything here
again. Um, and fast forward years later,

584
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:35,540
I'm now being invited to come back and
give this presentation to you and to um,

585
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,950
how this honor of being able to share
through my own personal trials and

586
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:43,220
tribulations and through the training
that I've got and through the experiences

587
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:47,210
I've had and helping over a thousand
clients to now be able to give you these

588
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:48,044
strategies.

589
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,400
And I share that story because I can
assure you all of you have jobs at Google,

590
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,400
so you're definitely 10 steps ahead of me,
right?

591
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:58,270
Y'All at least got through the screening
around and got through the call backs

592
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,850
and I know the interview process here is
really long and you're way ahead of me

593
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:05,210
when I started. So if I can go from
that place to being where I am now,

594
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,390
I am more than confident that with
consistent work with these strategies that

595
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:14,690
you will be able to have a
really amazing successful career.

596
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,680
And that at this point,

597
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:20,060
if you make that choice to choose to
change your personal brand in a positive

598
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:22,730
direction,
you can definitely make that happen.

599
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,040
So it was with great honor to be here
and I just really wanted to humbly thank

600
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:32,240
you for spending this time together.
And I'll take questions after this.

601
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,253
Thank you.

602
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:43,830
So what about if your personal perception
of yourself and other coworkers are

603
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:45,784
different?

604
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,280
Hmm. So we've got depends.
Great question. So, um,

605
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,020
let's take a little bit into that.
Uh,

606
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,180
do you feel like your personal perception
of yourself as positive or negative?

607
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,710
A positive.
Okay.

608
00:35:57,711 --> 00:36:00,380
And then do you think your coworkers
perception of you as positive,

609
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:02,170
negative or neutral?
Um,

610
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,240
still positive but just different stuff.

611
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,920
Okay.
Um,

612
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,420
and so what I would say with that is
it sounds like you're in a good place

613
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:12,010
because you were feeling
pretty good about yourself,

614
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:15,310
which is the first step and your coworkers
are feeling pretty good about you.

615
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,870
And so if what you want to do is to have
them see more of the stuff that you are

616
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:23,740
feeling good about, then the
recommendation would be, um, you know,

617
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,030
depending on the interactions you have
with people to discuss those things more

618
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,200
to find ways and highlighting
those things more.

619
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,800
So give me a specific example cause like
it's harder to answer in the abstract.

620
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,360
Um, what the positive
association of yourself that
you want others to know about

621
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:42,100
you. Um, taking more
iterative. Okay. Okay.

622
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,140
So if you want to show
that you're somebody who is
taking more initiative, um,

623
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:52,150
uh, one of the ways you can do that
is if you're at a team meeting, um,

624
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,670
instead of just sitting quiet
and not saying that to you,

625
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,110
but for the sake of time, what I would say
is that, you know, at every meeting, um,

626
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,000
you should at least make one comment
if you're not making a comment, right?

627
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,840
And asking questions.

628
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,800
And the other thing that you can do to
really show initiative is if there's

629
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,210
something that's being assigned
or things that are, um,

630
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,800
projects that are coming up,
you,

631
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,890
you would be the person who would
volunteer for it. Um, and that's,

632
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,810
that's showing initiative right there.

633
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,020
The key thing then though is to follow
up that and when you're working on these

634
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:21,100
projects to let people on your team and
let your supervisors know that as well.

635
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:26,050
So there is a one school of thought where
they say you keep doing the good work

636
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,880
and things will fall in place.

637
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:33,520
And now there's this concept of personal
branding there you have to proactively

638
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:39,040
influence or change the perception
of other people you see any conflict?

639
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,470
No, I don't, I doubt at all.
And I think that's a really
great question. I think, um,

640
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,080
um, the basis is you have to
do good work. You know, um,

641
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:51,530
if you're doing bad work and
you're expecting everybody
else to think good about

642
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:53,120
you,
that's a really hard place to be.

643
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:56,170
And that would not be something that I
would advocate for any client cause I,

644
00:37:56,171 --> 00:37:59,090
I'm really about having integrity,
honesty, and authenticity.

645
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,360
So you do need to do consistent good work,
um,

646
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:06,950
and some things will fall into place.
Um, so you know, you get a job at Google,

647
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:10,160
that's things falling into place and
Google is an amazing place to work.

648
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,120
Now if you want to elevate yourself
and get to that next stage where you're

649
00:38:14,121 --> 00:38:16,570
going into management and leadership,
um,

650
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,160
there has to be some
changes in your strategies.

651
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,710
So the foundation of doing good work,

652
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:25,340
it's still a core foundation
of who you are, but,

653
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,950
but that extra step of sharing the
good work that you're doing, um,

654
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,280
doesn't take away from that. And it
only adds to that. Thank you very much.

655
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,143
Thank you.
Bye.

656
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:35,470
Yeah.
