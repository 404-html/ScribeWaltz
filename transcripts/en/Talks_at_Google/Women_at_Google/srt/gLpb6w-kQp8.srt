1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,320
Hi and thank you so much for coming today
and taking time out of your very busy

2
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:16,580
schedules to listen to me
Yammer on about my book. Um,

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,610
it's called the vanishing season and it
just came out last week and it had an

4
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:26,981
unusual path to publication in that
it won the mystery writers of America,

5
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,030
uh,

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,710
slash St Martins [inaudible]
debut crime novel award,

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,740
which is an annual contest that is
held in conjunction with St Martin's,

8
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,900
my publisher and the
mystery writers of America.

9
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:46,901
So it's open to anybody who
has a unpublished manuscript.

10
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:51,290
So if you have an unpublished manuscript
lying around that has to do with crime,

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,600
you can shine it up and send it in.

12
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:58,601
The new deadline is mid January of
2018 and they usually get about 400

13
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:01,190
submissions.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,020
And the mystery writers of America
have some judges who comb through those

15
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:09,020
manuscripts and narrow it down
to a handful of finalists,

16
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,040
which are then sent on to the editors
at Saint Martins who pick the winner.

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,250
And occasionally there's no winner.
Uh,

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,260
but my year I won, which I was very
surprised and delighted to find out,

19
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,690
which is how my book came to be.

20
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:28,430
So that was March, 2016 when
they said, yes, we like it,

21
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:32,450
we will publish it. And it just
came out now about 22 months later.

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,420
So it's a long journey,
um,

23
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,950
from the decision to publish to the
actual presentation of the book.

24
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,150
But it's been exciting and
fun. I recommend it, you know.

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,600
Uh,
and um,

26
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,820
so the book is about, one of the
reasons I thought that it might not,

27
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,450
when is most of the winners have
been kind of traditional mysteries or

28
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,610
historical mysteries that don't
feel feature a lot of, um,

29
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,470
grit or, uh, well,

30
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:08,000
body parts is my mother calls my
novel, the body parts novel. Uh,

31
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,830
so I was very surprised where
they picked me and my body parts,

32
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,220
uh, add delighted but surprised. And um,

33
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,790
it's about a serial killer who,
uh,

34
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,280
well who's active in, um, a small
town in Woodbury and Massachusetts.

35
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,210
It's fictional.

36
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,160
And a living in this town is
my heroine Ellery Hathaway,

37
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,300
who was,

38
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,200
has personal knowledge of a serial
killer cause she was kidnapped off the

39
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:43,740
streets of Chicago as a 14 year old to the
eve of her 14th birthday. Actually, uh,

40
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,290
she was alone outside on the streets
at night because her mother was in the

41
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,920
hospital with her brother who was dying
of cancer and the father had run off

42
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,670
years ago. So LRA was vulnerable. Um,

43
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,190
and when the sedan pulled over,
it's a hot night in Chicago,

44
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,860
oppressive heat. She
thought, well, if I help him,

45
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,350
maybe he'll give me a dollar
for a soda and I can cool off.

46
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,530
But instead he got out of the
car and her life changed forever.

47
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,120
She would have been victim number 17 of,
uh,

48
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,930
Francis Coben who is an infamous
Ted Bundy type serial killer, uh,

49
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:24,931
who had a ducted and killed 16 girls
before and he kept the hands and ditch the

50
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,480
rest. And so Ellery was, um,

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,300
in prison by him and would
have been killed too,

52
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:36,301
if not for a very green FBI agent who
was like low man on the totem pole in the

53
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,210
investigation.

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,410
But he played a hunch and serendipitously
rescued her from the closet.

55
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,323
Um,

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,650
and that was 14 years before the book
opens and now she's living in anonymity.

57
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:50,950
She's changed her name. She's trying
to put all the past behind her,

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,810
but every year around her birthday
somebody goes missing from this small town

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,850
and they all seem to have, well most of
them seem to have reasons to be missing.

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,030
So nobody's very surprised
and there wasn't,

61
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:08,230
they aren't looking for them too hard in
most cases and they don't see a pattern.

62
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,830
But Ellery gets a creepy clown
birthday card in the mail.

63
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,960
After each disappearance
it says happy birthday.

64
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:16,690
Ellery and she doesn't really
talk about a birthday much.

65
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,690
So this is a signal to her that somebody
knows who she is for real and uh,

66
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,220
the person may be dangerous,

67
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:28,780
but she can't get anybody to believe her
that these disappearances are connected.

68
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:33,781
And to explain the whole story
risks outing her past and again,

69
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:38,980
being forced to deal with this ugly serial
killer who had hurt her when she was

70
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,080
a teenager. Um, so this
year the, you know,

71
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,130
the vanishing season is coming around
again and somebody is going to go missing

72
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:46,660
unless she can figure
out a way to stop it.

73
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,340
So she calls up the one guy she knows
will believe her and that's read Markham,

74
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,350
the FBI agent who rescued her
when she was 14 and Reed's life,

75
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,760
uh, skyrocketed, uh, after
his, uh, rescue of LRA,

76
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,130
he wrote a bestselling book about it.
He got promoted,

77
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:07,060
he became a hot shot profiler.
Uh, it was great. He hits,

78
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:10,660
he met his wife kind of this way where
she was starstruck a little by the whole

79
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,320
serial killer. You catch serial
killers. That's really cool. Um,

80
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,090
and uh,

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,670
so the best time of his life basically
is the worst time of [inaudible] and

82
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,950
that's why they're interesting
to put together as they,

83
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,140
they had their identities forged by this
initial terrible case and they've both

84
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:33,250
been living with it in different ways
ever since. So for read, it's been a boon,

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,660
you know, gave him fame and
fortune and for LRE it, you know,

86
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,160
has been awful obviously.

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,580
And so forcing them to back together
again for a causes them to confront those

88
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,840
roles where you know, for read,
if Ella is life isn't awesome.

89
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,380
I mean he's always told himself he's the
big hero of her story. He rescued her.

90
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:57,860
She's the one that lived. Um,
if her life isn't so awesome,

91
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:02,300
then maybe he's not the hero.
He told himself he was. Um,

92
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,370
and for Ellery she's always sort of a
told herself she's going to be the victim

93
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:11,750
forever. Like she's forever tied to
this very famous serial killer. Uh,

94
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,810
and so now she has a chance to see like
who she might be apart from that story.

95
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,090
Um, so that's kind of the
main thrust of the book.

96
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,710
And one of the questions I get asked
a lot is where did it come from?

97
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,880
And the genesis of the story
was about 20 years ago.

98
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:36,320
I was reading one of the stories about
Ted Bundy and there are a lot of them,

99
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,510
there's a new Ted Bundy story.
Every year, basically a movie TV,

100
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:45,440
movie, a book, something like this
story, you know, it's 40 years old,

101
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,100
but it keeps getting retold.
And so ted Bundy lives on, um,

102
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:53,360
and for the people who were
caught up in his story, uh,

103
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,670
this can be difficult to have to keep
reliving it when the public won't let it

104
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:01,790
die basically.
And um,

105
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,850
so he has living victims,
uh,

106
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,000
one of whom is a woman
named Carol [inaudible].

107
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,470
Carol was 18 and shopping at a
Utah shopping mall when Ted Bundy,

108
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,910
uh,
pretending to be a police officer,

109
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:20,990
told her that her car had been broken
into and she needed to come with him to

110
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,490
the police station and make a report.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,850
And so she got into the car with him
and it was immediately struck that this

112
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:29,750
doesn't look like a cop's car.
And then he drove her,

113
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,880
not towards the police station,
but away from it.

114
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,580
And so she freaked out and
demanded to be let out of the car,

115
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:38,960
at which point Bundy realizes that the
Jig was up and he had to subdue her

116
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:41,450
somehow. So he pulled over
the road side of the road.

117
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:44,390
And He tried to snap his handcuffs on her,

118
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,660
but in the struggle he got
both the cuffs on one wrist.

119
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,990
And so she was able to escape and she
became the beginning of Ted Bundys end

120
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,200
because they,
people sort of knew that he was out there,

121
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:01,140
this guy named Ted and there
were the missing girls and um,

122
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,290
they were probably connected,
but they didn't really,

123
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,570
they didn't know what he looked like,
all these sorts of things.

124
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:07,700
And she was able to say,
here's what he looked like,

125
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,500
here's the car he was driving and the
cops were able to start putting the pieces

126
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:15,620
together. So Carol, um, today,

127
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,740
so more than 40 years after this incident
still gets 10 to 15 messages per day

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
about Ted Bundy. People
write her saying, oh, he,

129
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:29,330
he kidnapped me to, um, or they say,

130
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,680
uh, Oh, tell me what Ted's
really like. What was it like?

131
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,440
They want her story.
A couple of years ago,

132
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:41,441
some guy decided to say he was her son
and like he has this connection to Ted

133
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,730
Bundy.
She doesn't have a son.

134
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,170
So she was forced to come for either let
this lie perpetuate or to come forward

135
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:52,580
and say, I don't have a son. He's lying.
So Bundy has been dead for decades.

136
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:56,790
He was electrocuted in Florida in 1989.
Um,

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,150
but for Carroll, he's there
every day. You know, the,

138
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,490
her life now became,
you know,

139
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:07,491
about Ted Bundy and the public
won't let him go for her.

140
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,320
She has no choice.
Um,

141
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,520
another person caught up in the Ted
Bundy story would be the read Marcom type

142
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,480
character. And this was Bob
capital who was brand new.

143
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:23,481
He had been on the job as a homicide
detective one week when he got handed the

144
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,420
Ted Bundy case.

145
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,680
And this completely changed the
trajectory of capital's career.

146
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,930
He ended up specializing
in serial murderer.

147
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,770
He hunted Bundy for years until
they caught him. Um, he actually,

148
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:39,630
when they Bundy was finally apprehended
for good cause he escaped Weiss. Uh,

149
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,000
he was when he was finally an
apprehended for good in Florida.

150
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,710
Keppel traveled there and interviewed
him multiple times and was able to get

151
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,160
Bundy to confess for two more murders
that they didn't know he'd even committed.

152
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,500
Um, eventually Keppel went
on to specialize in serial
murder and try to help,

153
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,240
uh, classify them to see if we could
figure out how to get serial killers.

154
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,080
Um, is there an learn more about how
they think, where do they come from?

155
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,630
So he participated in
some scientific research.

156
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:11,400
He ended up lecturing teaching
about serial killers. Uh, you know,

157
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,260
it also took over his life in a more
positive way and that he was the expert in

158
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:20,700
serial murder. Um, but again,
like it was serendipity, right?

159
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,640
He's just a guy,
he and working for the Seattle police,

160
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:27,090
when all of a sudden this call comes in
about a missing girl and now he's been

161
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:30,900
handed one of the most infamous
cases in all of history.

162
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,510
So I was less struck when I read
this book about Ted Bundy himself.

163
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,150
He's very interesting.
But all of these side people,

164
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,180
the people who were approached
by Bundy and didn't go with him.

165
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,850
So I know somebody who was living in
the sorority house that he attacked in

166
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:52,410
Florida.
Uh,

167
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,850
he broke in and just basically went
from room to room beating women,

168
00:10:56,851 --> 00:11:00,600
these young women with a log and he
killed some of them and gravely injured

169
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:04,210
others. There was one who
was going to be a dancer. Um,

170
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,530
and the head injury caused her life to
be rewritten because she had balance

171
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:15,330
issues after that. And so she lived,
but her life was never the same.

172
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,010
And the woman I know lived there,
but it wasn't home that night.

173
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,190
She was out. So it's, you know,

174
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:27,720
the sort of sliding doors parallel lives.
Like what if she had been there?

175
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,460
She wasn't. Um, but still it's
something she thinks about frequently.

176
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,300
When you have a brush with a, an
infamous case like this, it changes you.

177
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,290
And so the book is about serial murder
and there's a mystery and who did it and

178
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:40,951
all that other stuff.

179
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:45,951
But it's also about what it's like to
live attached to this infamous crime.

180
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,850
How many people are
familiar with mind hunter?

181
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,990
Very popular Netflix series right now.
I see one.

182
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,050
So mine hunter is,
uh,

183
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,000
based on the work of two other
people who hunted serial killers,

184
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,130
a wrestler and Douglas and they
went around and interviewed them.

185
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,910
They had this idea like,
you know,

186
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Sarah killers have been with us
forever but nobody really studied them.

187
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:15,341
And they said,
well,

188
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:19,480
we're going to study them and interview
them and see if we can classify them and

189
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:23,800
figure out where they come from and help
people catch them. So this is all about,

190
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,820
you know,
their interviews.

191
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:29,810
They have creepy serial killers are people
playing creepy serial killers and uh,

192
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:33,700
they show the interviews and how the
work came to be and whether people

193
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,400
supported it at first and
how it gained momentum.

194
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,880
What's interesting about it now
as if you go to the FBI site,

195
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,100
the FBI's basically like,
yeah,

196
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:46,810
none of that really
panned out like we tried.

197
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,640
But it turns out serial killers are very
hard to catch and they're hard to catch

198
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,990
for a lot of reasons. But one of
the things is all their hard work,

199
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:58,900
it trying to figure out like, okay,
what can we say about serial killers?

200
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:03,550
And they could find some tendencies,
like, okay, they tend to be, um,

201
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,480
bed wetters, you know,
into later adolescents.

202
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,170
So they like bedwetting is a problem
even when they're like 10 or 12 or

203
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:13,480
something like that.
Okay,

204
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:17,500
well if you suspect you have a serial
killer in your neighborhood and you're a

205
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:22,300
police officer, you can't really go
like round up the bed. Wetters you know,

206
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,910
like with the saw the cops.
So looking at these profiles going,

207
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,990
they don't help us, like have, you
know, okay, so we had mommy issues,

208
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:33,370
like how do we go round up the people
who had mommy issues or whatever.

209
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,420
Like this is not helpful.

210
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,430
And then also some of it just turns
out not to be helpful even as a

211
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:40,600
classification system.

212
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:44,740
So one of the big things they tried
early on was you could be an organized

213
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,920
killer who would be kind
of like Bundy, who, um,

214
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,800
planned his victims.

215
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:55,150
And he had this very big rooms where he
would dress up as an injured person with,

216
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,450
uh, um, a cast on. And
he'd say, Oh, come with me.

217
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,950
I need you to help me carry my books.

218
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:01,750
To my car and the young
woman would go with them,

219
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:04,150
at which point he would leap
upon them and subdue them.

220
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,940
Or you pretend to be a cop
or something like that.

221
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,340
And he had a plan with how he
was going to just, you know,

222
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,400
be with a victim and kill her and
where he was going to leave her.

223
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,850
And then disorganized killers who
would be, you know, like, Ooh,

224
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:20,380
I'm just walking along when I'm overcome
with the urge to kill and I break in

225
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:24,910
and I just killed people.
But one day did that too at the end.

226
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:27,400
So is he organized or disorganized?

227
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:31,540
And it turns out like organized killers
have elements that are disorganized and

228
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:36,250
disorganized killers have elements of
organizations. So this category helped,

229
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,413
not at all,

230
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,790
but there are other things that are kind
of interesting things that appear about

231
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:47,080
serial killers in movies and television.
Um,

232
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,950
so for example, you see things like, oh,

233
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,350
they always take trophies with them.
That's a big thing.

234
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,820
And it turns out about half,
half takes some sort of trophy,

235
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:02,810
like some piece of the victims
jewelry or a driver's license.

236
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:06,410
So they can like relive it
afterward, but only about half. Um,

237
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:10,160
another one they found serial killers
are more likely to have served in the

238
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:10,994
military.

239
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,190
So if 1% of the population is served in
the military around now see what killers,

240
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,033
it's one in three.

241
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,910
So probably they're attracted to
the dominance and the weapons and,

242
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,560
and that sort of thing.
But again,

243
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,610
most the vast majority of people in
the military or not serial killers,

244
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,220
so even if you suspect
you have a serial killer,

245
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,520
it's not like you can go round up
everybody in the military and say,

246
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:35,354
are you the one?

247
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,693
MMM.

248
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,590
And then, uh, let's see other things that
are so true about serial killers, um,

249
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,600
that they kill strangers and
that's why they're hard to catch.

250
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,620
And it turns out about a third
of their victims are strangers.

251
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,970
It turns out the most common relationship
between a serial killer and his victim

252
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,890
is business.
So watch out when you're doing business.

253
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:03,850
Now prostitution accounts for a good chunk
is app that's classified as business.

254
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,140
But also,
you know,

255
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:09,400
you go down to your Kinko's to
make some mimeographs or whatever.

256
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,930
And the Siri killer happens to be
working behind the counter. Uh,

257
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,420
so you get those kinds of things too
where there's this casual connection.

258
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,930
You would still mostly be classified as
strangers and you don't really know each

259
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:23,080
other, but you have met before. Um,

260
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:27,700
so that's another thing that is sort of
interesting about serial killers. Um,

261
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,380
another one that pops up sometimes
is like, are the victims,

262
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:35,110
all women on TV,
they're almost always women.

263
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,080
And it turns out in real life
they're mostly women to, um,

264
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,490
it's about 80%.
And again,

265
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,030
part of that is the prostitution because
if you're a serial killer and you're

266
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:48,400
lazy and you want a victim,

267
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:50,740
it's very easy to get a prostitute
to get in the car with you.

268
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,450
You don't have to go hunt her and she'll,
you know,

269
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:55,600
opened the door and she'll get it and
then you are expected to drive her off,

270
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:58,650
some more secluded. So she
doesn't freak out immediately. Um,

271
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,580
so unfortunately like prostitution,

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,720
people who are in the sex trade are
still vulnerable to this kind of thing.

273
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:09,010
You can call them up and like have
the one delivered to your home. Um,

274
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,890
so that's a chunk of
where that comes from.

275
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,840
So that's about 80% of
the victims are women. Um,

276
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,950
and another one I that I find
interesting, there's this idea that, oh,

277
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:23,110
they're already in the system somewhere.

278
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,100
If we just look for people who
are out there convict, you know,

279
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,250
committing violent crimes,
we can find the serial killer.

280
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,830
And it turns out,
nope,

281
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:38,430
that about 80% of them have some
kind of record by the time they are,

282
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,490
uh, arrested for murder. Uh,

283
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:46,530
but it's usually nonviolent
stuff like peeping or,

284
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,150
um,
simple theft.

285
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,020
It's not really that they're out there
committing these violent crimes and they

286
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:56,100
have a record. So it turns out they're
actually very, very hard to catch.

287
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,210
So that was one, I got some
feedback on my book actually, um,

288
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,330
about reed and his ability
to profile and everything.

289
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,490
It's a bit like he's not
very good at his job.

290
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,800
Like he gets stuff wrong in
the book and well, I mean,

291
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,150
profiling is not, you
know, a science per se.

292
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:19,770
It's not like it has the guaranteed
outcome that they're like, okay,

293
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:24,771
and he's going to be wearing a red
sweater and driving a blue minivan.

294
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,440
It's just like they can't
get it down that far.

295
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,550
And indeed the cops off of get frustrated
because what the profilers will come

296
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:33,840
forward with or stuff like,

297
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:38,130
well he's really angry at women
and the cops are like, yeah,

298
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:41,610
we kind of gathered that from the way
he's killing them. What else? You got?

299
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,690
Nothing of the bed wetter thing. Okay. Uh,

300
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,560
so there is this tension between the
FBI that wants to do this research into

301
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,850
serial killers and the local police who
really just want help catching them when

302
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:55,890
they think they have one.
Uh,

303
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:59,220
but this is another problem is
how do you know when you have one?

304
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,480
Because it'd be nice if they were always
very consistent and they like slept.

305
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:08,370
The sign nodes like the Zodiac,
you, it's me or they always,

306
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:13,110
you know, used a pair of red
nylons to strangle their victim.

307
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,810
Something obvious. It says, okay,
yeah, these are all related.

308
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,860
But sometimes they're opportunists
and they will change murder weapons.

309
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,820
So one might be a strangulation and
then another will be a shooting. Um,

310
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,470
so they can be very hard to detect.

311
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:28,320
But what's interesting now is some people
are beginning to experiment with like

312
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:33,060
big data and it's hard right now
because the way law enforcement works,

313
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:34,440
they're all segregated.

314
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,770
So you can be a serial killer in one town
and go like across the street and be a

315
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:39,630
serial killer in another
town in the two towns.

316
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,460
Don't even know that there have related
victims because they're not sharing data.

317
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,940
So there's some people who are making
efforts to try and get the police

318
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:49,560
departments to share more data.

319
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:54,561
So you can pick out serial
killers and that's looking like,

320
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,920
it might be an interesting way. Some
people are saying this, this will work,

321
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,110
but it hasn't been rigorously tested yet.

322
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:04,650
But at least we are probably moving in
the right direction to be able to spot

323
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:09,150
these guys. And again,
it is mostly guys, uh,

324
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,830
you can't get females.
They are killers.

325
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,570
They tend to murder like serial
husbands, like black widow's. Like,

326
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:18,490
I'll marry a guy and then often,
um,

327
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,320
for money and then I'll marry
another one off him for money.

328
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,760
And if you move around, this
can be very hard to, uh, catch.

329
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,740
And this is the thing, how do they
finally catch serial killers? Well,

330
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:35,010
it turns out their families
turn them in, their friends. Um,

331
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,740
the people who know them who can say,
oh yeah, he was a bed wetter or um,

332
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,940
yeah, or you know, and Bundys
case, his fiance was like,

333
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,790
he has a plaster of Paris in the,
um,

334
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:55,170
bathroom and some handcuffs in the
car that looks suspicious to me.

335
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,760
She had to turn him in three times before
they took her seriously because nobody

336
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,950
thought they were looking
for a law student.

337
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,800
They thought they were looking for
some sort of savage on the street.

338
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:09,580
He was like foaming at the mouth or
something. Um, so it took a while to,

339
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,790
even though like lots of people
returning Ted and Ted Bundy, like, Ooh,

340
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,370
this guy does drive a VW
bug and his name is Ted.

341
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,940
The cops just didn't believe it could
possibly be him until, you know,

342
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,631
his girlfriend.

343
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:24,130
Actually turned him in when he moved to
Utah and more women started disappearing

344
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:26,290
there and she's like, okay, so ted,

345
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,660
move to Utah and now you
have missing women there.

346
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:33,100
You really might want to check into that.
But what's interesting about Liz,

347
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,100
um, his fiance, she
didn't break up with him.

348
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,190
It's a head scratcher for me. I, so
she kept turning him into the cops.

349
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:46,030
Like I think he could be a serial killer.
I think he might be the guy.

350
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,910
And then I'm also still gonna marry him.

351
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,560
And indeed one woman did marry him on
death row when he'd been convicted of all

352
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:56,350
of it, uh, and actually bore his child.

353
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,410
So out there is, uh, a woman who, uh,

354
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,240
would be a little younger than me,
uh, who has ted Bundy for a father.

355
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,050
And her mother is somebody who had sex
with Ted Bundy when he was on death row.

356
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,040
So that's your parentage.
Good luck.

357
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,320
Are there any questions about publishing,
about the book, about serial murder?

358
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,600
I found the, the addressing of the, um,

359
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,850
the emotional scars in the
book. Interesting. It. Um,

360
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,690
uh, it really does feel like that is
a major part of the book as you said,

361
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:38,250
rather than, than just the, the, the
killer in the hunt for the killer. Um,

362
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,690
it's hard to make such
a thing come across as,

363
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,990
as believable unless you
know, you, you, you have

364
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,600
examples of people with
emotional scars that going,

365
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,150
I guess to some extent we all do.
Did you use any,

366
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:58,400
any particular examples from
the real world to, to base, um,

367
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,800
LRS behavior and,
and the baggage on?

368
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,170
Um, so, you know, I have the, the
Bundy cases, one of the imprints,

369
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,210
but, um, uh,

370
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:13,080
actually I was assaulted by a
neighbor when I was five, uh,

371
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,220
repeatedly by,
um,

372
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,020
a neighbor who told me he would
kill me if I ever told my family.

373
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,750
And so I said nothing for several years.
Uh,

374
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,790
he eventually went to jail
for unrelated charges. Um,

375
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,240
but I've always sort of wondered what
parts of my personality or as a result of

376
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:39,300
that experience and what
would have been me anyway.

377
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:43,770
There's no control Joanna, that we can
run alongside me to be able to say, okay,

378
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:47,330
that's how you would have been
if this had never happened. Um,

379
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,310
so it's something that's
interesting to me.

380
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:52,760
I started checking out books on rape
from the library when I was like eight to

381
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:53,930
try to understand this whole thing.

382
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:58,220
So I've done a ton of reading and
I've done writing about it. Um,

383
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,600
and what happens when I write about it is
women come out of the woodwork and say,

384
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,490
yeah,
here's what happened to me.

385
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,130
And so I've been collecting these stories
over the years of different women.

386
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,870
And so LRE is kind of an
amalgamation of all of us. Uh,

387
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,900
her story is very dramatic
because it's famous and you know,

388
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:21,470
you can't get away from it.
Most of us live in relative anonymity.

389
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:25,190
So that part is very unusual for Ellery.
Um,

390
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,840
but what's common is, you know,
the shame, the wondering like,

391
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:33,080
did I do something to cause this,
uh,

392
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,620
the feeling that if somebody knows
what happened to you that it's going to

393
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:41,090
change how they look at you, how
they feel, how they act to you.

394
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,720
Uh, you know, we've seen this with
like the me too movement, right?

395
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:49,070
So like a lot of women have some story,
uh,

396
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,390
and most of us are carrying it
around in secret and just the,

397
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:56,900
the secrecy part of it can
be like a lingering pain.

398
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,200
And so, yeah, LRE is like a
mixture of all of these tales.

399
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,990
Yes. Another question. Uh,

400
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,520
what did you find most surprising
about the publishing process?

401
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,920
Um, most surprising about
the publishing process?

402
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,430
Well, I'm really heartened
that the book is doing well.

403
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,600
Like to me that's the biggest surprise.
I brought eight.

404
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,090
It's a nice little mystery and,
you know, I, I like, but it's like,

405
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,620
it's sold out on Amazon
and six days. Um, you know,

406
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:30,590
and so people were coming forward going,
I really liked this. And I'm like, oh,

407
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:35,480
thank you. I'm just surprised every
time. Uh, it terms of like the mechanics,

408
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,830
I would say how long it takes is like,
I sort of knew that intellectually,

409
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,250
but you know, it's 22
months. And as I like to say,

410
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:47,990
I could have birth to actual children
in that time frame, you know,

411
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:51,470
instead or one elephant, um, or a book.

412
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,740
And it turns out that there's a lot
of different pieces that go into it.

413
00:25:57,741 --> 00:26:02,180
You know, when you, that my publisher
publishes like 110 mysteries a year.

414
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:05,750
So you have your slot about, this is
when the editor can focus on your book.

415
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,770
This is when the copy editor can focus
on your book. This is when the, you know,

416
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,030
cover artists can focus on your
book. Uh, and you, you know,

417
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:18,980
it's a complicated dance and you have
to meet your steps or the whole process.

418
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,240
You can, you can miss your opening and
then your book is delayed even more. Uh,

419
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,300
so it's,
that kind of has been,

420
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,760
I would say the most surprising part.

421
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,610
The thing that surprises
other people is like,

422
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:34,520
I don't have anything to
do with the cover. Um,

423
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,350
the publisher picks both the title and
the cover for books and authors depending

424
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:42,770
on their statue or get more or less input.
And so the,

425
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:47,430
this title actually is mine. Um,
and the publisher agreed to it.

426
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,910
The cover, like I was not even consulted.
They're just like, here it is. Um,

427
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,990
and I provided some feedback and they
made some tweaks on that and I'm very

428
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:59,490
happy with the way it turned out. But I
know sometimes authors are very unhappy.

429
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,970
Uh, Lisa Gardner was
telling me this week, um,

430
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,370
that they had tweaked her
cover so many times that, uh,

431
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,270
it ended up the woman had
six fingers cause she was so,

432
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:13,380
she's looking at the coverage,
she's like,

433
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,860
it looks odd to me and then they'll
publish this way. She's like,

434
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:20,430
it looks odd to me sending her husband,
she says he's more visual than I am.

435
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:23,520
And he came along, he was like,
that's because she has six fingers.

436
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,680
Oh yeah.

437
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,510
And then even if you are at least a
gardener who has published, you know,

438
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,100
Zillions of a New York
Times bestselling books,

439
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,850
um, still the publisher will
come to you and say, uh,

440
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,020
can you give the heroin Brown eyes are
not brown eyes but green eyes because we

441
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:45,270
have green eyed art that we
want to use on the cover.

442
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,280
And so brown eyes aren't going to work.
Oh,

443
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:50,790
can you go back and change
your heritage so that uh,

444
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,540
she has green eyes and
Lisa's, it's like, all right,

445
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,230
I'll just go tweak her heritage.
So she has green eyes in the book.

446
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,330
So the way the different
pieces come together and
where the author can push back

447
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:07,260
and where the author can is continues
to be a bit of a surprise for me

448
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,601
quickly.

449
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:17,601
Thank you for that explanation of why
so many books cover pictures don't match

450
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,950
the story inside.
I never understood.

451
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,250
Yeah. Well it turns out this is, you know,

452
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:26,490
authors actually usually are not very
good at figuring out what to put on the

453
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:29,910
cover because they imagined that
it's going to be like a scene.

454
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,080
Like you act out a scene from the book
and when it doesn't look like that,

455
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:38,610
they're like, what? But this
doesn't look like my book. And um,

456
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:43,590
it turns out that the most important thing
the book can do is signal it's genre,

457
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,000
like what it is. Um, so is
it literary fiction? Is it a,

458
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,860
is it a scary mystery?

459
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,850
Is it a cozy mystery like murder she
wrote where like there's a dead body but

460
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:56,100
nobody really cares.
Um,

461
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,480
that kind of thing because if you get
it wrong, like the readers are angry,

462
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,430
I've seen reviews where,
you know,

463
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:05,850
there's something on the cover
that's super creepy and then they,

464
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:09,060
the book isn't scary and the
readers are mad. They're like,

465
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,970
I really was prepared to
be terrified by this book.

466
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:15,840
And it wasn't even Martin Lee
thrilling or, um, you know,

467
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:20,790
this book looks Psi Phi to me.
Uh, and it isn't. And honestly,

468
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,720
even when you get in the genre,
you can still have, um, problems.

469
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:29,160
So one of my readers apparently
thinks she looks pregnant.

470
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:30,490
Okay.

471
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:35,440
And so she read the book expecting the
pregnancy to show up and it never did.

472
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,330
And she was mad. She's like, two
stars off the, uh, cover is a lie.

473
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,540
So you can't,
you can't win,

474
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,590
but you really more than acting out a
particular scene or having the character

475
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:50,420
look exactly like they're
described in the book, um,

476
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,580
you want it to signal what it is.
So that readers who were like,

477
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,670
you don't want somebody looking
for a pizza to get a cheeseburger.

478
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,810
What can you tell us about your future
work? Oh, what a great question.

479
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,390
So I'm very fortunate.
Uh,

480
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,780
saint Martins has kindly picked up
the next two books in the series A.

481
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:13,770
So, uh, no mercy is
slated to come out, um,

482
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,360
January,

483
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,130
2019 and then there was another one after
that and it's read and Ellery again.

484
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,220
And the Basset Hound speed bump,
everybody likes the Basset Hound,

485
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:28,170
so he's back to, and they solve
more crimes. The second book,

486
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,070
um,

487
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,990
Ellery is sentenced to group
therapy with ordinary crime victims.

488
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,360
Like one of them is a survivor. His wife
was killed in a drunk driving accident.

489
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,130
Another one had his buddy die in
a convenience store robbery. Um,

490
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:47,580
so none of them is famous. Like Ellery,
none of them has like, you know,

491
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:51,180
crime in big bold letters and Ellory's
like she's been living with it all these

492
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:55,260
years, so she's not too keen on
getting in touch with her feelings.

493
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:00,030
So instead some of these
crimes are unsolved, uh, for
her, her fellow survivor.

494
00:31:00,031 --> 00:31:04,290
So she starts trying to solve all their
lives, all their rather than, you know,

495
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,830
doing what she's supposed to.
And then the third one read,

496
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:11,700
actually his mother was
murdered when he was an infant.

497
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,140
She was found stabbed to death just a
short way away from his crib and he was

498
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:17,850
adopted.
Um,

499
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,590
and he gets a hot new lead
after 40 years and read an LRA,

500
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,420
go to Vegas to solve his mother's murder.

501
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,240
What would you say is the surprising
part of writing a book maybe compared to

502
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:33,360
other stuff you've written
in the past? Um, sure. Yeah.

503
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:37,920
Surprising part of writing a book.
Well, I have to have some surprise.

504
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:41,360
I discovered very early on that if I,
um,

505
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,090
outline too,
too much of a detailed outline,

506
00:31:45,091 --> 00:31:48,490
I won't write the book because
it's all like, well the,

507
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,320
the hard part is figuring out the exact
phrasing and everything and if the store

508
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:55,860
is all there, I'm like, well that's
it. I don't need to do that work. Um,

509
00:31:55,861 --> 00:32:00,030
I'll just leave it in my head. Uh,
so I have a rough outline and then,

510
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,020
you know,

511
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,710
things happen where I'm riding along in
a character I didn't think was going to

512
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:07,610
do something, does something.
All of a sudden it's happening.
And I was like, Ooh,

513
00:32:07,611 --> 00:32:12,120
that's very interesting. I didn't know
you had that secret motive or you know,

514
00:32:12,121 --> 00:32:16,330
this thing and you're past that suddenly
coming out to, to light. I know I'm,

515
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:20,460
Ian Mckellen said he wrote like 13 books
before he realized his hero was Polish,

516
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,690
you know, like that was his ancestor.
He's like, oh, of course you're Polish.

517
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:25,710
I didn't know.

518
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,580
So like that's the fun
part is the discovery where
you're riding along and you,

519
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,650
you learn about your characters.
So that's,

520
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,580
I think the surprising part
and the fun part. Thank you.
