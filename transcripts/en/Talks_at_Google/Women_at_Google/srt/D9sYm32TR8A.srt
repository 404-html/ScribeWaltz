1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,750
Thank you for inviting me.
It's a thrill to be here, uh,

2
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:12,950
on the Cambridge campus of Google.
And as I'm sure all of you well know,

3
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:14,990
we are for the past year and a half,

4
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:19,280
we've been in a sort of renewed discussion
of inclusion of women in the tech

5
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:22,220
sector, the experience of
women in the tech sector.

6
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:26,720
This is a conversation that
we periodically seem to
have and I'm here to remind

7
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:30,470
you that women helped create
and found the tech sector, uh,

8
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:33,980
so much of which was created and
pioneered during World War II.

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,520
My book code girls is
not about coding so much.

10
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:40,940
It is as it is about code
breaking during World War Two,

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,680
our code breaking force was actually
larger than the British force at,

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,880
at, at Bletchley Park. And more
than half of it was female. Uh,

13
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:51,860
and this is an untold story.

14
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,820
I think of it as a mash up of
the imitation game. And uh,

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,690
and the greatest generation
actually because these women
were the hidden figures

16
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:02,810
of the greatest generation.
So a mash up of all three of those.

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,830
And I like to start my
talks with this slide,

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,860
which sort of depicts the plight
of the educated woman in 1942.

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,150
Uh,

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,150
this shows the May court at Goucher
college in the spring of 1942,

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,290
uh, uh, may court as far as I could tell,

22
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,810
it was a very common thing for
colleges to have at the time.

23
00:01:23,811 --> 00:01:25,490
It was sort of a vestige,
I think,

24
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:29,620
of a pagan fertility ritual in
which a young female colleagues,

25
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:32,480
seniors are dressed in virginal white and,

26
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,000
and symbolically ushered
into the marriage market.

27
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,840
And Galcher college at that time
was a what, what were they called?

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,610
Girls School. Uh, the women who went
there were called Galcher girls.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,930
It was an all female college
in Urban Baltimore, Maryland.

30
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,850
It's now coeducational in suburban Talson.
But at the time it was all female.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,350
It had been founded like
most women's colleges, uh,

32
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,860
in the late 19th century at a time when
people generally believed that higher

33
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:04,070
education was not only
unnecessary for women,

34
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:06,490
but not necessarily good for women,
uh,

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,060
that it sort of made women overeducated
obnoxious, difficult to live with.

36
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,940
There was actually a Harvard physician.
This is no kidding,

37
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,200
who argued that higher education made
women in fertile because it swelled their

38
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:21,290
brains at the expense of
their wounds. Uh, and,

39
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:25,550
and people accepted that or some
version of that viewpoint about the

40
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:28,850
pointlessness really of giving
women too much education.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,370
And so schools like Galcher and
the seven sisters schools, uh,

42
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,500
many of which are here in Massachusetts
were founded to tilt against that

43
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:40,700
viewpoint to show that women
deserved an education, uh, and that,

44
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,320
that women could, could succeed in
a difficult learning environment.

45
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,720
So these were very academically,
uh,

46
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,820
academically ambitious schools that were
founded to educate young women and the

47
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,360
women on this platform,
we're,

48
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:58,310
we're more unusual than they would even
have realized in the sense that at this

49
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:58,641
time,

50
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:03,641
only 4% of American women achieved
a four year college degree.

51
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,570
And one reason for that was because
of this attitude that you know,

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,350
that it wasn't necessarily good for women
to become overeducated. And of course,

53
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,620
because so many campuses in that day,
we're still close to women.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,760
The Ivy League was largely closed
to women. My home state of Virginia,

55
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,270
the University of Virginia actually held
out for as long as it could and to the

56
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:26,230
late 1960s before it would award
a full four year degree to women.

57
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,500
And so there were many campuses
that were closed to women. Uh,

58
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,610
and there were many families particularly
coming out of the depression that were

59
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:38,110
reluctant to pay the tuition for a girl
to go to college because even if a young

60
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:43,060
woman was very motivated and did very
well in terms of jobs that were available

61
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,230
after graduation,

62
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,790
really the only job a woman could
count on upon graduating from a fine

63
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,530
institution was teaching school.

64
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,380
And that's great if you
want to be a school teacher,

65
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,030
but if you want to be an engineer or an
architect or a lawyer or a physician,

66
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,990
if you're a woman, you would largely
be shut out of those graduate schools.

67
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,430
And those business at works.

68
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,320
So many families would do the calculation
and conclude that it wasn't worthwhile,

69
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,210
uh,
to educate a daughter.

70
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,900
But one reason that a family might decide
to send a girl to a girls school like

71
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:20,890
voucher would be so she could get the
proverbial Mrs degree so that she could

72
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:25,540
date and hopefully marry a young man
attending a neighboring men school.

73
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,080
Like in this case, Johns Hopkins
or Annapolis, the Naval Academy,

74
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,340
which was 20 miles away, uh,
from, from Galcher. And so many,

75
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,730
I've interviewed many of the young
women on this platform and a,

76
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:39,390
or some of them at least, uh, and, uh,

77
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,570
they recall a lot of dating and also
enormous pressure to get married.

78
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,340
And so they experienced sort of the twin
pressures back then of wanting to do

79
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:53,130
well and prove that women deserve to
be educated, but knowing that they,

80
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,010
that they were under a lot of
pressure to get married by graduation.

81
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,350
And so just to show you,
for example,

82
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:03,520
how strong this pressure was at
Wellesley College in Massachusets,

83
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:08,521
the yearbook in the class of 42 actually
had a section naming all of the young

84
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:13,510
women who were engaged to be married and
who they were engaged to be married to,

85
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,640
as well as names of women who had left
before graduation in order to get married

86
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,570
and who they had married. So that's how
intense the pressure was to get married.

87
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,130
That's why they had rituals like the May
court to symbolize that they were being

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,690
ushered into the marriage market.

89
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,020
Wellesley at the time had something
called the senior class hoop role,

90
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,320
and the lore around the hoop role was
that the winner of that would be the

91
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,970
classes first bride.

92
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,260
What I love about this particular photo
though is it shows how the world was

93
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:45,910
changing and how the trajectory of
these women's lives was about to change

94
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,870
enormously. So if you look at this
young woman where the cursor is,

95
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,120
her name was Jacqueline Jenkins.
Uh,

96
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,920
later on after she married, after the
war, her married name would be Jenkins,

97
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:59,960
NY mother,
a Bill Nye.

98
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:04,820
The science guy so you can get a
sense of her intellectual chops.

99
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,470
And this was her good friend Gwyneth
commender and these two young women had

100
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:14,300
already been secretly tapped by
the u s navy to learn how to become

101
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,630
codebreakers.
Uh,

102
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,640
so they were being ushered into an arcane
field that nobody in the United States

103
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:24,560
would, would have heard
of at that time. Um,

104
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,950
code making and code breaking.
As you may know,

105
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:32,030
many people in this room might have
indulged him that some point in your lives

106
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:32,864
are now.

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,550
It's an impulse that goes back really
to the beginning of human communication.

108
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,220
As long as we've been
able to write and speak,

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,520
we have at some point had the urge to
communicate secretly with somebody using a

110
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,740
code or cipher that nobody else can break.

111
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,450
And if you don't believe
that this is true,

112
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,460
when I speak to elementary school
audiences and I asked those kids how many

113
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:59,510
people in that classroom
have made a secret code or
safer at some point in their

114
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:04,100
lives, every hand goes up because
it's, it's also a, you know,

115
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:07,970
a really universal impulse that children
feel to communicate without adults

116
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:12,470
being able to listen in.
So Julius Caesar had a cipher,

117
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,060
you might've heard of it, he
moved that they moved, uh,

118
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,060
you would move a letter for four spaces
ahead and the alphabet and substitute

119
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:23,420
that letter that's called a
substitution cipher. As you may know,

120
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,800
the mark of a good code and cipher is
that ease of use between the people who

121
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:32,270
know the system and unbreak ability
for by the rest of the world.

122
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:35,960
So the site, the cipher that Caesar
used would satisfy the ease of use,

123
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,190
but not the, not the unbreak ability.
Uh, in terms of the rest of the world.

124
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:43,070
That's pretty easy cipher
a actually to break.

125
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,510
So these young women were being ushered
into a field that has existed since the

126
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:52,340
dawn of communication that
was very familiar in Europe
for centuries before this

127
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,270
time.
Uh,

128
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,070
because of diplomatic intrigue because
of wars between European countries, uh,

129
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,913
and kingdoms.

130
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,450
But in the United States we were more
naive about what we'd called listening in

131
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:07,130
or reading other gentleman's male. Uh, we
were reluctant before the war to do it,

132
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,140
but we were having to learn
to do it pretty quickly. Uh,
and so these young women,

133
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:14,580
these two young women,
along with about a dozen of their guts,

134
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:18,860
your classmates were being
secretly trained in a locked
classroom at the top of

135
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:19,640
Galcher Hall,

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,590
taught by a naval officer as well as
an English professor named Ola Winslow.

137
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,600
Nobody on this platform knew that they
were being prepared for a completely

138
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,930
different future than the one
that had been envisioned for them.

139
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,230
Their families didn't know, their
brothers didn't know their boyfriends,

140
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:37,400
didn't know,
their roommates,

141
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:41,060
didn't know that they were secretly
training to become naval code breakers.

142
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,570
And the reason that those young women
had been tapped to learn how to do this

143
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:48,530
work of course was
because on December 7th,

144
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,490
1941 we were attacked at Pearl Harbor.
It was a surprise attack.

145
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,940
Our fleet was anchored in Pearl Harbor
that the judge is the goal of the

146
00:08:56,941 --> 00:09:01,620
Japanese was to destroy our Pacific
fleet and to drive us to our knees.

147
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,520
It had the opposite effect. Of course,
it galvanized the American public.

148
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,620
Every young man wanted to sign up
to fight. Uh, and so it was well.

149
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,390
So the attack at Pearl Harbor was the
galvanizing event that propelled us into

150
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:18,930
World War II.
We declare war on Japan the next day,

151
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,880
Germany declares war on us several days
later and all of a sudden we were in

152
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:27,900
what was called at the
time, total war, global war.

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,010
All of a sudden men are shipping out on
aircraft carriers and the Pacific Ocean

154
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,280
on convoys going across the Atlantic
Ocean to Europe and to North Africa.

155
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,620
And so we are suddenly at war at exactly
the time when we understand just how

156
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:47,220
unprepared we are in terms of our
intelligence gathering abilities.

157
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,680
Because the other thing
that Pearl Harbor was,

158
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:54,240
was a massive intelligence failure.
So I'm from the Washington DC area.

159
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:59,040
We take for granted that we have 17
intelligence agencies in Washington now.

160
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,160
We had none of that at the
beginning of World War Two.

161
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,540
When we are suddenly sending so many
young American men into harm's way,

162
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,390
we have been reminded or we have been
sort of woken up to, uh, the, the,

163
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,910
our inability to anticipate
what the enemy is going to do.

164
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,530
A Pearl Harbor was a terrible surprise,
particularly to the u s military,

165
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,870
particularly to the u s navy and
heads are gonna roll as a result of,

166
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,500
of that terrible surprise.

167
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,910
And so what will happen in Washington
DC is that we will start to very try to

168
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:33,270
quickly build up our
intelligence gathering operation.

169
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,250
The office of strategic services will be
formed, our first release spy network,

170
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:39,780
which will become the CIA.

171
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,820
But it takes time to build a spine
that work in, in foreign countries.

172
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:50,030
And what we could learn how to do much
more quickly was intercept enemy signals

173
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,270
and learn how to break
the enemy code systems.

174
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,210
So if you've seen the imitation game,

175
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:59,600
you're familiar with at least
one of these code system,

176
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,600
which is the cipher that's being
generated by the enigma machine that the

177
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:04,620
Germans are using.

178
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,460
All of the German military services
are particularly the u boats we are

179
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:12,300
concerned about. Admiral Donitz is
communicating with every u boat, uh,

180
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,500
using enciphered communications that
have been scrambled by the enigma machine

181
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,600
that is in every u boat.
Uh,

182
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:22,500
and so that's just an example of one
system that's being used during the war.

183
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,740
And just to give you a sense of how many
enciphered and encoded systems are now

184
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:29,100
racing through the airwaves,

185
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,110
if you think of how many communications
you send through the air every day,

186
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:38,070
write emails, tweets,
Instagrams, Facebook updates,

187
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,460
everything that you send all day long, you
might be sending them. Now, if you are,

188
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,770
it's fine. But you can imagine, you know,

189
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,590
if you individually are
sending this many messages,

190
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,240
think about during World War Two,

191
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:52,840
this farflung war in which enemy
commanders and, uh, are, are,

192
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,450
are to communicate over
thousands of miles, right?

193
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,440
With the people that they command.
Emerald.

194
00:11:57,441 --> 00:12:01,000
Donna is communicating with every u boat.
Some of the u boats are thousands of,

195
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,540
you know, hundred thousand
miles away from his command.

196
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,610
And so all of these enciphered and encoded
communication systems are traveling

197
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:11,620
through the airwaves,
radio waves.

198
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:15,910
They are being encoded at enciphered
sent generally using Morse code.

199
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,180
And that is what we have to learn how to
snatch out of the airwaves and decipher

200
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,780
in order that there not be another Pearl
Harbor attack as we are sending our

201
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:27,490
young men into harm's way.

202
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,320
So the u s Navy knows that it has to
ramp up practically overnight. It has to,

203
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:36,730
as we would say today, scale up.
It's code breaking force, uh,

204
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,900
practically overnight.

205
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:42,280
And it has to do this at
exactly the moment when the
young men it would normally

206
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:45,700
recruit to learn how to do this work
are suddenly unavailable because they're

207
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,020
fighting.
Uh,

208
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:51,400
and so the navy before World War Two
had a very small code breaking bureau.

209
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:54,220
It was not a prestigious
occupation in the U s navy.

210
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,830
You can imagine if you're
a career naval officer,

211
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:59,920
you want to be commanding a ship.
You want to be out there on the ocean.

212
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,550
So there was a very small code breaking
force and there were monthly memos that

213
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:06,260
were generated to say,
where are they were getting the,

214
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:10,320
the sort of minds that they needed in
order to learn how to do this work. Uh,

215
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,630
so this was when I was doing my
research at the national archives.

216
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,440
I looked through these, these monthly
memos. And normally before the war,

217
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:20,710
the navy would have turned to MIT.
It would have turned to Harvard.

218
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:24,070
It would turn to places of the Ivy
League to find the young men who were

219
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,610
trainable to do this work.
And you can see in this memo,

220
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:32,611
the light bulb moment going on over some
naval bureaucrats head since the young

221
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:37,930
men are unavailable to us. Let's see
what these educated young women can do.

222
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,860
So you see,
I've circled new source women's colleges.

223
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,290
The light bulb moment goes on.

224
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,490
Let us try these educated and trained
young women who have been at these great

225
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:51,160
schools, they've had Latin, they've
had Greek, they've had physics,

226
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,440
they've had math, they've
had English. Uh, you know,

227
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:58,090
they had this really great liberal arts
education. Uh, so let's see if they can,

228
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:00,090
if they can serve the nation.
Uh,

229
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:05,080
and so young women at Galcher as well
as all of the seven sisters colleges,

230
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,630
Wellesley, Smith, Radcliffe, Bryn Mawr,

231
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,370
young women would be secretly identified
by their math and astronomy professors.

232
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,970
They were being invited in one
by one to secret conferences.

233
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:19,450
It was like the Harry Potter a moment
for these young women when you get the

234
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:23,530
letter a, and so they would be invited
in, they would be asked two questions,

235
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,370
do you like crossword puzzles and
are you engaged to be married?

236
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,750
And if they answered yes to
the first and no to the second,

237
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:37,120
and they would be invited to take a
secret correspondence course that the u s

238
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:41,110
navy had developed to train.
It's cryptographers to train.

239
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:45,790
It's it's crypt analysts
and code breakers. And they
would come to Washington DC,

240
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:50,200
this first cohort of women who would
train all during their senior year at the

241
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:53,840
same time that they were doing all the
academic work they needed to graduate.

242
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,620
They would come to Washington at exactly
the moment when we understand in a

243
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:01,610
major way how important code breaking is
going to be to the outcome of this war.

244
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,790
And keep in mind that in 1942 it was not
for day that we were going to win World

245
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,000
War II, that the allies were going to
win World War II. It looked very bleak,

246
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:14,780
right? All of Europe now is
occupied or as an access country,

247
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,650
Japan is a very,
very formidable foe in the Pacific.

248
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,370
So we do not anticipate that we're
going to win this war. It's a very,

249
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:26,600
very scary moment. And so the women
after they graduate in the June,

250
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:31,160
June of 1942 or their exhorted by the u
s navy to come to Washington as soon as

251
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:31,994
they can,

252
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,930
there are so many of them that they're
sitting on upturned wastebaskets in the

253
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:40,931
very crowded central naval facility and
in June of 42 if you've heard of any

254
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,580
battle in World War II and he see battle,

255
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:47,150
you've probably heard of the battle of
midway and that was a very important

256
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:51,410
battle in the Pacific that turned on
our ability to break the Japanese naval

257
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:52,244
fleet code.

258
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,630
And the reason that we knew how that fleet
code worked was because a woman named

259
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,690
Agnes Driscoll and math and music teacher
from Texas had been a civilian working

260
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:08,021
in the navy's Code Breaking Bureau and
she had diagnosed that the Japanese naval

261
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:13,601
fleet code consistent of five digit
code groups might stand for let's say

262
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,720
destroyer a five digits and then they
would add to insight for that code group.

263
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,320
They would add five digits to that
code group two and cipher each digit,

264
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:31,490
right, to change each digit using
something called non-caring edition. I,

265
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:36,491
Mr Shell had spent the 1930s figuring
out how the Japanese system worked.

266
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,610
The reason that we weren't able to read
those messages right before a Pearl

267
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,030
Harbor was because the Japanese had
changed their code books as they did

268
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,601
periodically.

269
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,460
And then we would have to start all over
again figuring out what the code group

270
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:48,290
stood for.

271
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,290
But we were back in by June of 1942 the
Japanese had set out to an bushes on the

272
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:59,240
island of midway and finish off our
Pacific fleet. We read those messages,

273
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,850
we were waiting to
ambush the end butchers.

274
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,120
We defeated the Japanese and the three
days see battle that's now one of the

275
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:06,980
most famous see battles of all time.

276
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,390
And all of a sudden it's understood that
code breaking is no longer an obscure

277
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,130
unpressed aegis occupation.

278
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,730
It's going to be central to
victory in both theaters of war.

279
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:20,960
And so the women are pouring into
Washington at exactly the moment when we

280
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:23,720
understand how important
their work is going to be. So,

281
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:28,190
just to give you a sense of the division
of Labor, when we enter the war,

282
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:29,900
if you've seen the imitation game,

283
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,990
you know that the British
thanks to Alan Turing and,

284
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,520
and a large code breaking force have
diagnosed how the German enigma system

285
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,740
works.
So the,

286
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:42,650
the British are going to be the lead
code breakers for the Atlantic Ocean and

287
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:45,350
the European theater
at least at the outset.

288
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:49,440
But we're going to be a junior partner
working with them because we are now at

289
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:52,500
risk, right? We're sending all
these young men across the Atlantic.

290
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,420
The convoys are being terribly
menaced by the wolf packs, uh,

291
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,640
that the u boats were sinking
our convoys. Uh, but, but the,

292
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,580
we're going to let the British take
the lead on that, at least at first.

293
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,700
But we have lead code
breaking responsibility for
the massive Pacific Ocean

294
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,670
where we have just been terribly
surprised not that long ago.

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,930
And so the u s navy is going to be
primarily responsible for breaking the

296
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:19,440
Japanese naval fleet code. So that's
what those young women are going to do.

297
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,461
But meanwhile,

298
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:24,450
our US army has responsibility for a
completely different set of codes and

299
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:26,490
ciphers being used by the Japanese army,

300
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,060
which is now spread out on all these
islands around the Pacific. Right?

301
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,430
The Japanese were taking the Philippines,
they've taken Guam,

302
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:35,190
they've taken wake island,
they've taken the Malayan peninsula,

303
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:38,910
they've taken all of these land masses
and the Japanese army is communicating

304
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:39,900
back with Tokyo.

305
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,550
And so our US army is ultimately going
to need thousands of codebreakers to

306
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:47,730
break these systems and
it also needs women.

307
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,640
And so World War Two is this wonderful,

308
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:55,641
terrible moment where there
is unparalleled competition
for the first time for

309
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,370
smart educated women to
show what they can do.

310
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,700
So the private sector is going
to start a competing for women.

311
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,900
Mit is going to start taking women into
its graduate programs to run it's analog

312
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:11,901
computers and the US Navy and the u s
army are going to start a hot competition

313
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,730
for educated women. Uh, when
I was doing my research,

314
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:19,350
I found memos in which the navy was
pissed off because the army got to Wheaton

315
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,760
College or Connecticut College before
it got there. Uh, and it argued that,

316
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,190
that the army was poaching
it's girls. So, um,

317
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,520
so when the U s army had to figure out
where it's going to get it's educated

318
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:33,390
women, it decides to turn to
teacher's colleges as well.

319
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:37,380
These are humbler institution where
women are being trained to become school

320
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:40,740
teachers. Uh, so I'll just show you, cause
you'll hear from her at the very end.

321
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:44,940
Dorothy Ramallah Lee was training to be
a math teacher at Indiana state teachers

322
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,740
college in Pennsylvania.
Uh,

323
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,090
to be a math teacher was a high
aspiration for a woman because a lot of

324
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:55,800
departments wouldn't hire women as math
professors. This is my central character.

325
00:19:55,801 --> 00:20:00,370
Dot. Braden. She's still alive.
She'll be 99 this June. Uh,

326
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,560
so back in 1942, she was a school
teacher in Chatham, Virginia.

327
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,730
And what I love about the
army's recruiting strategy,

328
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:13,260
which is different from the navy's,
the army decided that that recruiting,

329
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:16,800
so we went and secretly a teacher's
colleges wouldn't be enough for its needs.

330
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,730
So it decided to massively
recruit in public,

331
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,510
trying to get women to sign up to
do secret war work in Washington.

332
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,560
So he decided to recruit school
teachers, actual school teachers, young,

333
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,340
overworked,

334
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,340
underpaid young women who by definition
were single because in almost any

335
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,990
occupation at the time,
if you are a woman that you got married,

336
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,580
you were expected to quit and stay home.

337
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,080
And that was certainly
true of school teachers.

338
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,330
So these women were the ideal workers.

339
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:45,900
That's the way we would think of them
today. Underpaid, overworked, single.

340
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,340
They could work full time,
could work in the middle of the night,

341
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,960
which they would be called upon to do.

342
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,040
And the army strategy to recruit these
women, west ascendance, handsomest,

343
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,840
young army officers out to lurk
and post offices and hotels.

344
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,680
Initially it was confined to the southern
states, Joe particular bureaucratic,

345
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,320
a division because it
was recruiting civilians.

346
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,490
And so the thinking on the part of the
army was that these young women would be

347
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:12,430
induced to sign up,
would be lured to Washington,

348
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,030
hoping that they would make a marriage
to a handsome young man like the officer

349
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,110
who was recruiting them.

350
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,120
And what I love about.is she shows
how wrong headed this strategy was.

351
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,690
In fact, in 1942. Dot.

352
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,280
Was a graduate of Randolph
Macon Women's College,

353
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:31,030
which was a fine woman's college
in, in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia,

354
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:34,780
which is where she grew up. She was the
oldest daughter and a family of four.

355
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:39,781
Her mother was supporting the whole family
as a secretary at a uniform factory.

356
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,230
Um, her parents were separated.
Her mom was supporting the family.

357
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,170
Dot was now working as a school teacher.
Uh,

358
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,960
her income was very important
to the family upkeep.

359
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,950
She had two younger brothers who were
now in the fighting like every young

360
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:57,040
American woman. She wanted to do
her part to bring the boys home.

361
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,730
She also wanted to get out
of a marriage that she, uh,

362
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,740
had been sort of pressured into entering
into her college boyfriend had sent her

363
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,920
a ring and engagement ring from
training camp in California.

364
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,590
She didn't want to marry him.
She liked him,

365
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,010
but she didn't want to spend the
rest of her life with him. Uh, and,

366
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,920
but she didn't know how to get out of it
because women at the time were told to

367
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:21,460
not upset the morale of the troops.
That was a big deal.

368
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,240
Women were entrusted with the morale of,
of the fighting force,

369
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:27,520
and so she didn't feel like
she could send the ring back.

370
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,850
But the chance to go to Washington
and do unspecified secret war work,

371
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,620
uh,
was it was a way to get out of a marriage.

372
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:38,650
She wouldn't have to follow
him to training camp in
California the way that he

373
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:39,484
was pressuring her.

374
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,620
So I just love the fact
that the recruiting strategy
was exactly wrong headed,

375
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,260
even as she was very inclined
to take this job, uh,

376
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,640
to sign on the dotted line
and come to Washington.

377
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:54,790
Her other motivation was to
come to Washington. Lynchburg,

378
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,330
Virginia is three hours
away from Washington DC.

379
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,350
She had never been to
the nation's capitol.

380
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,680
She grew up there during the depression.
Her family didn't have a car.

381
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,270
She had never seen the big city.

382
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,260
And Washington now is really the beating
heart of the free world along with

383
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:12,040
London, England. You know, it's
the major capital free city.

384
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,020
So much of Europe is occupied now.

385
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,220
It would really become the heart of the
allied war effort and the chance to come

386
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:22,330
to Washington and serve that effort was
an enormous opportunity for her to help

387
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:25,330
bring her brother's home and also to,
um,

388
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,360
to make twice as much money as she could.
As a school teacher.

389
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:31,300
She was making $900 a year
teaching in school in Chatham.

390
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,650
She would make $1,600 a year
working as a code breaker.

391
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,700
So in the fall of 1943,
she found herself on union station.

392
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,660
She took a cab to a place called
Arlington Hall before the war.

393
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:46,100
It had been at what with what
they call it, a junior college,

394
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,370
which was a thing back then again when
it was thought that it was best not to

395
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,020
give women too much education.

396
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,710
A junior college was a place
where a family could send,
it's a daughter to board.

397
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:58,790
She could get high school classes as well
as a couple of years of maybe college

398
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:02,600
English and French as well as sort of
typing and horseback riding and deportment

399
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,830
and the kind of skills that were thought
for a um, you know, sort of right for uh,

400
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,110
an upscale young woman. Uh, the,

401
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:13,640
the u s military needed secure facilities
for its massive code breaking forces.

402
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,210
So it kicked those girls out
of Burlington Hall in mood.

403
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:20,240
The code breakers in built
a temporary buildings.

404
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,760
You can see here the school
teachers now being trained here,

405
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,690
they're learning the geography of
Asia. You can see them intercept, uh,

406
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,190
receiving intercepted
messages from the Pacific.

407
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,680
And you can see how big these rooms were.

408
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,450
A former school teachers are coming
now to work for the war effort.

409
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:43,280
And what dots still has a hard time
getting her mind around is that she became

410
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,690
part of one of the three most important
code breaking successes of World War II.

411
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,380
And she didn't even understand the
importance of the work that she was doing.

412
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,690
So two of them you've already heard of.

413
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,810
Art Breaking of the German enigma cipher
was one of the most important code

414
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:57,740
breaking triumphs.

415
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,950
We've heard of that because of the
imitation game and because of places like

416
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:04,160
Bletchley Park that exists now is museums.
Uh,

417
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,790
the battle of midway and are breaking
of the Japanese naval fleet code was

418
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,620
number two.
But number three,

419
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:14,621
which you don't hear as much about was
our braking of the end super enciphered

420
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,070
system being used by the Japanese army
to communicate with its supply ships.

421
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,210
So the Japanese army spread out on
these islands around the Pacific,

422
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,820
everything that's brought to them,
food,

423
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:28,760
fuel re reinforcement troops,

424
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,930
a replacement parts for aircraft.
It all has to be brought by ship.

425
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,130
These are formal commercial ships that
had been now commandeered by the Japanese

426
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:39,180
army. They're called Morrow's. Uh,

427
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,050
they are traveling around the
Pacific and other bodies of water.

428
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:45,770
They're communicating with their
central command, what they're carrying,

429
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,540
where they're headed for.

430
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,010
We're intercepting all of those messages
there are being sent back to the school

431
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:56,750
teachers.
So it's 242 school teachers including dot.

432
00:25:56,751 --> 00:26:01,700
Braden who are breaking those messages
systems as fast as they could. Dot.

433
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:04,220
Remembers running to
the overlap or station,

434
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:07,490
which was the next station of what
was basically an assembly line.

435
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,390
The women would break the message as
fast as they could so that the contents

436
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:15,080
could be radio to an American submarine
commander who would be waiting on the

437
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:20,081
horizon when the supply ship appeared
as a result of how fast and well the

438
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:24,440
school teachers worked and how well
the submarine commanders did their job.

439
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,970
We sang thousands and thousands of supply
ships to the point where most Japanese

440
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:32,840
army desk where the results of starvation
and disease because they weren't

441
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,460
getting the supplies that they needed.

442
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,660
So that's how important the
messages were that dot was breaking.

443
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:39,861
Again,
these,

444
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:44,220
these slides just give you a sense of
how massive the eye of the operation was.

445
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,880
I'll just talk very quickly about one
more system to give you a sense of how

446
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:51,270
many systems there were.
Uh, this group of women,

447
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:55,290
we're breaking the cipher system
being used by Japanese diplomats.

448
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,650
They were using machine
that we called purple, uh,

449
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:02,910
to scramble the romanized letters of,
of a Japanese transmission.

450
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,790
So this might seem counterintuitive,

451
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,190
but Japanese diplomats are
stationed in Europe, right?

452
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:11,730
They're stationed in Germany. They're in
Vichy, France, they're in occupied France,

453
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:14,400
they're in Italy. They're,
they're all over Europe.

454
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,470
They're communicated with Hitler and with,
and with,

455
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,160
with muscle Lania and with all of the
access leaders and they're reporting it

456
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,140
all back to Tokyo in very, very
detailed, wordy, diplomatic messages.

457
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,930
We were reading every single
one of those messages.

458
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,220
Thanks to a woman named Genevieve Gracen,

459
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,090
a graduate of the University of Buffalo,

460
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:38,040
who before the war had the key insight
that enabled us to break that machine

461
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,270
generated cipher.

462
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,710
She had been unable to find any university
willing to hire a female math teacher.

463
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,540
So she had been hired by the army's very
small prewar code breaking bureau and

464
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,080
had the central insight that announced
that allowed us to break that machine

465
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:56,400
cipher. And just to give you a sense
of how valuable this intelligence was,

466
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,910
when the Japanese diplomats were
invited to tour the coast of France,

467
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,120
they were invited to see
Hitler's at Atlantic Wall. Right?

468
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:06,420
His fortifications along
the coast of France,

469
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,600
they reported back where it was
well fortified, where it wasn't,

470
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,000
so that when we were
planning the d day landings,

471
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,420
we knew that Normandy would be
a better place to invade than a,

472
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:19,530
than a better fried, better
fortified spotlight Kallai. So again,

473
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,910
that's the quality of the intelligence
that was being produced by these code and

474
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:28,800
cipher systems. Again, you can see how
many women and how exclusively female,

475
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,440
uh, many of these, many
of these rooms were.

476
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,790
There was also an African American
code breaking unit for the army.

477
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,800
So the u s army was segregated
during World War II.

478
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,320
So was the army civilian
code breaking force. Uh,

479
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,990
but there was a group of African
American codebreakers again,

480
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,990
who had achieved their college
education in a, you know,

481
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:52,020
despite enormous barriers in
a segregated school system.

482
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,230
And they were working in the codes
and ciphers that the private sector.

483
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:57,180
So that'll be familiar to you at Google.

484
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,390
Familiar to everybody who does
any kind of transaction online.

485
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,370
Just today as we hope that our financial
transactions are in ciphered after we

486
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:09,630
make them an encrypted, which is our
modern word for encipherment. Uh,

487
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,830
so two were banks and companies and
encrypting their communications during the

488
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:16,230
war. And so this force was, um, this,

489
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:20,190
this group was assigned to the codes and
ciphers or the private sector to make

490
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:23,550
sure nobody was doing business with
Hitler or doing business with Japanese

491
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:27,150
companies like Mitsubishi.
So that was very important work as well.

492
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,880
So just quickly,
the navy women,

493
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:33,480
so the women on that platform graduating
from Galcher and their frilly white

494
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:37,620
dresses are now working
for the u s navy as,

495
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,810
and they are actually in the u s navy.

496
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:44,500
So this is another tipping for women
Woodward to seize the creation of the

497
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:48,700
waves. Women accepted for volunteer
emergency service. Uh, other forces,

498
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:53,470
other branch of the military will
create female, uh, divisions as well.

499
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:57,040
And so the navy decides that it wants its
female code breakers to actually be in

500
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,860
uniform and to be subject
to military hierarchy.

501
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,670
So the women are sent back there actually
to send to Smith College to officer's

502
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:08,470
training camp and they will return to
Washington, uh, as full naval officers.

503
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,150
And also this is a great moment because
women who haven't had the benefit of a

504
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:17,050
college education can
enlist in the u s navy. Uh,

505
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,450
and if they test high for aptitude,

506
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:23,170
their math abilities or the language
abilities than they will also be routed

507
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:27,010
into the code breaking operation.
So ultimately the U s navy,

508
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,860
we'll have 4,000 women working.

509
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:34,840
This is a facility that is on Nebraska
Avenue in Washington DC. They,

510
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:38,440
it was also a girl's school. They kicked
the women out, they built barracks,

511
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:40,570
they moved the female
naval code codebreakers in.

512
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:44,620
You can see again how female
these code breaking offices are.

513
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:49,360
And you can see the camaraderie of,
um, of the women working in these, uh,

514
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,040
in these offices.
Uh,

515
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:55,150
and just a quick anecdote because it's
one of my favorite anecdotes to give you

516
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:58,480
a sense of what it was like for these
women to come together from all over the

517
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:02,530
country. Ultimately, one of the
women in my, uh, in my book,

518
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:04,540
Jane Cased Huddle,

519
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,910
remembers enlisting in the u s navy.
Uh,

520
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,380
and she was actually the daughter
of a very affluent family.

521
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:13,720
Her Dad was a physicist Theodore case,

522
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:18,880
and she thought when she enlisted in the
u s navy that she would be made a naval

523
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:21,670
officer because she came
from such an elite family.

524
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,070
Her family didn't want
her to join the navy.

525
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:27,610
It was considered somewhat scandalous
for young women to go into the military.

526
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:29,590
At first,
some people thought they were bad girls,

527
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,500
but she very much wanted
to join the war effort.

528
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:37,501
And so she took the subway from the upper
east side of Manhattan down to a naval

529
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,090
recruiting station and round Wall Street.

530
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,370
And she knew that going in as an officer,

531
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:46,180
she would have to take an eye exam
and she was very near sighted. Uh,

532
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:50,350
and so she had memorize the eye chart
and she slipped her spectacles into her

533
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:52,990
pocket and she passed the eye exam.
Uh,

534
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:56,920
but then she had to go around to all of
these other medical stations to sort of

535
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:58,600
get basically the
equivalent of a physical.

536
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,440
And she got to the place where the women
were told to strip down and disrobe

537
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:07,300
because men joining the u s navy had
to undergo a group naked physical.

538
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,520
And so the women had to as well.

539
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,820
And so Jane had gone to a very
fancy women's boarding school,

540
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:14,470
girls school on the upper east side.

541
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:17,300
She had never seen another woman
without her clothes on. Uh,

542
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,880
the word breast was never uttered a at
her fancy boarding at our fancy school.

543
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,201
Uh,

544
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:25,930
so she had to take her clothes off and
then a petty officer came up and drew a

545
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:27,160
number between her breasts,

546
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:29,770
the number nine and red marker
between her breasts and said,

547
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:32,200
our now go San between eight
and 10 for your physical.

548
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,150
And Jane was so near sighted that she
not only had to really look at the other

549
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:37,421
women,

550
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:40,970
but she had to really get up close and
pier in order to figure out where she was

551
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:43,700
supposed to stand.
So that was her welcome to the u s navy.

552
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:45,440
She's never forgotten it.
Uh,

553
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,430
and her other welcome was that she
thought she would go in as an officer,

554
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,040
but the cause she had was a graduate of,

555
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:56,510
I believe it's called the Longy music
school here actually in the Boston area.

556
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,200
That was not considered by the, the
navy, the equivalent of a college degree.

557
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:04,890
So she went in as, as what was called an
ordinary seaman as an enlisted woman. Uh,

558
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,780
so she had to actually live
in the barracks along with
all of the other enlisted

559
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:10,040
women.
And she loved it.

560
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:14,270
It was the great moment of
her life getting out of sort
of debutante society and

561
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:19,250
being able to live a alongside and
work alongside women from all over the

562
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:22,790
country. It was an incredibly
important moment for her. Uh, she,

563
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:27,620
she recalls working in these,
in these rooms with incredible pride,

564
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,280
which was true of all of these women.
In fact, this is a quote from Jane,

565
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:31,581
she could,

566
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:35,420
so we could tell what was happening in
the Pacific because the stack would get

567
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:35,901
larger.

568
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:40,901
So you can see the Japanese naval
messages piled up on these women's desks.

569
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,780
They are breaking these naval messages
as fast as they can because they know

570
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:47,480
that we are pushing back
across the Pacific. Of course,

571
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:51,370
the ultimate goal is to retake the
Philippines and then possibly attack, uh,

572
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,330
the Japanese mainland.
Uh,

573
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,420
and so the women know that they're
brothers and boyfriends are out there.

574
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:57,021
In some cases,

575
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:00,410
they are breaking messages that
foretell the fate of their brothers and

576
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:03,560
boyfriends ships and they want
to do everything they can.

577
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:07,610
They have to do a lot of triage to
determine which are the most important

578
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:11,060
messages and then move them
along as fast as they can.

579
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,960
You can see this is just a worksheet
that I found in the national archives.

580
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,620
You can see that they're working,
that's five digit super enciphered system.

581
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,190
So they're doing the brain work in order
to subtract out the insight from it,

582
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,480
a re reversing the false math but non
carrying edition that's been used there.

583
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:34,430
They're having to reverse engineer that
in order to get down to the code group

584
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:37,310
and then tell what that core group stands
for in order to know where the ship is

585
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:38,940
carrying and where it's going to be a.

586
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,290
And so these are just some worksheets
that I found in the national archives that

587
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:45,320
show the brainwork and again,
just very briefly,

588
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:50,470
we will eventually take over the Atlantic
breaking of the enigma cipher from the

589
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:54,780
British. Uh, so it turned,

590
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,980
so the Germans get suspicious that we
have broken the enigma cipher as we have

591
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:04,490
add. The German navy makes its
enigma machines more complicated.

592
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,390
It adds a road or there were three
rotors originally to scramble the German

593
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:10,730
messages.
They add a fourth Roeder.

594
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:15,680
And so the British machines that Alan
Turing helped design no longer work,

595
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,270
uh, well enough to break those
systems. So we build these faster,

596
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:24,200
bigger machines at, um, at a,
at a factory in Dayton, Ohio,

597
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:29,350
there secretly transported to Washington
DC where we take over Atlantic Ocean

598
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,290
code breaking.

599
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,700
And it's pretty much exclusively being
done by women who are designing really

600
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:37,220
the equivalent of early computer menus.

601
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:41,910
They're looking at a scrambled German
message. They are conjecturing where,

602
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:45,090
and that message,
a German phrase like the sky,

603
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:50,070
a wetter weather in the Bay of Biscay
might appear and then they're doing the

604
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:53,970
mental brainwork to think, or
what loop would produce, you know,

605
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:57,660
would turn this letter into this letter
and then this letter until this letter a,

606
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:00,510
and so they're designing basically
early computer menus that will then be

607
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:04,420
plugged in those into those machines
to see if they were a plausible, uh,

608
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,100
what's called key setting. Uh,
and then if it is plausible,

609
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:10,140
they'll plug the message
into a smaller machine.

610
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:12,780
That's basically the equivalent
of the enigma. It will,

611
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,840
if it produces an actual German messages,
they know they've got it right.

612
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,020
That will be translated by women who will
then take it to the room where another

613
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:23,370
group of women,
mostly the voucher women are,

614
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:25,500
are maintaining these huge wall maps,
uh,

615
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,660
showing all of the u
boats and their locations.

616
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,080
They'll write up intelligence reports
for naval headquarters generating

617
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:33,540
intelligence reports.
And as a result of that,

618
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,750
and of course the work that was being
done in the Atlantic Ocean by submarine

619
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,793
commanders,

620
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,630
we clear the Atlantic Ocean of the u
boats so that we can send the massive

621
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:46,860
thousands and thousands of convoys ships
necessary to mount the d day invasion

622
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,360
and begin to liberate Europe.

623
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,170
And this group of women actually were
reading the u boat and messages as the

624
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,740
Germans were looking out on the English,
uh,

625
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,860
English Channel on the
morning of June six, 1944.

626
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:02,850
And they're seeing the allied invasion
as it starts and the women experience the

627
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:05,340
landing that way. Uh, and so again,

628
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:10,260
that shows you how crucially important
the women's contribution was to the war

629
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,920
effort, the kind of intelligence that
they were generating that was used by our

630
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:17,000
military. These are just
some photos of their, um,

631
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,880
their brief free time in Washington.
That's my center character dot.

632
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:22,770
Behind a pole there.
Uh,

633
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:26,790
the women were writing letters incessantly
to keep up morale to the man whose

634
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,910
lives they were trying to
save my central character dot.

635
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:34,050
Would disentangle herself from her college
boyfriend and she was riding at one

636
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,640
point about a half dozen men.

637
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,760
She was more reluctant to
have that go into the book.

638
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,740
Then the fact of her secret code breaking,

639
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,890
she was a little embarrassed that
she was writing so many guys. But um,

640
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,680
but in fact that was really
quite common at the time. Uh,

641
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,600
and then women were sending
a lot of photos as well,

642
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,180
sort of the equivalent of
selfies they were sending, again,

643
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:54,840
to keep up morale to the amount overseas.
She would make a best friend,

644
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,240
a former school teachers from Bourbon,
Mississippi.

645
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,700
Remember this was top secret work.

646
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,600
The women were told they would be shot if
they told anybody what they were doing.

647
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,230
So, even though both of these women were
working on the Japanese supply ship code

648
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:10,030
breaking effort, they never
talked about it to each other. Uh,

649
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,080
they didn't even know that they were
part of the same code breaking effort,

650
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,860
but their friendship was so strong
after the war, uh, that they remember,

651
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,390
they remain close friends. You
can see. Dot. In the stripe
shirt. Her husband, the,

652
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:25,760
the soldier, she was writing Jim
Bruce. Uh, and that's her friend. Um,

653
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,020
uh,
Ruth Weston from Mississippi.

654
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,720
Ruth would go on to work for
the NSA as a mathematician.

655
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,830
So the national security agency is our
descendant agency of our successful World

656
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,700
War II code breaking.

657
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,600
Ruth would work as a mathematician
for NSA until she became pregnant.

658
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,900
And then I found her
handwritten resignation note
from the 1950s I resigned my

659
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:49,870
position as a mathematician with the NSA
because I'm expected to be home with my

660
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:52,180
children.
And so after the war,

661
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,970
basically the women were
told in secret letters,

662
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,440
thanks very much for your service. Now get
back, get back home to the kitchen. Uh,

663
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,210
and, and those should them did leave
and go back to private life eventually,

664
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,810
either, either immediately or
eventually when they had children,

665
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,820
they were expected to leave
the workforce again and uh,

666
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:15,130
but there are friendships remained so
powerfully strong that actually when Ruth

667
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,320
Weston was, um, was engaged to her
husband who you saw in that photo, uh,

668
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,050
she invited dot up to and harassment
basically to vet him that cause she

669
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:26,230
wouldn't agree to marry him until dot.
Had given the okay.

670
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,410
And this is a group of naval
enlisted women who, um,

671
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,470
remain such close friends after the
war that they had a chain letter going

672
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:39,460
between their friendship group and that
chain letter kept going for 75 years,

673
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:44,530
uh, until, until when I was
doing my reporting. The woman
in the front, Ruth Mirsky,

674
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,420
uh, was ultimately the only one of them
left and her emails sign on his roof,

675
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,380
the wave.

676
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:54,520
So even though she could never talk about
her service and never got credit for

677
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,320
it, uh, anywhere, uh,

678
00:39:56,321 --> 00:40:01,321
her identity as a naval enlisted woman
and as a naval codebreaker remained that

679
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:05,820
important to her that her email
sign on would be Ruth the wave. Uh,

680
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,810
and so I want to leave time for questions,

681
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:11,920
so I'm just going to show two videos
that will just let you hear the voices of

682
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:15,250
the women themselves. Uh, and I
have others that are on my website.

683
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:18,640
They're actually all on youtube. So,
um, you all can easily enough listen,

684
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,890
listen to the other women as well.
So this is dot.

685
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:22,690
Talking about her train ride to Washington

686
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,340
with my two suitcases,

687
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,940
my umbrella and my rain coat.

688
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,360
I went down to the train.

689
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Now my uncle had to take me down by no
car and my mother and her sister were

690
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:46,240
standing there crying
when I got on the train.

691
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,560
I was very secure that everything was
going to be just that Washington would

692
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,140
receive me with open arms.

693
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,390
And of course you're welcome to Washington
was being told that she would be shot

694
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,820
if she disclosed the nature of
the work that she was doing.

695
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,090
And so I just want to finish it like
you hear the voice of Dorothy Ramallah.

696
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:10,930
You saw her photo earlier
in the presentation. She was
the aspiring math teacher.

697
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,440
She was called in by the Dean of women
at her teacher's college and asked to

698
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:18,310
take the army's correspondence course
and she gives you the sense of why the

699
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:20,290
women were so motivated to do this work.

700
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,000
She remember seeing all the men in her
math class rounded up and put on a bus,

701
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,790
uh, you know, to go off
to, to fight and, and, and,

702
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,110
and she recalls sort of
the emotion of that moment.

703
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,810
Oh, bus. Okay. And it was at
two o'clock in the morning

704
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,400
that the aren't arrays Santa
above to get these problem?

705
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:46,970
I don't know.

706
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,660
It seemed to me it was all
the bad knee in a that,

707
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,380
that there were no men left

708
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,110
in a car at the time, current
date, but they all had to go.

709
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:05,111
I think that Pittsburgh is the sense I
was taking mathematics at town was I was

710
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,060
one of maybe two girls up or in they cost.

711
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,160
So I knew so many of the
fellows that were going on that

712
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,360
I'm there for you.

713
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,810
And what I also love about Dorothy
Ramallah is it she became a math teacher

714
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:36,050
after the war at the public middle
school in Arlington, Virginia,

715
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,300
that my own children would later attend.

716
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,680
And so that's an example of how these
women continued to walk among us without

717
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:44,570
getting any credit for what they did.

718
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,350
And I love the thought of all of these
middle schoolers taking Mr Molly's

719
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:53,351
Algebra one or Algebra two class and
having no idea that this sweet kind woman

720
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,290
who many of them remembers that Beth
math teacher they ever had had been a

721
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,600
Badass code break during World War II.

722
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,530
She was so good at what she did that the
u s navy poached her from the U s army

723
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,660
by offering an officers'
housing allowance.

724
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,870
So she went from the Japanese supply
ship code to work in the Japanese naval

725
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:12,110
fleet code. That's how good
she was. Uh, and so, uh,

726
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:15,500
it has really been the honor of my
career to get to spend time and interview

727
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:18,980
these women about their work and to try
to get some attention to the work that

728
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:23,981
they did because it was pioneering a
code breaking hacking and computer work

729
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,260
that they were doing a
cybersecurity cyber intelligence.

730
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:29,150
This is what they were doing.
And again,

731
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,720
I think of them as the hidden figures
of the greatest generation and their

732
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:36,740
contribution, uh, was, uh,
was, was remarkable. I mean,

733
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:38,940
it helped us win the war after the war.
Uh,

734
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,640
the estimates was that that code breaking
shortened the war by at least a year,

735
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:46,760
probably more and save thousands
of lives on all sides, you know,

736
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:49,850
access and allied lives because
the war was shortened. Uh,

737
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:51,950
and so I have time to take
a couple of questions.

738
00:43:51,951 --> 00:43:54,100
If you have time before you
go back to your workplaces,

739
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,740
I'd be happy to field any questions
that you have. Thanks for listening.

740
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,140
[inaudible] given

741
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,700
that their work was secret.
I'm curious,

742
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:08,030
at what point were they allowed to speak
about it or did you have any trouble

743
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,270
getting them to talk about it? That's
a great question. Thank you for asking.

744
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:15,290
So the story of Wartime World War
Two Cobra, he'd began to leak out as,

745
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:17,690
as memoirs and histories
began to be written.

746
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:20,960
And so at a certain
point in the early 1990s,

747
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:23,180
the story was officially declassified,

748
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,400
but nobody tracked down the women and
told them that it was okay to talk.

749
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:31,620
So there were, you know, there were more
than 10,000 women who did this work.

750
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,620
Moshe then carry the
secret to their graves. Uh,

751
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:39,621
when I was trying to talk dot Braden into
telling me her story and told me about

752
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,860
a half an hour to persuade her that it
was finally okay to talk because nobody

753
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:48,330
had given them the go ahead. Uh, so, uh,
so that's why they didn't get credit and,

754
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:51,510
and, but she wanted to tell her
story because after the war,

755
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,260
both of her brothers survived the war
in both of them had top secret security

756
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:57,120
clearances in their work after the war.

757
00:44:57,121 --> 00:45:00,060
And they would get together and
Brag about their clearances and dot.

758
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:03,700
Could never tell them that she had a top
secret security clearance as well. Oh.

759
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,090
So that's how it felt frustrating.
It sometimes was,

760
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,380
I assume most of the messages that they
were decoding would be in German or

761
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:11,940
Japanese or another language.

762
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,590
Were they also then having
to take language training
so they can recognize words

763
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:17,424
when they came up?

764
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,030
Yeah, that's a great
question. So the, the, the,

765
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:23,740
the code systems that you saw that were
in, there were a number of groups. Uh,

766
00:45:23,741 --> 00:45:27,020
so let's say it stood for rice.
Let's say the core groups should,

767
00:45:27,021 --> 00:45:27,980
for me to work carrying rice,

768
00:45:27,981 --> 00:45:30,950
you didn't have to necessarily even
think the Japanese word for rice.

769
00:45:30,951 --> 00:45:33,830
You could think the English word
for, right. So some of the systems,

770
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,070
you didn't really have to know much
Japanese and the military, you know,

771
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:40,410
these supply ships, it, there was
a pretty limited vocabulary, uh,

772
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,260
that the supply ships would be using.

773
00:45:42,261 --> 00:45:44,090
So they could be taught
a little bit of Japanese,

774
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:47,710
the names of islands and things like
that. And, and work with those, um,

775
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,840
those numerical code systems.
But if it was the enigma machine,

776
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:55,400
which was scrambling German messages,
or if it was the Japanese purple machine,

777
00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:00,350
which was taking romanized, that's
essentially phonetic spelling of Japanese,

778
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:04,460
uh, that is then scrambled by the machine.
And then what you get at the end is,

779
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:09,080
again, phonetically spelled Japanese.
They did need translators. So if, if a,

780
00:46:09,081 --> 00:46:11,810
if a young woman from the seven
sisters had majored in German,

781
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,470
she would be snatched up to work
at the enigma unit. And similarly,

782
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,750
there weren't many people
who knew Japanese, but,

783
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:19,550
but some people who did were missionaries.

784
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,550
And so graduates of Bible colleges
would actually be improved,

785
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,880
recruited to work as Japanese,
uh, translators. And in fact,

786
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:27,530
the Japanese surrender message,

787
00:46:27,531 --> 00:46:31,820
the first person who read that was a
young woman who was a graduate of Bethany

788
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,601
College in West Virginia.

789
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:35,330
She had been a missionary and so
she was being used as a translator.

790
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:37,910
So she was the first person who
read the Japanese surrender message.

791
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,740
I'm Kevin a spot, my [inaudible]
interested in this subject area.

792
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,390
Why did he start at researchers?

793
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,770
I happen to have a conversation with
a group of historians at the NSA.

794
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,640
All of our,

795
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,990
most of our federal agencies
have wonderful historians
offices like the FBI does,

796
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:55,580
the CIA does,
NSA does.

797
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:00,910
And I was speaking to a woman historian
there and a a woman who is a curator at

798
00:47:01,161 --> 00:47:04,280
the, uh, we have a little
cryptography museum in Fort Meade,

799
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:06,650
Maryland that is our
equivalent of Bletchley Park.

800
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:11,820
And they told me this story based on
some documents that I had come across a,

801
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,530
I was talking to them and they spent
several hours with me and laid out the

802
00:47:15,531 --> 00:47:18,980
story at a time when I didn't
know anything about code breaking.

803
00:47:18,981 --> 00:47:21,620
I look back at some of the questions
I asked them and sort of my level of

804
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:24,680
ignorance. This is
embarrassing, but, um, uh,

805
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,630
so the minute I heard the story,

806
00:47:26,631 --> 00:47:28,550
I thought it would be an
incredible story to tell. And,

807
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,540
and is a time period when I hidden figures
had not yet been published. Uh, uh,

808
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,310
there's a great book called rise of
the rocket girls that wasn't out yet.

809
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,280
So there were a number of books
that were percolating along kind of

810
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:43,390
simultaneously about women's contributions
to the stem field and to American

811
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:45,880
history. Uh, and so the
minute they told me the story,

812
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:49,840
I knew that I would like to try to tell
it and I just had to ascertain whether

813
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:53,890
or not I could find any women who would
be in their mid nineties. Uh, you know,

814
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:57,460
who could tell me about the work and
whether I could find documentation to

815
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:58,600
support their recollections.

816
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:01,870
Because of course I couldn't use their
recollections unless I could document it.

817
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,920
And I was surprised at how I had to
have a lot of records declassified.

818
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:06,880
It took about a year and a half,

819
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:11,050
but there was a lot of information
already in the archives at the national

820
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:14,830
archives hit that had just really been
neglected by historians, I must say,

821
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:18,100
because the cryptographic museum
now have copies of your book.

822
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,130
I think that that's a good question.
I think it does. Yes, I fit check.

823
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,160
Thank you for asking. So this sounds like
a story that more people need to hear.

824
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:30,670
Will there be a movie?
It has.

825
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:33,970
It has been optioned and it's working
its way through that process. So I agree.

826
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:38,320
I mean that really is how many, you know,
many people come to stories like this,

827
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:39,900
so thank you.
Scott,

828
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,990
did you find any records in the colleges,

829
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,820
like in all of the seven sisters colleges?

830
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:48,850
Did they keep their own records about
the women who left during the war?

831
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,320
That's a great question. Oh, I'm sorry.

832
00:48:50,321 --> 00:48:52,810
Women who left during the war
to do this work. Yes, yes.

833
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,380
So Wellesley college in
particular has done a good job,

834
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,580
a really good job of maintaining those
archives. And Galcher has as well.

835
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,430
Some of the other schools really didn't
even necessarily know that it had

836
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:07,510
happened because very few records were
kept. And the only reason that Wellesley,

837
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,850
one of the reasons is,
is a class of 19,

838
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:13,930
I'm a member of the class of 1942 decided
to send surveys to all of her female

839
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:17,440
classmates to find out what they
did during the war. And, and, and,

840
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:20,890
and the number of them wrote to
say, well, I was a code breaker. Uh,

841
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,980
and this was the first inkling really,
that,

842
00:49:22,981 --> 00:49:25,150
that any of their classmates
had of what they had done.

843
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,800
And I went and looked at those archives.

844
00:49:26,801 --> 00:49:30,040
And it's fascinating though to see what
the other women were doing as well.

845
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:35,070
You really get a sense of how women were
being suddenly recruited by Armstrong

846
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,830
Cork, uh, by, you know, all
of the defense contractors,

847
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,250
they're all out there reading blueprints
and, and you know, using their math and,

848
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:47,210
and language educations in so
many different capacities. Uh,

849
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,960
so that was actually,
that was a wonderful trove of documents.

850
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:52,870
It really gave me a sense of, and the
women themselves, remember they said,

851
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:53,021
you know,

852
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:58,021
we had so few recruiters on campus in
1941 and everything changed by 1942

853
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,790
thank you for spending your birthday.
