1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,950
Thank you. Let's get right to
it. Uh, the obsidian collection,

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,940
that term obsidian comes
from a volcanic rock.

3
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:18,800
It's a dark glass that's
formed when lava and dirt,

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:21,770
certain explosions,
all of that come about.

5
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:26,210
So there are lots of obsidian around
Hawaii and other places where there are

6
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:31,160
volcanoes. I love the name because I
think that's what black culture is.

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,990
Beautiful Black, shiny, formed
from high pressure, heat,

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,920
et cetera. And that's what we're
doing. The obsidian collection,

9
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,570
we're collecting the black archives,

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,340
but more than just that we're digitizing
them and making them available for

11
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,630
younger generations.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,020
And as I started the project just
a little bit over three years ago,

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,080
we were asked why,
why are you doing that?

14
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:00,530
There's already archive groups
that are collecting history.

15
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:05,450
The universities are collecting it.
And uh, we got that big beautiful new,

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,850
uh,
Black Smithsonian in DC.

17
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:12,680
So why do you need to form
the obsidian collection?

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:18,010
And I think I can best communicate
that and telling you about my love of

19
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:22,880
football. Now I know it's going to,
it's going to work its way back around.

20
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,210
But I love football.

21
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,520
I Love Chicago bears football.

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,890
And I can tell you from when I was
five to seven years old, I was,

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,230
my dad's friends would come over.

24
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:41,231
We had a giant floor model TV and they
would let me get the beer and they will

25
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:42,710
let me empty the ash trays.

26
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:47,711
Now this is the late sixties
early seventies so beer
cans were made of like what

27
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:50,450
I would think was solid titanium steel.

28
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,590
And the ashtrays were these
huge ceramic platters.

29
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:59,450
So my responsibility was important.
I remember the screens be in green,

30
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,640
they're being white lines on the screen.
People would crash into each other.

31
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,570
And then my father and his friends
would either cheer or gea and it was

32
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:15,350
football. And I love
football. Now fast forward,

33
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:18,650
I started seeing football throughout
my life and I know how football works,

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,750
the x's and the o's lineup.

35
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,740
Then they crash into each other and then
somebody throws in the yellow towel and

36
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:32,270
then people stand around
like this and then they wait,

37
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:36,710
and then the guys and the stripes
come out and do some things.

38
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:41,711
And then they either say this way or
they say that way and then you cheer or

39
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:45,500
[inaudible]. Now I've been
watching football my whole life.

40
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,420
I would argue with you that I love
football just like any other American.

41
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,020
And I love the Chicago bears.
I'm a native Chicago.

42
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,790
But imagine if I was the
curator of the Chicago bears,

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,660
I would put together an exhibit and it
would be all of the collisions, right?

44
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:08,290
Because that's what they kind of do.
They run into each other a lot.

45
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,180
They line up and then they run
into each other and then they,

46
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,000
then somebody throws the towel.
I've seen it.

47
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,510
So what I would do is I would have an
exhibit of all the collisions and then I

48
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:27,550
would have another exhibit of the towels
because they went from like a mustard

49
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,850
and then they started being more yellow.
I do remember that.

50
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,390
And then I know when some of the bigger
games they pour containers of water on

51
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:40,340
each other at the end of big wins.
I do know that to not,

52
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,760
it doesn't make a lot of sense,
but that's happens in football.

53
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,140
And I love football.

54
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,980
So one of my exhibits is going to be all
the coolers of water dunking on people

55
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,250
because that's football
to me and I love football.

56
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Now somebody who actually likes football
would go to my exhibit and inside of 15

57
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:06,130
seconds they would go,
what is this?

58
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,780
And this isn't football.
They are layers to football.

59
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,300
And there's a whole ecosystem and
culture around football and this isn't

60
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,553
football.

61
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,710
And that's what happens with a lot of
African Americans that walk into an

62
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:27,430
exhibit and go,
what is this?

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,530
It's people who just
focus on the collisions.

64
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,630
So you just here picking protests,

65
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,930
slave struggle, and it's like, um,

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,480
look,
there are layers to this thing.

67
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,340
This isn't the sum total
of the black experience.

68
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,290
And just like me with football,

69
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:58,180
and this is true because that is my
understanding of football. I would say,

70
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:01,660
well, explain football to me. And then
people who know football, like, look,

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,180
you just don't know for a ball and you
can't be in charge of it. It's not.

72
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,550
It's okay that you think you love it or
whatever your association is with it.

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,640
That's not the sum total of football.

74
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,180
And I remember my senior year of college,

75
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,210
the bears went to the Superbowl
and I watched it with everybody.

76
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,110
And again,
they lined up.

77
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,160
I don't know what the problem is cause
that's what happened. They lined up,

78
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,960
there was a snap, somebody man, this
way, somebody, they ran into each other,

79
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,000
somebody throwing the towel. This is
what, this is what I see. And I love it.

80
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,860
But I loved everything around it.
I'm football adjacent, I'm not,

81
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,110
I don't, I should not be in charge
of telling the story of football.

82
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,060
So it was then when one of
my friends said after they,

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,000
after we won, I know we won. I do
that, that we won that Superbowl.

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,990
The um, one of my friends said, who
do you think is going to be the MVP?

85
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,420
I didn't know what an MVP was,

86
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,090
but everybody burst into conversation and
they started discussing these plays in

87
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,520
these little nuances and
all of this other stuff.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,490
And that's when I realized I don't
know what they're talking about.

89
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,640
And that's how black culture is.

90
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,760
You can be adjacent and you can love it,

91
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,920
but there's a lot of layers to it
and it's important that there be an

92
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,950
independent free standing organization
run by black people to cure rate that

93
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:38,590
story because we can walk
into an exhibit and go,

94
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,420
I get it. It's a protest
struggle, SSA slave.

95
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,530
It's a lynching. It's like, it's
like that's all that's there.

96
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:53,531
So it's important for us to
take the narrative back and
that's what the obsidian

97
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:58,940
collection is doing.
So we started with the Chicago defender.

98
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,090
Now many people know,
and I don't want to preach to the choir,

99
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:06,980
but the Chicago defenders started in
1904 and it's essential to black history

100
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:11,960
because as we were freed his slaves,
everybody needed to know.

101
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,860
People wanted to start migrating away
and the Chicago defender was different

102
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:20,861
from other newspapers and they took the
initiative to actually start getting

103
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,420
these newspapers down south.

104
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,420
So they partnered with the Pullman porters
and the Pullman porters were in a way

105
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:31,820
to make extra money. They were
distributed in selling the papers.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,630
When in down south it was kind of frowned
upon for black people to actually even

107
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:38,780
read,
let alone get the scoop on where to go.

108
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,170
So the Chicago defender actually helped
show black Americans what was going on

109
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:50,810
in the rest of the states, where they
should go, where safe passage was,

110
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,930
what to dress like when you come up north,
what to wear.

111
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,800
All of those good things came
through the Chicago defender and um,

112
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,810
the Chicago defender had sold the family,
the original family from 1904.

113
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,350
So the paper in about 2007,

114
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,130
the theory was that all of the images
were taken by the family and then some

115
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,320
were given to the library,
some to Getty, et cetera.

116
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,010
And there weren't that many images laugh.
So when we came there,

117
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:24,011
we thought they were going to be 10,000
images and we found actually 250,000

118
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,990
images in this one room.

119
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,950
And what happened to me was you can't see
250,000 images of yourself and ever be

120
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:37,250
the same. Right? So it was like
being bit by a radioactive spider.

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,790
We said we got to get
this information out and,

122
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,590
and I've learned through my own child
that young people get everything through

123
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,430
the smartphone.

124
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,900
So when I was telling my son about some
of the stories and some of the things we

125
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:54,440
found, he would go right to his smart
phone and say, well that's not in here.

126
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,660
And you know, are you
spelling it right? You know,

127
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,980
and I remember in my own naivety,

128
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,530
I thought when the Internet was invented
that everything was automatically on

129
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:11,610
the Internet. Like, well now it's on the
Internet now through some kind of magic,

130
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,660
what I came to learn was we weren't
digitizing the black newspapers.

131
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,090
The black photo journalists
weren't getting,

132
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,120
there just weren't specific platforms
to get the information out there so that

133
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,850
younger and future generations
can immediately access it.

134
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,140
So that's one of the things
we started with the Chicago,

135
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,850
the Chicago defender was our first
effort and now we have a lot of black

136
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:43,851
newspapers in the queue to share their
images so we can get them out so that

137
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:47,190
everybody can see him
until fabulous new stories.

138
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,210
So what John mentioned, we, we
have a wonderful partnership.

139
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:54,740
Our first immediate platform is through,
uh,

140
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,980
Google Arts and culture who we met
through the black Googler network.

141
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,000
And we started by just
putting up some images.

142
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:07,950
Now these are just three of a quarter
of a million. And so, you know,

143
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,510
I narrowed it down. You're
welcome. And uh, but the,

144
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:15,600
the first image I like a lot because
it's just one of the secretaries when the

145
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:19,740
Chicago defender move their offices
into the south loop of Chicago,

146
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,600
that's an important play.

147
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,660
That story is on the Google Arts and
culture obsidian page and it's a series of

148
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,350
images,

149
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,350
but just being able to accomplish a
feet like that back in those days.

150
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:36,270
And then there were printers in the
basement and all of those other feeds.

151
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:40,650
Those are, those are the kind of place
that we would discuss amongst ourselves.

152
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:43,410
That's the kind of information that would,
would,

153
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,220
that's the narrative of
how we see ourselves. Um,

154
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,640
aside from just the newspapers
and the photographers,

155
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:55,350
we've got small community archives
joining us. And so the other picture,

156
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:58,380
the opposite one is a Fred
Hutchinson with a plane.

157
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,900
Wonderful story of this guy who
wanted to fly planes. But as a,

158
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,080
a black man in the early 1920s,
there was a nonstarter,

159
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,440
but his family was a family of means.

160
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,680
So his father bought him an airplane
and so he learned how to fly by starting

161
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:19,680
the plane,
getting in it and flying it.

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,800
And Landon, you know, that
he, that happened and uh,

163
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,860
and that, that was hidden. There was
a small plane, a single engine plane,

164
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,270
but he wanted to learn how to
fly the commercial airplane.

165
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:34,640
So he moved to Canada and he joined
the Royal Canadian Air Force where he

166
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:39,600
learned, then he eventually moved to
Haiti and opened up a black flight school.

167
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,370
But by then we were entering World War
II and America had decided we're going to

168
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,330
need some black pilots.

169
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:49,260
So he actually became a flight
instructor for the Tuskegee airman.

170
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,650
So that story is from
shorefront legacy archives.

171
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,970
They've been collecting the history of
the black people who lived on the gold

172
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,780
coast in the 19 hundreds that's
a story that doesn't get told,

173
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:05,440
but it was a lot of them.
And that was, you know what,

174
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,170
120 years ago,
but we were there too.

175
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,460
So shorefront has a great archive
and now the obsidian platform,

176
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,850
they've joined us and we'll be able
to get those stories to the world.

177
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,260
The one in the middle,

178
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,590
it's just one of my favorite photos
because it's just black boy joy.

179
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,750
I raised a black sign in in Chicago and,
and the kids have fun,

180
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,810
but that's not the narrative
that's in the mainstream.

181
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,150
But my life was fun. My son's
life was fun. If he says it's not,

182
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:37,390
he's lying was amazing.

183
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,320
I was an awesome parent.
But those,

184
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:43,570
we've got a ton of images like that.

185
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,050
This is one of my favorite and this just
helps me communicate that we're not,

186
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,930
I'm not doing this alone
because I'm not an archivist.

187
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:54,430
They will let you know that, that uh,
that's a postgraduate degree industry.

188
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:59,350
I am not an archivist. I
am not a historian. They
will let you know that too.

189
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,040
Uh, and that's a phd process.
So what I am as a storyteller,

190
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,050
but I've aligned our s with experts
and we're creating new experts.

191
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,040
This picture,

192
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,960
the man with the hat is Joe Lewis and
he's a famous boxer and I knew he was a

193
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:18,961
boxer because when I was a kid we drank
Joe Lewis milk and on the cover he was

194
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:24,100
posing like this and he had on boxing
gloves. So I knew he was boxing.

195
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,910
I didn't know he was one of the most
famous boxes ever. Blah, blah blah.

196
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,590
But that's Joe Lewis,
the guy in the metal judge Duke Slater.

197
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,390
Duke is the first African American
linemen to play in the NFL.

198
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,170
And that story doesn't
get that much coverage.

199
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:45,730
I will spare you in long and short.
The in NFL in 1926 he was,

200
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,770
he's got one of the best records. It was
just broken recently by a Chicago bear,

201
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:56,070
but the NFL let five black people play
in 1926 then they hokey pokey and it back

202
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,060
and said no, no black
players. So he, it went down,

203
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,100
it was five then it went down to zero.

204
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,280
So he was the first head coach and formed
the Chicago Negro All star football

205
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:13,090
team and after he retired football.
And this,

206
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:14,410
you're just as long story about that,

207
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:17,020
but we'll get those narratives out
there because it's a good story.

208
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,840
In 1928 he actually got his law degree.

209
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,230
So after he retired from football,

210
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,220
he became an assistant assistant district
attorney and then he's the second

211
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,350
elected judge in Chicago.

212
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,650
That is an important
part of our narrative.

213
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,770
We got to get those stories out
there so that this is second nature.

214
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,790
But the picture in the defender archives,
they were on the back.

215
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,960
It was written judge
Duke's later and Joe Lewis.

216
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,290
So I put that on Google Arts and
culture. That's it. Those two.

217
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,890
So one of my friends call
me who's 60 and he said,

218
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,740
why don't you credit the other guy?

219
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,510
Now you as people of a certain age know
who that is, right? You know that it is.

220
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,080
I didn't know who that was and it wasn't
written on the back because you know my

221
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:09,590
love of sports, but I won't bury the lead
too much longer. That's Jackie Robinson.

222
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,020
Now I only know one image of Jackie
Robinson is the one that's on the trading

223
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:18,260
card when he was 24 and so my friend said,

224
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,170
I'm gonna need you to write Jackie
Robinson's name up there. And I said,

225
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,800
but it doesn't say Jackie
Robinson on the back.

226
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,900
And that's not how
you're supposed to do it.

227
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:30,980
You're supposed to record the history
that it's accurate. And he said, you know,

228
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,843
and

229
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,580
anybody with a pulse of a certain age
wouldn't have thought to need to write

230
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:40,160
Jackie Robinson's name.
So I would tell younger people,

231
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,370
it's like if you had 100
pictures of Lebron James,

232
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,360
you wouldn't feel the need to make
sure you wrote his name on every page.

233
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,400
But fast forward 50 years later,

234
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:53,960
some child that has not been
born yet is going to go, what?

235
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:57,530
No name on there.
So we threw that out.

236
00:15:57,531 --> 00:16:02,531
So I asked five other people who were
over 60 do you know who this isn't even

237
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,120
looking at me like is this a cause? You
know who that is? Right. And I was like,

238
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:10,220
well I'm just trying to see if you know,

239
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,870
you know before we actually put
Jackie Robinson's name on there.

240
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:19,871
But the other beauty about this
photograph is these were three captains of

241
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:24,350
sports, boxing, football and baseball.

242
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,410
And they were actually
playing golf because Joe Lewis
made serious inroads into

243
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:31,580
pro am and the PGA.

244
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,560
And so this for black people
who knows sports better than I,

245
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:41,090
but you know, I know football, the, these,

246
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,520
these kinds of stories and these pictures,

247
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:47,780
they knew they were taking an iconic
photo and we've got to make sure that not

248
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:48,770
only do we get the photo,

249
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,980
but we've got to get the elders involved
to make sure we get the good Intel on

250
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:55,940
there. Cause I know everything
else really well except sports.

251
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:01,550
But we also have added more than
just photo journalism in history.

252
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:04,310
We've got a fashion and
beauty photographer,

253
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:09,311
Ernest Collins loaned us 120 images that
we put up for black history month this

254
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,470
year.
So on our Google arts and culture page,

255
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:17,420
we've added a lot of fashion and beauty
specifically because that's part of our

256
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:18,254
history.

257
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,820
The key part of that is we also
want to alter the metadata.

258
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,570
So when you go and Google
black man in Chicago,

259
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,730
primarily what's being populated,
our news outlets and crime.

260
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,780
So you don't, you only get
images from 1940 if you're lucky,

261
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:37,340
but you mainly get crime.

262
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,530
So it's important that as the obsidian
uploads all of this metadata onto the

263
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:46,280
Internet, when you type in black
man, black woman, all of this,

264
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,360
we're going to be populating it with,
uh,

265
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,690
hundreds of thousands of images that
are not the collisions because that's

266
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:57,410
already been done.
So we're picking the,

267
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,370
the real intricacies of the
culture of the layers to this game.

268
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,480
So let's get back to reclaiming
the Chicago narrative.

269
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,180
And let's talk about
Bronzeville. I'm going to go
over what a lot of people know,

270
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,200
maybe others don't. But this is one of
my favorite photos. So we don't own this.

271
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:19,080
When this was actually owned by the
library of Congress and it's completely

272
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:19,801
royalty free.

273
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:24,801
It was shot in 1940 1941 and most of us,

274
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,090
this is the Goto photograph
for Bronzeville, but this was,

275
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,700
this was just a photographer come to here.

276
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,060
Another narrative about
how brands Bronzeville was,

277
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,070
but he just stopped five ordinary boys
who were on their way to Sunday school

278
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,020
and said,
take a picture in front of this car,

279
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,340
because that's what Bronzeville looked
like. If we're writing the story,

280
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,030
this is just another day in the life,
everybody dress like that.

281
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,840
All of the images from my childhood,
that's what they looked like.

282
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:58,020
So Bronzeville was called the black belt,

283
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,000
but there was also a restricted covenant.

284
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,240
So as we were moving in droves from
about 1916 forward 1916 and 1948 it was a

285
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:13,140
law on the books that black people
could only live in a specific area.

286
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,490
And that was to call
the restricted covenant.

287
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,650
So we all piled into Bronzeville.
It's not the Bronzeville proper today,

288
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:27,651
it's about seven of those neighborhoods
and it's a big part of the south side.

289
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,490
So with the black belt,
somehow we had three hospitals,

290
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,960
six newspapers,
1000 small black owned businesses,

291
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,260
2000 people worked in the numbers game
and we were three times densely more

292
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:45,060
densely populated than
the rest of Chicago.

293
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,240
So if you pick the a certain
series of blocks in north side,

294
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,600
there'd be 20,000 people that same
square footage in Bronzeville,

295
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,240
60,000 so we were piled in,

296
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,020
but it wasn't what the narrative,

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,500
kind of what the narrative I've
been reading kind of leads us to.

298
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,600
It was vibrant.
So we had the Jones department store,

299
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,890
we had the palm tavern, we went
to the theaters, we had clubs.

300
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,910
Bronzeville was really extremely exciting,

301
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,680
populated and vibrant.

302
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,780
I'm stunned at this current narrative
that kind of implies, again,

303
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,180
just collisions of,
I dunno,

304
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,640
they came here and Gosh, we got to help
them. And it's like, wait, you're, you're,

305
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:33,870
you're leaving something out.

306
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:39,170
So we've got to get that online so
you guys can go to it as quickly as,

307
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,110
what I love about the youth culture
is somebody puts out a fact,

308
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,980
you guys clap back so fast with all kinds
of facts and links and hyperlinks is

309
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,010
like boom, boom, boom, boom.

310
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,780
And so we've got to get this information
digitize so that you can clap back

311
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,950
against these negative stories.

312
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:02,130
I don't know if it's that they are
black adjacent or if it's malicious,

313
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't know. But the truth
will set us all free and easy,

314
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:11,050
quick access to the truth will
get us there. So I'll leave it to,

315
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:13,810
I'll leave the clap back to you
guys cause I can't text that fast,

316
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:18,730
but we'll get the information out there
so that you can have access to it.

317
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:24,030
But I was trying to figure out how did
we do all of that with out all of this

318
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:28,030
help that has become the new narrative.
Like oh my goodness,

319
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:32,560
if we don't help them by, you know,
eliminating their entire culture,

320
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,940
then they won't be helped.

321
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,860
So what we also did was formed
what we call the elder circle.

322
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,410
And we started talking to
people from Bronzeville.

323
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,880
We've started interviewing and
filming them and talking to them,

324
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:53,881
getting the nuances of what's happening
in Chicago and what happened back in

325
00:21:58,421 --> 00:21:59,620
those days.

326
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:03,730
Now the guy in the corner is
not a of that same generation.

327
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,030
His Nathan Thompson who wrote
a book called the Policy Kings,

328
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,960
and actually we'll be doing a documentary,
we'll be doing film.

329
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:16,170
There's a lot that will be going on that
will be explaining why Bronzeville was

330
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:20,680
vibrant. And it was mainly
because of the number runners.

331
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,420
Now I'll say this,
the uh,

332
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,010
and now because I don't want to give
that story away cause that's coming.

333
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,910
But essentially those were the guys
who played, who ran the numbers,

334
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:35,320
which is like the lottery. I think it's
important when I'm telling the story,

335
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,710
I'm starting a narrative of 1746.

336
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,030
The New York general assembly had a
lottery and they built king's college,

337
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,430
which went on to become
Columbia University.

338
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,410
So when somebody else is telling the
story a lottery is acceptable. But,

339
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,200
and then when we did lottery it became,
you know,

340
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:59,020
thuggery and illegal and
illicit and all of those things.

341
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:01,510
That's why it's important to
drive your own narratives.

342
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,870
But the policy king's lived
in the community and they
actually invested in the

343
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:09,520
community and if you want to
just open up a small business,

344
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,550
you would get a small business
loan from a policy king.

345
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,540
So that's how we were able to
be vibrant and self sufficient.

346
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,600
So I want to make sure that we
get that information to you guys.

347
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:27,810
So that's kind of the overview of what
the obsidian collection is and why we're

348
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:33,040
doing it and what it is.
So to take that forward,

349
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,700
I am going to invite my colleague,
my young colleague,

350
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,390
who has been amazing and bold in that
she's one of the cofounders of the tribe

351
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,070
and they are a

352
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,660
digital platform that speaks to
millennials. I'll say this, when I saw it,

353
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:53,630
I was like, I don't know who some of
these people are. My son was like, oh,

354
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:57,590
I know all these people are.
And he immediately joined the tribe.

355
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:00,950
I've joined it too, but I'm going
to bring Morgan up to the stage.

356
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,093
Let's give Morgan.

357
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,810
Thank you.
Thank you.

358
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,440
So first I want to ask you
to tell everyone what is oh,

359
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,110
to tell everyone what is the tribe?
Sure.

360
00:24:19,111 --> 00:24:24,111
So the tribe is a publication
and production company
with a mission to reshape

361
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:28,560
the narrative of black Chicago.

362
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,540
And we were born out of resistant to
the dominant narrative of Chicago,

363
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:36,940
which is that the dominant
narrative of black Chicago, right?

364
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:41,520
Which is that we are a violent
throwaway community and especially black

365
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:46,521
millennials in youth that we are not
invested in or that we don't care about

366
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:52,050
black lives, which,
um, is, is a gross lie.

367
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,910
So, um, I did a crazy thing and I said,

368
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,110
I can't take it anymore.

369
00:24:58,111 --> 00:25:03,111
I can't continue to watch the news
and see black bodies on the ground.

370
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:11,241
I can't continue to read the newspapers
and see sensationalist headlines about

371
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:14,650
what the body count was
this weekend. And, um,

372
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,870
I called one of my best friends who I
went to Northwestern width and I said,

373
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:23,310
what can we do? Um, she's a journalist
and I talked to her and I said,

374
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,680
why don't you quit your
job at your newspaper,

375
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,210
move back to Chicago and write
about what you care about.

376
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,080
And that's what we did. Is that
Tiffany? That's Tiffany. Yeah.

377
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,620
Cause what I love about you guys'
logo is it's, it's, it's forward,

378
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,330
it's progressive,
it's young and it's,

379
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,820
I guess the tribe.
Why did you call it the trial?

380
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,510
We needed it to feel communal and we want
it black Chicago to feel like this is

381
00:25:50,731 --> 00:25:55,260
ours. That we are finally taking back
our narrative. I want you to talk about,

382
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,820
that's Tiffany, that's you in the middle.
And tell me who the other gentleman is.

383
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,670
Um, that's David. He's our
web developer and designer.

384
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,620
So he's the one that
came up with that logo.

385
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:08,490
And it's funny because I actually pushed
back with him on it and then he said,

386
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:11,970
I thought you wanted to do news
different. And I was like, you know what?

387
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,640
You're right. We're not going
to look like your typical, uh,

388
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,230
mainstream media platform.
This is going to look like a movement.

389
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:22,230
We're going to brand it. It's
going to be a lifestyle. Yeah.

390
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,640
Well as grade one of the things
I, when I met Morgan, um,

391
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,190
I was so moved by the entrepreneurship.

392
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:33,360
It reminds me of all of the
entrepreneurship that I've
learned in the archives

393
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:34,320
and then the history.

394
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,950
But one of the things I wanted to
make sure everybody understood.

395
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:41,760
One of the platforms you
guys did was shy vote.

396
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,380
Can you tell us about that?
We're a small collective. Really.

397
00:26:45,381 --> 00:26:46,850
There really is three of us.

398
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,330
And so many people think that
we're this huge conglomerate.

399
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:53,690
But really we hire
freelancers and we hire, um,

400
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,400
black voices to help tell these stories
about black Chicago. But at our core,

401
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:02,990
we thought there's no way that we're
going to be able to take on the elections

402
00:27:02,991 --> 00:27:07,370
with all the 5 million candidates
that there are. So what can we do?

403
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:12,020
So I said, why don't we reach out to
other independent platforms and say,

404
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,550
can we come together and amplify each
other's stories so that we're not

405
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:21,551
duplicating the same efforts and then
create an election guide together?

406
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,100
And that's what we did. So we reached
out to the better government association,

407
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:29,900
Chicago reporter, the daily
line, Black Club, shy south side,

408
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:30,501
weekly,

409
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:35,030
a bunch of organizations to put together
this nonpartisan election guide.

410
00:27:35,031 --> 00:27:36,800
So it's shy.vote.

411
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,740
That's great.
What do you think that the Obsidian,

412
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,940
the platform that we're building,
which should launch later this year,

413
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,130
how do you think that those tools
can help what you guys are doing?

414
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,160
Well, we had the same mission. It's all
about reshaping the black narrative. Um,

415
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,910
black youth are not being told
the truth about who we are.

416
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,880
It's not taught in schools.
Um,

417
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,300
there's no way for us to find some of
this information really until we get to

418
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,040
college.
When we get to college,

419
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:12,750
that may be the first time that we start
reading texts by black authors. So,

420
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:17,130
um, when I think about the news and I
think about a hundred years from now,

421
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,560
what are people going to go to,

422
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:23,100
to reference what Black
Chicago is right now?

423
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,880
Can you really look at the
archives of the Tribune or,

424
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,970
or any anywhere and say this is a
full picture of what black Chicago is,

425
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:36,480
when the majority of that is going
to be headlines about who was slain.

426
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,920
So we see the tribe as someone and the
obsidian collection as someone who can

427
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:43,650
step in and say,
here is a more holistic,

428
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:47,040
multifaceted view of
who we are as a people.

429
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,810
That's great.

430
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,810
I think what I was hoping to make sure
we accomplish is that people can get

431
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:58,350
involved and follow the
tribe and all of that.

432
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:03,351
But tell me one of the fun stories or one
of the important stories that you guys

433
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:09,150
covered as the tribe that matter to
you, that, that does the stick out.

434
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:10,110
Cause I know they all matter.

435
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,540
Sure. It's, we have a series on
our site called out west. Um,

436
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,180
Tiffany who's the cofounder of the
tribe and the editor and chief. Um,

437
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,150
she's from north Lawndale.
It's okay. West side.

438
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,980
Um,
but you know,

439
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:28,340
everybody talks about the stories of the
south side because there's so many kind

440
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:31,280
of vibrant middle class communities,

441
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,810
but people just leave the west side either
the dialogue completely when it comes

442
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:38,240
to west Chicago.
Um,

443
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,700
and so we wanted to focus on
a series that talks about, um,

444
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,980
Tiffany's routes to the west side and
also the great migration and that journey,

445
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,600
um, to the west side and why, um,

446
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,760
the west side is kind of like
the city's forgotten stepchild.

447
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,440
So we actually journey to
Mississippi together. Uh,

448
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,640
we found out Tiffany and I that our
families are both from Bolivar County.

449
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,360
And so we went there to kind
of discover the past. And, um,

450
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,330
it's a very fascinating story.

451
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:15,331
If you look at this series about us as
young people discovering who we are by

452
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:20,080
rechecks true, retracing the, the
roots of our grandmothers. So,

453
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,320
so you use a lot of things
more than just text.

454
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,010
You use videos and you
create documentaries.

455
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,440
Well, absolutely. So my background
is that I'm a filmmaker.

456
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,660
And so while Tiffany is your
more traditional journalists,
I'm coming in like,

457
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:38,060
no,
we're not doing this the regular news way.

458
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,100
I don't care about the 24 hour news
cycle and what's trending on Twitter.

459
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,990
Let's do more long form stories that
going to matter later on. You know,

460
00:30:47,991 --> 00:30:52,650
so I use my documentary film
background to tell, um, um,

461
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,660
like to make,

462
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:58,661
to create documentary series
the multimedia stories
because I'm in this day and

463
00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:01,300
age,
not everyone's going to read the text,

464
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:02,930
but you need something
that's going to go on.

465
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:07,610
Social media grabbed their attention.
So we like to use audio, video,

466
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,950
all different types of
mediums to tell stories.

467
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,100
Wow.
Okay.

468
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Well I think we've covered everything
that we wanted to talk about today and we

469
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:22,090
can open it up to questions
if anybody has any.

470
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,610
As I sit here and listen
to you guys both present,

471
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,670
I'm feel with goosebumps in terms of the
power of both of your platforms to tell

472
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:33,330
new stories for our African
American experience.

473
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:36,290
So I want to thank you guys
for this presentation and
just really appreciate it.

474
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:37,700
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

475
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,420
How sponsors responded to your site.

476
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,670
I'm actually very well,
we, I sell the tribe.

477
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,950
I keep it real with people.
When I'm selling the tribe.

478
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,690
Nobody's going to tell stories about black
Chicago like weekend until they start

479
00:31:57,691 --> 00:32:00,300
hiring black people.
So that hasn't happened.

480
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,590
So we're going to be your best voice
for telling stories about black people.

481
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:05,641
Yeah.

482
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:09,660
So they really come to us because they
want to reach our audience like you want

483
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:13,920
to get, um, I mean black millennials
are coming into like buying power.

484
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:16,650
Everybody's interested in that.
So yeah,

485
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,660
people are really approach
us along those lines.

486
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:23,990
How can we best support you,
both of you and your organizations?

487
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,073
You go first.

488
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,980
Money.
Money is always an answer.

489
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,870
I wish there was another answer I can
give you. Um, but we had the creativity,

490
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,640
we have the,
the education.

491
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:41,641
We have a conglomerate of creatives who
are ready and can't get hired at legacy

492
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:47,120
papers. So yeah, if we have money we can,

493
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,450
we can tell more stories and that
is the best way to help us out.

494
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,140
If we can talk afterwards
if you're interested.

495
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,560
Oh my gosh, I love her. Because I,

496
00:32:56,561 --> 00:33:00,050
I want to say Ditto to that,
but,

497
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,630
um, gosh, I just love these young
people because that's it. I, I would've,

498
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,550
I think my generation would have
said the exact same thing and,

499
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:09,860
and so many more words.

500
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:14,210
I would have stretched that out to
about seven or eight sentences. But, um,

501
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,290
you know, with my formal education
and all that. But I think that's,

502
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,600
that's what we're going to be
reaching out for that as well.

503
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,930
Hi, thanks so much for being here. Um,

504
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,160
what kind of conversations are happening
with teachers and with like the CPS

505
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:30,980
system to kind of help,
um,

506
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,020
with these gaps in the narrative that
you're talking about because it's

507
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:36,150
obviously such a crucial piece of this.

508
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,031
Well,

509
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:40,720
I appreciate you asking that because
both of my parents were teachers and I,

510
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:44,170
so I, I know way more about
teaching than football.

511
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:49,171
But one of the things that we're doing
at the obsidian is we are going to be

512
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,480
creating educational content as well.

513
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,590
But the interesting thing about education
right now is it has gotten very narrow,

514
00:33:56,591 --> 00:34:00,830
right? But people are teaching
to a very standardized, uh,

515
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,440
systems. And, and it,

516
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:07,650
it doesn't leave a lot of room
for extra curricular that way,

517
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:11,830
but the charter school system is
coming up and, and, and even they,

518
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,200
I've already been talking to them.
It's, it's just a very narrow space.

519
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:21,130
But we're working with
virtual reality and,

520
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:25,180
and some of all these other things so
that when that relaxes a little bit

521
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:28,660
because I'm excited that
that places like Google and,

522
00:34:28,661 --> 00:34:33,661
and these big tech firms are moving
away from these traditional narrow

523
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:38,230
requirements and that's allowing
for a lot more creativity.

524
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:42,700
We feel like with these platforms we can
get the knowledge and information out

525
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,080
even if it doesn't come through
organized curriculum systems.

526
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,950
So we're just going to keep creating
and then you young people just keep

527
00:34:50,951 --> 00:34:51,521
inventing.

528
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:56,521
Just when I figured out this tool
now everything is on the virtual.

529
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,920
So we're going to get it there and then
we'll get the information out there.

530
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:02,650
Cause you guys are taking in information
so many different ways. Yeah.

531
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,860
Let me add onto that because I love
talking to teachers about education.

532
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:12,190
I think we need to totally reframe
the way that we teach about history.

533
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,510
Um,
and I always tell this story.

534
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:19,511
I remember being in about seventh or
eighth grade and my social studies teacher

535
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:23,960
wrote on the board and huge
letters manifest destiny.

536
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:29,020
And we're literally talking about the u
s going through and stealing everybody's

537
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:31,430
land and just massacring people.

538
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:34,970
And we'd call that section
in history manifest destiny.

539
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,100
So I need for teachers
to start teaching from

540
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,960
the point of view of the oppressed.

541
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,640
And if the title of the texts in
history sounds like a comic book,

542
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,800
then it's probably wrong.

543
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,450
And we need to like reassess
what we're teaching our kids.

544
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,680
I, uh, first of all, I want to
say that, um, from my perspective,

545
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:05,450
you nailed it on football.
What's the problem? What I see,

546
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,340
right? Um, but curiously, exactly.
Um, uh, model any Hendrick,

547
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:14,360
I'm both a columnist for the sun times
and president of the National Association

548
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,790
of black journalists. And I
just want to say that, you know,

549
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:21,791
I'm more of a comment than a small
question and that is that I'm blown away.

550
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:26,480
I'm blown away. Um, you know, I've,
I've heard about your project, I've,

551
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:29,960
I've read bits and pieces,
but today,

552
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:31,730
just sitting there in the,

553
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,550
in the few minutes that you
went over some of the photos,

554
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,890
you told me stories I didn't even
know. And, and you know, and,

555
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:42,950
and yeah, I think I know everything,
you know, but, but I'm saying, you know,

556
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:47,120
as black journalists and as veterans,
we think we pretty much know the history,

557
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,010
but there were pieces that history you
told me, just little small photos. Um,

558
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,990
the one about the guy who,
Fred, is it Fred? Oh my God,

559
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,980
I've never heard of him. I was like,
oh my, I made a note, go look him up.

560
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,780
And you know,

561
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,880
son turn those archives
over to shorefront legacy.

562
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:07,220
His grandson is still
lives in Evanston and that,

563
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:13,220
that's amazing. And then, um, just to say,
you know, Morgan, of course, Hey Morgan,

564
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,990
I am so, so proud of Morgan and,
and she and Tiffany and her team,

565
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,640
um, you know, they just started their
stars, their Navj stars here in Chicago.

566
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,500
Um, the one thing I wanted to ask you
is, so as I sat here listening to it,

567
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:30,110
I was struck by how do I,
I mean,

568
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,950
besides telling the story
of the obsidian collective,

569
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,770
how do we share those photos?
I mean,

570
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,150
in terms of when you think about
copyright and like if, if the Sun Times,

571
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:44,870
if I wanted to do a story on
with the gallery of these photos,

572
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,260
how were they being allowed?

573
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,190
I'm glad you asked that too.
So we, we've got lawyers

574
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,180
and uh, and and so I've learned a
lot about copyright law but the,

575
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:58,920
a big part of the obsidian
collection platform,

576
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:03,310
we're building a very expensive
website. Uh, yeah. Uh,

577
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,690
is that is going to be a quick access to
licensing and permissions so that it's

578
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:15,201
going to rival kind of the other stock
photo images out there as well as a

579
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:18,180
platform for viewing and
pleasure and enjoyment.

580
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,480
But there will be quick access and that
is a revenue share model so that the

581
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,970
owners retain ownership
and then can monetize.

582
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,971
What it does is it allows revenue to
go into these small archive groups that

583
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,200
need those dollars.

584
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:39,410
And then it makes it a available
for you to tell the stories because,

585
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,680
uh,
the Schaumburg Library,

586
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,980
which gathered all of
the Harlem Information,

587
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:48,430
the reason Harlem is written
more about then Bronzeville was,

588
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,000
is because you had access
to the information.

589
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:55,420
The Schaumburg is actually gathered up
all the images and then you could go in

590
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:57,570
there and licensing and tell
all these stories. Right.

591
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:02,400
That hasn't been nearly as
easy. And Bronzeville, I,

592
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,210
uh, I do the licensing and permissions
for the Chicago defender right now and we,

593
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,400
we've negotiated with
movies, documentaries,
books, but it's very manual.

594
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,190
It's voluntary and it is not the,
uh,

595
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,150
it is not scalable. So
we're, we're making that, uh,

596
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,050
as a revenue stream for black legacy
newspapers that own their archives,

597
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:29,260
the photographers and the
archive groups. Okay, good.

598
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,340
Hi. Thank you ladies so much
for your information. Um,

599
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,060
it's going to be
beneficial to all. So, um,

600
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,180
my comment slash question is in the
form of money since you mentioned that.

601
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:43,870
And so my question is,

602
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:49,110
have either of you thought about any type
of fundraising efforts in order to not

603
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,630
only get your information out there,

604
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:55,590
but then also collect funds
at the same time? All right.

605
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:59,700
The tribe is actually celebrating
our second anniversary right now,

606
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:04,590
so we'll be having a huge
fundraiser on April 12th so yeah,

607
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:09,360
you'll be getting all of that information
and we don't have a fundraiser

608
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:11,970
scheduled, but we will.
It's, it's going to be as,

609
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,220
as new collections join the obsidian.
Our hope is to,

610
00:40:17,221 --> 00:40:20,350
as we welcomed them to have a
fundraiser to celebrate because the,

611
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:25,440
the digitization takes time,
treasure, money, all of those things.

612
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:30,220
So we'll that, that's our strategy. Thank
you. I was going to ask you, you know, we,

613
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,180
you're here in Chicago,
so the Chicago defenders available,

614
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,840
but what about the other black newspapers
across the country? How urgent,

615
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:37,360
what's stat?

616
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,310
And can you give us an example of what
it's like going into the bowels of

617
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:45,300
whatever defined this material
and is some of it destroyed?

618
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:50,280
Is it salvageable at the other newspapers
saying Lincoln, Pennsylvania, or, uh,

619
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,390
you know, Amsterdam News in New
York? Yeah. So it's, it's, that's a,

620
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:57,450
that's a phenomenal question. When,
when we started with the defender,

621
00:40:57,451 --> 00:41:01,320
the first thing I did was start talking
to other black legacy papers just to

622
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:04,310
kind of see where they were so we
can mirror what they were doing and,

623
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,550
and nobody was doing it. As,
you know, as journalism, uh,

624
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,140
institutions have shrunk.

625
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:14,280
The first thing you kind of put on the
side is the archive and you maintain the

626
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:16,350
journalism. So, um,

627
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,650
and then when things are so
different people have them,

628
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:20,910
different people feel they own them.

629
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:25,710
So we've got the lawyer's sorting all
of that out. But we've got a lot of,

630
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,740
we've got like eight legacy newspapers
in the queue that want to join the

631
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:34,280
Obsidian,
but most is local.

632
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,940
So in terms of rolling the
man and getting them digitize,

633
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:42,941
those are very specific to
the local community aspects.

634
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:48,851
And we're looking at partnering with
local Hbcu to partner with their library

635
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:52,370
science departments and get some of that
Labor go in and get this whole thing

636
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,710
kind of this big obsidian circle,

637
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:57,440
which is the logo of sitting in circle.

638
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,360
I can add on to that little
sure. Archiving. Um, again,

639
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:05,870
we do see the tribe, um, as a future, um,

640
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:10,871
source for these types of
materials because so many
newspapers and publications

641
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:16,571
have laid off photographers and people
who take videos and things like that and,

642
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,660
and a lot of millennials and youth,
we get our news from our phones. Um,

643
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,540
and from really kind of like
tabloid sites on, on Instagram and,

644
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:27,231
and Twitter,

645
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:31,880
like the shade room and things like that
where there's not real news and it's

646
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,920
people just aggregating materials.

647
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:38,921
So it's very important for us to be very
persistent and going out and taking new

648
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,460
images and capturing a
what Chicago is today.

649
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,860
That's one thing I love about you
guys is you're not just aggregating

650
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,290
entertainment and, and just actually make
a point, not, we don't aggregate at all.

651
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:57,590
Like we'd all go and say, oh,
this is trending right now.

652
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:01,250
We're going to just like copy and paste
with this peep with these people said,

653
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:04,220
because our whole thing is
since we have a small staff,

654
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:06,770
it's like if this story
is already being told,

655
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,100
there's no reason for us to like
tell it to. Yeah, yeah. You know,

656
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,150
we need to go in and tell the
stories that are not being told.

657
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:20,080
That's a great point with this big
black history month and I think it's

658
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:24,130
important, like you said, you need to
tell the stories that are not being towed.

659
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:24,850
Uh,

660
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:29,850
my name is crystal Allison and I tell
people I'm first generation great

661
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:34,960
migration to Chicago by way
of Arkansas and Tennessee.

662
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,390
And in that process I've been,

663
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,800
Angela and I have known each other
since high school and we've talked a lot

664
00:43:41,801 --> 00:43:42,680
about amazing,

665
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:49,270
we talked a great deal about this and
I shared and I think that what is,

666
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,730
you know,
what she's doing is phenomenal.

667
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,750
And I just learned about the tribe today.
Angela Mia,

668
00:43:55,790 --> 00:44:00,070
miss mentioned it and none of some
of our other conversations. But, uh,

669
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,850
when the movie the Butler came out and
I was at the advanced screening and it

670
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:07,850
was done by, um, what's his name? Um,

671
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:12,520
Lee Daniels. So talking about it because
they didn't know about that story.

672
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,760
So I was there for the Q and a, et cetera.
And I said, wait a minute, wait a minute,

673
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:18,460
wait a minute.
The black man that was in the White House,

674
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:23,020
he was the highest level executive
in the White House at that time,

675
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,650
who happened to be one
of my relatives effort,

676
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,790
Frederick Morrow.
He Ha I knew the Eisenhower.

677
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:36,950
He was the first African American to
have the highest level position in the

678
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,410
White House when Obama ran for
president then a talked about it,

679
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:45,270
he here in there and buy Ebay because
I like to look stuff up as well.

680
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,710
I realized that he had written a book and
it was entitled Black Men in the White

681
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:54,710
House and he chronicled a lot of the
things that were going on in a lot of the

682
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:58,790
involvement that he had.
So as I spoke to the Daniel's,

683
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,290
I was gonna like and telling that story.

684
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:06,291
You also need to tell this story too
because he was a republican and he was a

685
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:08,214
lawyer.

686
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,900
And in addition his sister also
made some major inroads as well.

687
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:15,830
But it was kind of like I'm
learning like I didn't notice,

688
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,810
you know as well as I'm learning a
lot of other things. I didn't know.

689
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:21,000
One of my great uncles
was a Tuskegee airman.

690
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,280
He is going to be 99 years old this year.

691
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,220
So I think that what you
guys are doing on both sides,

692
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:30,210
on the millennials side and on this side,
that there are stories to be told.

693
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:34,050
There are photographs that are out
there that are in people's personal

694
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,520
collections. And so I'm not
sure if I missed part of it,

695
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:43,521
but what are you doing to get personal
collections included in your archives as

696
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:46,970
well?
Well or,

697
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:52,030
or how do you communicating that
this exists so that people who,

698
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:56,640
you know, cause some people
where as you're leaving us,
you know, the photographs,

699
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:57,780
you know,
like being buried,

700
00:45:57,781 --> 00:46:02,781
thrown away or kind of locked in
somebodies a photo book and not being told

701
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:04,854
about,

702
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:09,590
well one of the things, uh, that uh,

703
00:46:09,591 --> 00:46:14,120
personal archive collection actually kind
of falls under the category for us as,

704
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,150
as a small community archives.

705
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:21,151
So when the obsidian first
joined Google Arts and culture,

706
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,680
we put out a press release and we got a
ton of pickup because everybody was just

707
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:29,920
so excited about that.
And uh,

708
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:35,020
one of the phone calls I got was a woman
who had inherited her dad's collection

709
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:40,961
of 300,000 photos that
included 1960s Motown,

710
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,040
which is gold and 1960 Chicago,

711
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,480
which was awesome too.

712
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,930
And so many times people inherit these
wonderful collections of black legacy,

713
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,250
but they definitely want to retain
ownership. And most people think, well,

714
00:46:58,251 --> 00:47:01,130
I've got to stand up a museum.
I've got to create my own foundation.

715
00:47:01,131 --> 00:47:05,230
I've got to replicate this entire
thing and what we're offering.

716
00:47:05,231 --> 00:47:09,170
And instead is a platform
for some of that.

717
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:11,840
But at the same time we're going to be,
uh,

718
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:17,020
having workshops and symposiums on how
to properly store and keep your own

719
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:21,380
archives and also what's valuable,
what's,

720
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,380
what's valuable to the world
and what's valuable to you,

721
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:28,880
which may be two different things, you
know, um, what, what happens when people,

722
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,330
things with, uh, a collection,

723
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:34,510
what happens when people leave
him with a museum or a university?

724
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:39,430
So we're going to do a lot of education
around protecting black history as well.

725
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:43,370
So our goal isn't to build
another blacksmiths, Sony.

726
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:46,090
And even though that place is amazing,
we're going to be doing,

727
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,450
we're focusing more on digital outreach,

728
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:52,180
even though we will have a location.

729
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,180
I mean, I think that there is, you know,

730
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,670
there's another museum that's
in the process of being built.

731
00:47:57,671 --> 00:48:01,750
I forget where it's going to
be about that. Well, there's
always, I mean, we're not,

732
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:04,480
we're not, right. So there's all watering
that space, right? Exactly. Yeah.

733
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:08,700
So there's always room for I think,
four additional stuff because justice,

734
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,390
that museum has a lot of wonderful
stuff in there. As I was told,

735
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,090
they couldn't get everything
in there. So there's, you know,

736
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,310
again, more stories that are
out there to be told as well.

737
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:26,140
So it's good to see that they're both
platforms or forums here to provide that

738
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:31,030
as a mechanism for learning more because
I think it is important that we're

739
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:34,660
taught who we are and, uh,
learn more about ourselves.

740
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:35,683
Thank you.

741
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,960
Thank y'all very much. Okay. Come in.
And I wanted to ask you guys like,

742
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,590
I do y'all really inspire me here today.

743
00:48:42,591 --> 00:48:46,940
Like listen to this a lot and it was
really interesting. I'm wondering, um,

744
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,090
it's fine. Are Ever gonna be part of
that? Like, you know, like, cause this, I,

745
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:57,110
you know, I'm 50, so I'm like
in between, uh, you know,

746
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,120
the millennial or whatever,
but I have seen,

747
00:48:59,121 --> 00:49:03,340
I have my first piece in the museum when
I was 10, so I've seen fine arts. Yeah.

748
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,940
Like what about like Richard Hunt and
Kerry James Marshall and all those people.

749
00:49:07,941 --> 00:49:10,400
Like they did some really cool,
interesting shit back in the day

750
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,560
on the tribe. We recognize that, um,

751
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:18,700
news isn't the only way to capture our
story. So we have a section on the site.

752
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:19,780
If you go to the top,

753
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:24,580
there's a tab that says the works and
it's just a space for creative works of

754
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:29,620
many different mediums from like
short films to photography are.

755
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,670
Um, so yeah, so we opened that up
for people to submit that type,

756
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,570
that type of material to,
yes.

757
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,670
Okay. Ben, let's get to know.
I'll check you guys out.

758
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:37,461
Yeah.
And,

759
00:49:37,461 --> 00:49:42,050
and so we haven't been able to get into
the fine art space yet because that's a

760
00:49:42,051 --> 00:49:45,330
different set of legal questions.
And,

761
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:50,490
and so right now we've got images and
who owns the image but put projecting

762
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:53,450
artists and something we've gotten to yet.
Yeah.

763
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:56,210
It was some really
beautiful things out there.

764
00:49:56,211 --> 00:49:59,170
I agree with you on all over
Chicago old stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

765
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,560
I thank you a Morgan and Angela.

766
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:03,450
One more round.
