1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,343
Great.

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,300
This conversation is going to look like
a conversation about public speaking

3
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:15,860
because it's,

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,870
it's pretty formalized and that I'm
standing up here at the front of the room

5
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:22,740
and you are sitting in audience mode,
but this is a really,

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,770
this is really about the image that you
project and that can be one on one or

7
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:32,430
around the conference room table or
standing up to give a presentation.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,840
But this is about inspiring
confidence in your abilities.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,110
There are some people just in the
way that they carry themselves.

10
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:42,960
You immediately have faith
that they can get the job done,

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,520
whatever the job might be.
And some people do it with a big bold,

12
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:52,521
dynamic personality and some people
do it with a very calm down to earth

13
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:57,060
demeanor, but whatever the
style, you just believe in them.

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,040
The fallacy is that those
kinds of positive assessments
that we make about other

15
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,620
people,
that they're all very subjective.

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,880
They're based on nuance store
or indefinable criteria.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,320
And I've spent the last 20 years of my
life researching how human beings assess

18
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:16,800
other human beings. And the bottom
line is that there are ground rules,

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,660
there are metrics,

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,490
certain behaviors lead to very
predictable assessments on the part of the

21
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:24,324
listener.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,480
So if you can better understand what
behaviors lead to what assessments,

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,650
you can just be more in charge of the
image that's coming across on the other

24
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:35,484
side.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,230
Are you aware that certain facial
expressions are hardwired into us?

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,600
Not all facial expressions, but certain
core facial expressions like fear, joy,

27
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,760
anger,
grief,

28
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,850
and it's why we can read
facial expressions across
cultures or why babies can

29
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,860
read facial expressions
at a very early age. Well,

30
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:58,860
the same thing is true for
your body language signals.

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,440
A significant portion of
your body language signals
are what we call universal,

32
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,380
how human beings assess
other human beings.

33
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,210
And so I'll give you an example of one,
keeping your head level.

34
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,930
So literally being levelheaded is a
show of confidence across the globe.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,970
Wherever you go.
Now,

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,130
whether you should show confidence is a
value system and sometimes that changes

37
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:27,060
from culture to culture.

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,800
Sometimes in some cultures
being deferential is a far
better way to do business.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,130
But being levelheaded as a show
of confidence wherever you go.

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,740
If I raise my chin just a bit,

41
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,570
this is a very high status position to
be in and if I continue to speak to you

42
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,460
with my Chin just a little bit high,

43
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,710
you are very likely to find me a
little condescending, little arrogant.

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,320
Can you see that?
If I lower my chin just a bit,

45
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:55,950
this is a very low status position to
be in and if I continue to speak to you

46
00:02:55,951 --> 00:03:00,280
with my Chin Low, you're very likely to
find me a little shy or differential.

47
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,370
And especially if I tilt my
head now whether or not I
personally am aware of the

48
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,470
position of my chin,

49
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,250
because I could be oblivious to what's
happening up here is still having an

50
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,850
impact on your side and even on your side,

51
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:20,470
you're not consciously aware of what
behavior is sending the message because it

52
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,760
just happens so fast in there.

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,410
So if I had started today with my chin
up like this and said, hello everybody,

54
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,050
I'm very excited to have this
opportunity to talk with you.

55
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,660
You would all begin to make an assessment
of me really quickly and in your exact

56
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:39,640
adjective would be up to
you, but you would all be
leaning in the same direction.

57
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:43,390
But it is doubtful that any of you would
have identified that it was my chin

58
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:48,040
that was bothering you.
I mean you wouldn't leave
afterwards and say, you know,

59
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,040
Kira was okay but her chin,

60
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,110
it was so high you just be stuck
with your assessment of me.

61
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,060
So that's why it's my job as the speaker
to be very aware of the signals that

62
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:04,630
I'm sending out I because they're having
an impact whether I am aware of them or

63
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:05,464
not.

64
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,830
And have you heard studies about how
long it takes for someone to come up with

65
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:13,480
an assessment of you under
30 seconds seconds? Right.

66
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:14,680
So seconds.

67
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,900
I recently read the research
from Millenium Body and
she was highlighted in the

68
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,120
book blink by Malcolm Gladwell,

69
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,710
but she is the researcher who
coined the term thin slicing,

70
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,090
which is our ability to see a pattern and
just a very thin slice of information.

71
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,430
When one of her research projects,

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,940
she showed people videotapes
of individual strangers.

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,440
She hadn't them assign adjectives that
they would use to describe the person on

74
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:48,610
the screen. And at first she showed
the video tapes for two minutes,

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,900
but then she just cut back and cut it
back and she got down to two seconds and

76
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,290
she found that the adjectives people
would use to describe the stranger on the

77
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:04,291
screen were the same whether they had
the opportunity to see the video tape for

78
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:08,190
two minutes or for two seconds.
Now,

79
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,850
that's pretty amazing actually. It's
amazing on two levels. First of all,

80
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:14,560
it's amazing that it happens so quickly,

81
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,130
but more importantly for
today's conversation,

82
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,040
it's amazing that there's
general agreement.

83
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,070
When we watch a video tape of a stranger,

84
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,170
we will all use about the same
adjectives to describe that person.

85
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,490
So if that is true,
they have got to be ground rules.

86
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,880
And so that's really what the
credibility code is all about.

87
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,600
What are the ground rules?
What are these behaviors?

88
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,700
How much impact did they have?
How much control do you have over them?

89
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,790
Now I had the pleasure to have worked
with Google over the last few years.

90
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,590
So I know a good deal about your,

91
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,800
your culture and in a
workshop early on in the,

92
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,230
one of the things that comes up is a
conversation about authenticity because

93
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:07,370
there's a high value here on being
authentic. And I want to acknowledge that.

94
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,910
And first of unsupported, I want you
to know, I believe that you are first,

95
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,190
you're going to be at your
best if your first yourself.

96
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,090
And that is really great if you have
some strong speaking skills on your side.

97
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,340
So I want you to think about the
ground rules that I'm about to lay out,

98
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,890
like the rules of punctuation or grammar.
As a writer,

99
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:32,570
we don't feel inauthentic in our writing
because we're following the rules of

100
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:37,120
punctuation and grammar. And you
wouldn't say as a writer, well of, well,

101
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,170
we're all following the exact same rules.

102
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:43,230
How will my unique voice
come through so well?

103
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,280
The truth is if you aren't following
the rules of punctuation or grammar,

104
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,980
people aren't like to pay
likely to pay attention to you.

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,780
And there are some really talented
people who can break the rules.

106
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,420
So that's acknowledged that too.
And it just makes them more interesting.

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,790
I give you permission to
break the rules to too,

108
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,170
but break the rule because you know
the power of it and you choose to do it

109
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:07,690
differently as opposed to just being
oblivious to how that behavior might might

110
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,950
come across.
All right.

111
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:14,930
I broke the conversation up into three
sections. First, what I call the basics.

112
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,220
And these are those behaviors that
you need to do just to get those,

113
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,490
those basic level adjectives where
someone might describe you as comfortable,

114
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,320
competent, capable, credible. Uh,

115
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,920
of course you want that as your baseline.

116
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,270
And then we'll talk about those things
you shouldn't do. I call those derailers.

117
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,930
So those behaviors that are
almost always invisible to us,

118
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,950
we don't know that they're going on,
but they nonetheless undercut our image.

119
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,490
And then I'll talk about the perfect
balance between being authoritative on the

120
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:53,780
one side to being
approachable on the other.

121
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,920
And the best communicators of all
know how to do both at the same time.

122
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,980
And just to give you a quick preview,

123
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,610
I will show you what it's like to lean
too heavily in one direction or the other.

124
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,680
If you're using a lot of authoritative
behaviors and I just kicked into a few

125
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:14,600
more of them right now, you're very likely
to come across as capable, competent,

126
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,530
and expert. But if you rely
too heavily on these behaviors,

127
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,970
you could also come across
as unreceptive or inflexible,

128
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,810
which isn't going to help you create a
relationship with the person on the other

129
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:29,060
side.
On the other end of the spectrum,

130
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,290
if you're using a lot of approachable
behaviors and I just kicked into a few

131
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:37,280
more of those right now, well you're very
likely to come across as interactive,

132
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,470
personable,
maybe even dynamic,

133
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,290
but if you rely too
heavily on these behaviors,

134
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,350
you could also come across
as a lightweight nice,

135
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:49,700
but in consequential.

136
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,600
So you need to have a balance between
both sides and if you personally know that

137
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,920
you need to bolster one end
of the spectrum or the other,

138
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,300
I will give very specific behaviors
that tend to send those messages.

139
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,880
Okay.
Going back up to the top.

140
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,570
The very first thing someone notices
about you as the visual picture.

141
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:13,410
So your body language has a big impact
on your appearance of credibility and

142
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,244
confidence.

143
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,930
The three pillars that hold up
your appearance of leadership,

144
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,790
presence of credibility,

145
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,600
of personal presence are strong posture,

146
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,230
strong voice,
strong eye contact.

147
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,460
If you're doing those three things, you
are going to look good. Strong posture,

148
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,190
strong voice,
and strong eye contact.

149
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,610
Now most people have heard some
version of this advice before. It's,

150
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,050
it's not like it's brand
new concept out there,

151
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:52,010
but most people severely underestimate
just how important those behaviors are.

152
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,170
So let me be explicit.

153
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,010
Strong posture means that
if you're standing up,

154
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:03,180
your weight is balanced equally over
both feet and whether you're seated or

155
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:03,661
standing,

156
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:08,661
your spine and your shoulders form
a t like a like a metal t bar.

157
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,900
And this area right here is rock solid,

158
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:15,330
has literal core strength.

159
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,050
So notice how if I allow myself to have
just a little more wishy washiness in my

160
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,170
spine,
I lose a lot of my executive presence.

161
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,230
So you have literal core
strength through here.

162
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,260
Then your head and your
shoulders move independently.

163
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,660
So your head moves like
a camera on a tripod,

164
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,590
which means I can look over here and I
can look over here and I can look over

165
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:36,810
here.
What's not happening is this,

166
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,050
again I'm back to wishy washy or
being a little kid in trouble. Oh,

167
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,510
think about how eagles and
owls survey their surroundings.

168
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,880
We call them regal and wise.
And then one word,

169
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,010
your nose has to point directly
toward the person you're speaking to.

170
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,220
So if I'm looking at you,
my nose points directly toward you.

171
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,310
And if I look at you,
my nose points directly toward you.

172
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,660
Notice what happens in my eyes. Move a
little more independently of my nose.

173
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,810
I'm very likely to look uncomfortable,

174
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,560
but I could also look sneaky or
mischievous or judgmental or skeptical.

175
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,420
Have you heard the phrase looking out
the corner of your eye at someone?

176
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,250
What does that mean?
Reticent Questioning.

177
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,120
So if you want to come
across as straight forward,

178
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,620
you have to literally be straight on
with the person you are speaking to.

179
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,060
There's a concept in communication
that is called marked and unmarked

180
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:45,384
communication.

181
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,070
And ultimately what we're trying to do
with our body language signals is unmark

182
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,920
the communication so that the
power of our words take precedent.

183
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,000
Sometimes we're sending some accidental
signal that sends a mixed message.

184
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,940
And so let me give you an
example of how this played out.

185
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:04,450
Recently I was working
with a group of teenagers,

186
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:08,530
actually a group of young mothers
in a job placement program.

187
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,870
And one of the young women said to me,

188
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,160
parents and teachers say that I show
attitude and I don't get what they mean by

189
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:20,800
that because I really don't
feel like I show attitude.

190
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,440
But she said it to me like this.

191
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,060
Okay.

192
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,300
Parents and teachers say that I
show attitude and I don't get,

193
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,550
you need to straighten that out. So if I
look at you this way, this is unmarked,

194
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:36,100
straightforward communication.
Me just talking to you.

195
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,100
And as soon as I start
to move my Chin around

196
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,080
in Mark's the communication. So if
you want to unmark the communication,

197
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,260
so people will really
hear what you have to say.

198
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,560
You need to be literally
straight on direct. So,

199
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,650
so here's the takeaway in
this particular section.

200
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,500
If you want someone to describe you as
having a strong spine and a level head,

201
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,460
you need to literally have a
strong spine and a level head.

202
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,290
And if you want someone to describe
you as straightforward and direct,

203
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,270
you have to literally be
straightforward and direct.

204
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,900
It is pretty amazing how the language
we use is a literal translation of the

205
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:23,240
attribute we are describing.

206
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,890
So standing with your weight balanced
over both feet, how might you describe me?

207
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,730
Grounded, balanced on
solid footing, upright,

208
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,460
strong spine from backbone, levelheaded,
head square on my shoulders,

209
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:39,350
standing on my own, two
feet, not easily pushed over.

210
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,220
There are so many positive metaphors here.
Fully evolved.

211
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,470
So you want to make sure,

212
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,490
oh and let's take some negative metaphors
being a slouch or shifty or unbalanced

213
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,170
or crooked.

214
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,160
So you want to physically embody the
metaphors you want people to use when

215
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,110
describing you.
All right.

216
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:06,380
Now if you just learned in
this conversation that you
should stand stock still,

217
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,530
well that would be a problem
too because part of leadership,

218
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:14,210
presence of looking perfectly
comfortable is fluidity.

219
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,850
Owning the space around you.

220
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,380
So your core provides the solidity.

221
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,630
And your hands and your facial gestures
provide the fluidity, the interactivity

222
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,330
hand gestures are or they're
hardwired into all of us.

223
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:37,331
There are a form of communication that's
that's deeper and older than verbal

224
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:41,420
communication. Then I'm even blind
people gesture when they speak.

225
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,510
It's not something we learn visually.
It's hardwired,

226
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,890
but what is most interesting about hand
gestures is that they are an unconscious

227
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,580
process, which means when you
are not thinking about it,

228
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,470
your hands are very much engaged in the
conversation and as soon as you become

229
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:04,430
self conscious, as soon as you
begin to think about the hands,

230
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,910
you have no idea what to do.

231
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,840
These bandages at the ends of your
arms and that that when that happens,

232
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:19,091
we tend to go into some sort of lockdown
mode or I call it unmasking masked mode

233
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:26,110
and it it's that apparent
self consciousness that
gives away the fact that you

234
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,530
are intimidated or
nervous by the situation.

235
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,180
When we are perfectly comfortable,
our hands talk when we talk,

236
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,280
if you want to exhibit executive presence,
personal presence,

237
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,890
the second year mouth begins moving.

238
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,780
Your body language has to talk to because
what intimidation looks like is your

239
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:52,040
mouth is moving, but no other body
language signal is online yet.

240
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,550
You don't have to learn
how to hand gesture.

241
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,120
You just your hundreds upon hundreds
of times throughout the day.

242
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:00,530
It's not a skill you need to learn.

243
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,640
What you need to learn is not to mask.
Not Too.
