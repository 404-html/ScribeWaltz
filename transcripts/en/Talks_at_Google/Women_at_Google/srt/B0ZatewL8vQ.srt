1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,970
Uh, so thank you guys for joining
us. For our first Google talks,

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,440
a Ad in the Birmingham
office. Uh, I want to, um,

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,230
I have the great pleasure today
to introduce Bridget Russo,

4
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:14,960
the Cmo of Shinola before I do,

5
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:19,000
for those of you who don't
have a deep background, uh, uh,

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,500
on the company itself, I wanted
to give you a little bit, um,

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,130
it was conceived in 2011.
So when we think about our own brand,

8
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:27,550
Shinola is only about five years old.
Um,

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,970
it is the maker of modern handcraft
watches, bicycles, leather goods,

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,790
journals,
and pet accessories,

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,020
of which it sounds like they're
expanding into even more products.

12
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:42,050
So we'll hear from Bridget about that.
Um, they're really focused on, and again,

13
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:44,570
you think about those of you who
work in the automotive industry,

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,340
some of the importance of
handcrafting leather. Um,

15
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,710
some of the more upscaled ways
that we try and convey a, um,

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,840
important elements of our
auto manufacturers background.

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,590
A lot of that is in the messages
that Shinola brings into the market.

18
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:05,300
So really interesting there.
Um, as far as their locations,

19
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,900
uh, those you'd be probably know they're
headquartered here in Detroit, um,

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,390
in the college for
creative studies building,

21
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:16,070
which was a former re
automotive, uh, research lab. Um,

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,140
and then since the company's founding,
uh,

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,120
they have I think about seven stores
now that they've opened up. Um,

24
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,730
as Bridget herself.
A little bit of background on Bridget,

25
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:29,030
her background started in PR,
which is coming in handy.

26
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,790
Obviously as a CMO you have
to deal with a lot of things,

27
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,540
particularly in social media nowadays.
Um, with her background in PR,

28
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,070
she started on the agency side,

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,120
very familiar to some of you and then
moved over onto the client side working,

30
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,920
um, with diesel and the fashion
industry. Uh, from there she moved in,

31
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:50,830
um, started to work with Eden,
which is a company that, um,

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,890
final started with his wife to support,
um,

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,690
some of the team to drive
industry in a, in Africa. Um,

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,060
and that moved her into her
own consultancy, which is
a lot of our Googlers do,

35
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,130
uh,
is to start their own businesses.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,050
And from there it led her to Shinola
and two from New York to Detroit.

37
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,450
And so with that, um, we welcome
her and want to hear her story and,

38
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,940
and learn about a bit more about Shinola.
So with that, I'll fucking bridge it.

39
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,310
[inaudible]

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,353
um,

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,730
well thank you for taking the time out
of your day to hear the Shinola story.

42
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,080
Um, can you, can everybody hear me
okay? Yeah, that's okay. Yeah. Cool. Um,

43
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:37,440
so I'm going to take you through quickly
since we do have the fireside chat and

44
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:40,590
I don't do want to give you guys the
opportunity to ask questions afterwards.

45
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,540
So I'll kind of whizzed
through this a little bit,

46
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,910
give you a little background as to why
we started the company and what's up next

47
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:50,250
in terms of new categories.
Um,

48
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,570
so we started with building a watch
factory in Detroit back in 2011.

49
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:58,130
People thought our founder Tom
Card service was crazy. Uh,

50
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,790
why not accept that manufacturing
has gone from this country?

51
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,220
Why not let the rest and weeds
finish what they started?

52
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,090
Why not just embrace the
era of disposability and
why didn't we buy a warmer

53
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:11,020
coat before we moved to,
there were three Detroit winters.

54
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,960
We've asked ourselves these questions
and work not to find our answers,

55
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,690
but to build it. So really, you know,

56
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:21,691
from the beginning the intention was
always to not only be in a city where

57
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:25,260
manufacturing was in its in
its history and its lifeblood,

58
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,660
but also to be in a city where we could
have a positive impact on the community

59
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,700
in our case,
and creating jobs.

60
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,140
Um,
here's a little video.

61
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,840
So this is

62
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,420
where it all began.

63
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,120
Yeah, the question isn't why you
build a watch factory in Detroit.

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,040
It's why you built one anywhere else.

65
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,350
This is the city that made this
country with its steel, with its skill,

66
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,180
with a slight reestablish some trays that
hadn't been seen in this country in a

67
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:55,330
generation or more.
It's a tall order to return to full,

68
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,670
but it's what hundreds
of Shinola employees work
towards every day here in Troy

69
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,730
where we believe in the beauty of
industry, the glory of manufacturer.

70
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,370
I know where American is mate.

71
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,530
So it started with watches.
Uh,

72
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,710
we launched our first product in 2013.
Uh,

73
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,040
the factory opened in 2012, which is
when I started with the company, uh,

74
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,630
alongside watches. We also had
bicycles, leather goods, journals.

75
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,560
Um, but really our messaging from the
beginning was watches built in Detroit,

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,540
um, of quality. And so we started,
there are first watch was the run.

77
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,130
Well,
um,

78
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,530
if you guys were around at that time
paying attention to some of the marketing.

79
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,740
Um, we had launched the Runwell watch
before we actually had product and market.

80
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:48,510
So that was March, 2013. Um,

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,030
the previous year we had a brand website
up where we were speaking directly to

82
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,910
the consumer through social,
primarily at the time,

83
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,620
Twitter and Facebook and really telling
people about our story directly,

84
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:03,400
not going through the trades and
sort of the normal, uh, you know,

85
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:07,060
where you would launch a brand showing
product before it was finished sewing

86
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:08,230
swatches of leather,

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,710
talking about our relationship with the
college for creative studies where we're

88
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:15,550
based, uh, to the degree that some
people were confused as to what we were,

89
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,820
you know, they would be like, are you a
watch company? Are you a bike company?

90
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,470
Are you a school?
Um,

91
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,310
but that really helped lead us
to the launch of the Runwell.

92
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,960
Fast forward to march of 2013,
um,

93
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:32,980
we had about 10,000 people on our email
list at that point and about the same

94
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:37,720
number of followers on Facebook and
Twitter. And we launched the watch.

95
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,010
We hadn't actually made the watch yet.
$550 price point.

96
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:45,160
We had 2,500 units by
the end of that week.

97
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:50,080
So eight days we sold out of the
watch. Um, which was pretty incredible.

98
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:53,740
We really didn't know in the beginning
there was some thought that Shinola would

99
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:57,410
actually be more of a company to
make watches for other brands.

100
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,920
But then when we saw the strength of
the run well and the Shinola brand,

101
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,600
we decided to go full force.
Subsequently, we've launched these other,

102
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,690
what we call platforms and
most recently the Canfield,

103
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:12,110
which is a refined Runwell bicycles.

104
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,080
So bicycles going back to the 80s,

105
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:20,060
really that production went off shore.
The U s primarily, um, you know,

106
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:22,060
the, one of the biggest
names, Schwinn, uh,

107
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,720
you might know the brand still out there,

108
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,580
but it's not owned by the family anymore.

109
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:29,210
They were one of the last to move
their manufacturing overseas.

110
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:32,060
So they lost the right,
it was sold the rights to their name,

111
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,010
but they did hold on to one piece of
their business called Waterford precision

112
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,980
cycles.
So they were making custom bicycles,

113
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,700
$10,000 and up that people
would wait months for.

114
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,010
So we met sky Yeager.

115
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,610
How we approach all of our categories
is really finding leaders within that

116
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:53,930
category. So in the case of
bikes that was sky, um, sky said,

117
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,760
I know the guy we need to go to.

118
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,030
Richard Schwinn up there in the corner
is a great grandson of the man who

119
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:02,330
started a Schwinn bicycles.
And we approached them and said,

120
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:05,420
what would it take for you to make
bicycles for Shinola? And we said,

121
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:08,780
we'll probably make about a thousand a
year and is I need to hire more people.

122
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,370
So we're like, great, right in line with
our, with our messaging. So, you know,

123
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:17,750
some people ask, well, why are the
bikes so pricey? Runwell is $3,000.

124
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,300
The Bixby that you see,
there's $2,000,

125
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,340
and it's because of the quality and the
craftsmanship that goes into it. Um,

126
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,750
so we make the frame and
fork with Waterford, uh, and
then we assemble the bikes.

127
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:34,700
As you see there in our Detroit
store paper, we work with,

128
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,013
um,

129
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,560
a bindery in Ann Arbor or
close to Ann Arbor, um,

130
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,900
called, um, Malloy brothers, sorry,
brain fart there for a minute.

131
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,370
Um, and again, we really saw the
market. So with all of our categories,

132
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:54,371
we really look at them in two ways as
brand builders or as volume drivers.

133
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
So bicycles,
leather and soon to be audio,

134
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:02,630
which I'll tell you about in a little
bit. Um, are really the volume drivers.

135
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,840
And then things like the journals,
bicycles,

136
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,650
pet accessories are the brand builders.
They're equally as important,

137
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:13,960
but it really helps us not only kind of,
um,

138
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,470
continue to provide products that are
relevant to the lifestyle of our consumer,

139
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,310
but also to add a point of
difference in the marketplace.

140
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,040
So if you go into a Neiman's or
Nordstrom in the watch department,

141
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,070
you might see a Shinola bike hanging.
Um,

142
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,210
we actually made all of the buyers of
the big department stores come to Detroit

143
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,520
before they wanted to buy the line.
Um,

144
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:39,440
so that definitely was helpful in
helping them show the full breadth of the

145
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:42,710
brand in their stores.
Leather,

146
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,940
we recently signed on a few years
ago now, uh, John and Richard,

147
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,060
they had a brand called Lambertson
and true x that we did very well. Um,

148
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,420
they're highly regarded
in the fashion industry.

149
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,600
Then they moved on to Tiffany's where
they built their leather business to a $50

150
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,433
million business.

151
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,790
And we're kind of in semi retirement when
we approached them to run our leather

152
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:07,230
business. So we started with small leather
goods and have expanded now into bags,

153
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,140
wallets, belts, um, come this fall.

154
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:14,520
We're really have a full
representation for women. Um, so again,

155
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,670
looking at leaders
within the categories to,

156
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,710
to lead the design and production

157
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,650
and then pet accessories. So these are
these fun categories, just as much work.

158
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,060
Um, but ones that really help create the
buzz around the brand because it's not

159
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:35,620
every day that you launch a new watch
or a new bicycle or a new range of

160
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,540
journals, but this is an opportunity
to get that PR earned media value

161
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,220
and then the marketing.
So it all started,

162
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:48,810
this was the ad that we ran
going back March, 2013. Um,

163
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,810
we at first we weren't going
to advertise. We were like, no,

164
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:54,570
we're not that kind of brand.
We're not going to do it. Um,

165
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,390
right about when I came on board,

166
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:00,330
we hired an agency called partners
and spade based out of New York.

167
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,890
They really helped us, um, design
the next version of the site,

168
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:09,360
which is pretty much what you see today
and really put a stake in the ground

169
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,580
around Detroit.

170
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Built watches a quality.
And we,

171
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,770
we decided to take this ad out and we
ran it in the New York Times, USA Today,

172
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:22,670
Detroit free press in the
Wall Street Journal, um,

173
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,740
sort of mid week in the
process of selling the watch.

174
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,760
And by the time the New York Times
Sunday Times style ran on Sunday,

175
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:30,840
they were sold out already.

176
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,393
Hm.

177
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,190
Um, you might remember this when Detroit
announced bankruptcy a few days later,

178
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:41,390
we ran this in the New York Times to
those who have written off Detroit.

179
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,320
We give you the Birdie.

180
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,250
Birdie happened to be a watch that
we were releasing at that same time.

181
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,750
And again, the P PR value
on this was amazing. Um,

182
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,720
and again, you know, for me, uh, if
you guys are familiar with PR newswire,

183
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,670
that's where you would
put your press releases.

184
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,340
I really saw the New York
Times as our PR newswire.

185
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,200
I found that when you had something
relevant that was had culturally relevant

186
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,440
impact,
um,

187
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,540
the New York Times was a great vehicle
when it came to mother's Day and father's

188
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,270
Day. And we were just announcing
the run well on a different color.

189
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,380
That was probably not the best ROI to
run a full page ad in the New York Times.

190
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,493
Yeah.

191
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,850
And then the second year we worked
with Bruce Weber. So Bruce Weber,

192
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:26,750
you guys might know a famous
fashion photographer. Um,

193
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,680
I like to say the first year we showed
people what was behind our doors,

194
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,460
highlighting the people that work in the
factory and establishing ourselves as a

195
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:39,020
leader within the industry. And then
the next year with our work with Bruce,

196
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:39,854
we really,

197
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,310
it was a love letter to
Detroit celebrating the people
outside of our doors and

198
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,230
why we came to Detroit in the first place.

199
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,603
Yeah.

200
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:52,100
Um, last year you might remember the
launch in April of the Apple Watch,

201
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,800
uh, call the agency, I think
a week before and said, hey,

202
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:59,830
can you guys come up with something
that would kind of just, you know,

203
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,250
get us in the conversation
of this major launch.

204
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,770
And so they came up with this a watch,

205
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:08,890
so smart that it can tell you the
time just by looking at it run well,

206
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:13,540
just smart enough. Um, so we
ran these ads again, you know,

207
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,280
sprinkle here and there.
Wall Street Journal,

208
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:18,130
New York Times ran some digital
around it too. And again,

209
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,140
the buzz that we created off of it was
really tremendous. Um, in a time when,

210
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,900
and we, we all know how much
apple spends on advertising.

211
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:30,010
So at a few friends that work there,
and I got a text from one saying cheeky,

212
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,230
which it was. And then this year, um,

213
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,830
in an election year, we knew jobs
was going to be a hot topic. Um,

214
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,090
and we really wanted to celebrate the
fact that we created over 500 jobs since

215
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:45,850
we launched.
And so we came out with this campaign.

216
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:48,610
There's a funny thing that happens when
you build factories in this country.

217
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,660
It's called jobs. And again,
really highlighting the
people behind the products.

218
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,100
We are a true manufacturing company
built not by the things we make,

219
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,710
but by the people who make them.
Um,

220
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,830
this year in the past we were,
um,

221
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,750
primarily our media plan was primarily
print and we started to see some

222
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:10,900
diminishing returns,
I would say mid last year.

223
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,040
So we really did a shift towards digital
this year working with premium partners

224
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:19,790
like Vanity Fair, l Harper's
bizarre vice to create content. Um,

225
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,660
so some of that you guys might have seen,
um,

226
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,080
we'll continue with that for a second
half of the year around big product

227
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:29,620
launches. So continuing to talk
about our leather, our watches,

228
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:34,060
and expand our reach outside
of our immediate consumers.

229
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,140
Uh, our big push for second half of
the year we'll be around women's.

230
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,980
The challenge that we do have is
that talking about jobs is great,

231
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,730
but when you're trying to sell a hobo bag,
talking about jobs,

232
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,880
it doesn't really help. It
doesn't mean that, you know,

233
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:50,620
women don't care about creating jobs,

234
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,920
but when you're trying to sell
someone this great leather bag,

235
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,560
that messaging doesn't
always link up together.

236
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,080
So that's something that we're
working through now to understand.

237
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,310
Probably around September
around the debates,

238
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,320
the jobs messaging will come up again,

239
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:08,680
but then we'll make a shift towards
really focusing on celebrating our women's

240
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,340
product and, and showing people
that we're serious about our,

241
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,090
our women's products
retail.

242
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:20,380
So our retail environments are really,
in my view, part of our marketing.

243
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,670
Um, we look at them as living,
breathing things there.

244
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:27,610
They're not museums for products,
but really community spaces.

245
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,380
So we activate our stores quite
frequently, two to three times a month.

246
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Um, we not only throw our own events,
but we opened them up to the community.

247
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:41,881
So the local Pr Association might hold
their annual meeting in the morning.

248
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,990
Uh, we, we work with creative mornings
to hold talks in our stores. Uh,

249
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,980
we're currently working with a local
barber shop in Detroit called Social Club

250
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,371
too.

251
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:57,371
They do a series called shoptalk where
they actually cut people's hair while

252
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,460
they're participating in a talk.
It sounds weird, but it works.

253
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:05,540
If anybody has attended there,
they're pretty interesting.
So we're doing that, uh,

254
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,830
not only in Detroit and Ann Arbor,
but across cities, DC, New York, La,

255
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,450
um, and each door is really
unique. Taking on the personality,

256
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:17,150
not only of the building that we're in,
but also the city that we're in.

257
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,680
And there's a few. We're
now at 15, 16 stores.

258
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,300
By the end of this year we'll have 20
and aim to open eight to 10 every year.

259
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,790
What's next? The fun part. Audio.

260
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,440
So come October, November,
we'll start with turntables.

261
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,470
Working with this gentlemen,
gentlemen here. Alex Rawson,

262
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:44,380
who again is a leader within the category.

263
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,540
He started a headphone brand that he's
got on right? They're called Odyssey.

264
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,470
It looks like he has waffles on his ears,

265
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,240
but a highly regarded within the
audio file community. So again,

266
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:58,750
we saw an opportunity, if you
look at what beats did, um,

267
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,740
beats charges a lot of money for a
product that doesn't really warrant that

268
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:03,341
price point.

269
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:06,730
And everyone you walk around and you see
I'm sure by people in the office might

270
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:08,440
have a beats headphones,

271
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:13,060
but our audio file friends tell us
that it is not of the quality that that

272
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:14,290
should be for the price point we,

273
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:19,291
so we saw an opportunity to bring value
into the category with good design and

274
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:24,890
audio file quality and then jewelry. So a,

275
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:28,700
some of you may recognize Pamela Love.
Uh, she's a designer out of New York.

276
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:33,210
We're partnering with her to launch
jewelry come mid October. Uh,

277
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,050
this will be part of a larger
Shinola women's launch.

278
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:40,490
So not only jewelry but expanding our
watch offering a and a new collection

279
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:43,790
called Gomelsky. We do have a
style right now called Gomelsky,

280
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,590
but this is sort of an offshoot of that.

281
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,000
And this is one of my favorite
films that we did with Bruce Weber.

282
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,420
You know what? Um, I think that
when it comes to to Detroit,

283
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,420
I view it just how I view love.

284
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:04,110
Like I feel like in everything
you have like a soulmate, right?

285
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,640
If I had to just give like one
line about the city of Detroit,

286
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:11,510
I would most definitely say
that. Uh, I belong here.

287
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,140
Native is definitely a soul mate of mine.

288
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,070
I was working on his poem a few days ago.
It's about the city of Detroit,

289
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,210
but it's how it breeds like
great, great guest, grandkids,

290
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,150
great boys, great girls. How we
grow up to be great men and women.

291
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,160
I don't want it to read it
to you. Okay, that's fine.

292
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,060
Somewhere in the projects there's a kid
working on a project to project to the

293
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:38,790
world. He lives in a city that grows
boys and girls into lions and tigers.

294
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,870
The city, it takes the fire in
the ashes, bills, rebuilds, turns,

295
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:45,510
abandoned houses,
empty fields and to things.

296
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:49,920
We're looking at a place that never
looks back the center stage of a nation,

297
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:54,090
the heartbeat, the patients, the music,
the Motown, the midtown and downtown.

298
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:58,500
The always come back around and we
fight for reputation, walk, ride bikes.

299
00:17:58,501 --> 00:17:59,880
Our destination practice.

300
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:04,560
Patient knows they can't forget about
this [inaudible] the city that continues

301
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,270
to call the world's bluff somewhere.

302
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,570
There's a kid working on a project to
project from a city that's rebuilding,

303
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,570
that we built in from the ashes together.

304
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,810
So the everywhere there can be Detroit

305
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,520
gamblers,
they

306
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,130
[inaudible].

307
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,870
Yeah, that was really powerful.
You can see why you like it now.

308
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:46,130
Two years old. And I think still totally
relevant. Yeah. So you mentioned,

309
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:48,560
I've heard you say in
some of your discussions,

310
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:53,561
this idea of conscious consumerism and
how a brand is basically responsible for

311
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,980
being a really good brand. And so
when you look at some of this, um,

312
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:05,110
and you can see how you're investing in
having the best people build the brands

313
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:08,810
that you want, the product you want to
present. Can you talk a little bit about,

314
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,360
yeah,
so it's,

315
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,650
it's a concept that I was first
introduced to when working for [inaudible]

316
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,090
Urbano anally back in 2004 when
we launched the brand Eden.

317
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:22,980
And they were really pioneers in the
space, especially in fashion. The idea of,

318
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,360
you know, conscious fashion people
didn't understand, you know,

319
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:28,950
the green movement was happening.

320
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:32,220
There was some organic brands out
there and none of them were all that

321
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,920
fashionable.
Um,

322
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,830
so this idea that you could
have quality product out there,

323
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,190
but by the nature of
your business practices,

324
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,580
your production practices who were also
helping to build communities and have a

325
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:46,230
positive impact,
um,

326
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,810
coming from the fashion industry where
you never talked about your production in

327
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,030
part because you didn't want to let
your competitors know where you were

328
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:56,280
manufacturing. But also, you know,

329
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,160
now we know so many things
have happened since then.

330
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,780
You guys probably weren't even born yet.
Kathy Lee, Gifford, Nike and every step,

331
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:08,220
everything subsequently that happened
from there. It wasn't pretty, you know,

332
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:10,150
the fashion industry,
um,

333
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,970
can be a pretty ugly industry or has
been in the past. Not intentionally.

334
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:19,290
I think as things went offshore that
control and understanding how things were

335
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,420
being manufactured in other places,

336
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,280
they weren't up to the same standards
as the US. Um, so, you know,

337
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:30,210
a lot of people early on got burned.
I don't think Nike set out intentionally,

338
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:32,550
you know,
to have children making their clothes.

339
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:36,450
But unfortunately it's hard to have
that control when you're doing things

340
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:39,090
overseas. A lot has changed. Um,

341
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,120
but this idea of buying products and
supporting products that have a positive

342
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:47,530
impact, whether that's on the environment,
whether that's on the community.

343
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,040
I think now for millennials
and anyone that's under 30,

344
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,660
I think that's a big part of that
purchase decision. Um, you know,

345
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,750
certainly is for me,
I'm not under 30,

346
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,500
but you know,
it,

347
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,870
I think if all other things are equal,

348
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:07,550
I'm willing to pay a little bit more to
know that this product is having some

349
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:10,910
sort of positive impact.
At the end of the day,

350
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:14,120
it still has to be strong product and
we'll learn that Eden the hard way,

351
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,481
you know,

352
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:19,070
we really put the mission in front of the
brand and butter product second and at

353
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:22,010
Shinola, what I really loved
when I met them, I was like, wow,

354
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:25,400
this product is amazing.
The fact that, you know,

355
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,800
we were creating jobs to
me was the cherry on top,

356
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:29,510
but that product needs
to stand on its own.

357
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,640
Yeah. Do you see that as being, uh,

358
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,830
increasingly challenging as the demand
for the product increases and the scale

359
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:40,740
and the volume that you need to
fulfill that demand increases?

360
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:45,120
As we think of other brands
who have, maybe you mentioned
even Nike in this case.

361
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:48,230
Do you see that as a
challenge for Shinola? No.

362
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,180
As you,
as you grow,

363
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,200
and we really look at
everything we do from, you know,

364
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:57,020
in the beginning we looked at where to
source her shopping bags and we said,

365
00:21:57,021 --> 00:22:00,440
well, we can source them in the
states but we and spend $12 on them.

366
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,910
Or we could take the savings of sourcing
that the bag overseas and put it

367
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:08,510
towards r and d to doing what we're doing
in Detroit and helping to grow that.

368
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,320
And since then we started with the
watch factory. I didn't mention,

369
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:16,230
but we opened a leather
factory two years ago, um,

370
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,370
where we're producing the majority of
our Leather Watch straps and some of our

371
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,060
small leather goods. So again,
continuing to add to that capacity.

372
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,120
The reality is we're in a global economy.

373
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,270
So every single component
is not made under one roof.

374
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,350
That hasn't existed for a
very long time. Um, you know,

375
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:37,610
we felt very strongly what we were doing.
We were doing more than assembly.

376
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,380
And so we use the word build.

377
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,010
You guys probably read that's got us
into a little hot water of recent,

378
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,190
but I think it's an opportunity,
um,

379
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,220
for us to work with the FTC on
clarifying for the consumer and makers of

380
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:55,250
products to say,
this isn't clear.

381
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,220
It's not clear for the consumer
and it's not clear, um,

382
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,290
for anyone who's trying to do business
and do the right thing in the u s um,

383
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,510
you know,
I can tell you from experience,

384
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,690
there's stuff out there that says
made in Italy, are made in France,

385
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:10,430
that is definitely not made there.

386
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,940
They might add a zipper at
the end or a small stitch. Um,

387
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,700
and their country allows them to say that
to preserve, you know, their industry,

388
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,740
what's left of it. So this is happening
across the board. Um, you know,

389
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,380
the one thing I can say, you know,
to anyone, please, we do do tours.

390
00:23:30,381 --> 00:23:33,790
You're welcome to sign
yourself up for one. Um,

391
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,830
you walk through that factory and you
see the people that are most of them.

392
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:37,664
Detroiters,

393
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,510
it's hard to say that we're not having
a positive social impact. And I,

394
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,870
the most thing you know
about it is when you say,

395
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,010
try and suggest to these people that what
they're doing is an important or what

396
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:56,100
they're doing. I heard some comments
as people do on social media. Oh,

397
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,660
a monkey can do it. It's like putting
together Ikea furniture. First of all,

398
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,030
I'm challenged putting together,

399
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,790
I challenged putting anything,

400
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,180
but it is hard. Yeah. You know,

401
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:13,181
a watch is made up of these tiny little
parts and to suggest that assembly is

402
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:16,070
not as complicated or you know,

403
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,550
not an important job that takes
some level of skill. You know,

404
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,190
that's why we felt very
strongly around the word build.

405
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,770
Now we have to qualify that to,

406
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,180
to make sure it's clear that it's a
combination of us and imported parts.

407
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,930
Something that we were always transparent
about. When you look into her FII cues.

408
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,690
In fact, there was a question
is this American made?

409
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,300
And we answered that and have
done from the very beginning. Um,

410
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,410
but I think that as a brand and also
the FTC need to take this opportunity to

411
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,210
educate the consumer. Maybe there's
a, like with food, you know,

412
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,600
if you guys remember with food,

413
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:55,310
it was sort of the wild west and people
natural and organic and what did it all

414
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:58,820
mean? Well, now there are systems
in place and labeling in place.

415
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,270
Maybe we need to do the same thing
with consumer goods. Yeah. Well it's,

416
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,640
it's clear that you have made
an impact in Detroit, um,

417
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,640
beyond today's news over the
FTC. So, you know, how do you,

418
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,930
how does that,

419
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,950
it sounds like you've been trying to do
that regardless of what retail store you,

420
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,550
what location you open a retail
store, um, how does that,

421
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,090
how do you guys factor that in to where
you do open them up and how do you look

422
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:25,490
to embed yourself in the community?
Like I know Ethan,

423
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:29,360
the Saturday you have a local band
playing at the store in Detroit.

424
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,750
So tell us a little bit about
how you've continued to look at,

425
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,120
where are you open stores
and how important the you've,
you've made an impact.

426
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:41,660
You're trying to make an
impact in the local market.
I think for us, um, you know,

427
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:43,530
it's always a balance. Yeah. Um,

428
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,470
we recently got some investments so
we have a board of directors and so,

429
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:48,830
you know,

430
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,450
there's a responsibility we have now
to a group of people versus one person.

431
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,710
Um, but you were just actually
having this conversation today.

432
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:59,200
We're still a baby brands,

433
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:02,660
so there has to be that balance of brand
building and making sure that we're

434
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:07,661
still unique and special for people and
high touch and also getting the Roi and

435
00:26:10,131 --> 00:26:15,131
getting us to profitability to make sure
that we're being responsible and also

436
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:19,970
growing a sustainable brand. Um, as far
as the community aspect is concerned,

437
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,350
we'll continue to look at our
manufacturing, not just in Detroit.

438
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:26,960
We're actually looking at
Chicago potentially for eyewear.

439
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,180
So parts of, of the, the manufacturing
that we can do in the states,

440
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,014
we will,

441
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,380
whether that's through our own facilities
or partnering with facilities that are

442
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:38,810
out there, um, you know, we're,

443
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,710
one of our leather partners potentially
could close because their rents going up

444
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:44,610
and they can't afford it.

445
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,020
So it's looking at that and saying
maybe we can put them together with,

446
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:54,360
um, manufacturers that we know
in Florida to combine efforts.

447
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:57,150
One is strong in high end handbags,

448
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:01,050
the other one has great process and back
of house, you know, how do you bring,

449
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:05,910
there's so much time and effort that
we put into these things to continue to

450
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:09,980
stand behind our goal, which
is to create American jobs. Um,

451
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,070
you know,

452
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,070
on a local level we go into markets
and really either it's working with an

453
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:20,880
agency or just going in on our own and
making those relationships with the local

454
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:24,100
community. So the local makers, uh,

455
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,350
different organizations that
are working on job creation, um,

456
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,940
and really embedding ourselves. In some
cases it might be as simple as, you know,

457
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,770
hosting an event for them in our store
or a fundraiser or donating a watch for

458
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,200
uh, an option. Um, but again,

459
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,420
making those relationships on a local
level as well. Yeah. And hopefully I'm,

460
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,420
you know,
as we start to grow and,

461
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,220
and really start to push
through tent pole initiatives,

462
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:57,570
I think the idea of workforce development
is something that we can be thought

463
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:59,970
leaders in.
So we're talking now on how do we,

464
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,840
whether it's partnering with Job Corps,
which was started in DC but has

465
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,400
local chapters across the US and really
help playing an active role in this

466
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:13,460
workforce development.
Because the reality is, uh,

467
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,380
and I was just starting to
educate myself on it. There's,

468
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,660
I think it's something like 2 million,

469
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,510
what they call middle
skill jobs out there. Uh,

470
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:26,511
so primarily trade manufacturing jobs
that there are no longer that generation

471
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,763
with that skillset.

472
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,090
So it's like a dying breed of artisans
and two things need to happen. One,

473
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,460
then there needs to be
infrastructure for the training,

474
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,660
but also a PR campaign to encourage
people to take these jobs.

475
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,250
Because it's a better job than
working at Mcdonald's or, um,

476
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,590
you know,
any of the big box stores.

477
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,540
And it's an opportunity to learn a
craft and work your way up. You know,

478
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,400
I, I, my mother owned a factory,

479
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:57,270
she started working in a factory in New
York and it put food on our table and

480
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,690
put me through school and
through college. So, um,

481
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,890
it is a career opportunity and we need
to kind of change the face of what these

482
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:06,760
jobs are. They're not dirty jobs. Yeah.

483
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,810
They're actually career paths
for every one is not, you know,

484
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,770
some people will go on and start their
own tech business or some people may

485
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:16,180
decide they want to be designers, but, um,

486
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,740
there's a lot of these jobs out there
and not the skilled labor force to take

487
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:23,190
them. And then we have the
unemployment rate. So, you know,

488
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,080
these things can be mutually beneficial.

489
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,500
So do you see that, was that a
premise at the start, do you think?

490
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:32,610
For the company I'm at the heart of,
it was job creation.

491
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,690
Um, or did it start as um, you
know, really, really strong, um,

492
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,290
wellmade products and then
the job creation thing,

493
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:42,910
cause it is a really interesting component
you mentioned you didn't actually

494
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:46,990
mention I think I wear is one of the
next areas that you're going to go into.

495
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:51,991
So you think about eyewear and how you
would now repeat this whole process of

496
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:57,040
finding the right partners and, and go
about selling it. So curious about it.

497
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,840
The job creation was always part of
the conversation alongside and making

498
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:05,400
quality products that were well
designed. And then we'll classic, um,

499
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,390
you know, from a business opportunity
standpoint, watches for instance,

500
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:13,110
so you have watches at the, you
know, the big old fashion watches.

501
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:18,111
So Michael Kors and brands such
as that at the three $5,500 range.

502
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:22,490
And then you have the high end luxury
watches, tag horror and the like.

503
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,180
And no one was really at our
price point offering the quality,

504
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,900
um, with the great brand
story behind it. Um,

505
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:35,130
so we saw a business opportunity as well.
Um, where we, Parker is a good example.

506
00:30:35,131 --> 00:30:39,000
They saw a business opportunity and
they also have the social impact part of

507
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:42,470
their business, which if you notice
it's not front and center, um,

508
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,090
it's sort of behind the
scenes even more so now than,

509
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,800
than ever before when they first launched.

510
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:49,670
So I think ultimately it has to
start with good product. Yeah.

511
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,200
It has to be somewhat of a differentiator
in the marketplace and there has to be

512
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,510
a positive impact in some way,
shape or form,

513
00:30:57,511 --> 00:31:01,620
whether it's double bottom line or triple
bottom line, which is hard to achieve.

514
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,610
But,
you know,

515
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:07,500
I think it's important now and in the
longterm it's just good business. Yeah.

516
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,300
So always back to that conscious
consumerism type thing.

517
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,830
So you weren't here at Google and data
is part of our world. We love data.

518
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,250
And so some of the, uh, the
marketing get samples, uh,

519
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,430
as the Cmo you've talked about,
um, uh, traditionally based, um,

520
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,320
and then a lot of the experiential things
you talked about in your retail stores,

521
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,880
very experientially based.

522
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:32,420
So can you talk to this group who
really looks at a lot of data, um,

523
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,840
and the campaigns and things that they do,

524
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:38,980
how you think about marketing and how you,

525
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,980
what kind of data you look at based on
the things that are important to you and

526
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:46,100
trying to reach these consumers. In the
beginning we didn't have data to look. We,

527
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,530
we had nothing to benchmark mark

528
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,790
it against. Now, you know,
going into our fourth year,

529
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,820
we do have that data and we are diving
into that data and actually working with

530
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:01,430
you guys as well as a group out of DC
called resonate to really hone in on,

531
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,543
okay,

532
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,310
we have this fan base here of
Shinola advocates and super fans.

533
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,240
We know there are like people out
there who don't even know we exist yet.

534
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:17,241
So how do we develop those personas and
then we're off first time ever believe

535
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,630
it or not doing programmatic.
Um,

536
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,640
so really looking at like individuals
out there and using a lot of digital to,

537
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,790
to reach them. Um, really
cutting back on print.

538
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,590
I'm a still a big fan on experiential.
I think at the end it's about the mix.

539
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,880
It's not like, oh, all digital is the
way to go, or all print is the way to go.

540
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,600
It's the mix because that's
how people live their lives.

541
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,100
That's how they're consuming media and
information. So it can't be all one way.

542
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,900
I think part of the success
early on is that, and again,

543
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:53,870
this is somewhat anecdotal, but
if people would tell me, Oh,

544
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,850
you guys are everywhere.
Well we weren't,

545
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,950
I had no way had a
budget to be everywhere,

546
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:02,270
but we were everywhere where they
were in the right moment. So you know,

547
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,740
and there was a lot of, you know, great
PR value there. So they saw the PR,

548
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:09,950
then they'd go online and you know,
see the social activity.

549
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:11,900
Then they'd go outside
and see the out of home.

550
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:17,150
It's how that mix all works together.
And then you have to be careful,

551
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,670
you know,
the data,

552
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,700
depending on how you look at it can drive
you in a direction that may not be the

553
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:27,890
right direction.
This is somewhat of a weird example,

554
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:32,550
but I'll give it to you anyway. So,
um, when I was working for Urbano,

555
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,550
he often told this story. Um,
there's an NGO that went into,

556
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,390
um,

557
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:43,390
a village in Kenya and the women were
walking like five miles to clean water

558
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,830
every day.
Uh,

559
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,890
and so they came in and they built a
well in the village and the women kept

560
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:55,520
walking the five miles. Well, no
one stopped to ask them, you know,

561
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:58,790
we're going to build a well, where
would you like us to put it? So finally,

562
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,830
after the fact, because they
were so puzzled, they asked,

563
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,320
why are you still walking five
miles? And they said, well said,

564
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,250
get away from the men.

565
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,460
That's our time together. No one
asked the question. So they were like,

566
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,630
what if we did it half way? And I'm like,
perfect. And that was a moment when too.

567
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:15,730
So we can't forget that

568
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,890
this data is great, but we're
all human beings, right?

569
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,390
And there's aspects to our behavior
that can't be put on a spreadsheet.

570
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,130
So the emotion and that
the high touch of a brand,

571
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:32,450
if you can maintain that some
in some way, shape or form. Um,

572
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,060
you know,
especially when you have limited dollars,

573
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,540
there has to be that element
of just human nature.

574
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,220
And then I don't know the answer for every
brand of what that is. And you know, I,

575
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,380
I still watch that video and think, well,
maybe we should run that in theaters,

576
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:48,710
you know, just because you don't even
know what the hell we're selling.

577
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:52,340
But I'm intrigued. I want to know more
about that brand after seeing that video.

578
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,620
Yeah.
So it is about the balance.

579
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:58,640
It's about the mix and
don't be so dictated by the
data that you lose the fact

580
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:02,250
that you are all human beings
and consumers as well. And that,

581
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:06,590
that gut feeling of, you know, what is
right and taking some calculated risks.

582
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,813
Yeah.

583
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,270
Uh,

584
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,520
I want to open it up for any questions
that you all might have that you'd like

585
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:11,860
to ask

586
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,610
Bridget. Go ahead. All right.
Thanks for coming. Good. First off,

587
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,560
I did not know anything
about the association with
the Schmidt family tied to

588
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:22,800
your bicycles,
but that seems to be a model in your

589
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,040
personality or an expert in
the field kind of help that.

590
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,760
Can you explain like the
process of identifying that
person that represents best

591
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:37,150
the shuttle a brand? Because I would
think it's more art than science. Yes.

592
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,260
To the data of like, is
it a relationship? Is it,

593
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:44,700
how do you identify that person that
represents how you want to launch a brand?

594
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:49,570
Um, we've been very lucky. Our
founder knows a lot of people. Uh,

595
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,410
and so it's a little bit of asking around.

596
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,150
I'm asking you advice from,
you know, friends. Uh,

597
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,510
and then some people would just somehow
cross our paths because, you know,

598
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,840
someone might know what we're up to
and say, I've got the person for you.

599
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:08,440
You need to talk to sky Yeager or
you need to talk to Alex. Rostin.

600
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,280
So it's been pretty organic
from that perspective.

601
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,070
And we've never done big searches.
I mean,

602
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:17,800
even we just named Tom Milan or CEO,

603
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,600
we didn't put the job out
there. We never did. Um,

604
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,890
but we just started to
put our feelers out.

605
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:27,640
Tom was working with us on
some side projects. And again,

606
00:36:27,641 --> 00:36:32,380
it was that gut feeling that our founder
felt like this was the right guy, um,

607
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,840
to help lead the brand.
And so that,

608
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,650
that's kind of at least to date how
decisions are made around people in

609
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:42,580
particular. Um, and it
makes for a really, uh, uh,

610
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:46,330
Tom or founder refers to us
as the bar scene in star wars.

611
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:51,280
Um, and that, you know, we all come from,

612
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,810
from varied backgrounds,
but I think it's helpful in making,

613
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,780
keeping us on our toes and also
seeing different perspectives.

614
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,110
The fact that Tom Comes from,
you know,

615
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,500
the sports arena and coming from that
background I think is an interesting

616
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,300
perspective for,
you know,

617
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:08,270
we don't even like to call ourselves a
fashion brand with zero sells more as a

618
00:37:08,271 --> 00:37:12,770
design brand. So I think having those
outside voices in the outside perspective,

619
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:14,510
because if you're all in a
room with the same, you know,

620
00:37:14,511 --> 00:37:16,370
if we had just had a whole
bunch of fashion people,

621
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:18,800
we'd be doing things very
differently tonight. Yeah.

622
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,170
The questions got ahold
of a skilled trade thing.

623
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,440
I grew up down river written
all the high schools down there.

624
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,910
My parents generation has shop,

625
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,050
they had a actual working auto shop
within a high school and everything.

626
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,810
But then that generation,
it's such a stigma

627
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,600
how you feel,

628
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:43,601
especially with how deeply passionate
people like your sectors upper middle on

629
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,980
came from those families
that have the stigma.

630
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,790
How do you use that and where do
you start to try to remove it?

631
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,060
I mean is it started with
politicians start in the schools?

632
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:56,850
Does it start with the brain out cause
that you have re calibrating their

633
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:01,910
mindset and where to really start to
get rid of that trade school is under

634
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:05,360
achieving and you have to have before
your school because those jobs are kind of

635
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,000
skills do transcendent and Mary Lou.

636
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,410
Yeah, I think definitely education is one
piece. And working at the civil level,

637
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:18,730
just make sure that you have the support
locally in these cities because there

638
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:22,990
are certain cities like Detroit
that are more, um, you know,

639
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,290
sort of better poised to
really drive this, uh,

640
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,640
buffalo's another good city.
Um,

641
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,930
and also working with
partners in the media, um,

642
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:39,880
who have such control now to really shape
people's opinions one way or the other.

643
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,770
Um, to help tell this story. And you know,

644
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,390
especially now with things
like Etsy for instance,

645
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:51,460
I think it's coming back to where people
are interested in learning how to make

646
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:52,450
things on their own,

647
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:56,590
making things and selling them now with
a great platform that you can go direct

648
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:59,770
to consumer. Um, so it's good timing.

649
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,310
And I think now with kids coming
out of college with that degree,

650
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:07,810
that really expensive degree
and no guarantee of a job, zero.

651
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,440
You know,

652
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,330
so people are looking at different
ways of how they can build a career.

653
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,300
And it's not the traditional doctor,
lawyer,

654
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,160
not everyone can be an entrepreneur
and make the next Uber or whatever. So,

655
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,520
um, it is, uh, education
is a big piece of it,

656
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:29,260
but that you need that support
at the civil level too. You know?

657
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,100
Um, oh, what's the word? You know,

658
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:35,920
making sure that there's certain land,
um,

659
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,600
agreements that it's not just about
building luxury condos, right?

660
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:43,860
Cause it's very quick to say
a factory will, you know, uh,

661
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,550
not yield as much from a real estate
perspective than a luxury condo.

662
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:51,930
But you know, that's not going
to help build a community, uh,

663
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,780
and certainly not help build at
diversity within the community.

664
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:00,940
Um, and I'm hoping Detroit
has an opportunity and there's
a lot of people working

665
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:05,440
hard at this to help
build this infrastructure.

666
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,550
Uh, and also if we can make it work
in Detroit, that's a blueprint.

667
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,530
Let's hope to do it in other cities.

668
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:16,030
But I was one of those kids who grew up
in the factory and I said from a very

669
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:20,380
young age, I would never work in the
factory. My brothers on the other hand,

670
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:25,370
did work in the factory, made a
lot more money than I did, um,

671
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,980
got burned when things by the
90s. It was, that was it. Um,

672
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,390
but it's all coming back now.

673
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:35,270
My brother actually held onto his machines
and now he's his knitting businesses,

674
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,320
getting, he's getting the
phone calls that he, you know,

675
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,040
a lot of people sold their
machines. He happen to hold on. Um,

676
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,260
but I think there's a
huge opportunity there,

677
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:47,230
but it's going to be a lot of different
entities working together and there

678
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:51,220
needs to be a huge PR campaign
that the media can help drive, um,

679
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,330
to change the perception.

680
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,250
It's a lot of people in this
room work with cmos every day.

681
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,900
They have to go out and meet and,
and, and provide thoughts, ideas.

682
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,800
I'm sitting there and obviously
you've had a good PR background.

683
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:09,010
It's helped set you up for a lot of
things here, even handling today.

684
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,330
Could you give them advice and, and, well,

685
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,510
how do you think about when
people come in, you, you know,

686
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:18,511
you said you talked to your agency about
the ad that was going to run when the

687
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,120
Apple Watch was being announced.
Can you give us any advice for how you,

688
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,320
you think about it or when someone
comes in to talk with you about ideas or

689
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:28,090
thoughts, how you, how you think of about

690
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,500
things? Um, for me,

691
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:33,190
I'm always impressed when someone
takes the time to research your brand.

692
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,000
All the information's out there now.
Not all of it accurate,

693
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:43,030
but there's a lot of sources out there
where you can really educate yourself

694
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:46,880
about a brand. I mean, even for
people who are, um, interviewing,

695
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,660
I'm often shocked by people who don't
really do their research. And I'm like,

696
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:54,320
why are you here? You know?
Um, so do your research,

697
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:58,880
help them realize that you took a moment
to not only understand their brand,

698
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:02,930
but to understand their business. So,
you know, not only researching Shinola,

699
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:06,410
but looking at where we
sit in Nordstrom and what,

700
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,580
who's our competitive set and looking
at their business leading up to meeting.

701
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:13,080
You don't need to become a watch expert.
Um,

702
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,540
but just gathering that information
and bringing that to a meeting to say,

703
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,010
we looked at your business,

704
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:22,550
we looked at your competitive set and
here's some learnings that we had from an

705
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:26,360
outside perspective because often you
guys might see something that we don't see

706
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:28,580
because we're in the thick of it.
Um,

707
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:33,120
so I think a fresh approach to just the
information that's out there before we

708
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:35,480
even get to the meeting.
Yeah, good question.

709
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,413
Good.

710
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,650
Detroit is for manufacturing,

711
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,990
also famous for creativity. And, um,

712
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:51,270
and I wonder if you could speak a little
bit to Detroit's influence and Shinola

713
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:55,670
designed now and maybe
as you see the future,

714
00:42:55,671 --> 00:43:00,671
especially with some of these world class
leaders in the areas you're going into

715
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:05,450
being a New York based
as you might expect.

716
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:09,740
But how is Detroit for House talent?

717
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,130
For us, we're very, from a product
perspective inspired by the architecture.

718
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,640
Uh,
so definitely the architecture of Detroit.

719
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,110
I would say the spirit and the attitude
of Detroit you see in our marketing and

720
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:29,111
sort of the irreverence of our voice
comes from Detroit and that Detroit versus

721
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:33,920
everybody. Um, sort of sentiment. Um,

722
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:34,911
you know,

723
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:39,911
I do think that in order for Detroit
to really be a player as it was in,

724
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,250
in the global marketplace,
from a creativity innovation standpoint,

725
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,910
it needs to be a place that maintains its,
its talent.

726
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,390
Because often what happens is
the talents here and they leave,

727
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,930
they go to Chicago, they go to New York
because the opportunity isn't here.

728
00:43:56,931 --> 00:44:00,770
So as businesses continue
to grow or move to Detroit,

729
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:06,200
um, I think that's an opportunity
to get back on in the ranks,

730
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,160
if you will,

731
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,780
of being an innovative city of
being a city that drives creative.

732
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,950
Um, it certainly inspires
us every day. Um,

733
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,420
but I think being able to keep the talent
that comes here is something that we

734
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:21,660
need to work on.
Um,

735
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:25,490
I mean the education system as a whole
other thing because if you're a young

736
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:29,570
person or you know, if you're coming
married with kids, I don't have kids,

737
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:33,120
so I live in Detroit. I'm not worried
about the education system personally,

738
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,360
but it's a huge problem because,
you know,

739
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,930
I have colleagues of mine that say
I would love to live in Detroit,

740
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:43,280
but I don't know where to send my kids to
school. So they drive them to, you know,

741
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,360
gross point or whatever after a while.
First of all,

742
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:47,940
not everyone has access
to do that. Yeah. Um,

743
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,670
so those are things that
are really important.

744
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,890
Just basic things or our public school
system really needs a lot of work in

745
00:44:55,891 --> 00:44:58,590
order to make this an attractive
city for creative people,

746
00:44:58,591 --> 00:45:03,240
for business minded people to live in and
build a family and not have to go live

747
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:06,600
in the suburbs because I need to be in
a certain zip code to write for their

748
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:08,610
kids to go to a good school.
Very important.

749
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,530
Any last one last question
from the audience then I'll
close with one. Go ahead.

750
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,970
So this may be a little bit of everywhere,
but I was curious to hear it, uh,

751
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:19,730
when [inaudible] started,

752
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:25,250
to what extent was Detroit factored in
as like the only location or was it like

753
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:26,990
one of several locations
that were considered?

754
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:30,830
I've heard kind of how price point was
factored into choosing to try it as a

755
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:34,070
potential location to kind of headquarters
at all. And then part two of that,

756
00:45:34,071 --> 00:45:37,590
as you expand internationally, what
is the recognition of Detroit, uh,

757
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,920
on the international level
and do you think like,

758
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:42,560
should I know all of that salt is now
going to become a vehicle to help promote

759
00:45:42,561 --> 00:45:46,100
the trait, whereas the tray first
may have promoted Froedtert? Shinola?

760
00:45:46,101 --> 00:45:47,610
It's almost seems like
it's now should I know,

761
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,090
is Turner to promote Detroit
in the international spectrum?

762
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,200
Oh,
we definitely are doing that.

763
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:57,201
I mean this brand part of our DNA and
what we built this brand on is the fact

764
00:45:57,841 --> 00:45:59,940
that we're in Detroit.
The fact that, you know,

765
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:02,910
we have a watch factory and
a leather factory in Detroit,

766
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,180
the intention was always at
this would be a global brand.

767
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,200
We didn't know how the Detroit,
um,

768
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,010
name would resonate certainly
outside of Michigan,

769
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:18,540
but even outside of the u s what
we're finding is people, um,

770
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:23,050
it's resonating because it's that underdog
story. People want Detroit to win.

771
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,010
There's a Detroit everywhere.
I'm

772
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,890
so sorry. Um, it is resonating.

773
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,630
No, I'm joking. No, it's
funny because I think as we,

774
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:43,940
as we travel,

775
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:48,280
many of us travel all over the place
and that we probably all feel that we're

776
00:46:48,281 --> 00:46:50,640
the ones standing up for Detroit.
I know I'm,

777
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,580
whether I'm here or are internationally,
it's,

778
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,880
I get teased a lot. Oh Detroit,
what's happening in Detroit? I'm like,

779
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,140
come on to try it.
It's great.

780
00:46:59,141 --> 00:47:02,080
So I feel like we were off
fill that in a lot of time.

781
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,620
But to answer the price question,
it wasn't really so much prices.

782
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:09,380
We invested a lot of money to build
the factory and do the training,

783
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:11,820
which we continue to do.
Um,

784
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,410
and we did not take the tax
incentives that were offered to us.

785
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,910
Certainly it's cheaper to open a factory
in Detroit than it is in the middle of

786
00:47:19,911 --> 00:47:22,390
Manhattan or la.
Um,

787
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,600
but really the opportunity that we saw,
you know,

788
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:27,600
you had a workforce,

789
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:31,540
a trained and talented workforce
that we're sitting without jobs.

790
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,840
So we thought we could transfer that
skill and to watch making leather making.

791
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,880
Um, so, sure. Is it cheaper to
open a factory in Detroit? Yes.

792
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,290
I mean that's changing now
with real estate booming
the way that it's doing. Um,

793
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,030
but it wasn't necessarily about the price,
it was about the,

794
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,750
the opportunity and the talent base
that exists here in manufacturing.

795
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,630
And so one last question.

796
00:47:56,631 --> 00:48:00,530
You mentioned Shinola
to be a global brand.

797
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,030
It's only about five years old.

798
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:07,010
So what are the global brands that are
iconic brands that might be on the wall

799
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:10,430
or in the thoughts of those
at Shinola to emulate?

800
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,610
You know, we'll even say we poked fun
at them. Apple definitely is up there

801
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,890
and it was all in good
fun. Um, you know, Tesla,

802
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:25,320
Virgin, um, these are all brands
that, you know, we aspire to.

803
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:30,060
I think Tesla would probably be number
one on that list. Yeah. Um, you know,

804
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,190
and it's,

805
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,840
it's been amazing to just be a part of
what's happening in Detroit. We're one of,

806
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:41,040
you guys know how many people that are
working both small and large scale like

807
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:44,160
Dan Gilbert, to really help
bring the city back on its feet.

808
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:49,440
And my hope is that it continues
to be a place of equal opportunity.

809
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,530
That it doesn't just become my,
my lovely New York,

810
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:56,550
but million dollar plus,
you know,

811
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:00,540
condos that most people can't
afford. Uh, cause it really starts,

812
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:04,230
it really hurts a city when it
becomes homogeneous like that.

813
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:08,250
So you have to make sure there's
a balance of opportunity, um,

814
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:10,670
that maintains the diversity.
Um,

815
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,800
that's the one thing that I think New
York lost over the years because now you

816
00:49:16,051 --> 00:49:19,370
turn around everywhere you go.
I mean, bedstuy which, you know,

817
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,960
I remember growing up as a kid in
Brooklyn, you just didn't go there.

818
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:27,230
And now it's like luxury
apartment buildings and
townhouses all over the place.

819
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,490
Yeah. So, and that's going to
keep the creativity here as well.

820
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,070
Well, we want to thank you for your
time. We know how busy you are out.

821
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,460
We have a little gift for you.
And um,

822
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:41,850
thank you for being part of our first
talks at Google in the Birmingham office.

823
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,713
So thank you for

824
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:48,030
[inaudible].
