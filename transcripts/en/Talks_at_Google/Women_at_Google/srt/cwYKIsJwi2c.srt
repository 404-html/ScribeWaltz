1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,153
Okay. Yeah, I know,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,200
uh, the one of many talents who's brought
as many speakers here and is here today

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:08,550
for us,
Sheryl Sandberg

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,780
[inaudible]

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,250
see how we improvise.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,200
So it is a great pleasure of women
at Google to welcome Senator Hillary

7
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:33,440
Clinton's who are stage along
with our CEO, Eric Schmidt,

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,510
[inaudible] [inaudible] senator.

9
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,660
Senator

10
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,660
Clinton was elected at United States
senator in 2000 reelected in 2006 making

11
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:17,810
her the first first lady
to ever hold public office.

12
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,580
She has sponsored and led many bipartisan
efforts on things that are close to

13
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:27,020
our hearts, computerized medical
records, rural broadband,

14
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,790
broadband access for rural communities,
r, and d and nanotechnology.

15
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,660
She's also led really important efforts
for the country on public education,

16
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:40,661
modernizing our school's job creation and
importantly universal health coverage.

17
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,810
January of 2007 so just last year on
January 20th she announced the creation of

18
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:51,680
a presidential exploratory committee
on the Internet. We love that.

19
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,150
I think everyone knows we started the
women at Google series to bring women who

20
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:00,450
have really made a difference
in the world to Google by far.

21
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,330
Senator Clinton has been
our most requested speaker,

22
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,630
so we are thrilled that she is
here with us today. And as always,

23
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,720
we thank Eric for his support of our
program. Thank you all for being here.

24
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,250
[inaudible]

25
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,010
pretty excited about having you here, Mrs.
Clinton. I'm excited about being here.

26
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,280
The people with the hats are new
employees, so don't be disturbed.

27
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:32,260
That's why they have their little,
their little name tags on.

28
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,340
They describe what they do and the weird
things they did to get into the car,

29
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,590
into the company. Um, I that in Washington

30
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,930
when, uh, uh, as some of you know,

31
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:49,270
I worked some with the
President Bill Clinton and,

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,020
and the vice president Al
Gore on some Internet work.

33
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:55,590
And in the context of that they had
a fellow working for them named Ira

34
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,800
Magaziner who became a good friend and is
very, very sharp guy. And one day I was,

35
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:03,190
and this was in 96 or 97
and I sat down with Ira,

36
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:06,820
we were having a nice chat and I was
saying how incredibly intelligent the

37
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,700
president was. And he
said she's smarter. And I,

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,310
I thought that's pretty amazing.
And so I filed that away.

39
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,210
So the next year I go to Davos and there's
a dinner and Mrs. Clinton shows up.

40
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,750
And then the next morning I go to her
speak her speech and I've not heard her

41
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,291
speak before.

42
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:31,291
And she talked for an hour
about the purview of the world,

43
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,230
social change, business
policy, international issues,

44
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,690
and she did the speech,

45
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,780
which is a brilliant
speech without any notes,

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,580
a feat that I have still
not been able to replicate

47
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,663
the,

48
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,970
I'm still,
I'm still thinking about this.

49
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,560
We're talking about an extraordinary
national leader here on stage at Google

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,740
today. Welcome to Google. Thank you.

51
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,663
You very much.

52
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,040
I am absolutely thrilled to be here,
uh,

53
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,060
to have a chance to come
and see for myself, uh,

54
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,140
the best place to work in America.
Number one

55
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,140
place that is really helping
to invent the future. You know,

56
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,200
one of the great things about America
is that we've always been more about the

57
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:39,700
future then nearly any place
ever in the history of the world.

58
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,810
And probably,
I hope we will always be that.

59
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,840
But part of what it means to envision
the future and help to create it is

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,550
figuring out how to work together
to achieve some of those goals.

61
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:58,780
And what you've done here at Google
and just a very short period of time,

62
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,640
uh, has revolutionized
the way we live. We work,

63
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,730
we think information
that's accessible to us.

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,680
And so I'm delighted to not only be here
to have this conversation with Eric,

65
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:12,491
but you know,

66
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:17,491
to keep learning more about what you
see in the future and how someone in my

67
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:22,921
position who is currently
in public leadership,

68
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,060
obviously I'm running now for president,
uh,

69
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,200
can be much more supportive in creating
the circumstances that enable not only

70
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:36,970
Google and people like
those of you who work here,

71
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:41,350
but so many millions of more around
our own country and around the world,

72
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,760
make that better future.

73
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:47,630
So this is exciting for
me and I appreciate the
opportunity to be here and, uh,

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,690
look forward to the
conversation with Eric. So,

75
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,870
so was her first question
was a Google earth question.

76
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,320
So we have a senator here
who's paying attention.

77
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,090
When I think about the political
campaign that you're now embarking on,

78
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,230
which I think is as many ways a physical
marathon having seen people do it

79
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:08,330
before.
What I,

80
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,050
what I don't like about the way it's
covered is everybody focuses on the past.

81
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,000
And my view is that what
this really is is an,

82
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,170
and it's an extended job interview between
the citizenry hiring you to be their

83
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,410
president. So, so I think a,

84
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,640
a good starting question is let's
talk about the future as you see it.

85
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,570
Um, and uh, critics would say, uh,

86
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,220
and I think with some
validity that Iraq is a mess,

87
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,120
that our global positioning
as a country is a mess.

88
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,320
That we have deficits before
us that are larger than we can,

89
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,060
that we've ever foreseen with
no obvious solution site.

90
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,490
And the criticism was go on and on.

91
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,670
Take us through the future as you see it.

92
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,840
Tell us why things will be better or
different with your insights and your view

93
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,480
and your ability to put people together.

94
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,010
That's a great,
great question.

95
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,390
And I want you all to imagine with me,

96
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,170
um,
what our country will be like in 10 years,

97
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:12,420
which will be the end of my second term,

98
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,473
uh,

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,870
or

100
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,280
the alternative that we just
keep going the way we are,

101
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,200
which I think would be really,
uh,

102
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,320
so counter to who we
should be as Americans.

103
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,320
Every time anybody runs for office,

104
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,440
they say that this is the
most important election.

105
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,320
And I think every election is important,

106
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:47,910
which is why I hope that each and every
one of you will take that responsibility

107
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:49,410
seriously now and in the future.

108
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:54,411
But I really do think this is a defining
moment election because we have so much

109
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,570
unfinished business at home and
abroad and we have a choice to make.

110
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,170
You know,

111
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,940
no matter how successful you are as an
individual or how successful you are as a

112
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:06,774
company,

113
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,130
there are certain things that we can only
do together through the instrument of

114
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:11,964
our government.

115
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,540
So I hope that the future
holds not just the promise,

116
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:22,980
but the reality of universal health care
coverage that provides high quality,

117
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,740
affordable health care
for every single American.

118
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,810
And I think Google has a real role to
play in helping us make that happen.

119
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,530
So it's not just what I see.
It's what I hope you see as well.

120
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,890
I hope the future holds that we have
an energy system that is no longer

121
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:46,110
dependent upon fossil fuels,
imported from regimes around the world,

122
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,530
but that instead we have figured out how
best to incentivize the private sector

123
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,860
to make investments that will to clean
green energy becoming dominant in our

124
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,780
nation, which will be good for the
economy, good for the environment,

125
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,160
and good for our security.

126
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,290
I hope the future holds that within
10 years we will have made progress on

127
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,860
global climate change. We're
no longer denying it. We have,

128
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,400
I hope that an over the bump of people
saying we can't do it because it will

129
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:22,080
wreck our account,
our economy,

130
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,320
but instead we see what needs to
happen will be good for the planet,

131
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,450
but it also can be good for the economy.
You know,

132
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:33,450
when President Bush took us out of Kyoto,

133
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:38,451
Prime Minister Blair took Great Britain
in and they created tens of thousands of

134
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:43,791
new jobs in trying to figure out how to
decrease greenhouse gas emissions and

135
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:45,870
clean up the environment.

136
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,470
I hope that the future will
see an education system
that starts with preschool

137
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:58,521
opportunities for kids who need some
extra help so they can enter school ready

138
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:03,150
to learn that we'll have
many more qualified teachers,

139
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:08,151
particularly in math and science and other
shortage areas and a culture starting

140
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:08,971
with the family.

141
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:13,971
But going beyond that really values
education in America and creates a feeling

142
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:19,200
among our citizenry that it's important.

143
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,260
I was telling Eric and Larry and Sergei
and others a story about how when I was

144
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:27,870
in fifth grade and Sputnik was sent up,

145
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,960
I don't have to tell you what Sputnik,

146
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,840
you'll need to tell him what will
make me feel very all very all to do.

147
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,674
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,550
Well, I can't, uh, you'll
have to look it up on Google.

149
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,060
But,
but when it went up

150
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,053
and it was,
you know,

151
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,090
a direct threat to America's primacy
in science and technology and space

152
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:51,370
exploration from the Soviet Union,

153
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,060
the whole country was galvanized.
You know,

154
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:59,830
I remember conversations about it over
the dinner table and I remember my fifth

155
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:03,280
grade teacher coming in and saying,
children,

156
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,820
the president wants you
to study math and science.

157
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,050
I personally thought the president,
President Eisenhower had called

158
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,600
Mrs Brows and 12th how us,
but

159
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,070
it, it had a feeling that we were all in
this together. Out of that came Darpa,

160
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,430
out of that came the space programs so
much else that galvanized your parents or

161
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:29,690
grandparents generation to be part
of something bigger than themselves.

162
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,840
It had enormous spinoff for the creation
of wealth and new jobs and increase in

163
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:40,340
our gross domestic product because we
set some goals partly in reaction to what

164
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:43,520
others were doing, but also because
it's part of the American spirit.

165
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,920
So in all of these areas,

166
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:49,340
what I see if we make the right decisions,

167
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:53,300
both through our government and in our
private sector and on an individual,

168
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,970
because there's a role for each person
to play and doing more to achieve this

169
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,900
better future. And of course I
see a future where once again,

170
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,930
United States is respected
around the world,

171
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:09,931
that our moral authority and
our leadership is helping
to solve problems and

172
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,950
recognizes that we will do
better if we work together,

173
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,740
that we create alliances
and relationships.

174
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,660
So 10 years is a long
time and individual life,

175
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:25,360
but it's not a long time
in the life of a country.

176
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,670
If we start down this path to renew
the promise of America at home and to

177
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:33,370
restore respect for us abroad,

178
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,530
then in 10 years we will be more
competitive. We will be better position,

179
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,480
we will have begun to deal with a lot
of the problems that left untended will

180
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,540
undermine our standard of living,
our quality of life,

181
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,460
and make the world a more dangerous place.

182
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,260
So we have two visions stay where we are
refused to deal with the problems that

183
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:58,180
we have. Refused to find ways to bring
people together to create new incentives,

184
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:02,500
to set goals or do what we're
best at doing. You know,

185
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:06,610
put our minds to work,
unleash our entrepreneurial energy,

186
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,960
create the framework to address these
problems and call our citizens again,

187
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,561
you know,

188
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:15,820
to make a contribution to putting us back
on the right path to a better future.

189
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,150
Think about what you
have chosen to embark on.

190
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,190
The world is different now
politically in terms of the,

191
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,540
the way the primary is work and so forth.

192
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,850
Can you take us a little bit through what
it's going to take in these first two

193
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:43,340
years? How will it play out? What
expectations should we have? Um,

194
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,490
where will you be? How will
we see you? Right. Well,

195
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,223
um,

196
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,710
this is,
uh,

197
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,640
a marathon and it's starting a lot
earlier than it ever has before.

198
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,780
But those of you who have an interest
or who have followed American, uh, uh,

199
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,430
political campaigns, uh, before I,

200
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,850
you'll probably recall that,
uh,

201
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,740
we didn't have this much
intensity or energy this early,

202
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,040
uh, in previous election cycles. In fact,

203
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,320
when my husband first ran for president,

204
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,000
he did not announce he would
run until October of 1991.

205
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,520
And then,
you know,

206
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:28,660
it was a sprint through the primaries
and then obviously the general election.

207
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,140
So the way this is set up now is there
are a couple of states that have early

208
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,830
contests.
You've got the caucuses in Iowa first,

209
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,850
then caucuses in Nevada
as currently scheduled,

210
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,520
then a primary election in New Hampshire,

211
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:48,430
and then a primary election
in South Carolina. Now,

212
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:53,150
if that was all that was going on,
it would be demanding but manageable.

213
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,050
But a lot of the big states have decided
that they don't want to be on the

214
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:59,690
sidelines.
They want to be in the mix.

215
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,550
And that means that they're moving
their dates up. So for example,

216
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,970
California now intends to move up to be,
you know,

217
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,950
within a week of South Carolina
on February 5th, Florida.

218
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:17,930
Wants to move up to the same day, South
Carolina. And then you've got, you know,

219
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:22,730
other states like New Jersey and Texas
and maybe even New York. So in effect,

220
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,151
Eric,

221
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:27,230
we're going to be running one national
campaign for the primary and then another

222
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,130
national campaign for the
general election. And you know,

223
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,590
I'm just going to be, is this vitamin
water? I'm going to be drinking,

224
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm going to be drinking a lot of
vitamin water. I'm going to try to, um,

225
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,660
you know,

226
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,660
run a campaign that keeps the focus on
what I want to do on the issues that

227
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:53,030
people talk to me about.
Because as I travel around the country,

228
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,960
a lot of the issues I mentioned
in addition of course to
Iraq and Iran and some

229
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,690
of the others that are really
on the front pages and,

230
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:02,020
and deeply concerning to people,
uh,

231
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,260
are what everybody wants to talk about
and what I would do as president. Uh,

232
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:09,380
and I hope that, uh, we can
get people more involved.

233
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,650
I think one of the reasons the campaign
has started so early this year is there

234
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:18,410
a lot of people, not just Democrats,
but independents, Republicans,

235
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,960
people who before were never
politically affiliated,

236
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:25,961
which I'm finding more and more coming
to events for me who just don't want to

237
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:29,060
think about the next two years.

238
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,130
They want to leap over the fact that we
have our current occupant in the White

239
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,680
House and get to the 2008 election.

240
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:40,250
So there's all this pent
up energy to get out there,

241
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,570
change the future.

242
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,650
Several Googlers sent in questions about,
um,

243
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,700
abuse of executive power up.

244
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,210
Okay.
I

245
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,680
think they were referring to a different,

246
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,620
one of the things that,

247
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:10,621
that you did that was very interesting
was how you transitioned from first lady

248
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:12,514
to senator.

249
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,740
And it notable because it was highly
criticized and notable also because it was

250
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:19,120
extraordinarily successful.

251
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,160
And it's a very interesting story in my
view of transformation of yourself and

252
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:28,960
how you worked at. And I'm acutely
aware of the fact that the burden,

253
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,770
the burden on women in, in high
places is even tougher in many ways.

254
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:34,210
The standards seem to be higher.

255
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,170
The criticisms are harsher in many ways
for reasons I don't understand. Uh,

256
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,830
and maybe, maybe you do, maybe
you don't, you live this,

257
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:46,060
you live this transition from first
lady to senator. How did you do it?

258
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,940
How did you become a senator in New York?

259
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,730
How did you make things
successful in New York? Uh,

260
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,820
especially in the red parts as
opposed to the red and the blue parts?

261
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,640
It's a great question.
You know, um, well, well,

262
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:03,530
one thing and I,

263
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:08,120
and I appreciate your saying that it is
still challenging for women because I

264
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,140
think that is the case.

265
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:13,370
Although we've certainly made a tremendous
amount of progress and much more to

266
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:17,630
come.
But I was lucky when I was growing up,

267
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,760
I had the same expectations for me and my,

268
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,040
my brother's in my family,
uh, from my parents. You know,

269
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,790
there was no difference in,
uh, that wasn't the case
with a lot of my girlfriends.

270
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,130
It may seem like ancient history,
but you know,

271
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:35,540
there were scholarships I couldn't get,
there was schools I couldn't go to.

272
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,340
There were jobs that really were not open
to women, uh, when I was a young girl,

273
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:45,610
but my parents believed in education
and gave me the opportunities to really

274
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,090
develop self confidence and belief that
I could do what I set my mind to doing.

275
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,510
And I also worked a lot all
during my growing up years.

276
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,550
I had my first job when I was 13,
um,

277
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,790
at a little park where I supervise kids.

278
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:06,791
And I just always had a
lot of opportunities to get
out into the world to sort

279
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:11,120
of test myself and kind of
see what the reaction was.

280
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:13,190
And I played sports not well,

281
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,910
but I did play sports in
those days and I loved that.

282
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:18,680
And it was competitive and you know,

283
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:22,580
you played with boys and
you had to play the game.

284
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,620
And so I learned a lot about, you know,
how to present myself and how to compete.

285
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,930
And obviously when I graduated from
college, I decided to go to law school,

286
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:36,470
which was still somewhat
unusual for women, uh,

287
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:41,471
and had a great experience and then
went to work and had a lot of different,

288
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:41,840
uh,

289
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,840
jobs all the way up until I quit
working when bill became president.

290
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,250
So I had always worked.

291
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:54,120
I worked and I was a working mother and
I know the challenges of being, you know,

292
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,540
a parent with family responsibilities.

293
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,500
So when bill became president,
um,

294
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,290
I transitioned into a full time volunteer,

295
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,050
which was something new for me because
I had never been a full time volunteer

296
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:10,880
and I loved volunteering.
But this became, you know,

297
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:14,030
the role that I had and it
was a great eight years,

298
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:18,380
but it was different
from the rest of my life,

299
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,870
particularly my working life.
So in a funny way,

300
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,160
running for and serving as senator was
getting back more to having the kind of

301
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:26,900
job that I always had had.

302
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,520
And when I started to run for the Senate,
it seemed like such a,

303
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,360
you know,
long shot and,

304
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,610
and hard to believe that I
could make the transition.

305
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,230
But I was very comfortable doing
it because I liked campaigning.

306
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,280
I love policy. I think it
really matters, you know,

307
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:49,330
what decisions made and how
they affect people's lives.

308
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,660
So as I traveled around
the state of New York,

309
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:56,410
I made it very clear that I wanted
to represent the entire state.

310
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:57,970
And is Eric says,
you know,

311
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:01,870
a lot of people look at California
or look at New York and say, well,

312
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:05,260
everybody's one kind of person.
Well, how absurd that is.

313
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:08,860
Everybody knows the diversity in
California and the diversity in New York.

314
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,870
So as I traveled, I visited a lot of
places that didn't vote for Democrats.

315
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,650
They had never elected a woman
statewide to anything and in our state.

316
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,210
So I had, uh, you know,

317
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,560
pretty significant hurdle to overcome,

318
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:28,540
to prove myself, to stand on my
own feet, to make my own case.

319
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,250
And I'm very grateful that the people
of New York gave me the chance to serve.

320
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,230
And when I got to the Senate, a lot of
people didn't know what to expect. Um,

321
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,350
there was some kind of funny thing said,

322
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:45,310
one of the leaders on the other side
of the aisle after I was elected said,

323
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:48,280
well maybe lightning will strike
and she won't come after all.

324
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,440
So I knew that I had a lot to prove
and I did what I've always done,

325
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:55,240
which is just to work really hard,

326
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,270
learn as much as I could and find
ways to reach across the party divide,

327
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:06,160
which I think can be so destructive
if it's not bridged. You know, we,

328
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:10,000
we stand on the opposite sides and we've
got all these problems and instead of

329
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:13,090
working to bring people together
to solve them, you know,

330
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:16,090
people just retreat and
kind of talk to themselves.

331
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,160
So I worked with a lot of people who were,
you know,

332
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,300
not exactly favorable to me during the
time that a bill was in the White House.

333
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,540
But you know,

334
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:30,190
I've found common ground with
them and I find the job, you know,

335
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:35,080
very rewarding because you get to really
look for ways on a very individual

336
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:39,310
level to help somebody as well as
the more macro level. You know,

337
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:40,570
for me,
you know,

338
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:45,571
helping a child get healthcare who's
insurance company has denied his parents,

339
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,600
uh,

340
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,580
the right to get the treatment that
their doctors say he needs is incredibly

341
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:52,414
important.

342
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,770
And it kind of keeps me going because
sometimes the bar on the bureaucracy and

343
00:22:56,771 --> 00:23:00,970
the political back and forth prevents
positive things from happening.

344
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:04,360
But if you can even help one person,
you know,

345
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:07,810
it feels like it's worthwhile. And
then I've been able to, you know,

346
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:11,920
do some good legislation and,
and work things through, uh,

347
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:13,300
to try to make a difference.

348
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:18,040
And obviously I'm very gratified that
people reelected me in this last election

349
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:22,870
was 67% of the vote and from a lot of
people and a lot of areas of the state

350
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,040
don't usually vote for Democrats don't
think they ever would have voted for me.

351
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,920
Um, so I think it's just like
anything else. I mean, you,

352
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,330
you really set your goals,
you work hard to achieve them,

353
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:39,310
and you try to bring more people in
to share credit and be part of moving

354
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:43,780
forward together to, you know, get to
those goals. That's what matters to me.

355
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,940
Obviously, you know, you
sometimes you can't make it,

356
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:50,640
but in general it's a very rewarding
way to, you know, to work. And I,

357
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm glad that I was able
to make the transition and
obviously now I'm looking to

358
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:59,330
make another transition
based on everything I've done
my entire life and all of

359
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:03,680
the preparation and experience and
qualifications that I bring to this

360
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:06,400
presidential campaign. So, so we had a,

361
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:06,880
uh,

362
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,080
a meeting with a number of leaders in
Silicon Valley a few minutes ago and a lot

363
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:16,081
of the conversation was about your
view of and the energy and environment.

364
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,350
And in your comments today with us,

365
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,430
you indicated that's a major area along
with education in a couple of others

366
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,190
with this audience and
people who were really,

367
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,110
people just really aren't going to do it.

368
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,990
Sketch out how you would like it to
play out the role of private sector.

369
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,350
Uh, the opportunity before us,
you cited a very interesting,

370
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,810
interesting statistic for
example about California.

371
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,720
The California has per capita energy use
has not caught up, right? Right. So again,

372
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,290
I'm looking at it from
policy policies perspective.

373
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,010
Take us through why we are where we
are as a nation and then how would you

374
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:54,970
change or how would you see it changing?

375
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,050
Well, that's a, that's a really
long conversation. But let
me try to, you know, just,

376
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,980
um, it, because I know many of
you are interested in, you know,

377
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,950
what we're going to do with energy
and what we're going to do with the

378
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:10,260
environment.
And they really are one in the same.

379
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:13,740
You can't separate out trying
to deal with the environment,

380
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:18,741
particularly climate change
without dealing with how
we generate energy and how

381
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:24,240
we use it.
And as I look at where we are today,

382
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,370
um, we've had a lot of missed
opportunities going back, you know,

383
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,770
more than I'm 35 years.
Uh,

384
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:36,771
we had some effort that nationally made
a little progress in the mid to late

385
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,470
seventies and trying to get people to
focus on raising gas mileage of our cars

386
00:25:45,781 --> 00:25:50,030
to looking for alternative fuel
sources. Then the, you know,

387
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:55,070
fossil fuels that we have relied on in
incentivizing conservation and energy

388
00:25:55,531 --> 00:25:59,280
efficiency. But when, uh,

389
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,170
President Reagan took office in 1981,

390
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,190
he and the Republican Congress dismantle
what was the beginnings of a kind of

391
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,450
energy policy that would change
how we thought about energy,

392
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:19,710
incentivize different
approaches. California, however,

393
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,270
maintained its emphasis on
conservation and efficiency.

394
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,020
So we're California is today is that
despite an explosive growth in energy

395
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:33,600
usage,
particularly here in Silicon Valley,

396
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,340
electricity usage has remained flat
in terms of per capita usage here in

397
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:46,200
California in the rest of
the country has gone up 50%.

398
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,400
So when somebody in another state kind
of buys in to what is the Republican

399
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,480
White House line about how we
can't do anything about energy,

400
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,110
and certainly we can't do anything about
climate change without wrecking our

401
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:04,980
economy. I say, well, isn't
that interesting? Look at
what California has done.

402
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:10,310
We would be further along if we had
kept the conservation and efficiency

403
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:16,380
measures that California cap and now
we've got to sort of reinvent them

404
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,320
nationally.
But California sets a good example.

405
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,040
This has to be a public
private partnership and it
has to be at all levels of

406
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:30,120
public government,
federal, state, and local.

407
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,650
At the federal level.

408
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:36,651
We do need a much broader energy policy
that shifts our subsidies and incentives

409
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:39,690
away from,
you know,

410
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,720
gas and oil into alternatives that
looks for cleaner ways to deliver coal,

411
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:46,650
for example,

412
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,920
that really provides a much greater
support for biofuels and biodiesel that

413
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:56,070
tries to get, get gas
mileage up that, you know,

414
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,780
looks at how we can use production
tax credits even more for, you know,

415
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:04,080
wind and solar and
geothermal and all the rest.

416
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,480
But that has to be translated down
so that it's state and local levels.

417
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,850
Their support for these changes.
You know,

418
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:15,370
when we were talking in the
earlier conversation, um,

419
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,430
Sergei and Larry were talking about how
Google had decided to put more solar

420
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:25,280
panels here, but there was
so many obstacles at the
local level about, you know,

421
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,440
what you had to do to get that
done and get them installed.

422
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,870
So it's not just what
happens at the federal level.

423
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:36,050
We have to change the attitude
of government up and down
the scale to really be

424
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,730
committed to this new energy future.

425
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,090
And then the private sector I think
can make a lot of money in new forms of

426
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:48,810
energy and there's a lot of
investment that is now going on,

427
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,050
very much centered here in silicon valley.

428
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,590
So if we have the right messages and
incentives coming from Washington,

429
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,520
if we have capital that is now ready to
invest in new technologies and let's bet

430
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:08,940
on a bunch of them and not
preordained what may or may not work,

431
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,930
then the missing piece is the individual.
You know,

432
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:16,560
what will the individual do? I
mean, will the individual, namely,

433
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,820
all of us buy into this new energy future,
you know,

434
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:24,630
will we buy the car with
the higher gas mileage?

435
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:29,730
Will we buy the house with those
funny blue solar panels on top?

436
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,770
We'll we want the wind turbine on
the mountain that we look out at.

437
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,060
Will we conserve and by the
energy efficient appliances,

438
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,420
I'm betting we will if we
create this, this group. Well,

439
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,140
and you are trendsetters. And
I mean that seriously. I mean,

440
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:52,141
we have to get this to be
something everybody does
because if we're not part of

441
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,370
the solution,
then truly we are,

442
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:59,430
part of the problem is the old cliche
goes and at the end of the day we have to

443
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,890
have millions,

444
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,030
hundreds of millions of decisions that
are made every single day to choose clean

445
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:07,864
green energy.

446
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,460
And then we also have to create
the conditions for clean,

447
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:15,100
green power generation.
Uh,

448
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:19,840
and we have to both through carrots and
sticks bring that about. But you know,

449
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:24,040
I think the time has come and
I'm hoping that, um, you know,

450
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:24,940
on Sunday night,

451
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:29,350
Al Gore wins the Oscar for inconvenient
truth and that'll give us another one

452
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,800
booth in the right direction.

453
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,530
When I look at the rock situation,
I see a mass,

454
00:30:40,531 --> 00:30:45,500
as I said in my personal view is that one,
it's a civil war.

455
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,510
And to adding or deleting troops, neither
scenario seems like a good scenario.

456
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,000
Whoa.

457
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,990
Go looking, looking
forward, looking forward,

458
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,700
not looking backward. Looking
forward. What should we do?

459
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,773
Uh,

460
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,370
maybe President Bush,
we'll leave this issue to his successor,

461
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,720
in which case it's probably
the first thing on the desk,

462
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,380
right when you get there.
Right?

463
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,750
Well, actually he has said several times
he's going to leave it to his successor,

464
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,140
which I think is the height of your
responsibility. This is his war.

465
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:26,280
He should extricate us from it
before he leaves. But if he,

466
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,210
it continues down the path he has chosen,
it is likely to be on the desk.

467
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,410
That is exactly right. Well, what
would we or should we do going forward?

468
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:41,990
What if we could persuade the president,
uh,

469
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:46,460
to change course would we want him to
do well? Number one, no escalation.

470
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:48,200
Stop the troop escalation.

471
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:53,201
Do not send thousands of more
combat troops and thousands
more support troops to

472
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:00,380
try to intervene in a
multi-sided sectarian civil war.

473
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,100
It is hard to know who you're shooting
at and who is shooting at you.

474
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,140
I have legislation to the effect that we
should cap the number of troops so that

475
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,860
it would be illegal for the
president to send additional troops.

476
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,780
At the very least,

477
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,840
we should make it illegal for the
president to send any young American in

478
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:26,351
uniform and to combat with all all of the
equipment and training he or she needs

479
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:29,750
to protect themselves

480
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,900
and their fellow soldiers.

481
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,560
We also need to make it clear to the Iraqi
government that the days of the check

482
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:43,730
or over, we're not going to continue
to fund their security forces and their

483
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:48,731
reconstruction unless they do what is
necessary to begin to put in place a

484
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:52,970
political solution.
We know what the pieces of it are.

485
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,610
As difficult as it might be.
Number one,

486
00:32:55,611 --> 00:33:00,611
there has to be a decision made about how
to allocate oil revenues in a fair and

487
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:02,600
equitable manner.

488
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,900
Something that I have pushed for since
summer of Oh three when I said do an oil

489
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:11,810
trust and I had bipartisan
support for it in the Senate,

490
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,260
we couldn't get it frankly past
the vice president's office.

491
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:21,010
We also need to get the Iraqis to reverse
their deep bath application to amend

492
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:27,461
their constitution and to begin to
try to figure out how to isolate the

493
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:33,050
extremists on both sides of
this sectarian civil war.

494
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:38,240
We also should convene an international
conference where the neighbors in the

495
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:42,800
region are put on the spot about what
they will do to help stabilize the rock.

496
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,050
We, we unfortunately, are confronted
with the president's approach,

497
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:53,051
which is we don't talk to bad people
and I think that is the most absurd

498
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,920
diplomatic position to take.
You don't make peace with your friends,

499
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,610
you don't even do business with
your friends a lot of the time.

500
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,990
You have to deal with people
whose worldview is different,

501
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:09,530
whose interests are sometimes
antithetical to your own.

502
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,980
During the Cold War where the Soviet
Union had thousands of missiles pointed at

503
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:19,850
us and where their leaders
repeatedly said they would bury us,

504
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,490
are Republican and Democratic presidents
always talk to them and it was a very

505
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:28,340
smart thing to do.
We actually could make some progress,

506
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,720
we could get better intelligence,

507
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:33,590
we could figure out how to leverage
what we needed against them and we could

508
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:38,591
send a message behind the iron curtain
that people in the United States cared

509
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:45,200
about the future of people who were
under totalitarian communist rule.

510
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,550
We need to be talking to Iran,
we need to be talking to Syria.

511
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:54,470
We need to be talking to our
adversaries and failing to do so.

512
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:59,471
Postpones any effort we can realistically
have of trying to manage these

513
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:01,250
difficult situations.

514
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,510
So there is a lot we could
start doing right now, Eric,

515
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,840
but we're locked into unfortunately a
situation where the president believes

516
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:16,880
he's right.
I argue it's against reality,

517
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,560
but he believes it's right and he seems
impervious to evidence or argument or

518
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:22,394
reason.

519
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:27,490
And is determined to pursue this policy
and the only way we can legally reign

520
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:32,900
him in is if we get 60 votes
in the senate. Why is that?

521
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,710
Because the house has different rules
and Nancy Polosi is doing a great job as

522
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:38,370
speaker and she pushed through

523
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,080
a strong resolution of disapproval of
the president's policy in the Senate.

524
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:51,100
The rules are different.
It's a kind of um, you know,

525
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:53,620
balance that our founders set up.

526
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:55,840
The Senate is more difficult
to get things through.

527
00:35:55,841 --> 00:36:00,400
You've got to in effect get 60 votes
for anything controversial because

528
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:04,870
otherwise a minority can dig his heels
in and prevent anything from happening.

529
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,630
Well,
last week we got 56 votes,

530
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:12,370
a strong bipartisan majority against
the president's escalation policy,

531
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:17,371
but we didn't get 60 so we have to keep
the pressure on Republican senators to

532
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:21,610
join with us, to try to rein
him in. I hope we can do that.

533
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,900
That's what we're trying very hard to do.
I'm not giving up on doing it,

534
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,800
but if at the end of
this president's term,

535
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,220
he has not extricated us from Iraq,

536
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,640
I will because I believe
it's so important.

537
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:41,170
It has to be the first item on the desk.
When you walk into the Oval Office,

538
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,760
the Senate senator,
Senator Clemens,

539
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,930
you're, you're, you're late
for your next appointment.

540
00:36:52,931 --> 00:36:55,240
But I have to ask you one unfair question.

541
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,510
We have all of the people
who make Google of success.

542
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,920
You are a Google user.
You have a vision of the world.

543
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,750
What would you have us do

544
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,523
well?

545
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,780
What are the things that
Google can help your vision,

546
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:16,170
right to happen? Oh, I have
some very specific ideas.

547
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,780
You have some bug reports and

548
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,160
well,

549
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,950
keep Google earth going.
Maybe that'll change some more minds.

550
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,040
That's obviously important.
You know,

551
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:32,210
the problems and the opportunities
that I started out talking about.

552
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:38,140
I think all of you who work at Google
and the company collectively can really

553
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,680
help us address them.
As Eric was showing me around,

554
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:46,880
we stopped at, uh, one of the offices
where the health team was working.

555
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:51,710
We cannot get to universal healthcare
coverage unless we have a much better

556
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:56,240
information base that is very
reliable that people can turn to,

557
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,490
to make decisions on their own, to be
empowered as consumers of healthcare.

558
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:05,780
And that is something I know you're
working on and we really need you to be

559
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,150
aggressively pursuing that.

560
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,590
We also need more information technology.

561
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,930
Someone's decided to play the piano while
you're eating. I'm sorry. It is Google.

562
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:20,050
Yeah. You know, we do need
more information technology
generally in health care.

563
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,650
Um, I don't know how many of
you been to the doctor recently,

564
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:25,420
but if you bought gone to a new doctor,

565
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:29,320
they probably took a new history on paper.

566
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,870
They probably don't have electronic
medical records. If you go to visit,

567
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,900
say in New York and you have
an accident or you get sick,

568
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,070
you need to go to the doctor,

569
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,720
they'll have to do it all over again
because they probably can't transfer what

570
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:48,460
you have at your doctor here to
where they are. The health sector,

571
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:53,461
which uses over 16 cents out of every
dollar we spend in America is woefully

572
00:38:56,651 --> 00:38:59,770
deficient in information technology.

573
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:05,390
Any way you can help us move our health
sector into the 21st century will help

574
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:13,390
us to get a base of information on which
we can make better decisions to provide

575
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:17,950
healthcare to everybody. When it
comes to energy or the environment,

576
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,290
there's a lot of entrepreneurial
genius in this room.

577
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:29,010
Anything that we can do to incentivize
people to make better investments or to

578
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:34,411
make better personal decisions by
going to Google or getting new ways of

579
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:39,220
communicating through Google or
new ideas. Please do. And finally,

580
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,030
you know,
with respect to education,

581
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,200
I really wish we could figure out how
to do much more online education more

582
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:54,691
effectively in more places where kids are
not being given a fair chance to get a

583
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:58,600
first class education.

584
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,970
Our schools are still stuck in
a 20th century industrial model.

585
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,190
They're open certain hours,

586
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,150
which is not very family friendly
for a lot of working parents.

587
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,820
The technology that's available,

588
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,510
I'm not talking about the best
schools which are terrific,

589
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:21,700
but in general the technology that's
available is not really, you know,

590
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:26,701
used to the utmost to further
the educational experience
of whoever the student

591
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:28,000
is.

592
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And we need much more intensive
opportunities across the
online world so that if

593
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:40,360
you're in a school where you don't have
maybe the best math curriculum but you

594
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:41,830
have an aptitude for it,

595
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,750
what can you do here at Google to help
capture the imagination of that young boy

596
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:51,751
or girl so that they stay with math and
science so that they help contribute to

597
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:56,650
what we need to do to transform our
economy and be competitive globally.

598
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,470
And I guess really the last thing I would
say about what you can do is, you know,

599
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,990
Google links the world

600
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,500
and we need a lot more understanding
and communication among all of us.

601
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,950
And particularly we need to reassert

602
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,340
America's willingness to actually listen
to other people that we want to be part

603
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:22,380
of an ongoing conversation globally.

604
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:26,360
That we want to send a message to
people around the world that, you know,

605
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,750
America is back,

606
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,130
that we care about you that were
interested in helping solve your problems,

607
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:35,720
were not self centered and you know,

608
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,310
finger pointing and line drawing the
way we've appeared the last six years.

609
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,810
Because every challenge we face
globally can only be addressed if we're

610
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:48,440
interconnected and that we
recognize our interdependence.

611
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,580
And Google is a great metaphor for that.
So the more we can do it,

612
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,900
the better off we'll be.

613
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:57,950
And I thank you for everything you
are doing and will do for the future.

614
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,910
Thank you.
I have,

615
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,110
I have only one request of the senator.

616
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,100
I have hours of more interesting questions
and I'm sure you have hours and we're

617
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:16,260
seeing answers, so we want
you to come back, okay?

618
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,170
Okay. Hi. Thank you for
coming. Thank you very much.
