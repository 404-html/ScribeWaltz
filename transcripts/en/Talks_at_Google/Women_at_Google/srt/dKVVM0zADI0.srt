1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,200
Well. Good morning and welcome to talks
at Google in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,280
Today it's my great pleasure to
introduce the great and Jane Lightman.

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,090
Jean is one of Boston's most exceptional
representational artists and teachers

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,571
as a teacher.

5
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:28,571
She passes on the knowledge and techniques
she has received as one in the line

6
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:33,530
of Boston School of painters that
has been unbroken for over a century.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,080
This was a remarkable lineage,

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,170
I believe is unique and
the American art community.

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,330
She can describe it far better than I
can and I'll leave it to her to do some.

10
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,710
Gene holds a distinguished
artists membership at the
Concord Art Association and

11
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:55,871
became a Copley artist member of the
Copley Society Boston in 2004 in 1989 she

12
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:03,860
was elected a member of the prestigious
guild of Boston artists where she

13
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:08,861
currently serves as vice president of
the board of managers and curated a major

14
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:12,710
historical exhibition,
a woman's perspective,

15
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,130
founding and early women members of the
guild of Boston artists 1914 to 1945

16
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,750
please join me in
welcoming Jane White Man.

17
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,430
Thank you, Jonathan. Thank
you all for coming today.

18
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,410
It's an honor to be here at Google and
have the opportunity to talk with you

19
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:44,920
about art. And in particular
the art of the Boston School,

20
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,780
which is not a physical school is Jonathan
explained it's a painting tradition

21
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:53,950
that's been handed down from teacher
to student for over 100 years.

22
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:55,740
Yeah.

23
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,910
And uh, in my talk today I'll
introduce the Boston school painters,

24
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:04,911
the founders show you the work of the
founders and I'm also the European masters

25
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,320
who influenced them as
well as their successors.

26
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,200
Okay.

27
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,200
I'll also show you images of my own work
and explain how I include the essential

28
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,590
elements of the Boston
school and to my painting.

29
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,470
So,
uh,

30
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,080
okay.

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,610
The Boston school painters are essentially
impressionist in the sense that they

32
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:34,611
paint what the eye sees with particular
attention to the lights and the shadows

33
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,630
and the colors

34
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,050
because their paint,
what there,

35
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:46,051
I actually sees some areas are more
distinct and others are more diffused.

36
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,560
So there are sometimes
called optical realist.

37
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,910
And this should be distinguished from
photo realist where in photo realism

38
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:55,451
painting,

39
00:02:55,451 --> 00:03:00,220
every square inch of the canvas
is painted in precise everything.

40
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,080
And in the exact same focus,

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,200
but the way that we actually see is some
areas are more defined and others are

42
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:12,730
more diffused and so that's the way the
Boston school painters like to paint.

43
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,450
As you can see,
they don't all paint alike,

44
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,650
but they're all interested in how
the light falls across their subject.

45
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,783
Okay,

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,040
and the most important trade mark or the
Boston school painters is that all of

47
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:32,041
the parts must relate to the whole
giving the paintings unity or breadth.

48
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,150
Okay.

49
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,980
Probably the earliest vulva
impressionist painter was Velasquez,

50
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:44,120
Diego Velasquez who painted
this beautiful scene,

51
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:49,121
Las Meninas and you can see how he has
captured the light and the relationships

52
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:55,531
of the light as they fall on on the scene
and pay close attention to the dwarf

53
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,930
and the dog and the lower right hand
corner because they're beautiful examples

54
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:01,280
of impressionists sing.

55
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:03,490
Okay.

56
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,100
From Mira was another impressionist
and the way that we're using this term,

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,600
he was fascinated by how light fell
across the scene and his paintings have a

58
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,880
truth or the look of nature.
You feel like you're in the room with,

59
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,750
with the subject.

60
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,213
Okay.

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,670
He's arranged the model next to the
window and he's described how the light

62
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:28,380
falls across her arm and across the top
of her head covering the back wall and

63
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:32,980
onto the table.
And he's painted relational color.

64
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:37,300
He was one of the first
painters and really the only
Dutch painter to understand

65
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,910
that there's color in the halftones,

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,580
which is the area between
the lights and the shadows.

67
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,130
And here he's painted this beautiful
blue note and the top of her head,

68
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,630
her head covering,
and he's looking at relational colors.

69
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:52,510
So rather than painting this breasts,
pitcher and,

70
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:56,980
and bowl a yellow as
it would be in in life,

71
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,520
he's showing you that it's reflected
in all the colors around it.

72
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:03,370
So this is relational color
versus absolute color.

73
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,850
And you'll see this over and over
again in the Boston school paintings.

74
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,700
Okay.

75
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,560
Chardon also include an influenced the
Boston school painters and he painted

76
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:14,760
beautifully composed,

77
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:19,761
still lives using simple kitchen objects
and note how he paints these beautiful

78
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:23,570
abstractions of lights
and shadows as they, uh,

79
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,950
move across the canvas.

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,170
Okay?

81
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,730
In the late 19th century,

82
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:35,230
Americans flocked to Europe to study art.
In the academies,

83
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:39,190
particularly in France and Germany.
And they learn,

84
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:43,810
they're the essentials of
painting and in particular design,

85
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,810
which was a key element,
so important in academic painting.

86
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,520
And this painting by Joe Only owns your
Rome called Gray Eminence hangs in the

87
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:55,330
Museum of fine arts. It's a wonderful
example of academic painting.

88
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,710
And I learned from a Google search.

89
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,900
The Gray Eminence refers to the power
behind the throne. In this case,

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,010
this monk standing on the stairs who
was the power behind the throne in the

91
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:10,430
court of King Louis, the
13th. And Cardinal Richelieu,

92
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,720
Edmund Tarbell is considered the
founder of the Boston school. In fact,

93
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,120
the early painters we'll
call terrible lights,

94
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,790
he traveled to France as a
young art student in 1883
and studied in the academy.

95
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,860
Julienne there.

96
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:31,850
He learned the fundamentals of
drawing and design and painting.

97
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,080
But he and the other early Boston
painters, Boston school painters,

98
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:37,790
and I'll show you their work in a minute.

99
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,470
We're influenced also by the color and
the light of the French impressionist.

100
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:44,871
And uh,

101
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:49,460
they incorporated those to the color
and light and the drawing and design.

102
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:53,600
And they brought those back to Boston
and taught them what became known as the

103
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:58,310
Boston school tradition. And note
here, and you should blur your eyes,

104
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,700
which is the way to look at a lot
of these paintings with a blurred I,

105
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:06,701
you can see the abstractions of dark
silhouettes cut into the light starting on

106
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:11,771
the bottom left corner of the canvas and
traveling up and down and up until he

107
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:15,560
gets to the right upper right corner.

108
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,710
Beautiful abstractions.
And like for mere,

109
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:23,630
he's fascinated with the play of light
across the models neck and also across

110
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,940
the wall throughout the whole scene.

111
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,960
This is also by bell and
a wonderful portrait.

112
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,411
Again,

113
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:38,180
abstract did abstract had saying of
lights and that are silhouetted against a

114
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,350
dark background.

115
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,980
The painter here shows is the beautiful
form and colors in her face and her arms

116
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,510
and also in her her dress.

117
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,510
And he's seeking something
here that, um, is, is a unique,

118
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:58,000
I think to a lot of the Boston school
painters trying to find the beauty, uh,

119
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:03,010
the whole harmony and the round forms
that you see when you look at the scene is

120
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:07,070
reminiscent of John
Singer Sargent portraits.

121
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,450
And people often ask me if sergeant was
a Boston school painter, but he was not.

122
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:15,740
He painted in Europe, um, studied
in Europe, like the Boston painters,

123
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:19,550
but his paintings are a little
bit different. And as you can see,

124
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,870
the models is that he's a genius. And I'm
not taking anything away from sergeant.

125
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:28,760
He was an absolutely superb, phenomenal
painter and a number of different genres,

126
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,350
not just portrait,

127
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,830
but he's not seeking out the subtle color
tones and the round form in the face

128
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,900
and the neck and the arms,
which I think you can see here.

129
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,550
He's painting a sort of
lively, um, painterly,

130
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,000
um,
ensemble of lights and darks.

131
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,930
Frank Benson was another early Boston
school painter and he liked Tarbell study

132
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:55,070
that the academy,
Julianne and Paris.

133
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:56,570
Yeah,

134
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,120
his outdoor paintings glow with sunlight.

135
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,590
Okay.

136
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,300
As you can see here, he's also fascinated
by the colors, the relational colors,

137
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,060
the blues and the yellows on her dress.

138
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:12,800
Also on the inside of the
boat and on his son's shirt.

139
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,030
These are his children here.

140
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,880
The whole painting is a wonderful ensemble
of blues and yellows with a little

141
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:22,550
hint of reds in here for some interest.

142
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,913
Okay.

143
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,400
Benson was also an avid
outdoorsman and he, uh,

144
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,910
as he,
um,

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,930
he also did beautiful etchings
and paintings of wildlife.

146
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,840
And notice here his wonderful designs,
the,

147
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:41,830
the would call what's called
negative shapes here of the, uh,

148
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,820
inside the wings of the Canada
geese and how he's spaced them.

149
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,840
He sort of has a wonderful rhythm here
that's played out from here to here to

150
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:54,760
here.
It's a really beautiful example of design,

151
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,750
very simple design and,
and Vinson was a master at that.

152
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,393
Okay.

153
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,210
Another early Boston school painter
was Joseph to Camp who studied with,

154
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:11,030
um, uh, frank douvenette in
Germany. Notice here. He's,

155
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,790
this is also a wonderful
example of Boston school.

156
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,140
What's essential to the Boston school,
which is lost and found.

157
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,830
So, um, uh, found edge, uh,

158
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:28,620
is where the light and the shadow or
contrast and so this would be a found a

159
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:31,080
edge here.
The shadow against the background.

160
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,740
Also her just very,
you have to look closely,

161
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:39,741
but her chin here against the
background is a found edge.

162
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,060
This is a law sedge under her neck.

163
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,000
So this just dissolves
into the background.

164
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,930
The same thing with the back of her
hair that dissolves into the back of her

165
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,520
neck and shoulder.

166
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,320
And then all the way down into the apron
and now look at how her apron dissolves

167
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,660
into the tabletop,
the shadows on the tabletop.

168
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,070
And then this wonderful still life here
of porcelain objects is a great example

169
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:05,910
of lost and found. So this
is a, a found edge here,

170
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,450
which is sharp here against
the black of her apron.

171
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,900
This would be a lost edge where the other,

172
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,920
other side of this porcelain
dissolves into the background.

173
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:21,921
So you'll see lost and found repeated
in a lot of the Boston school work.

174
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,740
Okay.

175
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,340
William Paxton studied with Joseph Decamp,

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,720
our previous painter and
Paxton Excel did interiors.

177
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,690
I'm very much influenced by Vermeer.

178
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,710
This is a painting at the Museum of
fine arts called the new necklace.

179
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:41,950
Okay,

180
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,350
this is another wonderful
painting by Paxton.

181
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm also at the Museum of Fine Arts and
another great example of lost and found

182
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:51,520
and also beautiful impressionist color.

183
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,060
So you here some lost edges here and um,

184
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,980
very simple,
not highly defined,

185
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,170
a licensed shadows in the face which
dissolve into the back of the neck.

186
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,670
But you really have to see this
painting at the museum to appreciate the

187
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,650
absolutely gorgeous colors that the artist
puts into her back. And also her arm.

188
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,440
And notice the beautiful form on both

189
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,310
his wife Elizabeth Paxon was also a
wonderful painter and she excelled at it

190
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:27,910
still life paintings.

191
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,270
He or she makes this terrific
ensemble of a mass of objects.

192
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:38,530
It's called the breakfast tray and
she has a variety of edges here.

193
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:39,820
This is all an angle.

194
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:44,821
So here's a sharp angle here around
a sharp edge on the edge of the cup,

195
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,820
beautiful variety of edges and the Napkin
and also wonderful color ensembles.

196
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:57,010
These yellows and blues
harmonize beautifully and
then she has a little note of

197
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,360
red here for interest.

198
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:02,530
Okay.

199
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,530
William Paxton,

200
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:08,531
student Ives gamble was responsible for
carrying that tradition on through the

201
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:10,150
20th century.

202
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,840
He taught a number of students in the
forties and the fifties sixties I guess 50

203
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:19,780
sixties and seventies when this tradition
was very much out of favor with the

204
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:24,640
artists and the arts schools of the day.
A gamble,

205
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,720
loved painting, these sort of
allegorical paintings. But again,

206
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:31,840
note the beautiful Carmona
is color relationships.

207
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,130
I love the blues and the yellows and
this painting and then he has also some

208
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:36,964
notes of Rudd.

209
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,693
Okay.

210
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,580
The PA,

211
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,860
the Boston school tradition would have
surely died out if it hadn't been for

212
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:46,640
gamble and a number of his
students have gone on to teach,

213
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:47,900
including my teacher.

214
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,293
Okay.

215
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,790
One of his early students
was Robert Douglas Hunter.

216
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,090
You might be familiar with his still
lives. He was a very well known,

217
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:03,150
a still life painter and also noted
for is harmonious compositions.

218
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,750
Um,

219
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,490
he painted what he said all nature in one
glance and it does feel like this is a,

220
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,443
uh,

221
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,450
this classical still life has a
beautiful harmony or unity about it.

222
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:17,360
Okay.

223
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,120
Gambles student.
One of his students was Paul Ingrid Son,

224
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:23,390
who was my teacher and Paul Excelled.

225
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,940
He's also has gone on to teach oh,

226
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:30,560
dozens of painters over the last 30
years in mansion now in Manchester.

227
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:34,400
New Hampshire has an Italia,
Paul Excels at portraits,

228
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,710
civilized interiors figures,

229
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,870
and this is a beautiful portrait of a
dancer. Uh, one of my favorites of his,

230
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:46,100
and he has uses a full
use of relational color,

231
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:50,810
beautiful color transitions between the,
the warm notes in her cheek across the,

232
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,430
around 400 chic to the cooler
blue notes at the edge of her jaw.

233
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,750
Also beautiful soft round
edge at the edge of her jaw.

234
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:00,690
Okay.

235
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,490
And across her neck. And more than
that, more the tech, more the,

236
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,390
uh, more than the technical
accomplishments of this painting,

237
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,340
he's infused the, the, uh,
portrait with expression in life.

238
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,070
Okay.

239
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:22,070
This is Pauline Robertson's Italia in
New Hampshire and this is one of his cast

240
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,401
drawing students.

241
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:27,180
When the student begins to study
in the Boston school tradition,

242
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:31,320
the first thing you do is you'd make do
charcoal drawings of these white plaster

243
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:34,500
casts.
And that's what the student is doing here.

244
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,250
And that's what I did when I
first started studying, um,

245
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,380
in the late eighties with Paul.

246
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:45,390
So this is my cast drawing and
it's the perfect teaching tool.

247
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:47,050
It's, it's the, um,

248
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,670
the opportunity for the
teacher to what's called true,

249
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:55,380
the eye of the student to
recognize values and proportions.

250
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,900
Everything is seen relationally.

251
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:01,680
So I learned to see the height
and relation to the width.

252
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,410
I learned to see how my values,

253
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:09,120
how dark my shadows had to be in order
to make my lights pop out and get what's

254
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:12,780
called a light effect,
which is so important in this painting.

255
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,850
Okay.

256
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,730
And I also learned to
distinguish a variety of edges,

257
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:18,050
as I've already pointed out.

258
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,520
So there's sharp edges where the
value contrast or the highest.

259
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,980
And then in order to describe the form,

260
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,270
I had to learn to understand softer edges.
And how to make things look round.

261
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:31,580
And of course in Socrates beard here,

262
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,310
I had infinite opportunity to do that.

263
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,520
Okay.

264
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,940
This is um,
Paul's teaching studio and uh,

265
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:42,970
where I studied in
Roxbury back in the 80s.

266
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,340
And a few things to point out about
the studios for these Boston school

267
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,390
painters. First of all, you notice
that the wall color is a middle value.

268
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,230
It's not white.

269
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:57,640
We never use white walls because the
light bounces all over white walls.

270
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,450
And so it's hard to see what your,
the light is doing on your setup.

271
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,240
This is the setup here.
Also,

272
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:07,360
we have high Northlight
because Northlight is steady,

273
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,630
there's no sun shining through to,
um,

274
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,250
to change the shadows. So the shadows
are fairly consistent throughout the day.

275
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,540
Okay.

276
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,870
Another thing I want to
point out is in our painting,

277
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:24,871
we actually have to stand back from the
setup and the Easel at least three times

278
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:30,580
the height of the painting so that
you can see the whole thing at once.

279
00:17:30,581 --> 00:17:33,490
Because obviously you're
trying to get harmony or unity.

280
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:37,660
So you have to be able to see all of the
relationships that the values and the

281
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:42,310
colors and the proportions all as
Robert Hunter said in one glance.

282
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,640
So you stand back and then you look at
the painting and the setup and then you

283
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:50,520
actually walk up and paint from memory.

284
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:54,060
So I'm not looking at the setup
when I'm painting this painting.

285
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:55,890
Yeah,

286
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,320
it's just an interesting note.

287
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,390
So I studied with Paul for
almost 10 years and um,

288
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,190
finally cut the umbilical cord and the
early nineties and started painting on my

289
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:10,380
own in a studio in Concord,
Massachusetts.

290
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,730
And I enjoy doing portraits
of kids, children. I've also,

291
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:19,350
because they have nice round form
and their faces and I love that. Um,

292
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,180
I also liked doing landscapes.

293
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:25,860
This is a painting of the Minuteman
statue with the Northbridge and conquered.

294
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,680
Okay.

295
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,680
But my passion is flowers
and in particular pns,

296
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,350
um,

297
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:39,350
what I love about them are the round
shapes and just like the figures with the

298
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:43,890
white dresses and the earlier
paintings that you saw, I get,

299
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,940
I'm very excited by all of the colors
that I see in the halftones between the

300
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,700
lights and the shadows.
So these white p and A's have an infinite,

301
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,640
infinite variety of color
in those half tones.

302
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:05,110
I also love the variety of shapes
in the pns and colors and sizes.

303
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,860
And here I also am painting hydrangeas.
Those are all so fun to paint

304
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,510
and most of all for me,

305
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:17,710
pianists have a real life force about
the mine titled this painting. She,

306
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:21,390
because the challenge for
me is to get the life, the,

307
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,000
the essence of these p and ls.
And um,

308
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,620
so I that was a,
this is she for that reason.

309
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,750
Okay.

310
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,850
So I want to explain to you,

311
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,320
show you how I actually set up a design,

312
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:43,180
make an arrangement and um, and then, uh,

313
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,010
decide until it's until I'm satisfied
with it. Because as Benson said,

314
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,810
design makes the picture good.

315
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:52,960
Painting can never save a picture
of the composition as bad.

316
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,363
Okay.

317
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,880
So in this set up,

318
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:59,120
I was interested in getting what's
called a cure Schiro effect. I,

319
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:03,860
I was interested in a very dark
background with a bright flowers,

320
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,060
um, uh, shining out, uh,
with a lot of light on them.

321
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,020
The problem with this though is I sat
with it for a few days was that there

322
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:16,130
really wasn't a good, powerful center of
interest. Everything was pretty similar.

323
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,740
So there are a lot of little flux
here and, and not particularly, um,

324
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,950
catching eye catching.

325
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,520
So I added in some white panties for
interest and started playing around with

326
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:33,200
these. But the problem here was that they
were too spotty. So I've got one here,

327
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,400
one here,
one here,

328
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,940
and I'm not really interested in
sort of into it individual panties.

329
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:40,820
I'm interested in massing them together
and seeing what they do as a big

330
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:41,870
abstract shape.

331
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,650
Yeah.

332
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,220
So I started doing that and trying to
get something interesting and notice also

333
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,640
that I'm starting to play around
with the background flowers.

334
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,320
Make those

335
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,500
okay.

336
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,010
Harmonized with the, um,
with the center of interest.

337
00:20:58,011 --> 00:21:01,040
Because you want your
background to accentuate it,

338
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,220
but you don't want it to take
away from the center of interest.

339
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,480
It's Paul used to say,

340
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:10,220
you don't want something in the backstage
to be jumping out saying, look at me,

341
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:11,054
look at me.

342
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,300
So you're interested in a center of
interest that's complemented by the

343
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:15,134
background.

344
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,170
So I'm continuing for a few days.
This was interesting,

345
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,110
but it was a little too symmetrical here.

346
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:25,840
Okay,

347
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,480
now I'm getting a little bit closer.

348
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,710
Yeah.

349
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,360
And finally, this is the finished
painting that I, that I, um,

350
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,080
was happy with them. The design. There's
some interesting negative shapes.

351
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,300
There's an interesting massive light here,

352
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,080
a movement or just you're
among the flowers that's um,

353
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,730
that's uh,

354
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,030
accentuated by the background and
then also notes of red and it's,

355
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,100
it's predominantly a
yellow and blue painting.

356
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:58,130
And I consider the green to
be part of the yellow family.

357
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,030
And then I've added some for interests,
some coral notes here.

358
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,130
So now I'll show you start to
finish how actually do a painting.

359
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,200
And this is another set up
in my studio. Um, and, uh,

360
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,310
the canvas,
as you can see,

361
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:17,360
a side by side and I'm standing fairly
far back in order to see the whole thing

362
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:21,290
at once.
So these would be my first marks really.

363
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:26,291
This is like maybe the first 20 minutes
of working with a very large brush and a

364
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:27,800
very blurred I,

365
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:32,801
because I'm looking to see the big
abstractions of light as it falls across

366
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:34,400
this,
um,

367
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,480
set up and also the biggest
color values that I can find.

368
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,890
So this is sort of the approximate
color and value of the lightest area,

369
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:48,830
which would be the P and A's.
And then this is the background,

370
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,830
the dark notes around it.
Actually, this is the background.

371
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:53,000
This is the dark shadow.

372
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,420
So what I'm trying to get them
approximately the right place.

373
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,250
This is now I'm getting more
of the lay in, it's called.

374
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:03,510
So this would be the first,

375
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:07,410
probably 30 minutes or one
hour of doing this painting.

376
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Again, big abstractions of light and
shadows. I'm not painting objects, um,

377
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,350
painting, um, masses of lights.

378
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:21,351
So for that reason you can see that
there's a law one edge on one side of the

379
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:25,950
flower that I'm, that I'm starting to, um,

380
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,440
delineate.
There we go.

381
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,040
And what I'm interested in here is how
that edge dissolves into the dark shadow

382
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:38,340
along the vase and where that is an
approximate relation to the edge of the

383
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:42,510
canvas. So I'm continuing to
search for my light masses.

384
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:48,050
I'm letting tones dissolve the
background that are called half tones.

385
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:52,490
I'm looking for the leading edge.
These would be the hour baskets called.

386
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,290
There are no lines in nature,
so I don't paint around anything.

387
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,880
I'm just painting edges and the
variety of edges that my eyes sees.

388
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,080
And also you might notice that I've
only painted the left side of this vase

389
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,250
because for compositional reasons that
was very important to me. For one thing,

390
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,290
the shadow dissolves into this shadow,

391
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:17,291
but also the arm here has a
relationship to the arc of this,

392
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,700
um,
flower up here and through this shadow.

393
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,770
This was very important
to me in the design.

394
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:26,771
And I want to make sure that I've
got this fairly well delineated,

395
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,900
delineated at an early stage of
the painting. And then there's a,

396
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,860
there's sort of a secondary
line or movement here.

397
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,770
So, um, and this would be
the, what's called the s, uh,

398
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,750
the big look for the start.
At this point,

399
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:45,620
I've got everything going pretty well.
Um,

400
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,910
I've got the visual orders, so
the, the areas that are, um,

401
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,320
that jump out at your eye when you
blur your eyes also come forth and,

402
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:59,321
or come forward on the canvas and areas
that dissolve recede on the canvas.

403
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,110
So it's, it's what my eye
sees when I blur it. Um, very,

404
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,430
uh, uh, with a very blurred,
I, I'm also looking for,

405
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,870
for shifts, shifts of value, and also
shifts of color. So I'm looking for rare.

406
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:16,550
My read, my, um, I'm sorry,

407
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:20,150
my yellows dissolve into bluenotes and um,

408
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,500
just color shifts all over here.
Also,

409
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,390
it has the appearance of,
of images coming out of a fog,

410
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:32,750
which is, um, also that
lost and found look.

411
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,180
So the rest will be refinements.

412
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:39,230
So I'll go area by area
now and start painting.

413
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:45,260
Uh, the, the, um, top
left here was one area.

414
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:47,030
So again,
I'm not painting objects,

415
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:50,060
I'm painting areas of
light and shadow and how,

416
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,390
where are they dissolve into one another.
Uh,

417
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,260
this is also when I'm
working area by area.

418
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,420
I'm working in the way that we call
painting from the back straggler.

419
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,370
So if you can imagine a shepherd who's
hurting a flock of sheep from one pasture

420
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:11,480
to the next, he moves that big
flock of sheep, sheep belong,

421
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,800
but he might have a small group that
sort of lagging behind and those are his

422
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:16,521
back stragglers.

423
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:20,330
So he goes and he pulls those flock of
sheep forward and then another flock of

424
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:24,140
sheep will lag behind. So we're
painting from the back straggler here.

425
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,080
And in this case, as you, you're,

426
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:31,010
you're trying to get the whole
ensemble moving pretty much at once,

427
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:32,860
but obviously you have
to paint area by area.

428
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:34,760
You can't paint the whole
painting all at one time.

429
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,440
So the back straggler for me would be
this bottom right hand area and that's

430
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:43,620
what I would have painted
the, uh, probably the next,
after I painted this area,

431
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:45,210
I would have gone and
painted in this area.

432
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,820
So I'm always also pushing
the light effect here.

433
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,420
Okay.

434
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,550
Looking for big colors shifts.
And um,

435
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,090
at this point everything is,

436
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:02,100
is pretty well defined and
I'm fairly happy with it,

437
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:07,101
but it doesn't have the harmony or the
unity of the setup of the concept that

438
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,340
I'm looking for. And it's important to
understand. We're not copping simply,

439
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:14,700
blindly copying nature.
We're looking for something bigger,

440
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:17,010
that breadth that I was
talking about earlier.

441
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,350
So I'm working day to day, pulling
back, looking for the biggest,

442
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,800
biggest relationships I can see with a
big blurred I with these hydrangeas and

443
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,170
how they relate to the whole ensemble.

444
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:31,990
Okay.

445
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,370
I often use a mirror,

446
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,640
which I look at upside down because it
reverses everything backwards and upside

447
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,560
down and it helps me see
what the very fresh eye,

448
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:43,760
okay.

449
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,350
So this was my finished painting and I
couldn't find any more back stragglers

450
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:48,591
here.

451
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:53,591
It has the harmony that I was
looking for and the big look,

452
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:58,841
it also has the vibrancy and the
lights and the shadows and um,

453
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,480
unity, strong light effect,
magical color relationships,

454
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:07,190
all very important in this painting.

455
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,203
Okay.

456
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,960
So I wanted to,
um,

457
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,020
okay,

458
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,670
just tell you a little bit about,

459
00:28:15,671 --> 00:28:19,840
you can see a lot of the early Boston
school paintings at the Museum of Fine

460
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,970
Arts and Contemporary
Boston school painters. Uh,

461
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,630
a number of us are members of
the guild of Boston artists,

462
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:29,620
which was founded by Tarbell and Benson
and decamp and the early Boston school

463
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:34,100
painters. It's a nonprofit
gallery on Newbury street. And uh,

464
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,880
continues today. We just celebrated
our hundredth anniversary. So I'm,

465
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:43,890
this is actually a photo of the gallery
in 1914 for the inaugural exhibition.

466
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:45,610
And the gallery is still there.

467
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:49,540
This mantle is still there and now
they're paintings of contemporary Boston

468
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:54,340
school and also other wonderful painters
painting in a different traditions,

469
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:58,270
tonal list, uh, Hudson River
school, some fabulous painters.

470
00:28:58,271 --> 00:29:03,271
So encourage you to take a look at the
gallery and see these paintings for

471
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:08,170
yourself. Some of the, uh, just a few
of those painters are Mary Menifee,

472
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:12,310
his wonderful portrait painter,
and also does beautiful still lives.

473
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,400
Okay.

474
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,140
David Curtis, who's also a
student of Ives gamble, uh,

475
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,360
like my teacher and he paints
wonderful. Still lifes, I'm sorry,

476
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:22,610
landscapes on the north shore.

477
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:23,990
Okay.

478
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,580
Anita Johnson who paints all kinds of
figurative work as well as I'm still

479
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:29,414
alive.

480
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay.

481
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,400
And Pamela Penn, Dell who was, um,

482
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,910
a student of Robert Hunter's and
um, does a number of different, uh,

483
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,250
paintings as well as sculpture and
beautiful drawings as you can see here.

484
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,583
Okay.

485
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,720
So, um, thank you very much. Also,

486
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:51,721
I appreciate being able to use the images
from the art renewal center and I'll

487
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:53,140
take any questions that you have.

488
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,390
Okay.

489
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,830
That was great. Thank
you. Um, I'm curious, oh,

490
00:29:57,831 --> 00:30:01,610
give him the longevity
of the Boston school.

491
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:06,611
Is there any obligation on the part of
you as a student or other students to go

492
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,040
out and become teachers on your own?

493
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,270
Yes, I absolutely, I'm,

494
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm deeply appreciative of Pauling son
because he is passing this on and there

495
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:23,130
are other teachers,
other people teaching this.

496
00:30:23,131 --> 00:30:25,950
I'm actually throughout the country.
Um,

497
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,430
but I think we as students do
have an obligation to pass it on.

498
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:33,750
And I do some teaching myself. Merry men
of fee also teaches David Curtis stages.

499
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:36,340
So there are a number of us who were,

500
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,680
I'm endeavoring to pass
this very valuable painting,

501
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:43,320
traditional one to the next generation.

502
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,600
So if there are no more questions,
I thank you all for coming today.

503
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:50,460
Yeah.
