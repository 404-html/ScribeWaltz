1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,710
Hi everyone. Good afternoon. My name
is Katie Gray and I work at the uh,

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,140
presentation design from Duarte were where
these ladies lead and I actually used

3
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:15,590
to work at Google so it's exciting to be
back here and I'm honored to introduce

4
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:19,850
them. Um, so Nancy Duarte,
she's a CEO of Duarte.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,510
It's a firm that's created over a quarter
of a million presentations over the

6
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,490
past 28 years in Silicon Valley.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,990
And Nancy has written five best selling
books about using visual storytelling in

8
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:32,960
business communications,
including resonate and slide ology.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,930
And the latest book aluminate,
which she'll be talking about today.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,770
Her work has been featured in fortune
wire, the Wall Street Journal,

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,780
New York Times, many, many other places.

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,250
And then Patti Sanchez is the
chief strategy officer of Duarte.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,280
She has over 25 years of
experience leading transformative
marketing initiatives

14
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:56,060
for global brands like Adobe,
Cisco, Ericsson, Nike, Vm ware, Ge,

15
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:56,894
and many more.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,950
And her lifelong passion is helping
communicators engage empathetically and

17
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:05,570
authentically. So Nancy and
Patty are going to speak to
you about their new book,

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,280
illuminate, ignite change
through speeches, stories,
ceremonies, and symbols.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,230
If any of you have tried to convince
a group of people to go on a long,

20
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:18,200
arduous journey somewhere,
even though you knew it was worth it,

21
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,500
but you had to convince them,
then this book is for you. Uh,

22
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,620
the book is a result of
years of research into many,

23
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:29,330
many business case studies from the
likes of Steve Jobs or Mary Barra or Lou

24
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,250
Gerstner, uh, at IBM. And
it's very informative. Um, I
think were very much enjoy it.

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,070
And today you're going to hear about
some key principles in that book to help

26
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:40,130
you lead people to a vision.
So with that,

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,710
I'd like to welcome Nancy
Duarte and Patti Sanchez.

28
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,000
Thanks Katie.
Katie Gray.

29
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,460
I love working with her and
I also love talking, right?

30
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,490
So she might know, I love talking
about storytelling. As Katie said,

31
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,010
we're big fans of visual
storytelling at Duarte.

32
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,870
And I assume that you're all fans of it
to some degree, which is why you're here.

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,850
And a lot of people recognize the power
of storytelling as a communication tool,

34
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:10,290
especially for marketers.

35
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,580
A lot of brands use storytelling to
create affection for their products and to

36
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:17,940
get people to fall in love with their
companies and the things that they offer.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,900
But what a lot of people maybe don't
realize is that storytelling is actually a

38
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:22,860
leadership tool.

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,260
And so we're going to talk to you today
about how leaders and people like you

40
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,470
can use storytelling to inspire
others to do big things.

41
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,170
And really we think that the job of
a leader is to create the future.

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,080
So what does that really
mean? Well, first of all,

43
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:44,190
I think it's the difference between a
manager and a leader is that a manager is

44
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:48,420
somebody who maintains what is,
they just keep the current thing going.

45
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,300
A leader is somebody who
creates what could be,

46
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,340
they make something new possible that
didn't exist before and it's not an easy

47
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:58,770
thing to do to create something new.

48
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,180
And you may not even think
of yourself as a leader,

49
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,660
but if you're doing anything
that makes a new future possible,

50
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:06,550
then you are a leader.
Your,

51
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:10,120
your taking people into a territory
that they've never been in before,

52
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,140
which can be creating a new feature
in launching it to the world.

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,050
It can be building a process of some kind.

54
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:19,960
It can be a hiring or training people.

55
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,770
All of those things create a capability
that didn't exist before to make

56
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:27,700
something new.
The challenges that,

57
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:32,380
that new future you're trying to bring
into being actually represents change

58
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,370
because you're envisioning
something that didn't yet exist.

59
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,640
You're going to have to get other people
to agree that this new thing is a good

60
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,730
idea and to get them to
help you make it a reality.

61
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,010
And that's not easy because most
people don't like change. Uh, you know,

62
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,740
some of you might actually be
kind of comfortable with change,

63
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:54,750
especially if you have an entrepreneurial
kind of spirit. So then maybe the,

64
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,410
the white space excites you that the
average human being is frightened by that.

65
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,550
They're frightened by the unknown
because it requires them to do things,

66
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,880
to learn things that they don't
understand and that stretchy.

67
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,660
And so whenever you introduce a new idea,

68
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:13,450
you're effectively asking people to do
something differently than what they've

69
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,870
done before. And most people are
going to resist that in some way.

70
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,010
And it may not even look like
outright a revolt to you.

71
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,160
It might just sound like doubt.
They might say,

72
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,640
how do we know that the best idea or
how do we know it's better than the way

73
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,530
things happen right now?

74
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,490
Or maybe the way we used to do things
was the right way to do things.

75
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:40,390
And all of those are signs that
they're going to resist this change.

76
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,860
And so if you have an idea and you want
to motivate people to help you make that

77
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:45,730
idea reality,

78
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:49,840
you actually have to have a plan for
how you're going to lead them on what we

79
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,540
call a venture of venture into the future.

80
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,110
So venture is an interesting
word because it has two meanings,

81
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,670
especially in Silicon Valley.

82
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:00,580
A lot of people think of a venture is
sort of like a startup. You know, you're,

83
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,780
it's a noun that means it's a new thing.
But adventure is also a verb.

84
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,450
It's actually the act of going somewhere.

85
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,810
And it's also sort of like metaphorically
and adventure and expedition into a

86
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,000
territory that people
haven't been in before.

87
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,710
So if you think about traveling to
a place you've never been to before,

88
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,240
what is helpful?

89
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,260
It's often helpful to have a map some
way to visually understand where you are

90
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,050
and where you need to go and what
the path might be between them.

91
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,540
So what is a map of a venture into the
future potentially look like what we

92
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,840
think there's a common symbol in business
that actually describes what this

93
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,450
journey looks like and it's
the s curve of innovation.

94
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,470
And what it does is it describes the
life cycle of a business or have an idea

95
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,090
from its beginning to its end from it
start to its growth to its maturity.

96
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,010
And the challenge is that when that idea
or the organization that's created that

97
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,980
reaches maturity,
then stagnation sets in.

98
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,220
Because as I said,
people don't like change.

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,530
So they're going to kind of
like dig in their heels and say,

100
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:10,010
let's just enjoy the way things are.
Like now that we've got it working,

101
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:11,330
let's just ride us.

102
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,230
But if you don't evolve,

103
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:18,050
if that idea doesn't
continue to grow and evolve,

104
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:22,850
then that stagnation can lead to decline
or even death, this downward slide.

105
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,340
So it's the job of a leader to imagine
another future and lead another venture

106
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,880
to go there and to do it
again and to do it again.

107
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,010
Because for organizations
and even people to thrive,

108
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,410
they have to constantly
reinvent themselves.

109
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,330
So what leaders have to do is figure
out how to bring people along with them.

110
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,720
And we've worked with all kinds of leaders
in our years of consulting at Duarte

111
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,220
and, and, and before that.

112
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,600
And we've studied what the
greatest leaders do to bring
people along with them.

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,790
And we found that they're
all great communicators,

114
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,530
but they also use specific kinds of
communication tools to bring people along

115
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:05,420
with them. So we're going to
talk a little bit about those.

116
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,940
This is what we consider the toolkit
that great leaders use to bring people

117
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:14,930
along with them on that venture into the
future. The first is telling stories.

118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,220
They also deliver speeches
and they hold ceremonies.

119
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,160
So stories are a great communication
tool because they engage people,

120
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,510
they make us feel something.
If you watch a really interesting movie,

121
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:33,750
you know that you get caught up in it and
you have all the fields, you know the,

122
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:35,990
the joy and the pain and the fear.

123
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,050
And the same is true of stories
that we tell in our lives.

124
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,290
And that leaders can tell is a way to
create an emotional connection with the

125
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:48,350
people that they're talking to.
So they cause us to feel something.

126
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:51,330
And actually when I'm telling you a story,
uh,

127
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,250
my brainwaves actually start to align
with yours or yours align with mine

128
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:58,760
because I'm feeling we're feeling the
same thing together at the same time.

129
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,710
And that same connection happens between
the people who are all hearing the

130
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:04,491
story together.

131
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:09,491
So it's actually a way to unite groups
of people around a common experience.

132
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,900
Now, another reason why stories are
really powerful tool for leading people is

133
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:18,860
because stories are about change
fundamentally at their heart.

134
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,370
Any story is about a person who has to
go through a journey of some kind and

135
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,770
ultimately is transformed by it.

136
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,320
And that's really what a
definition of a story is.

137
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:32,210
And there's a lot of confusion out there.

138
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:36,080
A lot of people talking about story and
saying that they're storytellers, uh,

139
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,620
when we don't think they're necessarily
true stories that they're communicating.

140
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,470
So this is the definition
in its purest form of story.

141
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,220
It goes all the way back to Aristotle
and he said, a story has three parts.

142
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,710
It has a beginning,
a middle and enhance.

143
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,510
In the beginning we meet the likable hero.
This is the protagonist.

144
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,550
This is the person who's
just trying to do life.

145
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,930
And then something happens and
inciting incident, they call it, uh,

146
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,000
that the rows, that hero's world
off balance and usually, uh,

147
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,900
actually causes them to leave that place,
that home and go somewhere new.

148
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,710
And in the process of traveling from
what they know to this new territory,

149
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,700
they encounter all kinds of roadblocks.

150
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:21,060
In the middle of that story
because it's all new territory.

151
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,280
They might have to fight monsters or
aliens and they even are challenged to

152
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:31,620
their inner core and often end up
questioning who they are and what they're

153
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,680
capable of,
but ultimately at the end of the story,

154
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,690
through grit and determination,

155
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:40,620
the overcome those obstacles and they
come out the other side different

156
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,940
transformed.

157
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,050
So that's why stories are actually a
really powerful way to help people cope

158
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:49,440
with change because they described
the process of change itself.

159
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,700
Now there's another tool that
leaders use. Whoops. Before that,

160
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,060
this is actually the shape of a story
and what you can see here is that the

161
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:03,300
middle of the story is where all the
action happens. Literally action.

162
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,960
The rising action increases tension and
the falling action releases that tension

163
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,930
and it's that increase of tension and
the release of tension that keeps us

164
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:17,310
engaged in the story. It
creates contrast. Now,

165
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,880
as I was about to say, there's another
tool that leaders use to communicate,

166
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,440
and you probably recognize this.

167
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:25,590
You may do it yourself and not
realize that you're giving a speech.

168
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,630
But speeches are not just the big talks,
like the vision thing.

169
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,810
You know when when the leader stands up
in front of the organization and says,

170
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:38,790
this is where we're going this year,
uh, speech is also a progress update.

171
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,690
You know, here's where we
are in our project, here's
what we're going to do next.

172
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,310
A speech is also an announcement
about good news or bad news.

173
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,860
All of those are
opportunities not to just,

174
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,240
not just to inform people about
what's happening and what's next,

175
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:57,840
but also to inspire them and engage them.

176
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,470
Now we've studied also storytelling
principles and how they can be applied to

177
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,310
speeches.
And a few years ago,

178
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:10,311
Nancy made an incredible discovery that
there's a pattern to those speeches that

179
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,950
the greatest communicators give and so
she can do a better job of explaining it.

180
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:14,790
So I'm going to send her up.

181
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,860
So after spending about four
years studying storytelling,

182
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,820
I was wondering why some speeches
have this cadence and a rhythm to it.

183
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:26,880
It's like it builds tension and released
it and it would build tension and

184
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:28,590
release.
It was just you were drawn in.

185
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:34,050
So after doing a journey through story
and then going through the hundred top

186
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,520
best speeches of all time,

187
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,930
I actually found what that pattern is and
it is based in the tension and release

188
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:44,070
of storytelling. And so I want to
show you the shape that I discovered.

189
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,340
This is a structural shape over time.
I mean it has a beginning,

190
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:48,174
a middle and an end.

191
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,350
And that pulsing in the cadence is the
building of tension and releasing it from

192
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,460
storytelling.

193
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,030
Now this has a three act structure
just like a great story does.

194
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,370
So the beginning of any,
I'm going to say presentations,

195
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:03,220
but this works for any type of
communication work from email.

196
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,550
This could work for a blog post
and helps me get my husband to do

197
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,970
tours on the weekend. Like it
works. It persuades. Um, so, uh,

198
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,970
the beginning is you need to establish
what is and what you're doing is you're

199
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:19,300
basically, you're basically
saying, what's our shared truth?

200
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,820
This is what we all believe as true.
This is the state of the union.

201
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,530
This is the budget,
this is where we're at financially.

202
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:27,730
That's kind of what you do. And then
what happens is you insert what could be,

203
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,250
and this is like the
inciting incident in a story.

204
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,200
Suddenly your world is out of balance.

205
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:35,590
And that gap between what is and
what could be winds up being,

206
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:37,960
what gets resolved through
the rest of your talk.

207
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,100
The middle moves back and
forth structurally between
what is, what could be,

208
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:43,030
what is and what could be.

209
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:47,080
So the human brain is wired for contrast
and we can actually see the gap.

210
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:49,330
The audience can see, oh,
if that's what currently is,

211
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:51,560
but this is what could be
suddenly what is isn't.

212
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,250
It is an interesting and what
could be is more appealing.

213
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,370
So that's how it works
as a structural tool. Um,

214
00:12:57,371 --> 00:13:01,810
the last vertical line is the call to
action and every talk should have won,

215
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,140
but you shouldn't end there.
You should end with the new bliss.

216
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,400
This is you describing this future state
that's going to be amazing if everyone

217
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:13,180
adopts your idea. It's the
new bliss, the new norm.

218
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,350
So once I had this shape,
I've analyzed so many talks.

219
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:20,510
I want to just show you
some, I have, um, uh,

220
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,390
I've done a ted talk
that goes into detail,

221
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,620
but I just want to show
you some quickly, um, um,

222
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,220
because we've analyzed a ton of them.

223
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,120
So we have a Margaret Thatcher
in her iron lady speech.

224
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:34,900
You can see she starts off with
what is, she's pretty rapid. Um,

225
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,110
when she talked to parliament, it was
a kind of this one, one punch to punch.

226
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,060
Like what is, what could be, what
is what could be all the time.

227
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,390
So you can see she starts off with what
is and moves back and forth between what

228
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:48,220
is and what could be ending high end to
the right, stating the new bliss. Um,

229
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,820
Richard Fineman, very famous
caltech professor, um,

230
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:55,330
he was a physics professor and kids
would like run across campus to see his

231
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:58,630
class, even if they didn't need to take
it. He was known as the great explainer.

232
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,220
He did a law of gravity speech and
you could see it's a technical speech,

233
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:07,720
yet it moves really rapidly between
what is and what could be Steve Jobs,

234
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:12,240
iPhone launch speech. He has a
heightened sense of what could be, um,

235
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,330
in all of his speeches.

236
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:17,200
But it does move back and forth between
what is and what could be. And of course,

237
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,610
Dr King's very famous.

238
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:22,900
I have a dream speech also starts off
with what is moves back and forth.

239
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:26,050
And you can see the frequency. You get
really tight, about two thirds in, um,

240
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,360
that was his very famous,
I have a dream sequence.

241
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:31,120
I have a dream that one day
I have a dream that one day.

242
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,330
What's interesting is some of the
most beloved parts of our most beloved

243
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,350
speeches are the gap between what is
and what could be at the phrase level as

244
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:39,730
they move back and forth between.

245
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:42,730
I have a dream that one day he did not
call this the, I have a dream speech.

246
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,660
He actually called it the fierce urgency
of now that was the actual official

247
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:48,850
title.
The people named at the,

248
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:52,280
I have a dream speech because of this
very beloved. I'm sequence right here.

249
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,730
So those are pretty lofty people and
you're like, but I just work at Google.

250
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,310
I just had this thing I need to do. I'm
not driving the civil rights movements.

251
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,860
I'll bring it closer to home.
Using an example of a female,

252
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,450
and it's my 11 year old niece,

253
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,890
she wrote a letter to a dad because she
wanted a mouse now and then an 11 year

254
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:13,010
old mind. This is the most important
thing in her life right now.

255
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:17,300
So she writes an impassioned plea that
follows the form perfectly. She says,

256
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:21,290
Dear Dad, we want a mouse. And you might
say they're stinky, but they're not.

257
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,950
If you put special drops in their water,
you might say that they're mean,

258
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,800
but you rarely find an aggressive mouse.
If they do bite,

259
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:32,390
it's usually just a curiosity. Nebel I
know you will not want to pay for it.

260
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,220
Sophie and I have that covered.

261
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,870
We've saved our birthday money so we can
pay for the mouse and everything else

262
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,610
and you will not have
to pay a single cent.

263
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,870
Also the mouse will be
in Sophie's or my rooms.

264
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,180
You will not have to see it all the time.

265
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,790
And the new bliss is we will
respect any decision you make.

266
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,453
They got the mouse.

267
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,970
So you can see what's interesting to me
is it's almost like we are hardwired.

268
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,940
She's not seeing my book's
come to my workshop.

269
00:15:55,941 --> 00:16:00,080
I did not design this letter for her.
She wanted it so bad.

270
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:03,800
She used a persuasive story pattern
with the tension and release of story.

271
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,720
So it's amazing when you really need to
give an impassioned plea how important

272
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:09,554
that is.

273
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,920
So one of the third story based
concepts that we're introducing into the

274
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,610
business vernacular is the idea
of ceremonies and ceremonies.

275
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,690
Some of the oldest artifacts we can find
are actually artifacts that were used

276
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,130
in ritual because of a,

277
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,150
a group of people felt they needed
communal catharsis around their community.

278
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,000
And so it's also based in the same
three x structure. That story is.

279
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,100
But the naming conventions are different.

280
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,780
We looked at the rights of passage
because that is the most common in society

281
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:45,470
today. A marriage, a
graduation, a bar Mitzvah. Um,

282
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,560
but because we were both
married to Hispanic men,

283
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:53,030
we're going to use the Keaton Yada
as an example. And what that is is,

284
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:57,800
is when a young girl turns 15,
she goes through a rights of passage,

285
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:58,910
similar to a bar Mitzvah,

286
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,120
but she comes in a little flat shoes
and a drabby little dress and she's

287
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,230
carrying a Dolly.

288
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,560
So what she's doing is she's actually
going to be separating from that version

289
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:13,790
of her identity. She goes through
a ceremony and she transitions.

290
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,420
The minute the ceremony is done,
suddenly she's a woman. Okay?

291
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,100
So she gets rid of her doll, she gets to
wear high heels, puts on a little Tiara,

292
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,070
and she's a woman. Now, all that
happened was three minutes of time.

293
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,490
She went from being a little girl and
suddenly she's a woman just because of the

294
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:32,360
ceremony of ceremonies. What they do
is they mark endings and beginnings.

295
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,100
This is over.
I'm not a little girl.

296
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:37,100
I've let go of my girlish
things and I am a woman now,

297
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,440
we'll corporations need to practice
the concept of endings and beginnings

298
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,270
because when you're trying to transform
a collective consciousness of people,

299
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:50,220
there are things that end and
there are things that begin again,

300
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,750
it's very important to understand endings
and beginnings and the power that they

301
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:58,890
hold. If people can let go of the old,
they're more willing to embrace the new.

302
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,050
And we have a case study
in a minute about that.

303
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:06,051
So this is the basic toolkit
that communicators need
as you're driving your own

304
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:10,800
teams. And I'll bring a patty
back up here again to talk about

305
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,190
how to do that. Yeah, she
has, I lose my shoe. Well,

306
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,720
that toolkit that Nancy,
uh,

307
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,310
recap just there is what we
call a torch bearers toolkit.

308
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,200
And the reason we use the word torchbearer
is because it's the job of a leader

309
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:30,920
to eliminate the path between the
present and the future. You know, again,

310
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:34,370
when you think about this metaphorically
as an expedition to a place people have

311
00:18:34,371 --> 00:18:38,180
never been to before, into the
unknown, uh, metaphorically,

312
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:42,320
that unknown is sort of a dark and scary
place to people. Or at least it's foggy.

313
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,220
It's hard for them to visualize it and
to understand it and feel safe going

314
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:46,910
there.

315
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,910
So through effective communication leaders
of basically like that path so that

316
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:54,950
people can see where they need
to go and how to get there.

317
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,350
And if leaders communicate really well,
they create moments that move people,

318
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,380
moments that make people feel bigger
and more capable than they realize that

319
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:09,620
they were the create the capacity for
people to do things that they didn't

320
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:13,760
realize they could do.
But the bigger your idea is,

321
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,640
the more change you're
going to ask people to make.

322
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,610
And the more change
you ask people to make,

323
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,020
the more you're going to have to
persuade them to actually go there.

324
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,280
Which means you're going to have to
communicate over and over and over because

325
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,680
transformational change
doesn't happen overnight,

326
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,050
but it's going to take
is actually a movement.

327
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,550
And what is a movement anyway?
You know, what movement is, is uh,

328
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,570
a massive group of people
going somewhere together,

329
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:44,300
usually over a long period of time.
It can be weeks,

330
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,330
but often it's months or
years or even decades.

331
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,940
And we've had many leaders say to us,

332
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:52,010
they wanted to create
movements around their ideas.

333
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:56,840
And that launched us on this quest to
understand how movements actually happened

334
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:58,040
and what they really look like.

335
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,530
And so as we mapped the
forms that communication can
take the shape of a story,

336
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:07,460
the shape of a speech, we wondered is
there actually a shape to a movement too?

337
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,870
And we studied business
movements like an open source.

338
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,090
We studied social movements like civil
rights and we looked at all the things

339
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,670
that leaders did,
all the communication that they gave and,

340
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,770
and how that unfolded over time.

341
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:26,030
And we discovered that they do actually
follow a shape which is magically the s

342
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:27,020
curve of innovation,

343
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:31,760
which is basically mapping the path
between what is the present state and what

344
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,110
could be,
which is the future.

345
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,730
But we also discovered that those
movements follow a story structure too.

346
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,730
Just like the communication
that you use to move people,

347
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,110
and so this is that story structure of a
movement which we call a venture escape.

348
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:48,610
It's that landscape of the venture
into the, so it has three acts,

349
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:53,380
just like a story with five stages in the
first act or the dream and leap stages,

350
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,770
dream happens when you the leader,

351
00:20:56,771 --> 00:21:00,190
whoever's the advocate for an
idea declares the vision. You say,

352
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:04,480
this is what I see, this is where
I want us to go. Let's go there.

353
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,850
But immediately as soon as
you communicate that vision,

354
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:11,710
people are faced with a choice about
whether they're going to say, yes, I'm in,

355
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,320
or whether they're going to say no,
I'm out.

356
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,260
So they have a choice to commit or resist.

357
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,480
And how well you communicate directly
affects how likely they are to say yes.

358
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,650
And when they do say yes,
when they leap into this venture with you,

359
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:30,280
then the middle of the story
starts to unfold in the middle.

360
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,270
Just like in a great story that you might
see in a movie is where all the action

361
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:36,820
happens and translated in real life.

362
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:41,410
That means where all the
hard stuff happens because
in the middle are the fight

363
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:44,980
and climb stages.
The fight is when you're,

364
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,410
anybody is trying to bring
that idea to reality.

365
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,570
The status quo rises up against it.

366
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,810
Anybody who's defending the way things
are and the fact that they should stay

367
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,090
the same is going to put up resistance.

368
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,490
And so people have to
overcome those obstacles.

369
00:21:57,491 --> 00:22:00,310
They have to fight that
internal inertia or the external

370
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,340
criticism of this idea. But every time
that you overcome one of those obstacles,

371
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:08,980
they gain a little more ground.
They climb a little closer,

372
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,420
get a little closer to that end goal.
And the middle is really the hard part.

373
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,920
It's where people are tested.

374
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:19,120
Just like in a story that hero comes to
question whether they have the stuff to

375
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:23,560
continue and how well you communicate
will determine whether they think they can

376
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:28,000
finish. And that's when the third
act of the story comes to an end,

377
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,590
which is the arrived stage.

378
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,620
The arrived stage is where you achieve
your goal or at least you conclude that

379
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:38,740
effort and it could be a happy
ending like in the movies,

380
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,550
but most likely it won't
be perfectly happy.

381
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,710
You might fall short of
your goal a little bit.

382
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,800
You might not achieve what you thought
you would, it might change shape,

383
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,760
but at that point in the journey,
it's important to look back to say,

384
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,530
what did we actually accomplish?

385
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,010
Where did we fall short and how do we
avoid those mistakes in the future?

386
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,430
Also, you have to communicate frequently
throughout this process and your

387
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:07,180
communication has to take on a different
flavor depending on the stage of the

388
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:10,060
journey that you're in because people
have different emotional needs at each

389
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:14,110
stage. In the beginning of the
journey, that first stage in dream,

390
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:18,400
what they need is a moment of inspiration.
They need to believe in that idea.

391
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,450
They need to be able to imagine themselves
in that future and long to go there.

392
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,130
In the leap stage, what they really
need is a moment of decision.

393
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,360
They need help choosing whether
to say yes or whether to say no,

394
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:35,410
and hopefully they'll say yes.
The fight stage is a moment of bravery.

395
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,580
That's when people need to be reminded
that they're capable of overcoming those

396
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:41,500
obstacles.
To feel courageous,

397
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,090
willing to risk anything to fight
to make your idea a reality.

398
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,830
The climb stage,

399
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,930
which is kind of a misnomer because it
can be a very long drawn out process of

400
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:57,740
getting closer to the goal. And what
people really need then is endurance.

401
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,550
They need to be reminded that they have
reserves deep inside of themselves that

402
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:06,080
they can call upon so that
they can overcome, keep
going, and ultimately finish.

403
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,560
And in the end, what people
need is a moment of reflection.

404
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,020
This is a time to stop,

405
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,910
to catch your breath before you
rush off to the next initiative, to,

406
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,700
to tell the stories of
what you just went through,

407
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,530
to celebrate them or to more the endings
before they start the next journey.

408
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,180
So I want to tell you about one leader
that I think did this really well in his

409
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:32,170
name, may not be familiar to
you. Um, but it's, it's, uh,

410
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,510
I have a lot of affection for him.
His name is Ray Anderson,

411
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:39,920
and he was the CEO and founder of a
company called interface interface was

412
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:44,300
founded in the 1970s when ray had this
idea that it was kind of crazy at the

413
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:46,580
time to create carpet tiles,

414
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:50,360
basically take big rolls of carpet and
cut them up into squares because he

415
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:51,230
thought it was a good idea.

416
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,710
And so he convinced a few investors to
give him some money and he started this

417
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:58,340
business and it turned out to be the
right idea at the right time because the

418
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,050
office environments we're changing.

419
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,810
And so this modular carpeting
was a really good concept.

420
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,470
And so he grew that business
like gangbusters for 20 years.

421
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,740
It became the world's largest supplier
of carpet tiles and he was making money

422
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,500
hand over fist,
a self made millionaire.

423
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,860
And everything was great until the 1990s
when everybody started to wake up to

424
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,100
the climate problem,
the environmental problems that the,

425
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,870
that we were all experiencing.
And they were starting to, uh,

426
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,910
criticize industrial businesses who
they believed were causing the problems.

427
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,570
And so customers even started asking, Ray,
what are you doing for the environment?

428
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,350
And he was really troubled by the question
because he couldn't answer it is only

429
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:40,520
answer was, I'm just trying to stay out
of jail, which is not a good strategy.

430
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,630
So coincidentally an employee
sent them a copy of this book,

431
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:48,590
the Ecology of Commerce by Paul Hawkin,
one of the founders of Smith and Hawken.

432
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:52,010
And so ray devoured this book looking
for an answer to that question.

433
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,390
And what he saw was this,

434
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,740
you said he convicted me as
a plunderer of the earth,

435
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,930
which is a horrible thing to hear,
especially for a founder. He said,

436
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:04,910
I built this company that
is plundering the earth.

437
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,920
And he said it hit him
like a spear in the chest.

438
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,030
He would tell people that story over
and over about the epiphany that he had.

439
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:14,900
And he was compelled to come up
with a new dream for his company.

440
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,450
And this is how he articulated it.
He said,

441
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,750
what if interface became the first
industrial company in the world to achieve

442
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,620
sustainability?

443
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,030
And he used to story metaphorical journey
of climbing a mountain taller than

444
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:30,830
Everest to describe this vision. And he
always drew this picture to depict it.

445
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:34,220
And he would use that over and over in
his communications to help people really

446
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:37,400
understand and imagine
themselves achieving that goal.

447
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,390
He knew it was going to take a
lot of work to make that happen.

448
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,970
So he called all of his leaders
together for an offsite in Maui, Hawaii,

449
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,570
and he asked Paul Hawkin to
actually give the keynote.

450
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,500
So Paul Hawkin stood up and he talked
about all the problems that were affecting

451
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:52,981
the planet,

452
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:57,981
but also all the things that individuals
can do this global village to turn

453
00:26:58,141 --> 00:26:59,700
things around and make a difference.

454
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,810
And then ray got up and spoke and he
asked every single one of his leaders to

455
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:07,050
make a personal commitment
to do something different,

456
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,890
to put the environment back in balance.
But he didn't just ask them,

457
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:15,570
he asks them to demonstrate
that commitment in front
of everybody right then and

458
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:19,920
there. So they all wrote pledges on cards
that they pinned up next to photos of

459
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:24,630
themselves on what they called a
personal legacy wall. It was a ceremony,

460
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,130
a pledging commitment to change.
And after that ceremony,

461
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:30,330
the leaders were galvanized.

462
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,420
They raced forward and they kicked off
all kinds of initiatives across the

463
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:37,620
company to do things differently to
transform the way they did business.

464
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,950
And over the next 20 years
they really changed everything,

465
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,330
top to bottom in the company,

466
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:45,720
everything about how they operated and
they also transformed their industry.

467
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,360
So why do I tell you this story about
Ray Anderson? A couple of reasons. One,

468
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:54,630
because he's an entrepreneur, somebody
who made something out of nothing.

469
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,320
And I think that's really inspiring too
because he put his entire business and

470
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:00,450
service of a purpose greater than profit,

471
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,140
which I also also think is
really inspiring. But three,

472
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:07,290
because he was a leader who understood
the power of communication and

473
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:11,010
storytelling and used it to motivate
people to do really big things.

474
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,660
He's not the only one.

475
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,300
There are a lot of leaders who did this
really well and so Nancy is going to

476
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:17,980
tell you about one more.
So I want to do a quick cut.

477
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,270
Hey, I'm about apple. As
you guys know, I'm Steve.

478
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:23,610
Jobs was kicked out of his own company,

479
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,750
went away for 10 years and
built a different company
with a different operating

480
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:32,310
system, but in the time that Mr jobs was
gone from apple, apple had no strategy.

481
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,540
They tried a few times to create
an operating system and failed,

482
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,370
so they had to go outside of apple,

483
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,260
look to buy an operating system they
bought next and with next came Mr. Jobs,

484
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,950
the very first time Mr job spoke,
even though it was a broad audience,

485
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:49,530
it was not at a developers conference.
If there were news was there,

486
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:50,364
it was a Mac world.

487
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,640
He spoke as if it was only talking
to the developers in the room.

488
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:54,690
He had 20 minutes in.

489
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:59,160
He used the word developer 27 times
because he knew the developers had to move

490
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:04,140
from Mac os nine to Mac os 10 or the whole
company would fail. It was huge. Nope.

491
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,100
Gilamelio spoke for three hours and he
said the word developer three times.

492
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,020
No wonder he wasn't the right guy to lead.

493
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,910
Did you gotta realize apple wasn't
a complete crisis at this time? Um,

494
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,990
the developers were very,

495
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:18,750
very skeptical cause they had
been jerked around for a decade.

496
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:21,300
They do a build in the next year
they find out everything was wasted.

497
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,450
They do another build and it was
wasted. So very skeptical. In fact,

498
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:28,440
Mr Jobs did a talk actually called
Apple's hierarchy of skepticism.

499
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,190
We went through all the
steps of skepticism and where
the developers were in the

500
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:34,440
spectrum because they were that skeptical.

501
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,030
So what happened is 2001 a lot of
the developers still were not moving.

502
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,790
They were still not migrating
and he did a ceremony.

503
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,950
He stood up and he made a vow.

504
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:49,930
He unfurled and oversized
piece of parchment paper and
he made a verbal vow that

505
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,650
I will stick with one
operating system strategy.

506
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,400
Some of the developers hadn't
moved because they thought
that they were going to

507
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,820
keep jerking them around.

508
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,050
What happened that was kind of
interesting is in the middle of the climb,

509
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,940
a lot of times at the s curves overlap.

510
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:06,160
That's the time you need to
already be dreaming again.

511
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,820
So the developers are still moving.
A lot of them had come,

512
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:13,390
but some pretty big ones had decided
to resist and decided not to come.

513
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:16,780
In the meantime, Mr Jobs had a new dream
he was already on, but the real dream,

514
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,200
he'd had this New Vision that the whole
world of connected devices would connect

515
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:25,000
to Mac os 10 it was called
this digital hub strategy.

516
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,590
If you go and you look at this speech,

517
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:31,270
he'd basically prophesied their entire
hardware strategy for the next decade.

518
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,470
It was a big speech, so it was a dream.
So of course he's losing his patients.

519
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:35,830
He's like,

520
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:40,540
get on to 10 get on to 10
but he keeps telling me,

521
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,070
get on to 10 I've got this new dream.
Oh my God,

522
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:44,560
you're not gonna believe what the world
is going to look like. So he decides,

523
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:45,990
you know what,
we need to bury the old OSTP.

524
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,460
We need to bury macro s nine
and he did exactly that.

525
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,150
He actually had a coffin and
smoke come up out of the stage,

526
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:55,030
stained glass up on the wall.
Erie music played.

527
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:57,820
He came out with an oversized a Macalester
nine you can see there to the right,

528
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,220
put it in the coffin, closed
the lid, put a red bows on it,

529
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,850
and he said a eulogy from [inaudible].
He said,

530
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:07,170
we are here today to mourn the passing
of macro s nine he is now in that great

531
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:08,140
big luck it in the sky.

532
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:11,560
No doubt looking down upon us with that
same smile he displayed every time he

533
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:15,520
booted.
Mr Jobs never mentioned Mac os nine again.

534
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:20,020
After this day it was done in the
developers that they're there.

535
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,230
Like you could actually hear it
in the audio. They're like, Whoa,

536
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,020
like your response to laugh or when
they'll never forget it was over.

537
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:29,230
It was done. So this is a ceremony
of endings and beginnings. Move on.

538
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,950
He said language like the
train has left the station.

539
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,030
People are going to buy another brand.
Then your brand. He pushed them out.

540
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,410
Endings and beginnings. He pushed them
forward. Some got pushed out maybe,

541
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,820
but it is fun to be a leader myself.
Some of you might be like, well,

542
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:46,960
I'm not really a leader,

543
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:50,530
but I've had the privilege of being able
to kind of prophetically imagine my own

544
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,240
organization's future and then had kind
of the power and the autonomy to move it

545
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,980
into this new alternate future and one
things consistent is change itself.

546
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,680
I'm sure you've heard that,
but my own organization is 28 years old.

547
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,440
We are on our eighth reinvention.

548
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,820
That means we've reinvented
ourselves every four years,

549
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,480
which I think is fascinating because
the u s board of Labor and Statistics

550
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,990
states that small businesses
die between four and five years,

551
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,310
so it's almost like the life cycle of
just my own little unit of 120 people

552
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:22,870
actually needs to be rejuvenated
in about four year increments.

553
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,520
Now Google does that at a scale that
this isn't even messy enough to show you

554
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:32,260
guys have hundreds of venture scapes,
hundreds of them going on all the time,

555
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,880
which means every single one of you in
this room are either leading a venture

556
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:40,940
scape or you being impacted by someone
else that's leading a venture scape.

557
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,680
That means that there's a lot of other
travelers that need to come along with

558
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:47,060
you.
You have other people.

559
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,870
These ideas are not going to be realized
if you can't get others to come along

560
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:53,630
with you and make that dream a reality.

561
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,370
It's why learning to communicate well
is so critical and you're gonna have

562
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:01,280
moments all the time, all along the
way where there's a speech of story,

563
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:04,790
of ceremony, Bam, Bam, Bam. Every day a
speech, oh, I need to tell a story too.

564
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,050
I need to do a ceremony today.

565
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,170
You may have a one on one with one of
your direct reports who's encountered a

566
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:12,200
roadblock and you're like, oh,
I remember in when I did this.

567
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:15,560
Here's the story of how I overcame
that same roadblock. A speech.

568
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,750
You've got the vision meetings,
you've got the all hands meetings,

569
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:21,740
you've got your staff meeting speeches
all the time. And then there's ceremonies.

570
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,690
Oh my gosh,
we just launched this initiative.

571
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:27,440
Let's all sign the great poster that
was just made and make a commitment that

572
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:29,630
we're going to make this reality.
Those happen all day long.

573
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:35,530
But there's these other moments that
happen when the team may be missed it.

574
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,710
The team needs to heal.
The team needs to be galvanized,

575
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,120
they need to be rallied.

576
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:45,560
It's a bigger moment along all those
other moments where you need to create

577
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:47,000
collective effervescence,

578
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:52,060
this moment where the people are bound
to each other and bound to you and

579
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:56,300
recommitted to what you're asking them to
do. And those stand out among the rest.

580
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,390
And that's when you need to combine
the stories, the ceremonies,

581
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,950
and the speeches into a moment that
people will never forget because this is

582
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:06,890
when they actually recommit.
They're so exhausted, so beat up.

583
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:10,250
Sometimes they need a moment to decide,
is this worth it?

584
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,860
Can I keep going and do I
want to keep doing that?

585
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,760
So moving people is really hard.
Um,

586
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,630
just because maybe I have this skill
for seeing the future doesn't mean I've

587
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:23,810
always been really good at getting
people to go there. In fact,

588
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,110
I used to just at the vision
meeting every year at my company,

589
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:30,500
I would just make this epic declaration
of what needed to happen and then I

590
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,950
would check in with myself at the end of
the year and be disappointed sometimes,

591
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:37,100
mostly in my travelers if they didn't
make my dream come true that I told them

592
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:38,180
once,
you know,

593
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,950
and it's so weird to see how
hard it is to move people,

594
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,710
but I had to finally own, like I
thought it was like, well, why?

595
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:47,150
Why don't they want to do this?

596
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:51,170
Why are we not working together to make
this happen? And I had to realize, well,

597
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:55,700
maybe it's partly that
the sacrifice is huge.

598
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:56,690
I'm asking him to do.

599
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,620
I had not honored the fact that
maybe they had to spend more time,

600
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:01,820
they had to learn new skills,

601
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,910
the sacrifice they were going to have
to make to make this dream come true,

602
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,240
but also was I portraying it in a way
that made the risks seem worth the reward

603
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,470
to them?
Was the risk worth the reward?

604
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,310
Did I really think for a minute that
they're encountering these obstacles that

605
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:19,100
might be just too hard for
them and moving them is really,

606
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:23,330
really hard and it's empathy that
unlocks something inside of them.

607
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:27,620
So I don't, I don't and haven't
had that much empathy in my career.

608
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:30,680
I had to learn it. And if you look at
these two models we showed you today,

609
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:34,580
they're actually models for empathy so
the leader can actually think through and

610
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:37,280
see things from someone
else's perspective.

611
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,630
And I was actually raised by a narcissist
and a narcissist doesn't have the

612
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:43,560
empathy gene.

613
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:46,890
It's actually a mental illness where
the empathy gene is just vacant.

614
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,610
That means I didn't have
empathy modeled for me as a kid.

615
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,110
My mom never showed me what that means
to think and consider someone else's

616
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:55,944
perspective.

617
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,210
So my body of work is actually my own
personal journey at calling this thing

618
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:02,010
called empathy that was evasive to me.

619
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,220
It was gone and I couldn't
really grasp it or find it.

620
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,750
So I had to create models so I could see
things from other people's perspective.

621
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,980
And I have to confess,

622
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:15,210
I have opened my own book that I wrote
myself with Patty and I've had to look at

623
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:20,211
the model to do a couple of talks in my
own shop so that it works to consider

624
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:24,510
how somebody else may be perceiving
what you're asking them to do and then

625
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:27,510
communicate through that and
from that place. And you know,

626
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:30,660
what does storytelling that binds us
together. Everything you learned today,

627
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:32,730
all the models are based in storytelling.

628
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,660
And I can tell you that if you adopt
the concepts and principles of story,

629
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,280
your career will never be the same.

630
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,720
It is the very thing that will move you
from simply a manager to being a leader

631
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:47,310
is how you choose to communicate the
actions you're wanting others to take. On.

632
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,600
That's the sole difference. Like
Tati was saying, it's, it's a tool.

633
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:56,601
It's hardwired into our brains
to bind the teller to the heroes,

634
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,060
to the listener.
It binds us to each other.

635
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,360
Storytelling also connects
you with each other.

636
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:05,580
When you've experienced an amazing story,

637
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:10,020
you feel connected to each other and it
really changes the trajectory of where

638
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:12,180
you're going and how
quickly you can get there.

639
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,110
So if you think about the concept
of story being about transforming,

640
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:20,340
it creates longing. If people are
trying to change and get somewhere,

641
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,760
the journey's hard and its story,
that's the coping mechanism.

642
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:27,480
It's story that helps them recommit it's
story that makes them want to continue

643
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:30,870
to build the future you're
portraying that needs to be built.

644
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:36,810
Stories create a longing.
I'm like anything else in,
in any sort of communication.

645
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:40,290
So I want to end with a quote and then
we'll take questions from you guys.

646
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,240
If you want to build a ship,

647
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,290
don't drum up people together to collect
wood and don't assign them tasks and

648
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:50,700
work, but rather teach them to long
for the endless immensity of the sea.

649
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:56,330
If Google in principle and conceptually
would embrace the power of storytelling,

650
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:59,120
you guys are already great
and unstoppable. Yeah.

651
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,630
I can't even imagine what could be calm
because you guys actually do change the

652
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:07,830
entire world.
And so we would love to take questions.

653
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:09,900
We also have a gift as you leave today.

654
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:14,010
We brought the actual insert from
the book, the communication tool kit,

655
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,080
which has, um, speeches,
stories and ceremonies, and
it has the dream leap, fight,

656
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:22,560
climb. I love arrive. We have warnings,
speeches, and motivating speeches,

657
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,860
warning stories, motivating
stories, morning ceremonies, Morgan,

658
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,520
easterners with this out.

659
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,110
Use it as your map and
change the world like crazy.

660
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,670
Thank you so much for your time.
Thank you.
