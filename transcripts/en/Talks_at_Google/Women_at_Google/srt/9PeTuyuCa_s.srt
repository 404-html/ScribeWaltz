1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,000
Please join me in giving a
warm welcome to Amanda Cohen.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,050
Thank you for that lovely
introduction. Of course. Amanda,

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,540
thanks so much for coming. I know we're
all really excited to have you. Um,

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,780
so let's just start about learning a
little bit more about your background.

5
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:25,490
How did you know you want it to be a chef
and eventually opened up a restaurant

6
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:26,840
and a cookbook?

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,920
I didn't know any of that.
I still don't know if I know any of that.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,210
I'm not sure what I want to do when
I grow up. Um, you know, I had,

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,370
I really loved cooking as a kid.
I'm from a really big family. Uh,

10
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:44,371
I had four older siblings and there's
about a five year gap between,

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,010
uh, my nearest sibling to me in age. And
one day all my siblings sort of ended up,

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:51,310
you know,

13
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,180
they were all in college and my mom
basically turned to me and my dad and was

14
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:59,950
like, yeah, I'm done. I'm not
cooking anymore. We were like, okay.

15
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,230
My Dad was like, yeah, I guess
I'll just have lunch at the office.

16
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:06,370
I don't know what he did. And I was like,
yeah, and I'm 13, like I've got to eat.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,380
She was like, yeah, you're going
to have to figure it out. Um,

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,310
and I did and I really liked to cook.
So every night I would,

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,150
after school I would go home and cook and,
and I just fell in love with that,

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,240
that time in the kitchen and how
much fun it was to play with food.

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,460
And then I sort of forgot about it. Uh,
I went to college, I came to New York,

22
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,690
I went to Nyu, I went through school,
I traveled a bunch afterwards.

23
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:30,220
I lived in Hong Kong for two years.

24
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:33,550
I lived in La for a year and I
was really floundering and I,

25
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:37,510
what I really wanted to do in
my life was travel and not work.

26
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,560
And then I realize that, well,
you know, nothing's free.

27
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:44,980
So I had to have a skill and I literally
had no skills. And I was like, well,

28
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,270
maybe if I go to cooking school,

29
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:49,570
I can travel with this skill and I
like to cook enough. So, you know,

30
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:52,720
I'll learn how to cook and then I
can go anywhere in the world, uh,

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,310
and use this great skill of mine.

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,600
So I came back to New York and I went to
cooking school and I started cooking in

33
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:02,500
the city and I actually really never
traveled again. I've been here ever since.

34
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:05,790
And that was about maybe 20 years ago.
Uh,

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,860
and even at that time as I was cooking,
I didn't,

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,420
I didn't know this was my passion. It's
what I wanted to do. I just liked it.

37
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:17,800
I liked the culture and kitchens.
I really liked sort of exploring,

38
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,150
uh, textures and flavors
with food. I like the hours.

39
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:25,160
I like sort of just the
whole crazy environment. Uh,

40
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,470
and I kept going and going and
going until one day I realized,

41
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,070
Oh shit, this is what I do. I
guess, you know, now, you know,

42
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:36,810
10 years into this I can call
myself a cook and a chef. Um,

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,830
and then I had had a series of
jobs, uh, some which I liked,

44
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:42,940
some of which I hated,

45
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,140
but I kind of hit a point in
my career where I couldn't,

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,520
I couldn't go any further. Uh, I had
sort of stayed in the vegetarian world,

47
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,260
um, and there weren't really any other
vegetarian restaurants. I could go cook.

48
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,880
I had sort of cooked at them
all in the city and I, you know,

49
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,420
I had this choice I had to make,
which was either, you know,

50
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:08,830
stay where I was in my career or start
back at the beginning and, you know,

51
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:13,390
be a line cook and a
mainstream restaurant, cook a
lot more meat and you know,

52
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:16,660
rise to the ranks that
way. Or I could, you know,

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,970
say screw it all and
start my own restaurant.

54
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,770
And I had actually kept working for
other people and then I kind of got fired

55
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,500
from a lot of jobs and I realized that,
oh,

56
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,390
maybe my only option is to
work for myself. Obviously
I don't like other bosses.

57
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,920
And so that's when I opened
the restaurant. Well,

58
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:40,360
that's an awesome story. Um, how
was opening your first restaurant?

59
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:43,500
Could you walk us through
what that really is like? Um,

60
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,780
it's sort of like going to hell
and never getting out of it.

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,870
And you think you're at like the last
circle and then you discovered there's

62
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,370
actually an eighth circle of hell.

63
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,470
And that's just like the first day I'm
opening the restaurant. And it was,

64
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,560
it was really, really hard. Uh, you know,

65
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:02,710
you think you know everything and you
know, you're like, oh, I, you know,

66
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,240
I'll figure this out as I go along.

67
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,700
But I've worked in restaurants for
long enough so I know how this works.

68
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:10,150
And as it turns out, you know,
nothing. And just, uh, you know,

69
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:12,970
I've opened a second restaurant since
and I had the second time, I was like,

70
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,120
you know, everything, I've got this
under control and I'm still like, fuck,

71
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,650
how do I not know anything? How do I keep
throwing this up over and over again?

72
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,840
Um, the, you know, they say that opening,
you know, chefs have really big egos.

73
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,550
I gotta tell you though,

74
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,190
opening a restaurant will just crush
that over and over and over again.

75
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,630
So the first one was really
hard. Uh, it was small.

76
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,700
It was 350 square feet.

77
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,770
I had about maybe $300,000 was my budget,

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,710
which, you know, 350 square
feet. Sounds like a lot.

79
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:47,410
It sounds like it should be
the right amount of money. Uh,

80
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:52,370
I had an awful contractor. He
really, really screwed us over. Uh,

81
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,970
he took all my money basically
and didn't do a lick of work,

82
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:56,740
and then we had to bring
in a second contractor.

83
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,510
And if you've ever built anything,

84
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,700
you sort of know that that's
the worst thing you can do,

85
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,210
because then nobody has to take
responsibility for anything.

86
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,170
So when the plumbing goes wrong, the
second contractors like, Oh yeah, sorry,

87
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,450
that's not my problem. And you're
like, yeah, but you're my contract.

88
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:14,080
And they're like, yeah, but the
first contractor put it in all right.

89
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,290
And he's like, so it's going to cost, you
know, you know, $500,000 and you're like,

90
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,860
well, I need a bathroom. So. Okay. Um,

91
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,820
and you know, the build out was
supposed to take three months.

92
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:29,770
It ended up taking a year, uh, and
it costs us instead of costs 300,000,

93
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:33,400
it cost us $700,000 for 350 square feet.

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,610
And the place was still
like crappy. Like, you know,

95
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:38,950
people would walk in and be like,
what's this little like, you know,

96
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,350
like crap hole in the Middle East village.
And I'd be like,

97
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:45,190
but it's such an expensive crop to
see that. It took me like, you know,

98
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,410
like a year to get the floors
level and they'd be like, yeah,

99
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:52,300
but that's still rolling downhill.
I know. Well, I tried. Um,

100
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,980
and then when we actually opened,
uh,

101
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,860
because everybody had really
sort of, uh, not done their job,

102
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,790
we opened without gas.

103
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,690
And so we spent the first six
months without gas cooking
on, um, like, you know,

104
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:09,350
like easy bake appliances. I mean,
you made a teeny, tiny little griddle,

105
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:13,570
a teeny tiny little fryer. I've
run with like a toaster oven. Um,

106
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,021
and wasn't even one of those,

107
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:18,980
I don't know if anybody watches like
real housewives of New York where I been,

108
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,840
it wasn't even a fancy title, but like
that it was like, you know, it's like,

109
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,570
it's really like an easy bake oven and,

110
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,680
and so we had to really struggle through
that and eventually we got gas and we

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
had sort of set the restaurant up to fail.

112
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,700
And that's a really weird way to
write up a budget. But I was like,

113
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,730
I don't know if anybody's going to want
to come and eat my food. Uh, you know,

114
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,560
we're,
we're to do vegetarian,

115
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:46,880
but we're really going to
focus on vegetables and I
who knows who's going to be

116
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:50,750
out there. You don't want to come eat.
And we had set it up so that, you know,

117
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,310
if worse came to worse, I can be the only
one in the restaurant running it. Um,

118
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,110
you know,

119
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,690
that it seems really roomy if it's one
person doing all the jobs and the 350

120
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:00,650
square foot restaurant.

121
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,760
And what happened actually is we got
really busy and we were really lucky.

122
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:09,080
So within the first couple of months
we started really filling up and then

123
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,760
filling up way too much.
Uh,

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,370
and we kept having to hire more staff
and trying to get as many guests into the

125
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:20,480
restaurant as possible. So in sort of a
normal restaurant you would want to do,

126
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,470
if you have 18 seat, the
most you'd really, really
want to do is about 50. Yeah.

127
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,830
It's about two and a half turns plus a.

128
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,900
And we started doing
about 65 people at night,

129
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,510
which meant we were doing three and
a half turns and the restaurant just

130
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,510
collapsed. It couldn't withstand that
many people. And I had too many staff.

131
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:43,430
And you think with that and a number of
people coming in that you would actually

132
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:46,890
be making money and it would be a
financial success, but it's not. Uh,

133
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,060
we actually were, I'm not sure the
restaurant really ever made any money.

134
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,300
Wow. What a great story
they always about. Yeah,

135
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,540
we talked about being scrappy at Google
and using those easy Vaco flights is

136
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:05,310
definitely a applies over here.
So when you think about,

137
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,240
um,
you know,

138
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:10,560
the landscape of New York restaurants
or even just restaurants in general,

139
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:15,561
a lot of the trends are moving towards
this vegetable focused cuisine.

140
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,060
How do you think of new ideas? How do you
keep them fresh? How do you know that,

141
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,220
you know, good, I do a lot of drugs

142
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,200
and I don't, you know,
that's, that's a real, it's a,

143
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,160
it's a hard question because how
to, people are always like, oh,

144
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,140
how do you come up and doing
dishes? And honestly, I'm
like, I don't know. You know,

145
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:40,900
like I think of a vegetable,
I think of a flavor.

146
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,590
I think of a place on the menu where we
need to do something and then we'd go

147
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,050
through a lot of testing.
So whatever,

148
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,110
and the idea is in my
head at the beginning,

149
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:53,650
it looks totally different when it goes
out to a customer. Three months later,

150
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:58,320
after all the testing, uh,
you know, we have, uh, uh,

151
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,060
Broccoli dish. We have these Broccoli hot
dogs. This is an easy example. And we,

152
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:07,320
I knew I wanted to do something with
Broccoli and we hadn't had this sort of

153
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:09,750
smoked cauliflower dish on the menu.
People loved it.

154
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,490
It had been on for about
two years and I was like,

155
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:14,970
it's time to for that to go to
the island of retire dishes,

156
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,290
we need to get something new in.

157
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,740
And Broccoli was the right vegetable
because it has this sort of same sort of

158
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:20,041
half.

159
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,980
So it was filling a position on the
menu and I really wanted to do something

160
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:27,870
with Barbecue Broccoli and
we had sort of pulled out,

161
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,170
we pulled off the all the stocks off
the Broccoli so that there was just this

162
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,710
one single Florette on a
very low on its long stock.

163
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,860
And we were going to like
grill that and I don't know,

164
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:41,280
it was going to get slathered in a
barbecue sauce and I want her to like five

165
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,590
different barbecue sauces and make
it really provisional and you know,

166
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
have soft white bread and
make it Broccoli bread.

167
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,880
And I kept testing this and kept
testing this and it was disgusting.

168
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,820
It was like the most disgusting
thing we've ever made.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,180
And the Broccoli bread was like foul.
It was like my staff was like,

170
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,010
stop making us eat this.
And I was like, no,

171
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:01,650
but I think this one's a little bit
better. And they're like, it's not,

172
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,620
it's just not.
Um,

173
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,550
but we had all these sort of components
and we had made the Broccoli Bun,

174
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,340
we're getting made the
Broccoli bread into a bun.

175
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:15,810
And I had sort of had a temper tantrum,
which I'd like to say I'm exaggerating,

176
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,420
but really I had had a temper tantrum
in the middle of the restaurant.

177
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:20,700
We like been working on it for months,
so it was a Sunday.

178
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:24,210
And I literally just took everything
and threw it in the garbage, uh,

179
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,310
and maybe through some things at the
wall and broke some dishes. But, uh,

180
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,070
the, I sort of really,
this, I would happen,

181
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:36,450
I looked in the garbage and the stock of
Broccoli sort of fell into the bun and

182
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:39,640
I was like, oh, well, that
looks like a Broccoli hot dog.

183
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,990
So we went back to the drawing table and
we stopped making the Broccoli buttons.

184
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,890
Uh, we made a, the soft white Japanese,
uh, milk bread, really, really soft,

185
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:53,470
as close to sort of like a fake button
as you can possibly make. And you know,

186
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,000
then we have our broccoli stalk in the
middle and the Broccoli Sauerkraut that

187
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:01,440
we put on top and this mustard sauce and
dehydrated broccoli raab chips with a

188
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:04,530
little vinegar powder. And you know,
the dish sort of rolled out from there.

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,020
Now that dish actually gave birth
to another dish because, uh,

190
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,770
so the problem with the Broccoli hot
dog is we have that one center stock of

191
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:18,480
Broccoli. Right? But you get like
eight cups of Broccoli Florets.

192
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,670
So it's the little place. We just ate
a lot of broccoli for our family meal.

193
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,020
But I mean,

194
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,030
you have to imagine and be like everyday
if you guys went to the cafeteria.

195
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:34,000
And the only thing that was
there was broccoli verbal. Um,

196
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,430
and we still couldn't get rid of it.
Like we had too much. And so we actually,

197
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,970
I tried to offer it to all the shops in
the neighborhood and people would take

198
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:45,580
like a court here or you
know, a gallon there. Um,

199
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,870
and then we tried to actually give
it away to the restaurants in the

200
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:51,270
neighborhood and be like, oh look
family meal. And they're like,

201
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:53,160
yeah we can't eat that much broccoli.

202
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,600
And then I actually put up an ad on
Craig's list giveaway the Broccoli and

203
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,870
that's how we finally started really
getting rid of it. There was one woman,

204
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,890
she came and she would get like she would
take it all and it would be like a lot

205
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,190
like the gallons and gallons
of it every week. We're like,

206
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,750
what is she doing with it?
So,

207
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,370
and we couldn't actually make
a dish with the Broccoli yet,

208
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,050
little dirt candy cause
we didn't have the space.

209
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:20,590
And so everything that we did at the
little one was really based on the space

210
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:23,740
that we had. How many dishes was the
amount of space we had in the fridge,

211
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:25,180
how much alcohol we served with,

212
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:29,170
how much space we had in the drawers
under the bank cat where we stored it. Um,

213
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,760
but at the new place we have a,
we have the,

214
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,340
we have the space, we have
walk ins and fridges. So we
were like, okay, well we are,

215
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,910
we've got to figure out something
to do with the Broccoli.

216
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:43,300
And that's how we came up with probably
our most popular dish at the moment,

217
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:46,300
which is our Korean Fried Broccoli,
which is a deep fried Broccoli dish.

218
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:49,870
And it's addictive and people
come all over to have it.

219
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:52,270
And then they have a second one, they
have a third one. I'm like, Oh my God,

220
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,080
I'm going to have to pay for your hospital
bills cause they're going to die. Um,

221
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,200
and amazingly we still have too much
broccoli and I'm still giving it away to a

222
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,710
restaurant down the street,
but not as much broccoli ice cream maybe.

223
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,790
Very cool. Um, so as a
chef and restauranteur,

224
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:13,380
you've also done some really amazing
things in terms of eliminating tipping.

225
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:17,560
So how did you come to that
decision? What made you, you know,

226
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,720
what were your key drivers and how
did you react to some of the press and

227
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:24,060
people's results yet?
So

228
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,770
I came to it for a couple
of different reasons. Um,

229
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,770
the first was about three,
four years ago,

230
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:35,771
I put out an ad for a new cook at dirt
candy and we actually got zero responses.

231
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,271
And I was like,
well,

232
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:41,360
that's kind of weird because when I had
first opened the first couple of years,

233
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:45,710
every time I would put out an out, I
would get like 30, 40 applications. Um,

234
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,950
and I put out a second one in,

235
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:53,150
a couple of people trickled
in and thankfully one stuck
around and we hired them.

236
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,370
But it didn't make any sense to me.

237
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:58,760
I have a very niche cuisine and there's
enough vegetarian chefs out there and

238
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:02,360
we're well known enough restaurant that
we should have been getting a lot more.

239
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,060
Um, you know, there's only so
many vegetarian restaurants,

240
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,470
but a lot of vegetarian chefs.

241
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,940
So that was sort of making me think
there's something weird going on. Um,

242
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,430
and I started, you know,
asking all my chef friends,

243
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:15,560
like if they were noticing the same
problems and they're like, oh yeah,

244
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:20,210
we're having the hardest
time getting cooks. Um, and
what I sort of realized was,

245
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,570
oh yeah, of course. How there's
no cooks left in New York City.

246
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,810
There was a lot of cooks in cooking
schools or students training to be cooks,

247
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,690
but they're all going to other cities.

248
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:33,740
It's really expensive for them to live
in New York and they're traveling,

249
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,450
you know,
an hour,

250
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,790
an hour and a half to get to their job
where they're working 14 hours and then

251
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,620
traveling back.
And you know,

252
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:44,621
the standard Perry is about $10
for a prep cook or line cooking.

253
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,760
You move up maybe $12 and sort of the top
you hit is about 15 until you get like

254
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:52,730
very specialized. Um, but at 10, $12,

255
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,000
you can see really hard
to live in New York.

256
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,510
And so the students are going to other
cities and now have great restaurants,

257
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:03,350
there's great food seems everywhere
else and a higher standard of living.

258
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,410
It's easier. So I was like, ah, well I
have to fix this because I'm, you know,

259
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,380
in the back of my mind like,
Oh,

260
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:12,950
I'm about to open a new restaurant
and I'm going to need 15 more cooks,

261
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,310
what am I going to do? Obviously
the natural response is, well,

262
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:18,620
I have to pay them more and
that's how I'll get, you know,

263
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:22,010
attract them to the restaurant. But the
restaurant doesn't make that much money.

264
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,430
So margins in restaurants are really,
really small.

265
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:29,540
Even like the best restaurants,
maybe it's like 5%. Uh,

266
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,790
most restaurants were to hover around
3%. I run a crappy one, so it's like 1%.

267
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,710
Um,
but there's just,

268
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:40,580
the money just isn't there and we need a
lot of labor for the kind of food I do.

269
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,230
So I was like, okay, well
I have to find more money,

270
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,590
but I can't charge more for what I do.
Cause consumers were only pay so much. Um,

271
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,060
and they all right, I, I've
got to find this money.

272
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,870
And then I sort of started looking around
and I looked at my server who I loved.

273
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,190
Um, but she was the only one who
was allowed to take home tips.

274
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,070
And because we were a small restaurant,

275
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,580
it's 18 seats and check
average was about $100.

276
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:07,430
And if you're doing 60 people
a night and you're, you know,

277
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,600
you're pulling in a lot of money and 20%
of that is she's walking out with about

278
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:16,250
$600 a night on top of the minimum wage.

279
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:20,900
And I'm paying her. Um, so I was like,
oh my God, there's a huge discrepancy.

280
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:25,880
My line cooks are walking out with 120,
150, and she's walking out with 600.

281
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,430
It doesn't mean that, I don't think
that she wasn't working really hard,

282
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,460
but somehow bad.

283
00:16:29,461 --> 00:16:32,570
Does it make sense if we're all working
towards the same goal in the restaurant?

284
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,840
So I was like, well, maybe, you know,

285
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:37,910
I'll just have my cook serve
more of my cooks helped.

286
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,180
They were always helping serve and my
dishwasher was helping serve more and I

287
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:44,090
was helping serve,
but none of us can touch the tips.

288
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,470
So that is like this law that
if you accept the tip credit,

289
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:53,330
even without the tip credit,
that the only person who can,

290
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,170
uh,

291
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,700
receive a tip is the server because
they touch the food basically 80% of the

292
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:02,120
time, once it's left the kitchen. And
that's how it sort of gets divided.

293
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,160
So then I was like, oh, well ha,

294
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,000
I can't take her tip money away back to
legal and I don't want to go to jail. Um,

295
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,600
I wouldn't do well in jail.
Um, uh, so I was like,

296
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,070
okay,
well I have to figure this out.

297
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,120
And then I started researching into
tipping and it's a really bad system.

298
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,430
It's sexist,
it's racist.

299
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,850
And it's kind of a false premise
because everybody's like, oh yeah,

300
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:28,780
well if services really bad, you
know, then I'm not going to, you know,

301
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,250
I'm going to cut my tip and half.
But the truth is,

302
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,350
is most people just tip what they tip.
You know,

303
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:37,220
if you're a 20% tip or your 20% tip, good
tip, spat, good service, bad service,

304
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,050
you do 15, you're 15 across the board.
Um, and then I started thinking, you know,

305
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:45,150
this is even weirder,
that I'm basically just letting my,

306
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,100
my customers be my human resources
department for my server.

307
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,620
Like they're the ones who are starting
to deciding what she gets paid and how

308
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,990
does this even make sense?
Because if I have a bad night,

309
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,090
it's the server that's going
to get punished, you know,

310
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:01,140
and when services really slow
and the food is really bad,

311
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,690
you blame the server,
you don't necessarily play in the kitchen.

312
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:08,100
And just all these sort of, uh, points
came together in my head. I was like,

313
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,530
alright, you know what?
Let's get rid of tipping.

314
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,970
Let's see if we can make this work.

315
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,900
And it was a really good time because
minimum wage is actually going up for

316
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:20,470
servers and for a regular
employees. So, you know,

317
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,000
I had to figure out how I was gonna be
able to pay them more. Uh, and yeah,

318
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,860
so that's how, that's how we
came to it. We started it.

319
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,783
Um,

320
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,530
it was pretty amazing how much people
really hated the idea that we were getting

321
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,150
rid of tipping.
Uh,

322
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,770
I've been pretty vocal about a lot
of things that they don't like in the

323
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:41,580
industry,

324
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,930
but nothing has like made people crazier
and hate me more than getting rid of

325
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:49,530
tipping. Um, I'm just like,
I'm stealing from my servers.

326
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:54,060
The bartenders aren't going to make any
money. How can I make this decision? Um,

327
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,920
I had, this is, this is one of, of these
sort of strange things that came out,

328
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:03,900
but I have never got as much antisemitic
hate now as from let us except from

329
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,340
this.
And when I didn't even know this,

330
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:07,770
like really actually existed
when I was like, oh my gosh,

331
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,670
like you people are saying
mean things about me. Um,

332
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,750
and you know, they're like, oh, you're so
cheap. You're so awful. And I was like,

333
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:16,680
well,
I'm not actually cheap.

334
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:20,580
I'm actually trying to be
really nice to my staff and,

335
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,360
and a lot of eds that are restauranters
where like, oh, it's never going to work.

336
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,320
Uh, and then so happened that it did
work. Uh, we haven't gotten rid of it.

337
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,620
Danny Meyer then also went
to his hospitality included,

338
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:34,470
which really helped us because it sort
of cemented the fact that, you know,

339
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:36,060
this is the way we think we're going to,

340
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,860
the restaurant industry is going to move
to my back of host, was really happy,

341
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,760
they get paid and my front of House,
uh, is pretty happy. You know,

342
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:48,600
we get the people who want to work for
a salary basically you can, you know,

343
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,250
we are guaranteeing them,
yes,

344
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:53,250
they could maybe make $300 one
night and another restaurant,

345
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,950
but they're also never going to
have a night where they make $100.

346
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,250
So it really sort of evens out in the end.
Uh,

347
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:03,060
and then we did decide to profit share
because I feel like for everybody,

348
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,160
you need a little incentive.
Uh,

349
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,190
raises are sort of far and
few between and restaurants,

350
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:09,450
especially for the front of House.

351
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,990
And we wanted to make it more fun and
we wanted them to really understand the

352
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:16,050
economics and have everybody feel like
they were working for the restaurant.

353
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,200
So we share 10% of our
profits when we have it.

354
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,120
We don't always actually have a 10%.
Uh,

355
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,680
but we do our best and we have lots
of little incentives along the way.

356
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,590
That's awesome.
So what's next?

357
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:33,570
What's on the next horizon of changing
the, you know, restaurant landscape?

358
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,370
I Dunno. Um, it's a tough one. I don't, I
don't know what really is out there next.

359
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,500
Um, you know, we have a,

360
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,260
we have a really big problem
in the city right now. Uh,

361
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,100
restaurants are exactly
sustainable as are, uh,

362
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,660
minimum wage is going to go up and I,
in the next couple of years that's from,

363
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,040
it's not going to help the tiny
margins in restaurants. Uh,

364
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,850
rents are incredibly expensive.

365
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,320
We're just operating a business in the
city and it's still really hard to find

366
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:07,300
labor no matter how much I'm trying to
pay my staff, they're just not here. And,

367
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,080
uh,

368
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,310
we've sort of had this restaurant's don't
charge enough money for the food they

369
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:15,790
serve. I know they seem
really expensive. A lot of,

370
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,530
a lot of labor goes into it
and it's really hard to get
people to understand how

371
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,280
much it cost, eat in a restaurant.
And you know, we all think,

372
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:27,610
oh well this plate of, um, you
know, those carrots, sliders,

373
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:29,440
if everybody came to the
cafeteria, oh, you know,

374
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:31,600
it's $12 and that's
just a carrot on a bun.

375
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,260
But the reality is it's way more
work than just a carrot on a button.

376
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,870
And on top of that,
I'm not only paying for that Labor,

377
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:40,090
but I'm also paying for the
toilet paper in the bathroom.

378
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,780
And you all want toilet paper
when you come to a restaurant. Um,

379
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,610
I certainly know that people
who steal it won it. So, uh,

380
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,810
and you also want electricity and
you want heat in the winter and air

381
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,840
conditioning in the summer.

382
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,760
All of that is really what you're paying
for when you go to a restaurant. Um,

383
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,350
and Eh, we don't charge enough. So we have
to figure out a way where we can start,

384
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:06,610
you know, convincing the consumer that
they have to pay a little bit more money.

385
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,470
And because if not,

386
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:11,710
restaurants are going to start to closing
what you'll end up with as a lot of

387
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:14,580
those sort of quick service
restaurants that, you know,

388
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,620
fine dining will disappear and that sort
of the next challenges unfortunately or

389
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:23,170
fortunately, I don't know, it's
educating the consumer a lot more.

390
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,700
Do you think that that's kind of the
solution right now just to educate the

391
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:31,810
consumer? Do you have like, I mean, that's
only sleeping. I know. I tried my best,

392
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:35,890
you know, I've, I'm trying so hard
to parent pay my staff a fair wage.

393
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:38,300
I want to be able to pay
them more in two years. Uh,

394
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,500
everybody who walks into the
restaurant starts off at $50 an hour.

395
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,920
Unless you're a server where
you make a little bit more. Um,

396
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,160
and in a couple of years that's actually
just going to be minimum wage, you know,

397
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,860
so I now have to figure out a way where
I can pay them $20 an hour. I can,

398
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:56,560
you know, get that up. I have to be
able to charge more for the food.

399
00:22:56,561 --> 00:23:00,760
I have to find the money somewhere. Um,
so yeah, that is the only solution I know.

400
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,950
Yeah, that would definitely, um,

401
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,650
would love to shift gears a little
and talk about your cookbook.

402
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,710
So what made you decide to one write a
cookbook but to make it a comic graphic

403
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:14,320
novel cookbook? Well, um,

404
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,170
I really didn't really want to write a
cookbook and I had worked for a number of

405
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:23,950
restaurants where sort of within the
first year the chefs had disappeared to

406
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:26,020
write a cookbook. And I
was like, ah, that's not,

407
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:29,050
that sucks cause you're not there and
nobody's taking care of the restaurant.

408
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:32,980
And the restaurant really hadn't been
around enough, I thought to tell a story,

409
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,800
but I'm also a snob and have a lot
of opinions. What do I know? So, uh,

410
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,220
we had gotten approached a couple of
times by some editors and publishers that

411
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,780
were like, oh, we really
want you to write a cookbook.

412
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,550
We really want you to write a
cookbook. And was like, no, no, no.

413
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,060
And then sort of one day it's in, and
I was like, well maybe. And I was like,

414
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:54,920
but I don't, I don't want to write a
regular cookbook. Um, you know, I'm not,

415
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,800
I, I love cookbooks and
I have a huge collection,

416
00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:00,590
but I'm not sure if people actually
cook from cookbooks so much anymore.

417
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,330
You know,
there is the Internet,

418
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,630
I think most people look online for
recipes and that's where they really cook

419
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:09,760
from. And cookbooks have become more
like a picture of books and you know,

420
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,300
coffee table books.
And I was like,

421
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:15,080
that's not really representative of
what we do with the reps restaurant and

422
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,040
we're going to do a cookbook. We have
to make something really fun. So I had,

423
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,460
I don't know,
uh,

424
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,740
I was having some huge fight
with my husband and he was like,

425
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,570
are you going to do this? I'm
like, I don't want to do this.

426
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,480
It's not going to be fun. And he's like,
well, let's make it fun. I was like,

427
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:31,280
I don't know how to make it fun.
I was like,

428
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,440
we'd have to do something really
stupid. And he was like, yeah,

429
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,150
like do it in a comic book form.

430
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,870
And then we both stopped dead and we
actually started over having the street

431
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,340
fight in the middle of the street.
So traffic had stopped

432
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,220
and we stopped and we were like, oh
yeah, that's perfect. And it just,

433
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:49,190
it clicked right away because
we knew that we could,

434
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,750
if we found the right artist,

435
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,320
we could really capture the spirit
of the restaurant in this book.

436
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,990
Little dirt candy was crazy.
It was insane.

437
00:24:56,991 --> 00:25:00,710
And it was like a circus
every single night. And I,

438
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,310
I couldn't figure out how I could
just, you know, do that in pictures,

439
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,380
but with sort of the movement that you
get in a graphic novel, uh, we really,

440
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:10,131
we were like,
oh yeah,

441
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:13,040
we could really make this happen and we
can make these characters come alive and

442
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:18,041
we could tell the story of the restaurant
and then we could also sort of a

443
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:21,110
rework how recipes were written.
Uh,

444
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,110
I think it's really easy
to learn something visually
and not always when there's

445
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:28,490
a lot of words next to it, especially
with cooking. And we were like, Oh yeah,

446
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:32,540
we could draw out so much of this and
make it seem so real that it would make a

447
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:36,880
lot of sense to the person who's cooking
from it. And these aren't easy recipes.

448
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:41,750
So we really wanted to make them as
easy as possible for the reader. So we,

449
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,810
we went back to all the
editors and publishers who
had come to us and we're like,

450
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,360
oh, we're totally going to write a
cookbook. We have this great idea.

451
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:52,160
And they're like, no, absolutely not.
We're like, no one is going to be on.

452
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:56,850
And they were like, no way too much
work. And, uh, we found, uh, uh,

453
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,920
Clarkson potter, Random House,
say they took us on and, uh,

454
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,010
we worked with them to do
this and it was amazing. It,

455
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,040
I am not an artist whatsoever.
Uh, but Ryan, Dan Levy,

456
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,540
who is the graphic artist,

457
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:13,460
he did this amazing job of just really
capturing the essence of the restaurant

458
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:18,350
and making it like look alive and fun.
And we told the story through it and,

459
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,870
um,
everybody said that it wouldn't sell.

460
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,980
And so our first run I think
was about 5,000 copies, uh,

461
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,160
and within a month we had gone into the
second run and we're about 40,000 copies

462
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:34,520
now. Which for a cookbook
without a, you know, a big
name attached to it. It's good.

463
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,280
No, it's all, I still haven't made
back any royalties though yet.

464
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:44,040
Maybe after this. Uh, no.
That's awesome. So, uh, we

465
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,010
also know you were on iron
chef as mentioned before.

466
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:51,180
How was that experience?
What like what is the four one,

467
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:54,150
one inside scoop that they
don't show you on food network?

468
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,500
Um, the actually the, the biggest
surprise was how long it took,

469
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:01,630
not the battle.
The battle is real.

470
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,600
It's up that 60 minutes and it is crazy.

471
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,940
I don't remember most of it because
it happened in such a blur. Um,

472
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,390
but the judging takes a really long time.
So it's,

473
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,360
it's actually like four hours and
you're like, by the end you're like,

474
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:17,141
I don't care who wins.

475
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:21,400
I just want to go home and you're
some 7:00 AM I want to go home.

476
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,240
Um, it's pretty, the whole
experience was pretty crazy.

477
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,900
I sorta like everything in my life.
I said no to it.

478
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,900
And then they were like, are you sure?
And I was like, I don't know what.

479
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,390
I'm just going to go and look like
a loser and I'm going to lose.

480
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:38,800
And they're like, no you're
not. I was like, yeah, I
probably am a, and I was like,

481
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:40,090
I don't want to look dumb
and I don't want, you know,

482
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,150
we had to agree that it would
definitely be a vegetarian battle. Um,

483
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:48,070
and you know,
you get there and you know,

484
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:51,490
it's just a lot of bright lights and
camera people like all around you.

485
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:55,240
And the hardest thing is at the iron
chef really knows where everything is.

486
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,300
You know, they've been there, they've
done it, they're allowed in the kitchen.

487
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,150
So you know, they stock their fridges
the way they want to stock it.

488
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:04,750
They know how the stoves work and the
blenders work and just like the ice cream

489
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:07,770
machine and as the competitor,
you walk in and you're like, ah,

490
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,210
I don't know where's the fridge? And
they're like, not thing like I want,

491
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,210
that was the freezer.
I thought that was a stolen,

492
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,030
none of them really makes sense. So when
those 60 minutes, when you're cooking a,

493
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,720
you're looking for things half the
time it's like, ah, where am I? Um,

494
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,430
and you're doing that as some camera
guy is following you around for like,

495
00:28:24,431 --> 00:28:28,510
I feel crazy. And then
the iron chef, you know,

496
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:31,940
they know where everything is
and so they're very calm. Uh,

497
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,930
I did exactly what they told
me I was going to do, which
is they're like, oh yeah,

498
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:37,180
you're the chef so you probably
don't cook a lot. I was like,

499
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:39,220
I'm in my kitchen every night. And
they're like, yeah, just be careful.

500
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:40,450
You're probably gonna cut yourself.

501
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,660
Cause I of got going to caught myself
like two seconds into it. I was like,

502
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:47,400
my fingers hanging off.
Um,

503
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,000
and then the whole,
you know,

504
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,630
show I had bandaids that kept falling
off and I was like, it stopped bleeding.

505
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,750
I can keep the bandaid off. And they're
like, no continuity. I was like, ah.

506
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,780
So like every three seconds I had a
new band aid on a stick to the plot.

507
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,190
And then for us, the,
we're dumb. All of us just,

508
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,860
I love my people who work in my
restaurant but me included. But we just,

509
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,090
we didn't quite get what we were supposed
to do. And um, you know, they were like,

510
00:29:13,091 --> 00:29:17,230
well, it's five courses. And we're like,
yeah, it's five courses and I don't,

511
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,250
I don't know what was actually
wrong with our brains. Um,

512
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:25,390
but we made enough food for like a
night in the dining room, but it really,

513
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:28,960
it's only like the judges who sit there
and it's like three people taking tiny

514
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:32,710
little bites. They were all like
amuse sites, just amuse boosh sites,

515
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:37,060
tiny little size. Then you realize that's
really what, uh, uh, chef Morimoto did.

516
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,410
They make these tiny little portions.

517
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,220
Meanwhile we'd made it like gallon
of burble on sauce and they're like,

518
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:44,890
what are you going to do with all this
butter sauce? I'm like, I don't know,

519
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,010
put it on craigslist.

520
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,470
So we spend a lot of time doing stupid
stuff like that. And I would like to say,

521
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,570
Eh, that we won, but we did not win. But
we did a good showing and it was fun.

522
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,070
I would never do it again. I'm not
a competitive person like that, uh,

523
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,140
but it was really, really fun to do
and I'm glad I have it on my resume.

524
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,360
That is awesome.
What a cool story.

525
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,650
So we'll actually be taking
questions in the next few minutes.

526
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:16,630
So if anyone has a question, start to
think about it and head to the mix. Um,

527
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,000
would love to just hear
a little quick fire. Uh,

528
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,880
what is the best thing you've ever eaten?

529
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,770
I hope I haven't eaten it yet.
Oh,

530
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,740
what is your favorite vegetable and why?

531
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,230
I know it's like all your kids.
I actually,

532
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,970
this is an onion. It's actually my
favorite vegetable. It's really,

533
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,150
really versatile and it's the
backbone of almost every single dish.

534
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:45,580
So we couldn't live without
it in the kitchen. I mean,

535
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:50,560
I don't usually eat them
like an APP. They're really
sweet, but that is, you know,

536
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:50,730
it,

537
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,690
it works so hard in the kitchen
and it gets such little love,

538
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,090
I guess the Grayson, any, uh, particular
onion that you like better than others or,

539
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,040
oh, no, I'm, I'm, I'm an onion lover.

540
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,070
What's your favorite thing to do?

541
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:11,071
To relax and actually just
read a book by myself.

542
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,760
Not Talk to anybody. That's
awesome. Okay, cool. Well,

543
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:18,760
any questions looks like we do have one.

544
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,230
I, so what are the tax implications
of the gratuity only model?

545
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,350
And I was also curious if you see any way
of changing the laws to make it easier

546
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:30,490
for restaurants to do what you're doing

547
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,830
in that, in that regard. Uh,
the tax implications, uh,

548
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,830
for me personally as a business,
um,

549
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,760
they're divided on third doesn't
make a big difference. I have,

550
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:46,020
my insurance has gone up a lot because
my payroll has gone up a lot. Uh,

551
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:48,870
so that's the biggest difference.
Like cost to me,

552
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,590
tax implications are for the consumer
because now you're getting taxed on your

553
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:57,500
tip. All right, so sales tax for
the consumer has gone up. Uh,

554
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,050
but it's also only gone up slightly
because you used to pay sales tax on let's

555
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:04,800
say the hundred dollar portion of your
bill and now you're paying it on 120,

556
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:08,690
but it's really, it's only that
differential on the $20. Right? Um,

557
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,450
the laws to the laws are there to
make what I'm doing actually best for

558
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:15,490
everybody.

559
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:20,490
The laws surrounding tipping
are so complicated and like
even without meaning to

560
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,010
people break them constantly and it's,

561
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,290
it's like funny things
you wouldn't think of. Um,

562
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,910
bussers this is sort of what most of the
law states, if you've ever, if you know,

563
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,690
read the sort of, I don't know, food
gossip papers and you know, there's a lot,

564
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:38,040
all of these lawsuits against restaurants
and tipping and who gets paid what,

565
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,380
well,

566
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,380
the easiest way to understand that is
bussers who spend more than 20% of their

567
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:49,160
time polishing or not until I
entitled to the tips. I mean, that's,

568
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,660
and that's part of their job, right? So
thank you have to be like, okay, you know,

569
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,530
Rizal you've been punked polishing for
an hour and you've got to get back on the

570
00:32:57,531 --> 00:32:59,600
floor. I'm got to switch you off with
somebody else. And even he's like,

571
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:03,470
but I liked doing the polishing.
He's not entitled to the tips. Um,

572
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,000
so the law actually works against tipping.

573
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,160
It works great for exactly what I'm doing,

574
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:15,161
which is parent paying everybody a fair
wage and not having to sort of be a part

575
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:20,110
of that, uh, tipping system.

576
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:25,180
The,
it would be nicer if,

577
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,320
um,
yeah,

578
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:31,120
like the way we do get hit a little ways
on are like state taxes for employees

579
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:32,080
like food and Sudan.

580
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,290
That it'd be nice if those were reduced
a little because everybody's, we're,

581
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,000
we're getting hit with that.
And if, um, you know, uh,

582
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,630
there was some, if you weren't
part of the tip credit system,

583
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:45,130
if there was some other credit system,

584
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:48,280
but you were paying your
employees a fair wage.

585
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,150
Very interesting. Cool. Hi.

586
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,540
I was wondering if you could talk
a little bit about vegetarianism,

587
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:59,020
both kind of your personal philosophy
towards it and then the role that you

588
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:02,860
think it kind of plays in the or should
play in the food scene in general,

589
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:06,510
especially as they are kind of more
vegetarian vegetable focused restaurants

590
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,353
opening.

591
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,230
Um, well, I'm not a vegetarian,
so I was one for about,

592
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,910
uh, maybe, um, 15 years or so.

593
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,230
Uh,
and I gave it up because I did,

594
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,490
I had gone to, I was really tired of
the vegetarian plate, a restaurant,

595
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,421
to be honest.
And I was like,

596
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:29,210
I can't eat any more grilled
Portabello and a side of rice,

597
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,310
even at like fancy restaurant, you know,
I'm, I'm not, if I'm going out to eat,

598
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:37,130
I'm really not becoming a better
chef. And if I'm, you know,

599
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,030
this obviously other staffs just really
care about the protein on the plate and

600
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:45,500
not the vegetables. That was about 15
years ago. Uh, and times have changed,

601
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,730
so, but for me, that's, you know, I'm
not a vegetarian anymore and I was,

602
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,070
I really only became a vegetarian because
I don't like meat. It's so there's no,

603
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,190
it's just a personal taste preference.
I've never really missed it.

604
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,750
Uh,
I do think the world's a diet is changing.

605
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,490
I think people want to
eat more vegetables.

606
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,600
I still think they really want to eat
meat and it's all about finding the

607
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:12,640
balance. So I think restaurants
like mine that are uh,

608
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:17,710
really vegetable focused are always
going to be a smaller proportion of the,

609
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,240
you know, the restaurants out there. Uh,
but the more people can offer vegetables,

610
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:23,210
the more exciting it is.

611
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:25,670
And we're starting to see some
really exciting things happen,

612
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:27,510
particularly in New York City,
uh,

613
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,560
where people are now getting used to
eating their vegetables are restaurants.

614
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,110
It doesn't seem so awful.
Yeah.

615
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:38,590
What's your favorite dish
on your menu right now? Um,

616
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,440
what was the last Oh,
well probably the carrot sliders,

617
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,530
which is what we serve downstairs.
And uh,

618
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,480
also we have this eh pepper
dish and which is delicious.

619
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:54,810
But mostly I like it cause it's really,
really annoying to my staff to have,

620
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:58,980
to make you have to do it.
And then we take bell peppers and uh,

621
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,910
we filet them.

622
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,230
So we peel off one side of the scan and
peel off the other and then we punch a

623
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:05,130
lot of holes out of it.

624
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:09,720
So they look like lifesavers and it's a
lot of work and they were really angry

625
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:13,350
at me. So that's like,
I find that pleasurable.

626
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,393
Awesome.

627
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,440
We'll take a question.
Yeah.

628
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,250
So dirt candy is a really
great name for a restaurant.

629
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:24,360
This focused on vegetables.

630
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:27,270
I wonder if you had any sort of story
about how you came up with that name and

631
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:28,104
its origins.

632
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,660
Well, again, it was a fight
between my husband and I. So, uh,

633
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,030
we were, we were tying to figure out
what to name the restaurant and um,

634
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,220
we, we wanted to stay
away from a one word, uh,

635
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,660
restaurant name really,
because this is weird to say here,

636
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,690
but because it's really hard
to Google it. Um, you know,

637
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:53,160
if you're called fork and you just put
in for like everything shows up from

638
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:55,140
actual forks,
so like a fork in the road,

639
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,320
like a million other
restaurants named fork. Um,

640
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,170
so that was out Andy and we were
trying to really figure out,

641
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,770
um, you know, what, what
the restaurant represented,

642
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:11,580
what vegetables rep represented and,
and you know,

643
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,820
as things escalate, we were fighting
about what they meant and what they were.

644
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:17,910
And at one point I was like, no,
they're like candy from the earth.

645
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,430
And my husband was like,
like dirt candy.

646
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,290
And we both stopped and we were like,
Oh yeah, dirt candy. That's good.

647
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,890
That's really, really good.
And then before we had opened,

648
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:34,200
we thought we were going to be more of
like a vegetable and fruit restaurant.

649
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,180
So we're like, well, if we
call ourselves dirt candy,

650
00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:38,250
we can be dirt candy and tree meat.

651
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,160
I know we both stopped and we're like,
no tree meets, call a restaurant.

652
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,360
[inaudible] I'll know.
I still really like it.

653
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,550
Um, and then we sort of went from there.
We were like, yeah, dirt candy. It's,

654
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:58,090
it's perfect. Um, and then I actually
went to go buy dirt candy, the name, uh,

655
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:01,320
and it was taken,
that's why I'm dirt candy nyc.com.

656
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,350
And it actually pulled up
my other favorite name,

657
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:05,700
not necessarily for a restaurant,

658
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:08,070
but for a project that
one day I want to work on,

659
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,170
which is nasty bond bond song calm,

660
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,300
which would be this like the sister to
dirt candy. So I, I should have bought it.

661
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,170
I really like that nasty bond bonds.

662
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,280
And then so we took their candy and we
knew it was going to be a difficult name

663
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,450
for some people. And we did, I mean
still to this day, eight years later,

664
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,100
two restaurants, uh, and you
know, countless reviews. Uh,

665
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,260
we are still getting the last of the
worst name for a restaurant. I'm like,

666
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:38,530
I don't really care cause you remember
it and you will never forget it.

667
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,010
And so that's, you know, we
branded ourselves with this name.

668
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,680
How do you deal with,
you know,

669
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:48,400
criticism and people constantly
critiquing your food?

670
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:53,050
I cry a lot. I find myself
in the bathroom. Um,

671
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,280
I try not to read the reviews and then
I'm totally lying cause I read them,

672
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,360
which everybody does.

673
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,770
I know other people who read them and
they sort of filter it out for me. Uh,

674
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,810
and we, you know, it's,
the truth is it's hard.

675
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,710
It's really hard. We all work really hard.
I'm in the restaurant every single day.

676
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,800
My team is in the restaurant
and we have staff meetings.

677
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:19,060
We do our best to do customer service.
We're constantly asking people, uh,

678
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:21,250
how things are or what
else we can do for them.

679
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,460
And when you read something the next day,
um,

680
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,290
where you know, it's really negative
and you're like, but I was right there,

681
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,280
you know, just why didn't
you say something to me in
person where I can fix it?

682
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,110
I can't fix it. If you've left, really,
I can, you know, offer to, you know, uh,

683
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,440
refund your meal if I can get an
email address or a phone number.

684
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:45,040
But the truth is I want to
help you there. My, my goal,

685
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:49,390
even though I am a chef and yes, I have
an ego, is I'm a restaurant or in my,

686
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:52,330
I want to give you the best customer
service possible and I want to make sure

687
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:56,320
you have the best experience and such a
small part of going to a restaurant is

688
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:57,154
about the food.

689
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,060
It's about the company and the service
and everything else that makes it up and

690
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,880
that's my job is to make you really,
really happy.

691
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:07,120
Hopefully I can make you love the food
to you might not like it and that's okay.

692
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,410
Not My food is definitely not for
everybody, but the experience is,

693
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,920
you know what I want you to have
and it's really, really hurtful.

694
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,000
Actually when we read negative reviews
can we're like, well we're right there.

695
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,610
You could defend something. You thought
this was too salty. I'm so sorry.

696
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:24,790
We would remade it or you
didn't like this or you know,

697
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:27,640
you thought you weren't getting paid
enough attention. Whatever the thing is,

698
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,720
I can only fix it at the moment.
And that's, you know for sure.

699
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,663
Definitely.

700
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,870
First of all, the carrots flutters
were really good. How do I for lunch,

701
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,580
so thank you for that.

702
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,260
It was super delicious and I'm next,

703
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,380
I was thinking about all the challenges
of having a restaurant in New York City

704
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:49,350
that you talked about how expensive
it is and how hard it is to get stuff.

705
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,220
I'm wondering if you ever think about
leaving New York and setting up shop

706
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:54,600
somewhere else and if you don't,

707
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:57,300
why you stay in New York City
and if you do where you'd go?

708
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,013
Um,

709
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,350
I stay because I have a 10
year lease I can't get out of.

710
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,700
Also, I, you know, I live
here, this is my home.

711
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,040
I've been here for over 20
years. I love, love the city. Uh,

712
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,740
but it wasn't this hard beforehand
and it's become really hard and really

713
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:20,940
expensive over the last
couple of years. Um, and

714
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,160
I, I probably will never open
another restaurant in New York City.

715
00:41:26,161 --> 00:41:30,930
It's just financially, I don't know
how people afford to do it, really. Um,

716
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,640
uh, so if I were to go to somewhere
else, I would probably go home.

717
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,220
I'd probably maybe, you know,
open another place in Toronto,

718
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,530
which is where my entire family is.

719
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,360
So it would be nice to
spend some time with them,

720
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,340
but I'm not sure I want to
ever open another restaurant.

721
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:46,370
And so it's a lot of work and
I, you know, I'm getting old.

722
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,580
I don't want to stand that
long anymore. Um, you know,

723
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:54,260
I've been standing for 15 hours a day
for about 20 years. I'm tired. Uh,

724
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,330
restaurants are really,
really hard work.

725
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,890
So it's been fascinating.

726
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:03,610
As someone who likes going to restaurants
to hear about your experiences and

727
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:04,444
your opinions,

728
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:09,590
it was really curious about what you
think about takeout and delivery because

729
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:13,810
that's like a big thing. I wonder what
you is a restaurant. I think about that.

730
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,310
I mean I think it's great cause I eat
it when I'm not working all the time,

731
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:21,480
so thank goodness for seamless.
I don't know what I would do. Um,

732
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,370
you know, it's, it's almost
like takeout and delivery.

733
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,790
It's like there's two different dudes.
It gets like they don't,

734
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,270
they're not the same. We can't
do delivery from dirt candy. Um,

735
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:38,790
because our portions only looked
normal sized in the restaurant.

736
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,050
I don't know if it's because
of the plane size or what,

737
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,100
but he to talk it up and tell me, it's
like, I'll take that to go rob. He's like,

738
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,330
Huh, how did that fit in that tiny
little container, three weeks making it.

739
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:56,340
Um, so it is really, really different.

740
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,440
Uh, I missed sorta like the Taiko model
though and delivery and all those sort of

741
00:43:01,441 --> 00:43:02,101
like quick service.

742
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:07,101
Restaurants are great and they have found
this way to make portions decent size.

743
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:13,200
They get you through fast enough and it
sort of at satisfying comfort moment,

744
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,320
but it's really, really different
than going out to eat in a restaurant.

745
00:43:16,321 --> 00:43:19,980
And I do think because people,
uh, especially in New York,

746
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,040
there is so much takeout and delivery,
um,

747
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,510
it changes your expectations
at a restaurant.

748
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,270
You forget that you're
there for the experience.

749
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,480
And to me there with company and to
have a bottle of wine or cocktails or

750
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:35,040
whatever it is and uh, you know, really
sit and enjoy the moment versus, you know,

751
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:39,660
getting something really fast and eating
it at your desk or in front of the TV

752
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:41,560
and being finished with it.
Um,

753
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,760
and because there's so many takeout
and delivery kind of places it has,

754
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,530
I do think change the way people,
even restaurants.

755
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,490
Yeah,
for sure.

756
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:57,860
Any other questions before we wrap up?
Go for it.

757
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,530
Oh wait, what's your goto
seamless order? I have to ask. Um,

758
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,150
problem. Well, we had a
lot of fights about it.

759
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,640
You know what, I'm tired of. Every time
we find a restaurant and we really like,

760
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:22,110
I swear like the next week it's gone.
What happened to you?

761
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,320
Uh, we have a Thai place on her
corner, but it's pretty good.

762
00:44:25,321 --> 00:44:27,180
And then I feel really bad
saying if on our corner I'm like,

763
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:30,930
how can I not go out and pick it up
myself? It's like a block and a half away,

764
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,520
but I'm still like, no,
you're going to come.

765
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,880
That was wondering whether as running a
vegetarian restaurant and you feel that

766
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:43,020
there's a pricing pressure where customers
in New York are willing to pay more.

767
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,500
If there's a fancy piece of meat
on the plate, then they will,

768
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,940
if you put even more Labor into making a
really nice vegetable, but B, they say,

769
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,580
oh, it's just a vegetable.
I don't need to pay for it.

770
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,170
Are you in my brain? Yeah,
I mean that's actually,

771
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:01,010
I think one of the really big
problems with the restaurant. Um,

772
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,260
we sort of have this price price point.
We can't go above,

773
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:07,800
which is like $22 $23.

774
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:12,800
And if that's sort of the cutoff point
after that, we will see in reviews. I go,

775
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,700
I'm not going to pay
that much for this food.

776
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,110
But I do think if I had that
same dish at a steak house,

777
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,970
I could probably charge $30 and nobody
would sort of think twice about it.

778
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,940
It is where you're eating and what
sort of getting served next to it.

779
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,940
One of the really hard things
with vegetables, and this
is my fault and you know,

780
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:32,610
it's my restaurant, it's what
I do. But they are revealing,

781
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,190
labor-intensive and like,
can you think like, oh,

782
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,770
I put a whole piece of meat in
the oven and I just cook it. Well,

783
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:42,690
every single carrot has to be peeled
and diced and cooked and done something

784
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:47,580
else to it. Um, and so that,
that Labor difference is huge.

785
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:49,920
Like people will walk into my
kitchen and be like, oh my God,

786
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:52,710
there's so many of you here. I'm like,
I know, I'm so embarrassed. I'm like,

787
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:56,250
why am I embarrassed? Um, so just that,

788
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,700
that difference. Yeah, I mean if I, I,

789
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,760
I truly believe if I put a
piece of fish on my menu,

790
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:06,180
I can raise all my is by a couple of
dollars and November when we were like,

791
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,310
yeah, of course she serves
six. Nobody would order it,

792
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,980
but I hate that I would
have it. I'm like, oh,

793
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:15,150
it's not fish restaurant with lots of
vegetables you can charge $30 a plate.

794
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,170
What's your view on,
yeah,

795
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,180
local produce versus organic produce.

796
00:46:20,181 --> 00:46:23,690
I feel like a lot of the times
now it's a lot of farm to table.

797
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:27,800
Do you feel like that's a really important
element to have in a restaurant or

798
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:31,290
your a restaurant or do you, are
you comfortable with, you know,

799
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,300
any type of veteran?

800
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,160
I'm comfortable with any type
of vegetable. Uh, we, if you,

801
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,460
if you can afford it and you want
to buy organic grape, I can't,

802
00:46:40,461 --> 00:46:44,420
my prices would be ridiculously
high. Uh, we do some organic stuff.

803
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:48,290
A lot of our dairy is half
of our dry goods, but, and,

804
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,420
and certain produce items. But
for the most part, we're not, eh,

805
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,370
local when it's in season.
Great. But you know,

806
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,790
we live in the northeast
and even in, you know, I,

807
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,880
I wrote a whole piece about tomatoes and
how it's, you know, if you want it to me,

808
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:05,090
no, just go buy it. It's don't
feel guilty, better needed tomato,

809
00:47:05,091 --> 00:47:07,670
then something else in
the middle of winter. Um,

810
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,020
all food comes off a truck
in a box somewhere anyways.

811
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,560
Uh, we have a big enough problem in this
country that people don't eat enough

812
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:19,640
vegetables. Uh, New York might be
sort of outside of that, but you know,

813
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:24,641
the f a USDA statistics for how
much vegetables or eating really,

814
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:26,420
really depressing in this country.

815
00:47:26,421 --> 00:47:31,421
And the two most popular vegetables are
potato and tomato because it's French

816
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:36,520
fries and ketchup. And
so like, I'm like, yeah,

817
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:41,390
I'm not sure local is the issue. I'm just
getting people to eat vegetables. Um,

818
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,520
so yeah, when we can, we buy local,
but we can't always, and you know, my,

819
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,600
my goal is to get people to eat their
vegetables and once I can get them to do

820
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:53,350
that, maybe I'll try a little harder
with other things. Cool. Awesome.

821
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:55,270
We'll take one more question.
Yeah.

822
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,720
Um,
I live in the lower east side.

823
00:47:56,721 --> 00:47:59,380
I was wondering if you could talk
a little bit about, uh, sort of,

824
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:02,450
it's your choice of vocation and kind of
the restaurant scene in lower east side

825
00:48:02,451 --> 00:48:05,480
and sort of how you feel it compares to
other parts of the city and stuff. Like

826
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:09,270
I've only ever owned a restaurant in
the East village or the lower east side,

827
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:12,720
totally different neighborhoods
and they're actually very similar.

828
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,270
Uh,
the,

829
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:19,110
the thing with the lower east side is
it's probably one of the last areas where

830
00:48:19,111 --> 00:48:23,590
you can get a good deal on rent.
And that's why I chose it. Um, it's,

831
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:27,510
you know, rent is really
expensive in New York right now.

832
00:48:27,511 --> 00:48:32,490
So for my small space, which
was 350 square feet, uh,

833
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,130
my rent started off at $1,800,

834
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:40,230
which was really fair and decent and
eight years later it was that 4,000.

835
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:45,210
Wow. So those numbers just
don't make any sense. No.

836
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,990
10 blocks south, which is where
I am in the lower east side. Um,

837
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,830
I have about 2,500 square
feet and my rent is 10,000.

838
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,030
So that makes a lot more sense.
And married,

839
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:59,730
you can still get a really a good
rent deals. The restaurant scene,

840
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:02,010
I think in the lower east side,
east side is the most exciting.

841
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:06,580
The restaurants were really nice.
Um, I love being the spillage. Oh No,

842
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,140
they were mean over there.
Nobody wanted to take my broccoli.

843
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,600
Jewelries. Sigh. Everybody's
taking it now. They're really nice.

844
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:17,400
We have a really nice community of
restaurants and I think the food scene is

845
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:21,360
exciting and I think because
the rents are cheaper, um,

846
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,220
and you can sort of make a living,
people are more willing to take chances.

847
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,230
And so it's a lot of fun. There's
this, this really young, vibrant, uh,

848
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,990
feeling down there. Other neighborhoods
in the city to me seem really stagnant.

849
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,810
It seems like it's the same
restaurant opening over and again,

850
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,480
and I think in the lower east side
and you got to see a little bit more

851
00:49:39,481 --> 00:49:41,910
diversity.
Super Cool.

852
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,050
All right,
well that is it.

853
00:49:45,051 --> 00:49:50,051
Everyone should go stop by dirt candy and
make a reservation at 86 Allen Street.

854
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,220
Um, we also have some comic
book cookbooks for sale.

855
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:59,870
Google or discount for $5 so feel
free to grab one after the talk.

856
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,000
Amanda,
thank you so much for coming.

857
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,230
The food was amazing and I know I can
speak for myself and everyone else.

858
00:50:06,231 --> 00:50:09,050
This talk has been awesome getting
know. Thank you. Thank you.
