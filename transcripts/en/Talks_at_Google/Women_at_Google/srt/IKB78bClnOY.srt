1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So it's my pleasure to welcome my friend
Maura here today and we're so lucky to

2
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:13,280
have her with us.
She's a writer,

3
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:16,820
an academic who is currently part
of the Harvard Society of fellows.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,650
She just finished her phd at Yale, so we
should all congratulate her afterwards.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,810
And her work is fascinating.

6
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:28,811
It's at the intersection of social
theory along with histories of labor,

7
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:33,170
media and Technology in the 20th
and 21st centuries. Her book,

8
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:36,380
which we'll be talking about today,
is called Labor of love,

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,300
the invention of dating. And Maura
is also a founding editor of logic,

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,220
which is a new magazine about technology
or Weigel. Thank you for joining us.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,360
Thank you for having me. Whoo.
Okay, so just to kick it off,

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,400
I want to start by digging into the book
you've called the Book Labor of Love,

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,740
secretly an economic history.

14
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,930
What's the connection between economic
forces and dating and how has that played

15
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:05,270
out in the last century? Yeah, well,

16
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:09,170
there are a lot of connections between
economic forces and dating. I feel like,

17
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,063
um,

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,910
to backtrack to when I was first starting
to think about the book part of why,

19
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:15,680
you know,
contrary to what it might seem,

20
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:18,890
I wasn't always obsessed with dating or
at least not anymore than I think most

21
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:22,690
people up. We are. Um, and, but, uh,

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,930
one aspect of its history that really
interested me is that this practice that

23
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:31,730
we call dating that we might take for
granted as sort of like natural and not

24
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:35,720
think about is something historical is
actually like pretty new in human history.

25
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,820
If you look at most societies,
uh,

26
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,910
it's not been the case that young people
go out and meet one another on their

27
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:41,570
own.

28
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,370
And it's really only emerges when you
start to have large numbers of women in

29
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:49,550
the workforce. Dating is connected to the
economy in a number of different ways.

30
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,860
But one of the big ways and
part of why as a feminist,

31
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,000
I was excited to write about it,

32
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:57,260
is it only emerges as a practice when
you have large numbers of women going

33
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:58,094
outside the home,

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,190
going outside private space and the
public space earning their own money.

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,630
And we'll sort of like taking control of
their own romantic and sexual lives in

36
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:08,390
a way that really was pretty
unprecedented. I mean,

37
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:12,020
it's quite interesting because of
course this happens differently.

38
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:16,640
My Book's mostly about America, but
we can watch this happen in Asia, uh,

39
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:18,860
in a different way or like
an African a different way.

40
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:19,970
But it's the history of dating.

41
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:23,790
It's very tied to the history
of women entering paid work. Uh,

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,490
and then of course there
are some other ways too.

43
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:30,491
I think that the ways we think about love
and romance are like totally shaped in

44
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:35,120
a number of ways by the way. We think
about economics, uh, in terms of being,

45
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,010
you know, on the market,
off the market, hard to get.

46
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,390
These are all economic metaphors.

47
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,870
So I think there's a kind of economic
unconscious that how we think of a lot

48
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,900
about a lot of things about dating.
Absolutely.

49
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:49,820
So how has today's economy reflected
itself in this age of Tinder?

50
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,210
Um, what's the Gig at the
sexual gig economy like? Um,

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,770
I think that, uh, I think that, you
know, like every other aspect, our lives,

52
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:04,560
our romantic and sexual lives are
becoming more flexible and uh,

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,000
this has both positive
and negative aspects.

54
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,750
I feel like one reason I wanted to write
the book was to push back against all

55
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:15,400
these kinds of doom and gloom
and narratives about dating
apps and online dating.

56
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:19,960
I feel like around 2012, 2013, when
I was first starting in 2013, 2014,

57
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,850
when it's frustrating to
think about these questions,

58
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,030
there were a series of how it
high profile stories in books.

59
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,960
I don't know if folks had like mom's
send these to them or saw them in another

60
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,640
way, but there was like this big end of
men story. Uh, that was in the Atlantic.

61
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,940
There was a huge New York Times
story called the end of courtship.

62
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,500
There's all this anxiety
about hookup culture and uh,

63
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,430
and I'm always interested in these
conversations about crisis because I think

64
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:49,330
it's where people actually articulate
what they believe men should be and women

65
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:53,980
should be. So I'm always very suspicious
of them. But at that time anyway,

66
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,490
I was interested in all these articles
that were basically like, you know,

67
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:00,610
humans have always met and fallen
in love in this, in this way.

68
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:04,210
And ever since cavemen days, this is
how men and women were until Tinder.

69
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,630
And like now everything's over.
This is like a historian. And as,

70
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,980
as a young person who is still dating
this seem suspicious to me. Uh,

71
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,170
so I wanted part of why I want it to
do this research was I was like, well,

72
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,560
it can't really be the end of sex and
the end of men and they end up loving the

73
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:22,090
end of courtship all because of
Tinder. Um, so what's behind that? Uh,

74
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:22,661
so anyway,

75
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:27,100
that was wanting to push back against
that narrative of like crisis around

76
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,980
courtship was part of how I
got into this project. Yeah.

77
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:32,080
That's something that really
fascinated me about the book.

78
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,930
It felt like there were these moments
of crisis every time there was new

79
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:37,330
technology.
And I actually found it pretty comforting.

80
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,990
So you talked in the book about
how when the automobile came out,

81
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,790
people were like,
this is the end of morality.

82
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,060
And at the different stages people
had this moral hand ringing.

83
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:50,560
So I would love if you could
talk us through some of
those moments and then also

84
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:53,380
tell us like, is there even such
thing as traditional courtship,

85
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,840
this idea that people seem
to think is being lost?

86
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,140
Is that even something that
exists? Yeah. So totally.

87
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,960
So this will either be really comforting
or really depressing depending on how

88
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:02,651
you think about it.

89
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:06,100
But one of the interesting things
about the history of dating is that,

90
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:09,970
and I start to talk about it by the way,
people often, I call it in the subtitle,

91
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:12,250
the invention of dating. And people
are like, well, what does that mean?

92
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:16,330
Having people always dated, and I
joke that dating was invented in 1896.

93
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:19,060
This is the first time that we
see it and the print record, uh,

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,500
being used that word in the way that we
use it now. Um, but basically, and again,

95
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:24,311
as I was saying earlier,

96
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:28,150
it's tied to like women entering the
workplace and young people in general

97
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:32,140
moving to cities and this new kind of
urban culture that you have emerging in

98
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:35,800
that period.
But when you go back into the history,

99
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,770
the thing that is either comforting or
depressing depending how you think about

100
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,010
it,

101
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,010
is there has never been any time or place
in which people are like dating great,

102
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:47,830
killing it. I'm sure I'm doing it
right. All the kids are doing it right.

103
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:50,260
We're not worried about them at
all. It's constantly, you know,

104
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,540
from the very beginning of dating,
dating,

105
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,290
dating is said to be dying or in crisis.
Um,

106
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,430
and one of my favorite research things
is that I learned that during the first

107
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:02,240
decade or so that you have
women going out with men, uh,

108
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:06,050
on what we would now think of as the
most traditional looking kind of date,

109
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,020
like going out to dinner,
going out to a movie, uh,

110
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:12,380
that the first one who do this are often
were arrested on prostitution charges.

111
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,640
Um, and a lot of the early research I did
was in like vice squad reports because

112
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:21,641
there was no precedent for women going
out on their own with men at or for money

113
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:26,090
being transacted in courtship. Like
when you think of a Jane Austin novel,

114
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,160
Mr Darcy isn't buying anything.

115
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,830
He's just like going into her living
room and hanging out with her mom,

116
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,920
Elizabeth, that that's
her name. Um, so anyway,

117
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:35,810
I think that like back
in the very beginning,

118
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:38,240
like the very first period where
you have this thing called dating,

119
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,440
you have not just handwringing but
literally like arrests and people being

120
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,030
dragged off to reformatory.

121
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:47,660
And then throughout the history there's
this constant kind of overtone of

122
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:51,410
anxiety both from the grownups and from
the people who are participating in

123
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,990
dating. Because one thing that's
distinctive is nobody ever knows.

124
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,760
Unlike courtship systems when it,

125
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,940
where it's controlled by parents or
by rabbis or priests or whomever,

126
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,420
a defining feature of dating
is that nobody knows exactly
how you're supposed to

127
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,940
do it. And that's always been true. Right?

128
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:07,190
So let's paint a picture for
people who haven't read the book.

129
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,120
What came before dating. Yeah.
Uh, so in the book, you know,

130
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:15,680
of course everywhere has their own
variables and their own situations,

131
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:19,970
but the dominant middle class system of
courtship and the 19th century is called

132
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:23,810
calling. Uh, and again, it's
the Jane Austen scenario, right?

133
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,010
You like sit in your living
room, your mom, your aunt,

134
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,640
your sisters are there gentlemen
callers can come visit you. Uh,

135
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:33,050
it's almost is since I'm an academic,
I always think of it as a kind of awkward,

136
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:36,860
like office hours, no magic kind of
situation whenever it goes to that.

137
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,230
Um, no one wants to go to my
office hours. Oh. But yeah,

138
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,330
so calling and calling is,

139
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,660
as a system of courtship is
symbolically important. I mean,

140
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:49,940
I believe that all of our
social practices and code,

141
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:54,941
all kinds of beliefs about how we think
the world works and what kinds of roles

142
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,630
different people should perform. But it
locates courtship in the home. Right?

143
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,990
So it's like in the territory of
the family, it's being supervised.

144
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,410
It is supposed to be noneconomic.
No money is exchanged. I mean,

145
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:07,730
I think that's very interesting as it,

146
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:12,620
it's also very much understood to
be in control of the women. Uh,

147
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,430
I read there's an advice column
and the Ladies Home Journal,

148
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:21,050
which is like the most popular magazine
in the world around 1900 and there's an

149
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,990
advice columnist called the
lady from Philadelphia who,

150
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,760
and who answers people's
romantic questions and she
would get these letters from

151
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:33,500
young men saying, oh, can I go call on
a young woman if she hasn't invited me?

152
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,450
And The lady from Philadelphia,

153
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,990
contrary to our belief that men are
always the initiators is absolutely not.

154
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,790
You know, you can, if a woman
doesn't want to see you,

155
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,310
you can't go show up at her
house in this way. So there's,

156
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:47,810
it's important sense in which the calling
system makes women like the hosts of

157
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:51,620
courtship. Uh, and this
dramatically changes when people,

158
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,010
when portrait moves from the Living Room
with mom and dad into the public sphere,

159
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,490
which historically has been seen as
the sphere of men, the year of money,

160
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,510
the three of the market.

161
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,260
So it's the predecessor to bumble
women have to make the first move.

162
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,280
Something like that.
I think about it.

163
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,980
I want to hear if your mom
were on bumble maybe. Great.

164
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:11,341
So we'll,

165
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:15,030
we'll talk about that in a little bit in
terms of these ideas that we think are

166
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:19,950
deep seated into our DNA and actually
are relatively new inventions.

167
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,240
So one thing I read was that
you had initially thought
of things like dating and

168
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:28,980
relationships as maybe too silly or
trivial to warrant serious study.

169
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,790
How did you change and come
to write this book? Yeah,

170
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,780
well this book as my phd supervisor be
happy to tell you it was a distraction

171
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:40,510
from my main h d research. It wasn't
what I was supposed to be working on it,

172
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:44,040
you know, where I was in Grad
school. Uh, I feel like, again,

173
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,620
about this time when there were
all these stories coming out,

174
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:49,380
which I see in a way as a
reaction to the financial crisis,

175
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,370
and we could have a longer conversation
about this, but why around 2013, 2014,

176
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,890
there was all this anxiety
in the air about like,

177
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,530
men are an acting like men
and women aren't, you know,

178
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,360
kids aren't dating properly. But in that
moment, um, and I was in Grad School,

179
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,600
I was getting trained in all these
ways of looking at theory and history.

180
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:08,010
But of course on my own time,

181
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:11,480
I spent all my time with my
friends talking about love
and sex and romance soon,

182
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,960
if not all of it,
but quite a lot of it.

183
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,380
And I feel as if I came to this
point where I realized like,

184
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:20,220
we're all developing these
huge intellectual tool kits
to look at certain kinds

185
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:23,070
of questions. Um, but why, you know,

186
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:26,490
why don't we take this other
kind of questions seriously.

187
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:29,760
And I think in a very
deep way, um, you know,

188
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:34,761
dating for better or worse is the system
that our culture has in place for like

189
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,780
reproducing the world,

190
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,140
like forming social bonds for
intern biological reproduction,

191
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,670
for setting up a kinship networks.

192
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,880
Like there's very little that's
more serious than that actually.

193
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,380
And I think that there's actually
something really kind of sexist and

194
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:55,950
conservative about treating some of
these topics is if they don't warrant

195
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,230
serious intellectual consideration.

196
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:01,530
I mean I think it's kind of funny
to have this whole cultural system,

197
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,660
especially if you're a straight woman
where you've grown up, you know,

198
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:07,920
your whole life with magazines and movies
and books and all of these cultural

199
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,920
signals telling you, you know,
here's what you should want.

200
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,690
Here's how you should be
if you want to be loved,

201
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:15,090
which by the way is like the
most important thing about you.

202
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,880
And then the minute that you're
like, ah, I have a question,

203
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,490
I have a question about that.
It's like it's not serious. Don't,

204
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,830
don't waste serious intellectual
energy looking at this.

205
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,360
So I feel as if I came to the project
kind of extra curricularly in graduate

206
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:32,100
school. But then once I started thinking
about it and all the ways that, um,

207
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,110
that are romantic beliefs are in
meshed and like deep social beliefs,

208
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:38,730
historical practices,
that kind of thing,

209
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:43,290
I really felt like it felt important to
take like a serious intellectual lens to

210
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,950
look at the sources of these messages
and the work they were doing in terms of

211
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:50,660
teaching us to desire. Well, I'm so glad
you did write the book. Oh, thank you.

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,830
I was wondering if you would read this
passage us and then I have a followup

213
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,683
question on it.

214
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,710
Ooh, look at this. All right.

215
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,630
I began to feel a need to write this
book when I sensed that I was trying to

216
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:10,631
make a life according to rules I did
not understand and that the process had

217
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:15,701
blinded me to mind desires following
my desires was supposed to be the point

218
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,200
did, I had never reflected long enough
to discover whether the feelings that I

219
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:26,000
believe should be there actually
where I had no idea who I was.

220
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,740
And as long as I kept impersonating
all the women I thought I should be,

221
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,290
I could not receive
love much less give it,

222
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,800
I had no self to choose to give it from.

223
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,070
Yeah,

224
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,090
she was still. So have you ever feel
moved to laughter? It seems like,

225
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,620
I'm trying to be funny,
just like,

226
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,020
so based on that passage and based on
what you know now, I'd love to ask you,

227
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:55,021
what advice would you give 16 year old
Maura and more broadly if you could

228
00:12:55,301 --> 00:13:00,040
design a class that every high school
girl had to take before entering adult

229
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,990
relationships, what would you
include in that course? Okay,

230
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,730
these are big questions.
Um, I think, I think that,

231
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:09,400
and I'd be very curious to hear from
people here. I think what's interesting,

232
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:14,290
if you're a certain kind of ambitious
[inaudible] sort of like high achieving

233
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,730
straight woman,
especially,

234
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,000
you received this one set of messages
about your career and you're supposed to

235
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:21,550
be confident in your soul to be
able to act in all these ways.

236
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,180
And then you receive basically
opposite messages about your love life.

237
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,610
And indeed, not only are you
not supposed to show initiative,

238
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,910
you're supposed to do all this extra
work to like cover up the fact that you

239
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,550
have that you have those traits.
Um,

240
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,240
so I feel as if if I,

241
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,860
I mean 16 year old more like who
knows what could have helped.

242
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,080
But if I good think about could have
known anything earlier, I think,

243
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,151
I don't know,

244
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:51,151
I would have liked to be more aware of
the ways in which these rules that are

245
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:56,050
given to us and these things that
we're taught about how to be,

246
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,420
if we want to be desirable,
um,

247
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,730
serve all these incentives that are
not necessarily our own. I mean,

248
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,560
it's an excellent way to sell
women things like anxiety.

249
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:07,650
It's like tell them woman that's something
that she didn't even know was a thing

250
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,530
wrong with her and then sell
her the thing to fix it.

251
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:14,820
It's like an engine of quite a lot of
the economy in general. But I feel as if,

252
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,320
um,
yeah,

253
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:21,321
this way in which you get so many
messages that are also always about like

254
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,660
repressing your own feelings. Like, if
you think, and we can talk about this,

255
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:28,980
but do you think about how many self help
franchises are basically like whatever

256
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:32,010
you might feel like doing, do the
opposite thing. Like don't do that.

257
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:34,720
Don't show your feelings,
don't express your desires. Um,

258
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,740
I think being aware of the ways in which
that grew out of history that's deeply

259
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:43,890
sexist and certain institutions and
practices that are deeply sexist is would

260
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,540
have been helpful and probably would've
made me less anxious and self Hayden and

261
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:53,090
various moments. Um, but it was the other
thing is syllabus. Yeah. So I think,

262
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,350
I mean it's kind of a combination.

263
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,470
It's like what would 16 year old Maura
have benefited from knowing with what you

264
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:00,140
know now, but what would women
in general benefit from knowing?

265
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,380
And I think the answer of just be
skeptical of somebody telling you that

266
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:06,470
something's wrong with you and then
trying to sell you something to fix it is

267
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,720
good advice for all of us.
And I think also,

268
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:12,140
and it's hard for us to do
and it's especially hard
to do in romance because we

269
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:14,810
all have so much at stake personally
and want to make things work,

270
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,910
but also to think structurally
and systemically sometimes
can be very helpful.

271
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,510
And I think that this is the opposite
of what we usually want from self help.

272
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,760
Usually what we want is a totally normal,

273
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:29,540
fair thing to want as we were like what
are the 10 tricks that will like help me

274
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,110
navigate this situation, you know,
whether it's professional or personal.

275
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,820
But I think that what is
exciting and radicalizing,

276
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:41,120
I'm like liberating about studying history
is you see how many of these issues

277
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:45,140
and problems are in fact
structural and social. Um,

278
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,550
and you know,

279
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:50,900
there's quite a lot of work left to
do before women are romantic equals or

280
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:54,770
equals of any kind, um, in, in
all kinds of social situations.

281
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:59,010
It's substantively and meaningfully and
those solutions can all be done by like

282
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,380
working on yourself personally.

283
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,840
Is that a real pep talk that you've
given your friends where they're like,

284
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:05,450
what's wrong with me? And then
you're like, it's not you,

285
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,870
it's market forces and society and 100
years of sexist institutions that have

286
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:14,390
contributed to where you are today.
More than a hundred.

287
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,190
I feel like,
I think that

288
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,440
I have my, trying to think of specific
friend and specific pep talks.

289
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:30,580
I mean I think this sense in which like
the answer that we get is so often like

290
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:33,370
work a little harder on yourself.
Do a little bit more about this.

291
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,180
I think that the idea that it's like
that's not the problem isn't always you is

292
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:40,120
certainly a thing that I've
stressed to friends. Um,

293
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,540
whether I talk about market forces when
we're putting up there and I hope I

294
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,790
don't. Um, but yeah,

295
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,300
so I want to talk a little bit more
about what you mentioned about self help

296
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,000
books.

297
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,770
So you make this really great point in
your book that if you go to a bookstore

298
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,370
and you walked down the self help I all
on your left hand side you might see are

299
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,290
all the career books that tell you lean
in work harder, don't speak with uptalk.

300
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,070
And it's all about like really
putting effort in toward your career.

301
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,010
And then on the righthand side could be
all of these books about your love life

302
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:13,260
that say whatever you want to do, do the
opposite and not him. It's you. Yeah.

303
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,870
I think I'll quote you here when you
said, um, if you want to call him, don't,

304
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,220
if you want to sleep with him,
don't,

305
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,170
if you slept with him and you want to
call him afterwards, don't, and it's true,

306
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,980
it's like the rules is
literally 32 chapters each
one of which is like don't do

307
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,750
this thing they want to do.
Right.

308
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:32,950
So I think it's fascinating
to just explore how on one
hand we're being told to

309
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,100
put so much effort in. And on the
other hand we're told to be passive.

310
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,960
So how do you navigate that tension?
Wow, that's a big question. I mean,

311
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,780
I think that again, to look to history,
like a thing that interests me.

312
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,690
To go back to the beginning when we
were saying how this whole phenomenon of

313
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:51,030
dating is predicated on women being in
the being like mobile in cities having

314
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:55,150
certain kinds of agency that we hadn't
had historically that it's been,

315
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:58,650
that you start to see all this romantic
advice as almost like a reaction or an

316
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:02,520
attempt to control female sexual
sexuality given that it's no longer being

317
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:06,930
controlled by mom and dad and the
rabbi or the priest. I think that, um,

318
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,401
sorry.

319
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:13,350
I think that that perspective was very
interesting to get while researching the

320
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:13,710
book.

321
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,220
It was funny to look at 19th
century advice like advice
for calling cause people

322
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,380
were also anxious about calling,

323
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,530
but there wasn't this emphasis on deceit.

324
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,210
Like I feel like a
contemporary of self help.

325
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,240
There's so much emphasis and I mean
this by the way for straight people

326
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:30,090
fascinatingly self up for Queer people,
it was very different.

327
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,600
And I think shows how much of this is
about reinforcing certain binary gender

328
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:37,470
roles actually. But, um, there's
so much emphasis on, you know,

329
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:41,370
not showing too much about
how you feel or um, you know,

330
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,960
covering up your desire.

331
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:46,200
And this really only emerges
with dating and this earlier era,

332
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,040
there's much more emphasis on sort of
sincere self expression and straight

333
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,880
forwardness. And I think that in a
lot of ways from a macro perspective,

334
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:58,860
this is about controlling female sexuality
and how anxious it makes a culture

335
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:02,640
broadly for women to have certain kinds
of liberties that they hadn't had.

336
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,000
And also if you tell women men are
from Mars and women are from Venus,

337
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,000
it's a lot easier to sell both of them
above to explain the other jet. Yeah,

338
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:11,160
exactly. I feel like it's, um, very,

339
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:15,120
very many self help books and kind of be
summarized as like what dudes are like

340
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,590
by a dude.
And I was like,

341
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:21,030
what women are really like by a woman
that this sort of mutual mystification of

342
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:25,050
men and women to each other is a very
good engine for selling both sides things.

343
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,810
So this whole idea about women
needs to be passive in dating.

344
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:30,570
It's often chalked up to
this evolutionary legacy.

345
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,230
Can you talk a little bit about
that and kind of where some of that

346
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:38,850
pseudoscience emerges from and how that
impacts us today? Yeah. Well I think,

347
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,870
I don't know if folk scene,

348
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,110
I feel like maybe this trend has
peaked and gone down a little bit,

349
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:43,944
but I feel like the,

350
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,540
the sort of ebbs psych clickbait the
article that's like did men involved to

351
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:52,560
like women in high heels? Like yes, click
it. This is sort of like a kind of piece.

352
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,970
There's that new book that came out,

353
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:58,560
casual sex about how Tinder is affecting
monogamy and I think it reinforces a

354
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:02,010
lot of these ideas. So it's still, it
is that books, I haven't read it yet,

355
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:03,390
I just read an article about it.

356
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:07,920
But it was basically saying that like
men had to become monogamous in order to

357
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:11,370
get married, which gave them access
to women and an ability to reproduce.

358
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:15,210
But now with Tinder, men have this
easy access to sex when they want.

359
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:18,810
So there's this bifurcation between like
the place I go for sex in the place I

360
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:22,380
go for marriage, which is leading
fewer people to want marriage.

361
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,190
It's really amazing how many respectable
academics and scholars in 2017.

362
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,340
It's like never occurred to them
that women might also enjoy sex,

363
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,210
but it's like there's still this idea
that heterosexuality is like this

364
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:38,010
depressing truths whereby women give his
little sex as I can get away with for

365
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:39,190
affection.
Um,

366
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,100
and that men do the opposite
or the contrapositive or
whatever the mirror image

367
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:45,130
of that is.
Um,

368
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,180
I think that it's very comforting to
believe that certain phenomena are natural

369
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:56,900
or biological or hardwired in
like the Pleistocene era. Uh,

370
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,890
and we all love, we don't, I
don't, I love carbohydrates,

371
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:03,550
but many people love Paleo diets
are like this idea of, you know,

372
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:05,680
that something was natural and
it's how Cape people did it.

373
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,440
So it's how we should do it.
Um,

374
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,250
I think that this is very rarely they
useful framework for like explaining human

375
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:15,970
behavior. We're social creatures
or historical creatures. Um,

376
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,090
this isn't just some wishy washy
kind of social construction thing.

377
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:23,200
I mean brain scientists talk about the
plasticity of the brain and how quickly

378
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:27,040
it can change sellers of gene expression
to talk about how much environmental

379
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,940
factors trigger and shape, like which
genes express themselves or not.

380
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,970
So this idea that the
nature of heterosexuality,

381
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:38,560
it was like established by cave people
and we're still somehow acting that out

382
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:43,540
always to me seemed um,
very circular and all sorts of ways.

383
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,940
You know, it's often,
um, Stephen Jay Gould,

384
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:47,470
who's the evolutionary
biologist at Harvard.

385
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:50,440
Describe this kind of story
is just so stories, um,

386
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,670
but also like just not that useful and
mode of explanation as I was suggesting

387
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:55,001
earlier.

388
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:59,680
I can look back at advice columns from
like 1905 and they say totally different

389
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:03,580
things to what we say now about who
should take the initiative in a courtship

390
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,320
situation or whose role it is.

391
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:10,321
So I think that like humans are much
stranger and more flexible then this kind

392
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:13,210
of narrative suggest and it's really
comforting sometimes I think it's kind of

393
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:15,280
Ed psych narratives are
comforting to everybody.

394
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,100
It's like if you are a conservative,
you know,

395
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,960
if you're a conservative
and certain gender beliefs,

396
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:23,440
it's reassuring to think like,
oh, things won't change that much.

397
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,240
This is how people are.
Um,

398
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,990
and if you're frustrated
by the lack of progress,

399
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:33,430
it's like your boyfriend's not a jerky
evolve not to pick up the dry cleaning,

400
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,140
you know? Um, so I think
that these narratives are
very appealing as clickbait,

401
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:40,150
but I think that they don't really,

402
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,600
they're not very useful actually in
terms of their explanatory power.

403
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,590
And there've been many
critiques within academia of,

404
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,810
of evolutionary psychology specifically.
It's funny,

405
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:54,190
this is one of these modes of thought
that's like existed in its popularized for

406
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:58,930
much beyond a much longer
than it's existed and it's
institutionalized academic

407
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,850
form.
I love how you call it clickbait.

408
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,330
And I think it's interesting to note
that it's neither helpful for explaining

409
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,190
gender roles in dating nor for why there
are fewer female engineers at places

410
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:12,970
like Google or do there.
Um, is there a question?

411
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,110
Implicit question and implicit
question. Um, yeah, I think that,

412
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,940
I mean this is a very, a very charged
lead to talk about here. Again,

413
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:29,941
I would just say I think that explanations
that refer to some kind of absolute

414
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:34,060
natural disposition or like
not usually very useful.

415
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:37,730
And usually when you go back to the
scientists who were being cited, um,

416
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,330
do not hold up to scrutiny.
I think that it's, you know,

417
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:43,300
there are gender distributions.
It's not that there is no, um,

418
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,000
there are differences among genders,
but I think that usually it'll be like,

419
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:47,990
you know,

420
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,190
the brain scientists when you ask them
say 10% of this differences due to gender

421
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:54,110
and 90% of it is due to other factors.

422
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:58,130
There are more differences among people
button and this one class then across

423
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:00,170
the classes.
So I think that again,

424
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:03,350
it's reassuring to certain
people to believe that, you know,

425
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:06,920
what is natural is good and that nature
sanctions a certain kind of social order.

426
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,580
But, um, but I think this is usually not
a very useful and certainly not a very

427
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:14,510
progressive way to think
about our relations as humans.

428
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,980
So I just want to underline your point,

429
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:19,370
which is that if anyone does point to
these things like women being passive and

430
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:22,580
men being the aggressor and
relationships as natural,

431
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,910
like even looking back a hundred years,
things were totally different.

432
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:29,380
So it isn't really based in
history. Yeah, no indeed.

433
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,010
History provides plenty of cadre examples.

434
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,040
I mean that's what's so cool to me and
exciting about studying history is like

435
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,310
it's so much weirder than you think in
our social arrangements are so much more

436
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:40,730
contingent than you might imagine,
which also means that they can be changed.

437
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,470
Incidentally,
I'm sure everyone here knows this,

438
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:45,440
but programming is originally a
female profession predominantly.

439
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:47,490
There's a great new book
about this by my friend,

440
00:24:47,491 --> 00:24:51,230
so I'm going to tout it called the
program didn't quality about sort of the

441
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:53,690
pushing out. I've been doing a
little research at MIT on this,

442
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:57,110
but the pushing out of female programmers
and the 1980s basically from their

443
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:57,531
profession.

444
00:24:57,531 --> 00:25:02,150
So the idea that the current gender
distribution reflects some sort of like

445
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:06,500
timeless biological reality rather than
a certain set of social arrangements to

446
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:09,780
me seems pretty, pretty tenuous. When
you look at it as recently as you know,

447
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,280
1972 in the 1980s the gender
distributions with that different,

448
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,500
I'm excited to talk to you
about that later. Yeah.

449
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,000
Take that microphone off and talk
about later in this conversation you've

450
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:21,830
identified yourself as a feminist,

451
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,240
but I read or I heard in another
interview you did that you didn't always

452
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,930
identify as a feminist and in fact you
felt like you could sort of overachieve

453
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,810
your way out of these
glass ceilings situations.

454
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,530
What's been your journey from feeling
like that was a possibility to where you

455
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:39,980
are now? Yeah, I think, I love
this question. I feel like,

456
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,260
I mean I'd be very curious.
I want to put anyone on the spot,

457
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:45,240
like who identifies as a feminist here.
Yeah.

458
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,630
I mean I think most of the room,
most of the room. Yeah. Um, I think,

459
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,030
did anyone else, maybe this is a
question people have to think through,

460
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:56,960
but experienced this thing of like not
identifying that way and then in their

461
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,310
twenties they're like in a later life
period coming to identify that way. Yeah.

462
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,050
Because I think the only thing that makes
me feel less embarrassed of how long

463
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:09,830
it took me to identify that way is how
many brilliant women I know who say

464
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:14,720
something similar. Um, I think that
part of it, I'm sure, you know,

465
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:17,570
I grew up in the 90s I'm sure part of
it was like the historical mood when I

466
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:20,720
grew up, but I also think
until you reach a certain age,

467
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,380
there's this way that you imagined as
a young woman of a certain kind that if

468
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:28,150
you're just good enough, if you're just
good enough, it won't apply to you. Um,

469
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,590
it's amazing looking. I mean, I,

470
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,010
I'm thinking about this because of the
Harvey Weinstein stuff today. I mean,

471
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:37,490
it's amazing when I think about how many
women I admire have since we've gotten

472
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:37,941
a bit older,

473
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:40,190
talked about getting sexually harassed
at work and it was his stomach and

474
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:44,730
prevalent that is, but I think that
when you're younger, you just, you know,

475
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:47,340
if I just do this right or if I'm just
smart enough, I'm just good enough,

476
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:48,420
surely this won't apply to me.

477
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:52,740
And nobody wants to identify with the
class that systematically disadvantaged,

478
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:53,281
you know,
nobody.

479
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:56,430
And this comes back to your question about
what's trivialized and what's treated

480
00:26:56,431 --> 00:27:00,870
as on and sort of pink and
frilly. It's female things. Um,

481
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,940
so I think that,
gosh,

482
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:06,420
it's hard for me to pinpoint the moment
and I do think something the zeitgeists

483
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:08,280
change.
Like if we look at that moment,

484
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,270
I always think of Beyonce
at the Vietnamese in front
of the big feminist to sign

485
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,590
that there were many things in the air
and like 2013, 2014, I think, you know,

486
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,910
lean in Sheryl Sandberg's
book, uh, all sorts of,

487
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,610
of other cultural signals suggested
that feminism was like trends.

488
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,020
He for the first time in our lives.
I'm sure that influenced me,

489
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,620
but I think that aided a lot of it
is just growing up and entering more

490
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:33,750
professional situations
are more adult situations.

491
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:38,610
When you realize that you
can't overachieve your way
out of out of like anything

492
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:40,350
or everything,
but it's like these,

493
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,020
these structural things do
indeed apply to you. Um,

494
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,910
and no matter how excellent you may be.
And of course this applies,

495
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:50,760
it goes that saying across intersectional
identities, it's not just women.

496
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:54,600
I mean this is true for all kinds of,
of groups that are historically oppressed.

497
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,990
But I think that, yeah, I
think it was the experiences,

498
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,060
my twenties and also dating
really terrible if I'm honest,

499
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,390
but both in work and in love.
Um,

500
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,170
I think that I came to that really
realization or did that identification

501
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,093
belatedly.

502
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,500
Yeah. I mean, this really
resonates with me every,

503
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:14,490
I mean we're similar ages and everything
you said about like if you grow up on

504
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,060
the power puff girls and spice girls
and girl power and being told that girls

505
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:18,871
can do anything,

506
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:23,520
you sort of believe it and you don't want
to identify with people who are having

507
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:25,710
a harder time and maybe
you haven't experienced it,

508
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,090
but at a certain point being the
teacher's pet or doing everything right,

509
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:33,120
like it doesn't necessarily serve you
and there's like structural things that

510
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:36,840
are actually affecting you at
work or affecting you in academia.

511
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,520
And I even feel like in Silicon Valley
a lot of risk taking behavior is really

512
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,210
valued,

513
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,680
which in some ways is at odds with this
teacher pet teacher's pet persona that a

514
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:49,680
lot of women are forced into.
So it's something I've been observing,

515
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:52,260
which is for women to be
successful and take risks,

516
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,880
they almost have to shed that teacher's
pet persona that they were praised for

517
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:59,520
for, you know, the first 18
or 22 years of their lives.

518
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,560
It makes sense. And of course when
this runs into issues with age too,

519
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:08,010
but it's easier to take risks if you have
no caring responsibilities or children

520
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:10,590
or other kinds of things that are
disproportionately put on women.

521
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:14,220
So of course this value that's
placed on risk taking, um,

522
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,030
has certain gendered elements as well.
But it's true. I think, you know,

523
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,710
I was raised to be a very good girl.

524
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:22,320
It was a very good girl for a long time
and you sort of do everything you're

525
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:26,250
supposed to and realize that it
nonetheless doesn't get you out of this,

526
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,440
you know,
the situation situation.

527
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:32,040
You might be an odd that that experience
can be very radicalizing. Yeah.

528
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:35,460
And I think I realized this became a
plotline on the show insecure recently,

529
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:37,300
which I'm a big fan. I love it. See what,

530
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:40,440
what part should date of like how
much I realized I thought in shouldn't

531
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:45,070
statements. It's like, oh, I should I talk
about, are you a Molly? I guess so. Yeah.

532
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,860
I didn't know if I'd claim
to be a full mile, you know,

533
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:49,840
I don't know if I get to claim that,
but I definitely,

534
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,820
and I opened the book talking about this,

535
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:55,270
but I realized that I thought so much
about like what I should watch or what I

536
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:59,680
should want to do or what I should be
doing while my was I doing the right

537
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,680
things and that it's really hard to
shake that and be like, what kind of,

538
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,200
you can't shoot about a want,
what do you want?

539
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,920
But that were very socialized to think
about what it's like the good thing to do

540
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:10,030
or the right thing to do.

541
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,290
Right. I mean that feels like a very
familiar narrative. If I do these things,

542
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:17,850
I will be desirable.
Versus like what do I desire and how.

543
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:20,700
Oftentimes when I debrief with
people after they go on dates,

544
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:23,730
they talk all about whether or not
the person's seemed interested,

545
00:30:23,731 --> 00:30:26,970
but they don't get to the point where
did they like that person or not.

546
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,460
And I try to kind of
get them to that point.

547
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:32,820
But it's interesting that our brains
don't naturally say like, what do I want?

548
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:36,380
It's what should I want? Or how
can I get them to want me? Yeah.

549
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,570
So something that we're working
through. Absolutely. Yeah.

550
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,220
So we've talked a lot about how dating
is this arena where people play out these

551
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,520
gender roles and we have
these scripts we've inherited,

552
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:50,970
whether it's through books
or culture or movies.

553
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:56,220
If people in this room or people watching
online want to flip those scripts,

554
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,440
what are some things that we can
do? Wow. I really do you think

555
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,910
a recurring theme that I came across
in the different areas is that despite

556
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,330
this, um, tendency of the
self help industry to miss,

557
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:13,040
if I men and women to each other actually
like most humans want more similar

558
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:14,000
things.
You know,

559
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:18,380
like most humans want some combination
of like sex and intimacy and respect and

560
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:19,214
communication.

561
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:24,550
And there that I think that one of the
most harmful scripts is this idea that

562
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:28,160
men and women are sort of essentially
at odds and that all gender and sexual

563
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:31,700
relations or this said compromise, um, of,

564
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,940
of women for whom sex is like work.
And you know,

565
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:38,060
for men it's like correct creation or
something, but that's a whole other topic.

566
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:43,270
So I think that like it's really
important to get out of that script.

567
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:47,300
And I think, um, yeah, I don't know.

568
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:52,100
I think there's so much like gamification
of they or this idea that it's a game

569
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:54,080
where you master the,
I mean the rules and the game.

570
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,080
These are the two most successful dating
franchises of the past decade or so.

571
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:04,841
But I think that sort of trying to get
beyond these sort of games and this idea

572
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:09,110
that partners are mysterious
to one another and,

573
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:12,830
and do this like slightly more challenging
emotional work of being in touch with

574
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:17,060
one's own desires is sort of like the
most fundamentally important thing and

575
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:21,890
scripts. I mean in some of the research
that I cover on hookup culture,

576
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,310
it's so funny you get these young
men again and again saying like,

577
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:28,880
well I imagine everyone else just having
so much sex and like I feel sad but I

578
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:31,160
shouldn't because I'm a man and this is,
you know,

579
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:33,890
this is what men are supposed to want.
And it's like first of all,

580
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,240
none of your classmates are having as
much sex as you think they are or very few

581
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:42,440
of them. And second of all you
can't shut about a lot. You know,

582
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:45,410
if you feel sad about this and you feel
you shouldn't because you're supposed to

583
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:48,050
be masculine and it's not masculine.
I'm Matt.

584
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,220
That belief again about this absolute
gender difference in different aims is

585
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,600
producing a lot of unhappiness.

586
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:55,910
It's actually very counter
productive for everyone involved.

587
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,220
Do you feel optimistic about
the generation younger than
us? Yeah, I think I do.

588
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:04,160
I think I do. I think the kids are all
right. I mean I think that, you know,

589
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,270
we have to,

590
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,060
we always have to think about class
difference in geographic differences and

591
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:09,500
it's very hard to generalize.

592
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,660
But I think the generation below us has
better gender and sexual politics than I

593
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,980
did at their age anyway.

594
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:20,210
I think that there's a way in which
the Internet is creating new kinds of

595
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:24,020
discourse and awareness.
Um, I think that there is,

596
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,950
despite the depressing state of affair,
you know,

597
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,380
this apocalyptic smokey state
of affairs in America generally,

598
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,350
there's a lot to feel hopeful
about with young people.

599
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,400
Well since you are on a college campus
and in fact the college campus that you

600
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:41,270
and I attended, I would be
curious to see whether, um,

601
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,520
women who are undergrads right now,

602
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,490
whether they've been affected
by sort of what you called,

603
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,500
like the beyond say 2013 feminism or so
basically like either on one hand they

604
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:56,090
are more feminist than we were when we
were in college or it's just an age thing

605
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:59,930
and maybe they will reach that point of
identifying as a feminist later. I think,

606
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:02,180
I suspect some people in this
room might be younger than I am,

607
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:03,410
so we could ask them,
but I,

608
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,940
I think that feminism is trendier than
it was when we were in college that this

609
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:12,740
idea, my like I can't think if I
have any hard numbers to prove this,

610
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:16,970
but when I think of like when I encounter
young women now who are in college

611
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:17,631
around that age,

612
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:20,780
they think it's cool to be a feminist
and that's a thing they identify as.

613
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,760
I think that Beyonce and Hillary
and Cheryl and all these,

614
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:29,900
all these women help produce that moment.
Um, which I think is basically, you know,

615
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,450
Tim, Amanda Negocio, dgs,

616
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,670
that we should all be feminists
moment that that really resonated,

617
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:36,500
which I think is basically a great thing.

618
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,920
I think that there are limitations to um,

619
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,180
I don't know the sort of the
transformation of feminism
into a lifestyle brand

620
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:46,790
or that's a side thing that
you can just, you know, make,

621
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,520
make a choice individually to be
this way and that that will fix all,

622
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,090
all the problems that women face.
I think that there are limitations to it,

623
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,660
but basically the kids are
more politically aware,

624
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,420
more politically engaged maybe
than we were at their age.

625
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,630
I certainly around these questions
of gender. That's great. Yeah.

626
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:06,170
I do find that really comforting and
that this idea that there is more gender

627
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:10,340
fluidity and flipping the scripts and
that people at least whether or not

628
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,050
feminism is being commodified on some,

629
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,530
in some ways it's at least giving
people the space to say like, Hey,

630
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:19,460
maybe we shouldn't wear really short
skirt so we can get into that final club

631
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:23,480
and see the list. Yeah. I think
that that does feel, again,

632
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:27,380
there's a lot more work to do, but that
feels like a basic improvement. Okay.

633
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:30,790
It wasn't even a conversation they were
having. My friends and I were having, um,

634
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,170
when we were undergrads,
at least not,

635
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,160
not with the same explicitness and
emphaticness that or the CEO's idea

636
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,040
from like,
you know,

637
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,630
from nine to five you were in class and
you were killing it and answering all

638
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:43,740
the questions and doing well.

639
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,470
But then like what happened at night
was like a different part of your

640
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:47,161
personality.

641
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:50,820
And my hope would be that people are kind
of more unified and being that strong

642
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:52,500
woman like during the day and

643
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,790
in the evening. Yeah. I think
what's privileged, again,
we were both undergraduate,

644
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,560
Harvard and I mentioned a lot of
people here are also sort of, you know,

645
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,720
a certain kind of type that
we saw a lot in college.

646
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,490
I think what's hard is that we were,

647
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:06,180
we're very conditioned to want to
succeed and get approval. And that's,

648
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,470
you get that for one set
of things professionally or
academically and you get it

649
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:13,050
for a different set of things
like socially and sexually.

650
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:17,010
And so there's no real contradiction
between being the straight a student who

651
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,730
wears a teeny tiny skirt and stands
outside of Finals Club at night.

652
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:25,380
Like they're both ways of seeking
approval from institutions of authority.

653
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:28,410
And you know, the men and the real
estate of the finals clubs too.

654
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:32,860
I mean there's this deeply, um, gender
and system of social power that,

655
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,630
that we were really responding to.
It wasn't just in our heads.

656
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:38,880
So it's this weird way that it's like
you're overachieving by being what someone

657
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:39,714
else wants,

658
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,700
whether it's on your CV and about a boss
or a teacher or about looking cute at

659
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:47,970
night. And I think that it takes a lot
of personal strength and also political

660
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:50,460
solidarity and these more
collective forms of thinking,

661
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,130
the change to change that.
And I do think it's happening.

662
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,420
I love that perspective.
Yeah.

663
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:57,360
I think it's hard for an 18 year old or
certainly would have been hard for me to

664
00:36:57,361 --> 00:36:57,961
say,
Oh,

665
00:36:57,961 --> 00:37:01,620
success during the day is doing well in
my classes and success night is standing

666
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:03,270
up to the patriarchy.
Yeah.

667
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,850
Well hopefully we can make standing
up to the patriarchy. Cool.

668
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,130
I think it's already cool on its way.
Yeah.

669
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:11,200
So I do want to leave time for
questions from the audience. Um,

670
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,860
before we get to that,
I'm going to ask you one more question.

671
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:17,820
So this is something I ask all my guests
who joined me for these toxic Google.

672
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,990
There is the google.com homepage
that has the Google logo.

673
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,930
And then underneath it,
sometimes there's this line of text.

674
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,210
So if you could write the line of text
for one day and millions of people would

675
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:32,730
see it as they do their
billions of searches,

676
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,500
what would you put on that line of text?
And since this is a modern romance talk,

677
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,370
maybe what would that line
be to help people with their
dating and relationships?

678
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,310
Oh my gosh. Oh yeah. No
pressure though. No pressure,

679
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,940
I think because I usually think with
Google over those wonderful drawings.

680
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,700
Oh yeah, we do have drawing when I
like, I'm a terrible drawer. We could,

681
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,550
you could commission a Google doodle
for something that's on your mind. No,

682
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,140
I've been thinking a lot. And
again, I feel like, you know,

683
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:59,730
we've just scratched the
surface of this history,

684
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:01,420
but I've been thinking a lot about,
about

685
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,660
the leftists and feminists slogan.
Um,

686
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,410
none of us are free until all of us are
free and that might seem like a stretch

687
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,500
from dating. But I think that
there's a way in which, um,

688
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,640
we can have fun at
Romance. Um, and you know,

689
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:18,310
we not always supposed to be thinking
about the structural and the political,

690
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:21,340
but men and women, and again, we've
hardly talked about queer dating,

691
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,400
which is the funnest part of
dating history by the way. But, um,

692
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,930
I think that we can't,

693
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,050
it's all very well to say that we're more
flexible in that we're more permissive

694
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:32,110
about romantic relationships and
family structures and all these things.

695
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,730
But men and women,
um,

696
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,470
can't really meet full romantic
equals until we address these kinds of

697
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:41,680
underlying social and structural problems.
So again,

698
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:42,810
they should have these two is,

699
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,870
there was this double vision between
the personal and the social. Um,

700
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,960
but I think that the idea that none of
us are sex until all of us, they're sexy.

701
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,390
None of us are free until all
of us are free as a sentiment.

702
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:53,710
I've been thinking about a lot.

703
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:57,420
So that's my grand claim to stake on
the bottom of the Google homepage.

704
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,120
I love that. Well, maybe somebody out
here today can actually get that on there.

705
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,330
Oh yeah. Okay. So now we'll open it
up to questions from the audience.

706
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:06,660
And Scott has a handheld mic.
Um,

707
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,010
I'm really interested to hear your
perspective on race within dating, um,

708
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,640
race or ethnicity. Um, I recently
heard a podcast on NPR about, um,

709
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:20,020
dating apps and how it's completely
skewed when it comes to race and yeah,

710
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:23,620
wait at throughout history or just what
your perspective on it is now in current

711
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:28,060
times. Yeah, I mean this is a great,
it's a great question, a huge question.

712
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,060
I think that there is all this data and
one thing that's interesting about the

713
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:35,320
proliferation of these apps is it does
give us much more sort of measurable

714
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:38,800
information about People's
preferences and behaviors.

715
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:42,760
There's certainly a lot
of kind of disappointing
information that's come out of

716
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:47,170
Okcupid and other apps in terms
of how forms of social prejudice,

717
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,460
uh, that we see elsewhere in
society play out in dating. Uh,

718
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,220
there was so many things to
say. I mean, historically,

719
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:58,750
one thing that's really interesting is
that dating is a practice really emerges

720
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:02,080
out of the working class
and the early 20th century.

721
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:07,081
And so you have these really vibrant
dating and go nightlife cultures in the

722
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,540
Harlem Renaissance for instance.
Or you have, um, a really vibrant,

723
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,640
like queer dating culture.
We didn't even talk about,

724
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:15,880
this isn't my favorite facts,
how a Tgi Fridays,

725
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:18,940
which was the first singles bar was
invented because the entrepreneur who

726
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:19,661
started it was like,

727
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:24,630
we need a gay bar for straight people
often like what I call been dating alleged

728
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,550
potato skins.
But it just like Grindr and Tinder again.

729
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,050
It's like exactly a Tgi Fridays was a
sexy singles bar in the 1960 [inaudible]

730
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,960
it's all the New York. But
anyway, I think that uh,

731
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:38,320
we often see these sort of
like experimental spaces
where there are kinds of

732
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:43,240
interracial dating or there
are opportunities to express
other kinds of desire

733
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:48,160
and affiliation that open up and then
pretty quickly are sort of like captured

734
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:51,160
and commodified and made mostly
for straight white people. Um,

735
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:55,120
and it's this sort of always
this horizon of possibility.

736
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:58,030
Cause one of the things about dating
that's different from organized courtship

737
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,440
is there are possibilities.
I mean is a very hard thing to pin down.

738
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:03,520
It moves in lots of ways.

739
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:07,060
And so you do get these sort of
spaces where there are other kinds of

740
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:11,530
relationships and then, um, it gets sort
of like whitewashed and locked down.

741
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,440
So that's like one historical observation.

742
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,320
I think we can keep
talking about it later.

743
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:22,321
There's like so many possible
things my mom likes to say don't,

744
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:26,140
should on yourself.
So I should,

745
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,030
I wish she could've told 16 year old
Margaret that I should on yourself. Um,

746
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,990
but uh, I maybe have kind of a
Google design question for you.

747
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:41,350
If you could wave a magic wand and kind
of take away a social norm within dating

748
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:46,850
that you feel like is detrimental to
the way that kind of society design

749
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:50,810
stating, um, what would you change?
What would you change about,

750
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:53,150
cause it's almost like as individuals,
we're,

751
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:57,590
we're functioning in this bigger picture,
so, so much of it you can't control.

752
00:41:57,591 --> 00:42:01,130
But if you could control something,
what would you change?

753
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,580
This is going to sound really, really
grandiose, but I do think that so much,

754
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:09,320
I'm dating in America and so many of our
practices are still organized by this,

755
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,790
not just assumption or false belief,
but real belief that because we have,

756
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,380
again,
the dating,

757
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,940
the purpose of dating is not always
getting married and reproducing,

758
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,450
but it is the dominant system
that our culture has for that.

759
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,510
And because our culture still treat,
um,

760
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,130
childhood and social reproduction,
these highly privatized ways,

761
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:31,010
it's not supported socially
very much at all. Uh,

762
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:34,490
it actually is a reality that for a woman
who hopes to do those things you have,

763
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,510
like there are real incentives to be
married here that shape sexual behavior in

764
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:41,660
a way that you don't see in like
Scandinavia in the same way, for instance.

765
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,630
So I'm like,
am I allowed to say paid parental leave,

766
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:46,250
socialized medicine and child care?

767
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:50,180
Like I feel like those would be some
really good design changes that I do think

768
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:54,260
actually relieve, would reverberate and
why stop there. Universal basic income.

769
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,950
Oh yeah. That's a complicated one. We have
to think about that. But, uh, but yeah,

770
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:01,830
I think that, you know, wage inequality
for sure. It's a funny thing, um,

771
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,350
that I get into the
first part of the book.

772
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:07,730
But how much early dating was often just
a way for women to get men to buy them

773
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:10,880
dinner because it didn't make enough
money in the city to like afford dinner.

774
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,360
And I think that there are all these
ways that like wage inequality and other

775
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:18,560
kinds of social inequality and to continue
to shape like the dating unconscious

776
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:22,050
and those inequalities are still
real as we know. But yeah, I'd,

777
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,090
I'd settle for socialized medicine,
childcare and paid family leave.

778
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:29,631
Um,

779
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:34,631
so I've always kind of heard our subscribe
to this pervasive belief that women

780
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:39,971
are designed to want to like build a
nest and foster home and sort of settle

781
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:41,781
down.

782
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:46,640
And men are designed to spread their seed
as far as they possibly can and in so

783
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:48,200
many different directions as they can.

784
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,130
I'm curious what your research has
uncovered around that from a biological

785
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:57,080
perspective and if that is just more of
a social norm that we've adapted to or

786
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:01,640
if there's something inherent about human
beings that makes that sort of true.

787
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,980
Well, one thing that's really interesting,
I do tend to think that it's like,

788
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,630
I joke about this,
but I think it's real.

789
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,410
It's like if there's any widely held
belief about gender and sexuality,

790
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:14,520
usually the opposite thing is actual time.
There are these new studies,

791
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,320
there are studies that ask,
you know, men and women,

792
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:19,350
would you like random anonymous
sex? Sorry, I'll get to
the question, I promise.

793
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:23,370
But random anonymous sex like right now.
And you know the initial findings,

794
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:23,830
you're like,
oh,

795
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:27,000
men would love some random anonymous
sex right now and women are not so sure.

796
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,850
But then if you control and
it's like he won't murder you,

797
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,800
like you might get orgasm that that then
suddenly women are much more interested

798
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:36,360
in that.
It was like some men are,

799
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:39,090
and it's similar with cin numbers
of children that people want to,

800
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:40,830
it's like there are recent do recent work.

801
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,370
There's a woman named marina add shade
who's an economist at University of

802
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,160
British Columbia who could public his
published and would know the exact numbers

803
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:49,350
on this if she were
here. But men, you know,

804
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:52,320
historically I think there's
this assumption that women
care more about having

805
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:55,470
children or want children more or
that motherhood is more defining them

806
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:55,951
fatherhood.

807
00:44:55,951 --> 00:45:00,490
But indeed when you control
for or when you tell him,

808
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:03,450
I know you might have to do some of the
work that's related to child raising or

809
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:07,920
you that actually men want children more
and a greater number of children than

810
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:10,490
women do. So I feel like there
are all these beliefs, um,

811
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,710
that start to shift under scrutiny and
often the opposite of what the general

812
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,100
assumption is true in
terms of settling down.

813
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,640
I mean I do think there is a certain
biological reality that like female

814
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:27,210
investment in pregnancy
and parenting is greater.

815
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,630
Like a woman has to make a greater
investment of time and physical effort to

816
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:32,830
become a parent than a,
than a male does.

817
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:37,440
And there surely is something
biological about that. At the same time.

818
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:39,770
So much of this is socially conditioned.

819
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:44,620
Then I think we've seen in societies that
had more robust forms of communalized

820
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,240
childcare where it wasn't just going to
be a private responsibility to take care

821
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:49,260
of your kids in your home.

822
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,680
That you see very different outcomes
in terms of how much women feel.

823
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:55,590
Their whole life needs to be
oriented around planning for that.

824
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:56,760
And I think part of that is a,

825
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,600
it's a reaction to the fact that in our
country and this time there's like very

826
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:05,370
few other options for getting that
work at home done. Um, I've just,

827
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:06,810
this is a much longer
different coverage of,

828
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:10,230
I've just come back from this trip to
China to this matriarchal society where

829
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:13,290
children are raised communal and have
no fathers and it's very different.

830
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:16,200
I mean there really are other
ways to live, but I didn't know,

831
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:17,820
I imagine there's some biological element,

832
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:22,821
but it's also quite socially constructed
and also variable if you control for,

833
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,560
um, the equivalent of will I have an
orgasm and will he not murdered, you know,

834
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,070
these kinds of variables

835
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,770
as dating has evolved to dating in the
public sphere as it is today as opposed

836
00:46:34,781 --> 00:46:39,781
to calling in the parlor and where maybe
these experiences were more chaperoned

837
00:46:41,411 --> 00:46:45,220
or there was more commentary invited
from your priest or your rabbi or your

838
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:47,800
parents. How, um,

839
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,370
how that conversation has evolved in,

840
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:56,080
in ways it's maybe improve like Logan
you're saying like you try to encourage

841
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:58,060
your friends who are dating to say like,
yeah,

842
00:46:58,061 --> 00:47:00,460
but what did you think of this person?
Um,

843
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:04,360
if there are ways that we can as like the
armchair therapist for our friends who

844
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:05,350
are dating,
um,

845
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:10,410
be more constructive and be more helpful
in navigating the dialogue that is

846
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:13,000
associated with dating
and maybe the debrief.

847
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,020
It's a really good question.

848
00:47:17,021 --> 00:47:20,260
I think that this will be
a strange thing to say.

849
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:23,190
I think another thing that's come up a
lot like back when I was on book tour

850
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,250
doing a lot of radio interviews is that
people feel this pressure to always be

851
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:27,701
dating.

852
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:30,850
And the same way that our phones mean
that we feel like we should always be

853
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:33,070
working and our boss can email
us in the middle of the night.

854
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,960
People feel like they
should always be on Tinder.

855
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:39,210
It should always be on OK cupid.
Um, again, they should, um,

856
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,120
but should be working at it all the time.
And I feel as if this,

857
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:47,170
I would very often when doing events back
when I was on book tour get a question

858
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,270
where someone would say basically like,
I don't feel like dating right now. Like,

859
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,980
is that okay? Like that's what
the question would boil down to.

860
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,280
And I feel like I also so often just
want to tell friends that it's like we've

861
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:03,670
completed romantic success
and professional success
and a lot of ways people

862
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:07,780
often speak about like feeling that
they need to hit certain milestones

863
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:10,060
romantically as well as
professionally by certain ages.

864
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:15,061
And I think that to the extent that
it's like you also don't do that and you

865
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:20,070
know, a lot of, um, well that also goes
back to the biological clock. Yeah. Idea.

866
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,960
Talking about earlier,
this idea that women,

867
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:25,900
straight women in particular feel all
this pressure to like plan their life out

868
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:27,370
at every stage.
Um,

869
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,990
I think that so often people seem to
just want permission to like desire

870
00:48:31,991 --> 00:48:34,840
otherwise or to not be dating
or working at at a certain time.

871
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:36,480
And I also found like,

872
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:41,300
I think that can be a useful kind of
advice and maybe it sounds very Kumbaya,

873
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,650
but I think that women in particular are
encouraged to be so hard on themselves

874
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,910
and so self critical and
to feel so anxious and we,

875
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,950
that's actually very counterproductive
to establishing intimacy. Um,

876
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,040
but I feel like sometimes I just
want to tell friends like, you don't,

877
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,470
you don't have, um, if what you're,

878
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,340
you're hearing from yourself that you
want is that you don't want to be doing

879
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:04,300
this right now. That is also okay.
However addictive it might be.

880
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:08,880
Just swipe all the time. What's the
term? And a normativity had oh, a motto.

881
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:11,410
Normatively. Lots of
normativity. Yeah. Yeah.

882
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,790
So our friend Mandy is very
into this idea that, um,

883
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,240
we're kind of raised to think that like
the goal in life is to like find one

884
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:22,750
partner and like everything is like
leading up to this moment of romance and

885
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,510
actually like perhaps lots of
people are happy single on.

886
00:49:25,511 --> 00:49:27,520
That's not necessarily
the goal and everything.

887
00:49:27,521 --> 00:49:32,521
So what does it mean for society to take
a step back and say like perhaps it's

888
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:36,650
okay for a woman to be seeking something
other than like ultimate coupled them

889
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:39,460
in partnership. Yeah. And I
think that it's like, again,

890
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:41,980
it's a hard thing to see in
our own individual lives,

891
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:45,460
but the purpose of marriage and the
purpose of courtship like has changed

892
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:46,960
greatly over time.
You know,

893
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:49,870
when you think to like an
agrarian preindustrial society,

894
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,130
you'd have a range marriage because
extended families are like the unit of

895
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:57,370
production and you need to be married
to like the dude from next door so that

896
00:49:57,371 --> 00:49:59,770
his brothers and your brothers
can like work the farm.

897
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,980
It's like what marriage becomes
what it becomes about. Love.

898
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,710
Basically around the time of the
industrial revolution is something very

899
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:09,130
different than that. And maybe we're
entering another new phase, you know,

900
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,520
that the purpose of these relationships
in their functional role in our lives do

901
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:16,550
change. We're all gonna live to
be so much older than people. Uh,

902
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,490
then people did. I mean, hopefully.
Um, then, uh, they did and you know,

903
00:50:21,491 --> 00:50:25,510
the early 19th century we have very
different working circumstances.

904
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:29,190
We have very different lives.
And so this idea that um,

905
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:32,600
a certain kind of like straight,
usually white,

906
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:36,950
monogamous romantic love is like this one
measure of societal success is really,

907
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:42,080
is really outdated. I think. Like
there are many ways to live, so yeah,

908
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,570
absolutely.
Any other questions?

909
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,220
You alluded to this a few times,
the differences between, you know,

910
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:54,250
queer dating historically
and view straight dating and
can you elaborate more on

911
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:58,670
that? Just some of the
history, the differences.

912
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,320
I'm really curious.

913
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,510
Yeah, totally. I think that it's funny,

914
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:05,600
it was a thing I struggled with writing
this book because this is a book about

915
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:10,670
sort of dating as a cultural institution
and for most of the century or so that

916
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:15,200
people have dated queer dating has not
been like legible adds dating to most of

917
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:18,020
society at the same time and
perhaps not incidentally.

918
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:21,920
It's also been like the funnest and most
experimental and best and best place

919
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:26,030
for you to these terrible a gendered
norms that we see across so much other

920
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:26,391
dating.

921
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:30,380
So I think that in my book they should
have two chapters that deal primarily

922
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:34,670
with LGBTQ dating.
And I think that it often,

923
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,050
the first one sort of deals a lot with
the roaring twenties and the 30s in sort

924
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:43,400
of speakeasy scenes and these spaces that
are at once like theoretically out of

925
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:44,390
the public eye,

926
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:48,830
but then also become sort of like an
avant garde or lead or what's fashionable

927
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,180
for dating.
Um,

928
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:54,080
you see it again as I was suggesting
in the 60s with this hilarious guy,

929
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:56,180
Alan Stallman.
He starts Tgi Fridays.

930
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:58,340
And it's like if we could
scale this restrict people,

931
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,190
we'd make a bazillion
dollars a as indeed he did.

932
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,400
But I think that often you seem cultures
of experimentation not burdened by

933
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:08,300
these norms about,

934
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:11,390
you know what I keep joking about
this idea that men and women are like

935
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:15,290
inevitably at odds and then sex
is this depressing compromise, um,

936
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:18,500
that allow for a lot more possibility.
I think because there aren't,

937
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:22,220
or for most of the history of dating
haven't been such overbearing social

938
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:24,800
scripts about like how men are
and how women are, you know,

939
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:28,330
Lgbtq folks and have to deal with those
in the same way that often you've seen

940
00:52:28,331 --> 00:52:30,290
much more um,

941
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,240
self awareness or sort of thoughtfulness
about defining desires and expectations

942
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:38,660
cause there aren't these assumptions
about what they should be. Uh,

943
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,950
I think one part of the book deals a lot
with the AIDS crisis and the safe sex

944
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:43,761
movement too.

945
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:48,530
And the ways in which like really
heroic activists around HIV and AIDS,

946
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,100
um,

947
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,660
started building materials to help
couples talk about sexual practices more

948
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:58,930
specifically and more openly and how that
became really important for people of

949
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,580
all genders and orientations.
But I think that,

950
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:06,020
so I think that like queer
dating and my book and, and in,

951
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:07,980
in history,
um,

952
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,920
is often a space of greater
experimentation and self awareness. Uh,

953
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,950
and then often sort of like sets the
trends in the same way you get Tgi Fridays

954
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,350
imitating gay bars. You get
Tinder imitating grinder. Uh,

955
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,200
so it gets sort of co opted and made
and made it less fun for straight people

956
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,980
maybe. But those are
just, those are a couple

957
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,240
of themes that come to mind.

958
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,420
And I also post a lot of things on
Facebook about dating and relationships.

959
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:34,230
So you can find me at
facebook.com/logan Ury.

960
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,570
Just wanted to say thank you
so much for having so much fun.

961
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:38,920
Yeah.
