1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,000
All right. I'm very excited for my fourth
toxic Google to welcome Kari Byron.

2
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:10,360
Best known of course for the
Discovery Channel Show mythbusters.

3
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:13,400
But she's done many,
many things since for over a decade.

4
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:17,890
She's been a strong presence in the world
of reality based science television.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,880
She's hosted thrill factor,
head rush, Pumpkin chunking,

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,170
large and dangerous rocket
ships. Ldrs. Super Cool. Uh,

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,530
so you spent a lifetime occurring odd
skills and interests after graduating

8
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,660
college as an artist.
She traveled the world,

9
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:34,990
decided to settle in San Francisco
to pursue a career as a sculptor,

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,820
which is amazing. Um, but ended
up discovering the handling poop,

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,430
eating bugs,
wiring,

12
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:46,150
explosives and scraping chicken guts
off the ceiling was a real dream job.

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,410
Perfect resume for Google.
All right.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,610
I'm very excited to
welcome Carrie to Google.

15
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,623
Oh

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,480
well thanks for bringing me out here

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,970
from the bay area. So for me,
I've watched Google grow. I mean,

18
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:06,050
I came here with Jamie for a photo shoot
you guys had when it was like an open

19
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:10,160
floor with some cubicles and I was so
impressed because you had a candy wall.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,440
You have grown a lot.
Yeah.

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,430
So before talking about everything
had been up to since mythbusters,

22
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:19,941
I have to ask,

23
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:24,941
is your job as insanely fun as it appears
or are you just some terrific actor?

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,820
Well, I'm definitely not a terrific actor
and if you look at early mythbusters,

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,760
you can tell how nervous and
awkward and bad I am at talking.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,600
It is really, really obvious.
My job is actually very,

27
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:41,510
very fun and that is one
thing that we always had.

28
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:46,040
His mythbusters was one of the
few shows that was on reality.

29
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,370
That was actual reality when we were
hurt, we were hurt. When we're happy,

30
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:53,360
we're happy and you know, you're doing
some really fun, interesting stuff.

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,640
And when it was boring they
would just edit it out. So

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,600
no, and even with all the set up,
because all the shows you've done,

33
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,750
there's a lot of stuff that gets filmed
and Diane are not film behind the scenes.

34
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:04,390
Is that stuff's still fun
or is there any part of it,

35
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,720
this kind of like a drag when you hear
actors talking about the hours of waiting

36
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:11,530
in the trail or in the drudgery
and making a film? Was it all fun?

37
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,450
Well, you know, we were
all friends. Um, and,

38
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,420
and we actually had chemistry so we,

39
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,260
before we all had angry birds so that
everybody would ignore each other.

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,060
We had these really fun games that we
would do when say there was some sort of

41
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:28,380
safety protocol. Like, you know,

42
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,410
the bomb squad had a full hour that
they had to wait and we were stuck in a

43
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,560
bunker.
We would come up with old timey games,

44
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:38,880
like throw the rock at the can and we
would have so much fun trying to see who

45
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:41,580
could hit the can. Like
we, we always had fun.

46
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:44,790
Even when some of the
things kind of dragged on,

47
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:48,000
we all had a very similar senses of humor,

48
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,290
which slowly got lower and darker
because that's what happens when you get

49
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:57,210
familiar with people and we all just
kept each other very much in stitches.

50
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,640
Cool.
You on to college for Film and sculpture,

51
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:02,770
your most well known for
your science or programming.

52
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,520
How has your background as an artist
influenced how you communicate science?

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,170
Well, you know, I come
from a long line of,

54
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,210
of Sciencey and rd people and I
feel like they are in the same vein.

55
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:18,450
It's all about fostering a
curiosity. You know, with,

56
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:22,350
with art you're taking an idea and you're
trying to explore it in a visual way

57
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,370
that um,

58
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,370
helps you come to some sort of conclusion
or feeling about that question.

59
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:32,040
And Science is the same thing.
It's just exploring your curiosity.

60
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,080
The difference is, I feel like over
time science became very sort of,

61
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:37,921
you know,

62
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:42,780
when I was growing up almost like clinical
where it was identifying the parts of

63
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:43,614
a cell.

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,730
Whereas when it really gets fun is the
way we did it on mythbusters is where

65
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:51,510
you'd get really dirty and you get your
hands on it and you do it the way you do

66
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:55,500
art. You know, you're, you're throwing
a pot, you're getting your hands in the,

67
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,543
in the Google.

68
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,860
So that kind of builds into this question
is there's a perception among some

69
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:04,600
that science is not a creative in Denver
that creative people pursue the arts.

70
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,530
What have you learned about
science, especially past
what you get in high school?

71
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,970
Um, about the creativity of scientists
and those persons that pursue science?

72
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,421
Well,

73
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:17,170
I think it's pretty obvious in the tech
community you guys have figured it out

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,200
that a great diversity actually comes
to a better space in solving any sort of

75
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,550
problems. So when you bring
an artist into, you know,

76
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,540
a scientific field or vice versa, you
come up with the most beautiful things,

77
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,980
look at kinetic sculptures.

78
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,940
When you take science and apply it to
art and you make these incredible moving

79
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:41,680
pieces, I think it works the same way.
You just have a different approach.

80
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,310
And a, over the years I've learned
that art and science are pretty much

81
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,110
is there mashed inner and you've also
emceed some amazing events showcasing

82
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:53,120
students sign in addition, the
White House science fair, uh,

83
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,780
to the vex world championships
and Disneyworld. A super cool.

84
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,270
What have you learned from the students
that you've met over the years?

85
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Never under estimate young people because
they are so much more sophisticated

86
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,760
then I was as a kid and,
and when you talk to a 12 year old,

87
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:13,510
you talked to him like there are 35 year
old, you know, it's, it's, it's, um,

88
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,130
I've learned so much from them and their
experiences because everyone at that

89
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:22,450
age is so honest and will tell you
exactly what's happening and they're so

90
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:26,140
creative and the world's just so open
and it's just such a beautiful way to

91
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:28,200
approach it. And I think
sometimes as we get older, we,

92
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,990
we lose that need to be fascinated.

93
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,510
Well, I can tell you, we have, we have
thousands of interns every summer.

94
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,310
If you were probably in
the audience right now.

95
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:41,130
And it's amazing what
interns can accomplish before
they've even finished, uh,

96
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,810
have finished their college degree.
Very true.

97
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,230
So a lot of them has written about how
you visited mythbusters and never left,

98
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:47,801
uh,

99
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:51,190
for students that have no
idea what they're planning
to do with their lives when

100
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:51,970
they grow up.

101
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,840
What have you learned about making
the most of unexpected opportunities?

102
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:56,990
Well,

103
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,060
I feel like I was almost too young when
I went to college to truly appreciate it.

104
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,780
I, I mean, that might be pretty universal,

105
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:07,130
but I don't think that I was
the kind of person that, uh,

106
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,110
took advantage of it the way I probably
would now for me when I was traveling,

107
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:12,890
um,

108
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,890
that's where I really learned how to
say why not and to go for opportunities

109
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:20,960
because I was traveling alone around
the world. I hadn't, you know,

110
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,250
I had friend to start with,

111
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:25,640
but then we went our separate ways and
it was just the sort of thing where you

112
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:28,940
just have to, even if it's
scary, you have to try it.

113
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,970
And I feel like that is what led me into
mythbusters to start with because I,

114
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,121
you know,

115
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:39,950
I tried advertising and I was bored and
I tried all these different careers and

116
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,990
I just couldn't find myself. And I came
to mythbusters in my late twenties,

117
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,010
but I was ready to just work
for free. I was like, you know,

118
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,000
I will be an intern because I want to
do sculpture and special effects seems

119
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:56,000
like an easy fit because you
guys get paid to do sculptures.

120
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,930
How did I know it was a
dying art? Uh, the time,

121
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,290
the practical effects were just crumbling
beneath the crushing computer industry,

122
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,300
but I really,

123
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,840
really wanted to learn how
to have an interesting life.

124
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,330
And so I thought if I just do it for free,

125
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,390
sooner or later I will prove myself
worthy and maybe they'll pay me.

126
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,500
You had a long road with miss busters
was never a point where you wavered or it

127
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:19,580
got old or,

128
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:22,040
or did you just manage to have this
incredible long run where it was fun the

129
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:22,874
whole time?

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,130
I mean it, it, it changed
along the way. It was, it,

131
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,560
it's peak fund when we had the least
amount of cooks in the kitchen where we

132
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:33,950
were just allowed to run with it
and kind of do what we wanted.

133
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,840
Whenever any buddy tried to mess with
the formula and try to figure out what

134
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,460
makes it popular and do more of that,

135
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,940
you know that that was
always a little hard.

136
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,580
Like for a while they kept trying to
make us fight. They would, they would,

137
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,960
you know, like all those
chopper shows were so popular.

138
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,550
So they would take me aside.

139
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:54,710
This was back when Scotty was
there to take me aside and be like,

140
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,580
Scotty said about what you did.
You know what she said about your field,

141
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,470
and then she takes
Scotty's. I'd be like, Oh,

142
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,120
this is what Carrie just said about you.

143
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,570
And they try to get us to fight and
be like, oh, you're probably right.

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,930
Your way is better. And
they're like, no, no,

145
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,180
never works. We're fallen
for it. We liked each other.

146
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,580
So you've already brought up
the diversity is so important.

147
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,110
Combining sciences and
technology and gender,

148
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:22,680
so specifically about getting
more women to pursue stem,

149
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:25,180
which is a huge priority of Google
and we've got a long way to go.

150
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:27,510
And we've been very public about that.
It's persistent challenge.

151
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,850
What have you learned
about inspiring kids?

152
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:33,030
Especially girls to ignore those
stereotypes or look beyond them.

153
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,090
I mean, I feel like we've made a
lot of progress. I mean a long,

154
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,620
not too distant past. I was, you know,

155
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,590
would've been chaining myself to other
women trying to get the right to vote.

156
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,020
And then my mom's generation
was burning their bras,

157
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,190
trying to get me to go to college. And
now we're here where, you know, when,

158
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,080
I don't remember seeing a lot of women
in dynamic scientific positions on TV.

159
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:58,110
If they were in a doctor,
they were the nurse. They were
never the, the scientists.

160
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,230
They were never the smart one.
And now every TV show you look at,

161
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,620
you see actual women represented
in smart scientific fields.

162
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:10,330
And you know, maybe by the time my
daughter's a grown up superhero,

163
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,400
women won't have to fight in high heels.
Like I feel like progress is being made.

164
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,890
Um,
I know that when I,

165
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,950
I don't know if I'm an
expert in this at all.

166
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,790
I do know that the girls I talked to with
the White House science fair seem like

167
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,040
they were, they had it
down. They, you know,

168
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:30,870
I asked them what got you into it and
they all had these great stories of

169
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,640
triumph to get to where they were.

170
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,240
But mostly supportive parents,

171
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:40,080
especially a supportive dad was
really, really important. Um,

172
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,550
the having role models they could look
at like people like Ellen stolen from

173
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:48,720
NASA. Like you know, seeing women like
that succeeding was, was really important.

174
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:53,721
Seeing themselves reflected in the media
was very important but also mostly it

175
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,520
was being able to find like minds.

176
00:09:56,521 --> 00:10:00,090
You may be the only girl in the
math club at your small school,

177
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,480
but there's another only girl
in Minnesota in the math club.

178
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:07,590
And if you guys can get online,
which is the beauty of the Internet,

179
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,570
you can actually connect,

180
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,490
you can feel that support and maybe you
can help each other stay because I feel

181
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:18,450
like people get interested in things but
fall away when it's hard or when they

182
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,710
feel like an outsider.

183
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,530
And if you're the only girl you
might feel like an outsider.

184
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:25,260
So you got to network
and help each other out.

185
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:30,261
We as women also have a tendency to
compete and tear each other down and we've

186
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,260
been raised that way.

187
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,480
Whereas I think we're trying very
hard to start being supportive.

188
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,330
Like every time I meet a woman
trying to get into my industry,

189
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:42,810
people are always trying to pit me against
them. Like, ah, she's trying to be like,

190
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:47,550
you were her shows not as good. I'm like,
there's a woman on TV, are you kidding?

191
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:51,210
I'm going to call her and if we can
help each other, this will be great.

192
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,880
I wouldn't be where I am
without people like uh,

193
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,340
Debbie Myers from science channels.
She's like,

194
00:10:56,341 --> 00:11:00,330
let's do a show that inspires girls.
Let's do it. She helps me out.

195
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,970
I'll help her out anytime she needs it.
Cool.

196
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,490
You've always struck me,

197
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:07,880
we were talking about this before
about being an accidental celebrity.

198
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:10,640
By that I mean you didn't,
you didn't do theater.

199
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,390
I tried to Google it and then I asked
though theater, no theater background.

200
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,410
You weren't designed to be a star, you
know, so you were at an accidental.

201
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,590
You gain celebrity status waiting until
you're past about how different is real

202
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:25,730
world carry from the brand carry and is
there any difference in you even think

203
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:26,564
about that?

204
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,210
Um, TV characters, a lot more. Makeup,

205
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,220
clothes are generally tied her
on TV I think because, well,

206
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:36,290
or maybe that's just because
of moving parts for machinery.

207
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:40,640
I don't want to get hurt. I wear a lot
less dresses on TV. That's about it.

208
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,870
But other than that, Byron we see
on mythbusters and pumpkin shape.

209
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,970
That is you feel like you're
able to be who you are?

210
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,170
Yeah, I mean, I, I didn't, when
we started, uh, mythbusters, it's,

211
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,950
it's not like you have audience like this,

212
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:55,810
which would have been
incredibly intimidating.

213
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,650
You have a camera crew that you're
friends with and it's almost like making a

214
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:04,390
home movie. And so it just
slowly became part of what I did.

215
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,730
And I don't live in the
Hollywood structure as well,

216
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:09,940
so I don't do red carpets
in that kind of fun stuff,

217
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,740
except for maybe once a year I get invited
to something special and I'll go down

218
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:15,191
to la.

219
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:19,900
So I think that maybe that would have
fed me more of the celebritiness but

220
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,960
no, myth busters, I think you did.
You're on the red carpet for the Emmy's.

221
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:26,110
Mythbusters never didn't want to
got nominated ton. Did it ever win?

222
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,530
Now far if mythbusters won an Emmy,
total crime,

223
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,850
what would be your acceptance speech?
Oh, they would let me get back.

224
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,940
The small amount of time I talked.
So much

225
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,880
music you get the best speech has
got the music. Yeah. All right,

226
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:46,780
so the internet does not have a great
track record when it comes to the online

227
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:50,260
treatment of women. How has your
experience been with the online world?

228
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:50,851
Um,

229
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:54,870
at first I had to get a thicker skin
because we had message boards that we were

230
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:58,980
encouraged to be very interactive with
our audience because that was what made

231
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:02,420
mythbusters different is that our
audience was part of us. And um,

232
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,110
you know, I got my feelings hurt
really easily when people would,

233
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,770
I remember somebody called me a bubble
head and I cry. I mean, it's just,

234
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:14,380
it's just silly insole. But it was
just, you know, [inaudible] was,

235
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,331
it was a little tough,

236
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:19,070
but I grew a really thick skin and I
just don't read that stuff and I kind of

237
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,170
laugh at it now. You
just don't engage. Um,

238
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,410
and you definitely don't Google your
name with the words feet or butt

239
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,010
or you in any male Costar or

240
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,480
sort of more positive like you've
been on David Letterman show.

241
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,640
It's a while back. Google
it. It was my first nervous.

242
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,610
I can tell you, you were amped up. I
was playing my dress the whole time.

243
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:50,460
My feet were sweating. You opposed
to science for, as I mentioned,

244
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:52,500
the White House medical events.

245
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,910
What is the coolest door that's been
open because of getting some celebrity?

246
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,680
Oh my God, the White
House. I mean, I got it.

247
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,320
I got invited to host though White
House science fair because they were,

248
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:06,321
there was an emphasis on women and girls
and I was so humbled by the experience.

249
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,160
It was so incredible.

250
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:13,161
I got to do this panel with some
really incredible women and some,

251
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,170
some girls that had made it to the science
fair and hear all their stories and

252
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,670
we just got to sit around and talk.
And I walked away from there just in awe.

253
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,470
And then the president said my name
out loud, my mom and dad could hear,

254
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,090
which was amazing.

255
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:31,200
And then they ushered me off to a little
secret room with like teen came in and

256
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:32,460
all these fancy people.

257
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,840
And then the president comes over
and gives me a hug and I'm just like,

258
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,670
oh,
this is so crazy.

259
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,200
And then at one point I had
to go look for the bathroom.

260
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:44,640
They just let me walk
around the White House.

261
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:46,770
Like I would just walking
around looking for bathroom,

262
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:50,400
like kind of looking for
some like monogrammed m and
m's or something to steal.

263
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:54,800
But you didn't. But then like John
Kerry just walks past me on his phone.

264
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,510
That's pretty hard to top up degree.
Um,

265
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,320
so mythbusters head rush,

266
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,140
you've had a chance to recreate
and test some cool science.

267
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,850
What is the most unexpected results that
you can choose? Just one surprised you.

268
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:14,780
It was not what you're planning

269
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,780
you. There's so many different ones.
And I've talked about him a lot.

270
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,400
Like a bull in a China shop.

271
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:25,480
I couldn't believe bowls were graceful
complete elephants were actually afraid

272
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:26,314
of mice.

273
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,340
I couldn't believe that an ancient
Chinese system using drums buried in the

274
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:33,820
ground actually would, uh, trigger,

275
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,680
you could hear somebody tunneling from
far away from this old ancient system.

276
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,750
Um, but the most surprising I had was,
I don't think I've ever talked about it,

277
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:45,940
but, uh, on head rush, um,

278
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,360
I had a science advisor that had this
experiment for me where it was making a

279
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:57,870
heating water in sort of an early Meyer.
And then he told me to put a lid on it.

280
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
I was like, I feel like that's
a pressure vessel, but you know,

281
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,420
I didn't hear the science guy
and my gut kept telling me,

282
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,670
this is a bad idea. This is
a really bad idea. He's like,
no, no, no, no, no, no. Well,

283
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,600
I've done this before. I've done it
a million times. So I'm like, okay,

284
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,620
he's the scientist. What do
I know? So I, I made the,

285
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,800
this experiment, I put my head down
close because they want to get a shot.

286
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:22,801
And then I stood up and it exploded and
it burned across my stomach so that the

287
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:28,780
skin fell off.
And I have like a kind of a scar,

288
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:33,370
the shape of a wolf, which
is kind of cool. But it was,

289
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,850
it was a really important
moment for me because it,

290
00:16:36,851 --> 00:16:41,020
it shook me because I feel like there's
this psychology that you think of,

291
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:43,840
the camera's rolling. You can't
get hurt if the camera's rolling.

292
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:46,720
Nothing can go wrong.
And I also,

293
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,290
I didn't trust my gut
and I only got hurt in a,

294
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,290
in a really uncomfortable way right
before you have to go on vacation to a

295
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,133
Hawaiian island

296
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,990
because the skin was coming
off. But, uh, it was,

297
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:07,020
it was a small price to pay for a
new awareness where I could realize,

298
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:10,960
okay, you've got to actually stay
safe even if the camera's are rolling.

299
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:13,720
Trust your gut. And just because
somebody has the credentials,

300
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,920
it doesn't mean they're right.

301
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,730
So I'm gonna ask a couple more questions
and open it up to the Googlers.

302
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,380
So start thinking, ask good questions. Uh,

303
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,060
so on a Pumpkin chunking and Ldrs,

304
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:29,300
you've had the chance to meet some
really interesting people that,

305
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,940
and if you're not familiar
with pumpkin chunk,

306
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:35,360
and that's this event where you
hurl a pumpkin really, really far

307
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,080
by any mechanical means possible.
So we're talking catapults,

308
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,180
Trevor's Jay's air cannons. It
just, it, it can't be like rockets.

309
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,130
And they, they go almost, they've
gone over a mile, a pumpkin

310
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,590
and then a large and
dangerous rocket ships.

311
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,250
People take pretty much anything and turn
it into these ridiculous rocket ships.

312
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,870
And also I'm rock tips go super high.

313
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,530
So when you've met these both really
cool shows, check them out. Um,

314
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,210
what have you learned about
the people behind these crazy,

315
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,030
insane Stein's? Now you've had a
chance to talk to them, meet them,

316
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:09,990
like what makes them tick?

317
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,510
I just, I have a great respect
for anybody who follows a passion,

318
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:20,190
specially weird passions and the fact
that these gorilla engineers are just

319
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:25,191
sitting in their garage and this is their
hobby to create a huge trevorshay to

320
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:29,340
Laba pumpkin and their whole
years dedicated to that.

321
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,840
It's so much fun because they're,
they're the good kind of crazy, you know,

322
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,040
they're,
they're using,

323
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,220
they're using a science and engineering
in a wild and cool way and they turn it

324
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:41,820
into a family event.

325
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:46,160
Like everybody brings their kids and
kids get into the physics of it and it's,

326
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:51,150
it's some of that unintentional learning
that I always love where it's, you know,

327
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:55,380
it's, it's the cheese on the Broccoli. It
makes it taste good. I learned something.

328
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,553
Okay.

329
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,780
And on your most recent project with the
travel channel or thrill factor also,

330
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:02,130
very cool.
It looks like a blast.

331
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,780
How did you convince Tori to vomit and
pass out on a stunt plane to show the

332
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:07,614
effects of four?

333
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,460
I didn't really tell him to vomit path.
That wasn't right. It's fantastic.

334
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:13,190
And watch it.

335
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,500
Oh Tori and I are really good friends
and we do a lot of shows together because

336
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:21,990
it's, uh, were, were complete and total
opposite. It's like a, it's, it's,

337
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,900
it's really fun.

338
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:27,700
And he was the one that brought the stunt
planes to us cause he met a rich guy

339
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,460
that had stunt planes and he's like,
let's,

340
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,300
let's go out there to Vegas and do this.

341
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:35,500
And I was a little dubious cause it
seems crazy but towards a certain kind of

342
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,310
charm where it's,

343
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:42,200
it's sort of like his men friends kind of,
you know how men get where they,

344
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:45,970
they love each other but they
want to torture each other,
you know, all these. So,

345
00:19:45,971 --> 00:19:48,730
so we go up in the plains and they,

346
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,170
he actually has a really great resistance
to g lock and he gets to the point of

347
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,090
fighter pilot before he passes out.

348
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,850
And I think that made the pilot
sort of challenged. He's like, Oh,

349
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:02,500
you had passed out yet,
what we're going to make you pass out.

350
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,530
And then after I watched Tori pass out
tamable they basically just turn off the

351
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:13,120
engines and let the plane tumbled.
And he was insane.

352
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:16,720
And I looked over like, oh my God, that's
awful, Huh? How, how do you do that?

353
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:20,950
He's like, Oh, you want to do it now?
It's like, no, no, turn off the plane.

354
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,030
It tumbled. Mind you, none of this made
it to air. I've suffered for nothing.

355
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,840
Tumbled into the plane.
And then just cute. I like,

356
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,340
and then as I'm getting off the
plane with my puke bag and you know,

357
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:36,850
the travel channel crews
down there, they're like, all
right. So I don't let that,

358
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,680
we both had to sit in a dark room for
an hour before they could do interviews

359
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:48,340
and stuff with us. And we had wanted
to the plane part out of the way.

360
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:52,700
So we didn't do any of the preliminary
stuff just yet, like walking in. And uh,

361
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,770
so I had to get the puke out of my hair
and get the Mascara Alec from an Emea.

362
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,730
It's like a pretend like
it hadn't happened yet.

363
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,230
So one, one final question. I'm
my hand it off to the audience.

364
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,790
So if you could have a cameo in one of
the following, which would you choose?

365
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,360
And why Star Wars,
Star Trek,

366
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,090
game of Thrones or Sharknado,

367
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,370
if it was based entirely on fashion.

368
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,700
The dresses and the outfits that they
wear in game of Thrones is awesome.

369
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,240
But the women don't fare too well.
It's a little violent.

370
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,600
So I mean I would clearly pick star wars
because the like layers let it then I

371
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,870
won't spoil news there.
They're leaders,

372
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:41,830
they're warriors and they're equals
and they get to fly. Cool planes. And

373
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,100
how has that movie,
because we were talking about this week,

374
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,670
how has that movie affected your daughter?
Like how does that,

375
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,050
what impact did ray have?

376
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,660
I have a seven year old. So,
uh, when we went to see the
movie, she had no idea. She,

377
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:54,590
she,
she hadn't watched any of the star wars.

378
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:58,690
And we went with my nephew who
was five and so excited and we,

379
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,730
we win to the theater and she's
like, Oh yeah, this will be cool.

380
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:07,330
And then when it turned out that ray
appeared and she was the main character,

381
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:09,860
my daughter yelled back,

382
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,880
everybody's laughing after that. She
went home, she made a wrapping paper,

383
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:19,160
Light Saber. And she just be, you know,

384
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:23,690
she actually threw away all her
princesses. Don't tell Disney we threw it.

385
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,070
We wait.
We didn't throw them away.

386
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,670
We took all of our princesses and we
gave them to a younger cousin and it was

387
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:30,360
all about star wars.
Cool.

388
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,970
That's cool. Sandy Diego to my
daughter. So. Very cool. All right,

389
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:38,140
so I have a helper here with a microphone
and the Dory. If there are any doors.

390
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,580
There are some. All
right, I will, I will, uh,

391
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,150
just go on the audience first
and I will look through the dory.

392
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,981
The Dory by the way,

393
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:47,860
is our internal mechanism for people
watching our lives and ask questions.

394
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,620
So I will look through those for
those. The livestream. Okay. All right,

395
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,990
so we'll go to an audience
question first. Yes, yes, yes.

396
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,850
I'm Erica. Hi. Um, I actually have
three daughters, seven, 10 and 12.

397
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,870
And um, also very similar
to you, engineering,

398
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,890
art sort of my whole life.
I've kind of been in there,

399
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,510
so I understand the desire.
Um,

400
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,490
I wanted to know if you have heard of
what's called she heroes because I think

401
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:16,930
that modeling is a sort of a really
key thing for our daughters. Um,

402
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:21,430
and so there's a program called she
heroes were people like you and regular

403
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:24,580
people, um, do little video clips and,

404
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,680
and give models to young kids,

405
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,190
young girls for like being cool
and being cool and science.

406
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,950
So I was just curious.
Yeah, I hadn't heard of it,

407
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:35,880
but I will definitely put that on my
look. Lexi's okay, cool. I'll Google it.

408
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:40,670
Google it because it's, I mean, you
involved in that I think would be awesome.

409
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,570
Is that Shirley use,
do I am friends with somebody who does it?

410
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:46,940
So if you the connection,
I'm happy to set you up.

411
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,550
Sorry.
Already.

412
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,080
It is a very cool program for anybody
that our first question end plug and

413
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,590
going to the dory.
Uh,

414
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,900
so what's the coolest skill you've
learned while mythbusters that you've used

415
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,160
outside the show?

416
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,740
I should,
I say

417
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,570
no. Like as soon as someone says,
should I seen this, the answer,

418
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:07,650
of course we need to hear it.

419
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,880
I, um, well as I love to do artwork,

420
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,960
I have,

421
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,060
I used to really love the impressions
that black powder would make after you

422
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:18,894
exploded.

423
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,260
So I do some black powder painting
now at an undisclosed location that is

424
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:29,580
completely safe and completely
legal. It's, it's, um, it's really,

425
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:33,240
it's a fun medium to work with
when you know how to do it safely.

426
00:24:33,241 --> 00:24:36,720
And I learned how to do it safely and I
learned that you can get anything on the

427
00:24:36,721 --> 00:24:41,690
Internet from China
for your artistic passion.

428
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,050
So I have to build on that because the
explosions in mythbusters in slow mo are

429
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,400
phenomenal. And what is your
favorite all time explosion?

430
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,380
Oh, that's easy. Because you know,

431
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,170
people always ask me about my favorite
papered explosions and you know,

432
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,110
there's that pushing power of Amoco
photo and then c four is sort of like a

433
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:02,290
dirty quick one. But
like I love, I can't, oh,

434
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,510
like it might actually be an ignition,

435
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:08,720
but when we shot guns at,
um,

436
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,780
a propane tank, it made this
gorgeous, billowing, fiery,

437
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,640
probably not great for the environment.

438
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:19,540
Cloud that in slow motion kind of roles.

439
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:23,920
And it was just beautiful that in coffee
creamer also an ignition when coffee

440
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:26,380
creamer exploded it into the
air and lit it with a flair.

441
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,240
Also just like a fuel based kind
of Hollywood style explosion,

442
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:35,710
the kind of thing that you actually
expect to see as an explosion.

443
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,580
Cool audience, I'm sure. Yes.

444
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,810
I'm curious what your favorite myth was
that either never actually made it to

445
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:47,830
air or never got selected to
even be done at all. Uh, we,

446
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:48,970
we've definitely had,

447
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,210
we had a couple that didn't make it to
air either cause they were ridiculous or

448
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:52,811
we couldn't do them.

449
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:56,610
Where we tried to do this one called
squash weight lifter where, um, the,

450
00:25:56,611 --> 00:26:01,540
the idea was that one of those giant
Pumpkins from Monterey had the capacity to

451
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:06,320
lift a car if it grew
underneath it because it, it
had that kind of strength. Um,

452
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,400
but turns out all of us at black
thumbs and we couldn't grow anything.

453
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,880
And we had this like, not from gardens.
So we tried it twice, three times.

454
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:17,650
We had this garden set up with the best
hydroponics because San Francisco and

455
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:21,070
it's like crazy grow light disco den.

456
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:22,980
We had the seeds from some,
you know,

457
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,500
champion Pumpkin's and we couldn't
get anything bigger than this.

458
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,700
We try to try it. I'm like, ah.

459
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,100
But it was really fun because we had
that crazy garden and I enjoyed the,

460
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,340
it was a little zin going out
there and trying to garden,

461
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:38,860
but I guess the environment
just wasn't supporting it.

462
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,190
So recently Google has been doing
things like deep and Magenta

463
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,880
with some basic forays into AI,
creating art and music.

464
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,900
What would be some combinations of science
and art that are just completely psi

465
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,660
Phi that you would like
to see become reality?

466
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,340
Oh hmm.
I would like my own slave robot.

467
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,210
Android.
They could,

468
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:07,110
could light the explosions in my black
powder painting closer than I could.

469
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,560
That is a very complex question.
I like it. Um, have you ever seen,

470
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,070
I think they're called wind to
beasts. When debase, when base those,

471
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,820
those giant kinetic sculptures,
they move in the wind.

472
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,440
That that's my favorite kinetic
application of science to art.

473
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:29,700
I thought that was so beautiful.
It's all AI scares me though.

474
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,830
These aren't real people.
These are all wouldn't be surprised.

475
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,820
Testing the Beta tester on the scary AI.
We're going to go back.

476
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:41,160
They don't look like regular people.

477
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,150
How we're going to analyze the last
and make sure they were laughing.

478
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,650
Any appropriate party.
All right.

479
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,580
Scenes from mythbusters over
like, Hey, I'll do that.

480
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,460
You really wish what
club? Major error. Okay.

481
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,050
Oh, I mean, there's so many, but um,

482
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,710
I could tell you a super embarrassing one
that was kind of funny. Um, there was,

483
00:28:01,711 --> 00:28:03,810
uh,
there was a point where we were,

484
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:07,110
we were out in the desert and
tensions were high. It was hot.

485
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,780
People were fighting. It got
really sort of, uh, just,

486
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,080
just very tense.

487
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,120
And so I walked up into the middle of a
tense conversation and just walked up to

488
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:19,710
grant,
went pull my finger.

489
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,670
They laughed very hard as I think, you
know, that means you toot, right? Yeah.

490
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,470
Yeah. Okay. I just felt like, I was like,

491
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,170
I couldn't figure out anything
to make this better. It was like

492
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,950
nothing better than a girl fart.

493
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,250
Curl cars are funnier than dog hearts.

494
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,520
I'm not sure how to go about that. So
I'm not going to pivot off that question.

495
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:52,700
We will get so off the dory. What advice,
we'll take a couple more questions.

496
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:56,000
What advice would you give to
a young aspiring scientists?

497
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,910
But I'm going to modify it a little bit.
One of the youngest

498
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,760
firing female scientist.
Uh,

499
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,160
find a mentor and find an internship.

500
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,460
Find someone doing what you want to be
doing because likely they will help you

501
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,960
out. And ever people love
talking about themselves.

502
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:13,190
I've been doing it for
like half an hour now.

503
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,010
You can usually get in good
with somebody and they're,

504
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,170
they're likely to help you out.

505
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:21,230
And everybody loves an
insurer and they work hard.

506
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,960
They're trying to prove themselves
and they are cheap or free.

507
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,590
So you can get your foot in the door,
you can get some experience.

508
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:30,560
Find out if it's what you
really want to do. And I mean,

509
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:34,840
that's how I started on mythbusters is
just a lot of exploiting free labor.

510
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,630
So he started with sculpture.

511
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,000
And now you've mentioned
like the black powder stuff,

512
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:45,260
the kinetic art is sculptured still
your now, now TV films, Cetera. Uh,

513
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,070
it's sculpture is still your favorite
or do you have a new favorite?

514
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,990
Heck, no. I love sculpture rights.

515
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:54,290
I think in three d like I am a
much better sculptor than a draw.

516
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:58,420
It's someone who draws. I, if I have an
idea of something how I want it to look,

517
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,300
I can make it in clay better that can,
I can draw it.

518
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:05,140
So for me it's very calming and um,

519
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,010
I'm a bit of a multitasker,
so I will do sculptures. Well,

520
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,230
I listened to podcasts or watch TV or
try to have meetings when they're on not

521
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,120
Skype. Um, because they
can see that and I,

522
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:20,680
I still make a lot of them and I use
them as a terrifying parental learning

523
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:24,070
tools for my daughter.
I make these things called manners,

524
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:28,600
monsters or behavior beasties to
break her of habits such as a,

525
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:31,090
for a while she wasn't each to,
when she was much smaller,

526
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,470
she had a tendency not
to flush the toilet.

527
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,330
So we made a monster that looked like
it was crawling out of the toilet that I

528
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:41,230
said, if it stays in there too
long, it comes to life. Um,

529
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,350
we had booger monsters that you know the
boogers in your nose and if you go in

530
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:47,860
there and steal their food,

531
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,770
they're going to crawl out of
your nose and look for food.

532
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,590
They might crawl on your ear and eat your
brain and you'll never learn to read.

533
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,230
So we, we make these little, I have,

534
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,960
I have monsters grow
almost every bad behavior.

535
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:02,450
So I've got a ton of them now and they're
creepy and little kind of timber and

536
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:06,850
you look at things and that they've,
they cured her of nail biting real fast.

537
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,660
All right. Who would back a Kickstarter
campaign for a boob? Wildstar

538
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,890
terrifying your children into good
behaviors. We're going to take them,

539
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,110
we'll take one more,
one more dory and one more live question.

540
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,820
And then we have time
for a short mean green.

541
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:25,530
So I'm going to modify this a little bit.
So what's the most dangerous thing,

542
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:26,700
not that you did on the show,

543
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:30,110
but that you didn't do on the
show because you finally here.

544
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,350
This would probably be too dangerous to
film anything Tori ever suggested it and

545
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,631
all right,
so that sounds good.

546
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,210
We'll bring Tory in for a followup
and that will be the leading fashion.

547
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,640
All right.
We had a one more to the microphone.

548
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,020
Back to the art side. I do follow
your black powder work. Uh,

549
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,900
tried to dabble a little bit in it
myself and caused a little bit more fiery

550
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:56,710
explosions probably, and not a safe
manner as you, but for the art side,

551
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,430
do you, you've done a lot of
advocation for technology,

552
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:03,610
engineering and all of that.
How do you feel companies like this?

553
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:07,150
Like we have a makerspace here.
Uh, it's called the garage.

554
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:12,151
And do you try to advocate that artistic
side towards a lot of those ends to

555
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:13,391
those tech sides?

556
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:18,391
Cause I feel like sometimes that's
lost when there's a lot of science and

557
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:19,300
engineering and all of that.

558
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,920
You might lose some that ingenuity
or the fun of arm that comes with it.

559
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,390
Is that something that you often see or
is there anything that advocating wise

560
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,450
that you do on it?

561
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,400
I love living in the bay area because we
are clearly a strange bubble of people

562
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:38,330
who it's, I hear it's not
stem, it's steam. We put the
art in the stem because I,

563
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:42,800
I mean mathematicians are artists
and scientists are artists and I,

564
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:47,801
I think that the maker movement is
incredible and I love how DIY and sort of

565
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,380
that the whole sort of Etsy generation
is kind of bringing it back to an rd form

566
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,290
and the maker fairs
getting bigger every year.

567
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,320
And it's so cool to see people applying
all of their different brains into

568
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,340
something even.
It's ridiculous but beautiful and cool.

569
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,040
I love the maker movement.
Cool.

570
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,190
Well, I don't want to thank you
