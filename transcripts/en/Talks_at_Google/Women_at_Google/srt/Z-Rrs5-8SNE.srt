1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,470
So tell us about your journey.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,240
How did you know you want
it to be a doctor and this,

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,710
this whole path was really your calling?
You know,

4
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:15,600
I always say it was an accidental journey.

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:18,960
I don't think anything was super
intentional until maybe more recently,

6
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:23,961
but the whole point or path of being a
doctor really began when I was a child

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,340
and we took a trip to India. My parents
are Indian and we went to Calcutta,

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,580
which is a very busy bustling sitting,
bustling city in India.

9
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:37,581
And I just remember being stunned and I
remember literally getting up from the

10
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:40,770
airport all the way into the city,
just looking around.

11
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:45,600
It was my first trip there that I could
remember and just being shocked, stunned,

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,310
the poverty, the people, the noise,
the colors, the smells. It was just,

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,850
it was just overwhelming. And there's so
many things I remember from that trip,

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,480
you know, from meeting my family for
the first time or extended family too,

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,860
you know,
trying to speak in the,

16
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:02,220
and the most terrible way you can
possibly imagine and all this other stuff.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,280
But the thing that's stuck for years
later was just people on the street that

18
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:11,880
were hurt. They looked like they needed
care and something in me at that age,

19
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,730
I was 10 and it was just like, I
want to, I want to help people,

20
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,070
I want to do something.
So it's very naive.

21
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:19,320
Everyone walks around saying they want
to help people and they want to do

22
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:20,130
something.

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,963
Okay.

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,380
Stuck as I went through high school and
then as I got into college and that's in

25
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:28,710
college, I had doubts and I
had moments where I'm like,

26
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:32,430
I'm not sure if medicine is for me.
I love science, I love chemistry.

27
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,810
I love thinking through all of that.

28
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,710
But I also love writing and I love
speaking and I was thinking maybe more

29
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:39,480
journalism.
Maybe that's the way to go.

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,220
And at the end of the day I chose medicine
and embarked on that path and that

31
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:48,780
journey, which consumed me quite
honestly and left journalism behind,

32
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:52,230
left riding behind and read a book
and write and do anything for years.

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,740
And it's just funny how life works out.
Journalism found me again.

34
00:01:55,741 --> 00:02:00,180
So that that was sort of the path to
becoming a doctor and to entering this

35
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,250
field. Absolutely. That's so interesting.

36
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:05,180
And not only are you a
doctor but you really, um,

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,030
in a profound way combined western
medicine, eastern medicine.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,140
So can you talk a little bit about what
Skype did? You too, not just, you know,

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,290
do the traditional medical route,
but you know,

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,960
explore this whole other world that,
you know,

41
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,620
may not be as familiar to most people.
Yeah.

42
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:24,900
So that also is an accidental journey.

43
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,100
I never intended to jump into the world
of eastern medicine or integrative

44
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:32,430
medicine.
I was a hardcore Dr. Quite honestly,

45
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:35,700
I loved procedures.
I love adrenaline.

46
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,950
I want it to be an ICU doctor.

47
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:42,060
I interviewed across the country for
Icu fellowships and the only reason I

48
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,570
detoured from that was there was a lot
of stuff going on in our family back in

49
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:46,440
Atlanta.
And I was like,

50
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,500
I really need to be home for a year
or to settle all that stuff down.

51
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:52,590
Let me go back to Atlanta.
And I took a job in urgent care.

52
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,970
And so from urgent care I got recruited
into the emergency room and the

53
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:59,830
emergency room again is high
adrenaline, right? You're everything,

54
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,830
you're seeing everything you were
doing procedures and you know,

55
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,070
you see everything under the sun and you
meet every type of person under the sun.

56
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,550
So I liked it. I actually really loved
it. So that's the type of doctor I was.

57
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,510
But unfortunately the
years of medical school,

58
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:17,980
the years of your work or taking a toll,
and I didn't even realize it.

59
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,870
I wasn't even conscious or aware
of it. I was completely, you know,

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,350
disconnected from what
was happening with me.

61
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:26,800
I was more interested in kind of what I
was accomplishing or what I was doing.

62
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,880
And the kind of silent was
first that I always talk about.

63
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,000
Like you don't feel quite right.
Your joints are hurting a little bit,

64
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,880
you're starting to gain weight and
you can't really explain it. You know,

65
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:38,740
everything that was kind
of just very silent,

66
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:43,060
kind of murmuring under the surface for
years started to crescendo to the point

67
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,790
where I was losing hair.
It was noticeable.

68
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,790
I was gaining a significant amount
of weight. I had terrible acne.

69
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,050
I didn't feel good.

70
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:53,590
I would get dressed in the dark because
I was just so embarrassed to like try to

71
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:57,400
put myself together.
And then I still didn't connect.

72
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:00,190
I still didn't connect that something
was wrong and I needed to do something.

73
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,230
It's just I was so in my
head most of the time.

74
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,650
And it was finally a couple of things.
It was my mom,

75
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,130
he was really proud of my original Indian
hair cause I have the best hair in the

76
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:11,440
family.
And it was absolutely devastated.

77
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:16,030
But now like half of it was gone and it
was my now husband who we were dating at

78
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,560
the time. It was just like,
something's wrong with you.

79
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:20,740
You need to get checked out, you know,
I, you know, he goes, I don't care.

80
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,980
But like I feel like something's wrong.
And it was my patients, you know,

81
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:28,030
because the Er at some point is
still primary care nowadays. Right.

82
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,300
So there are patients that would come
in and had seen me for a few years and

83
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:32,560
they were staring up at my scalp.

84
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,350
They weren't really looking at
me or paying attention to me.

85
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:39,340
And so it was kind of those three things
that motivated me to start this journey

86
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,610
of trying to understand
what was happening, what was
happening with my health,

87
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:43,690
what did I need to do.

88
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,190
And that began my journey
for finding answers.

89
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,060
And that journey didn't go
really well. It, you know,

90
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:54,700
it was so frustrating and you know, not
to jump ahead, but I've been, you know,

91
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:58,750
to deal with my leather and long right
now who has a new diagnosis of cancer.

92
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,990
I'm back in that conventional medicine
world and that journey hasn't changed for

93
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:04,390
people. It's just as hellish
as I remember it being.

94
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,250
And I went from doctor to doctor trying
to get answers, trying to get solutions,

95
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,020
solutions and didn't really get anywhere.

96
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,630
Went to the quote unquote best
doctors in the city, you know,

97
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:16,420
it was willing to travel to get answers,
nothing.

98
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:20,650
And then finally got put on a medication
that one of the side effects of the

99
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:22,780
medication was that it
dropped my blood pressure.

100
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,210
Now I'm telling the story not just
to tell you what happened to me,

101
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,500
but also that explain how disconnected
I was and I was a physician, right?

102
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:33,160
So I'm put on this medication,
I'm following what I was told to do.

103
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,190
I'm not paying attention or digging
into the fact that, you know,

104
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,890
this might drop my blood pressure,
my blood pressure is already low.

105
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:42,040
Shame on me for that. Right? I already
have this knowledge. So anyhow,

106
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,980
I dropped my blood pressure dropped
dramatically one day while I was driving.

107
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:48,010
And so I got into a wreck.
I could have hit somebody else,

108
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:49,960
I could have hit another car,
I could have died.

109
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:54,070
And so that was sort of just the jolt
of like, you know, like what am I doing?

110
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:54,820
You know?

111
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,820
And so that began a search for answers
that began going home that day and being

112
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,770
like, I've got to figure something else
out and I've got to do it on my own.

113
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:05,780
There's really nobody else
who's going to do this for me.

114
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,320
There's no prints coming in. There's
no magic solution. There's no one pill.

115
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,300
So I just started studying,

116
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:15,020
I studied everything I could get my hands
on and it began with a weekend course

117
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:18,020
and holistic medicine. And
then that became, you know,

118
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:22,010
wanting to be certified in nutrition
and that became wanting to learn Chinese

119
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,520
medicine.

120
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,150
So I flew to San Francisco and became a
licensed acupuncturist and study Chinese

121
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,370
herbal medicine.
I learned about Iyer Veda,

122
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:30,950
which was a little bit in my roots
and got reintroduced to that.

123
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,850
And then finally did the
integrative medicine fellowship
with Dr while which has

124
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:35,601
an Arizona.

125
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:39,770
And so spent two years going through
that program and that kind of finally I

126
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:40,491
finished that program,

127
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:44,210
I think it was 2008 that gave me the
confidence to put like all these little

128
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:48,470
pieces I had back together in terms of
maybe taking care of somebody else. Now,

129
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:51,740
all the information I had gathered up
until that point I had fixed myself.

130
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:55,610
It took me a good two years, but I
had fixed myself. But then, you know,

131
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,980
it was everybody else asking
questions like, what'd you do? Well,

132
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:00,350
how did that happen? What was
the solution there? You know,

133
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,720
what or would you take it?
What do you do acupuncture for this.

134
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,560
So all those questions and then finishing
the fellowship, that was sort of,

135
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,260
you know, the kind of the
moment where like, Hey, I might,

136
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,340
I might have something here. I might be
able, might be able to help a few people.

137
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,330
So, so that got me into the
world of eastern medicine,

138
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,760
integrative medicine,
functional medicine, nutrition,

139
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,770
all these different fields
that you hear about today.

140
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,940
But that was my entry into it.
Absolutely. No really interesting journey.

141
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:30,800
I think wellness is such a buzzword as
everywhere and it's kind of just the new

142
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:35,150
fad. So how do you define wellness and
how do you break down some of those

143
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,430
stereotypes or misconceptions that
are out in the media and you know,

144
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:44,300
in our everyday lives today? Yeah,
I feel like wellness is such a,

145
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,160
a used term now, right? Everybody's
talking about wellness in our vernacular,

146
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:52,940
which I think is great. I mean, I think
it's fantastic that we've shifted from,

147
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,000
you know, disease management to
wellness. I think that's a huge,

148
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,700
huge accomplishment culturally.
So that's fantastic.

149
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,430
But wellness means different
things to different people. Right?

150
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,290
And it depends on who you're talking to.

151
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,190
I remember him coming from this vantage
point in this perspective of having all

152
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,040
this different types of
training kind of under my belt,

153
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,900
including conventional medical training.

154
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,100
And so when I sit back and I think about
what does wellness mean to me and what

155
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:20,150
does it mean for my patients or from
my center or for anyone that I touch,

156
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,190
it's really cumulative.
It's additive.

157
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:24,800
There's not one factor
that defines wellness.

158
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,250
And so it's really the accumulation
of a number of different things.

159
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:31,640
And I would start with energy,
like where's your energy?
If you have good energy,

160
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,140
your emotional landscape. I mean, I think
the further I get along, it's funny.

161
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,380
It's like I know so much chemistry and
I know someone's physiology and I'm sure

162
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:41,930
we'll talk about all of that.
But the further I get along,

163
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:44,930
it's like I'm understanding
how powerful our emotions are,

164
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,410
how powerful our sense of connection is.
That's a part of wellness too.

165
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,670
I think it is chemistry. It's
your nutrition, it's your
biologies, your physiology,

166
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,340
what's your gut doing? Do
you have inflammation? It's
all of those things as well,

167
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,790
and then it is about community and
family and support and spirituality.

168
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,150
All of those things define wellness when
that is the reason I think that so many

169
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:09,900
people send my exam rooms or my offices
or talk to me when I'm out and they're

170
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:13,050
like, well, I don't understand. I
ate this way. I did this, I did that.

171
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,490
Why did I get x, Y, and z? It's because
again, it's cumulative, it's additive,

172
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,640
and it can feel overwhelming
to try to tackle all of that,

173
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,740
but unless we start to sit back and
understand that it's all influencing each

174
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:26,521
other.
You know,

175
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:30,600
I had an expert tell me recently that
a hamburger on vacation is metabolized

176
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,390
completely differently than a hamburger
when you're stressed out or you might be

177
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,340
eating it right now. So, I mean, again,

178
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,940
it's like it's so cumulative and so
additive and we have to understand how all

179
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,200
those pieces come together.

180
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,280
And the beauty of eastern systems of
medicine is that they stress that from the

181
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:48,030
get go. It wasn't just, you know,
take this herb. It was like, well,

182
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,560
what's the rest of your life doing?

183
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:53,250
And then trying to understand how to put
all that together. I love it. I love it.

184
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,960
Um,
so you know,

185
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,110
obviously western medicine hat then what
would be like a hack or something that,

186
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,760
you know, um, you know,

187
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,180
is a general tip that you could give
to some of our viewers or audiences?

188
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,200
I know that, you know,
our worlds are so crazy,

189
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:14,100
but if you could do one thing today,
what would you suggest doing? Am I god?

190
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,780
Besides buying super woman? Right. Well
I think the first thing I was stressed,

191
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:21,120
you know, and it's funny cause I think
my answer's changed over the years,

192
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,630
but I think the very first thing I
would stress is the importance of being

193
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,770
connected to yourself.

194
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,520
I think that's the most important thing
you can do to not ignore yourself.

195
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,550
I think most people and most women in
particular ignore the soft and silent

196
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:37,170
whispers that we here on any given day,

197
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:41,160
they'll ignore the fact that I'm tired
more days out of, out of, you know,

198
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,040
out of the week, then I'm not, you know,

199
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,400
or that something's hurting or that my
hair's falling or this joints bothering

200
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:51,250
me or why am I gaining weight or losing
weight either direction, you know, um,

201
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,920
more so than I ever have in the past.

202
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:54,840
Or Why am I suddenly getting
more anxiety or depression?

203
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,300
I think we collectively
ignore those things.

204
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,960
And I think the most important thing
before you start any health or wellness

205
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,200
journey is to understand how
to get connected back to you.

206
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,830
I would say that's the first thing and
there's so many different ways to do that.

207
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:09,950
I mean, that's a really big
blanket statement, right?

208
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,740
But it's everything from just adopt
one habit that you could do everyday.

209
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,460
Maybe you journal every morning, maybe
you pray everyday, maybe you meditate,

210
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,550
you know, maybe you go for a walk in
nature. You know, but whatever it is,

211
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:24,480
have that conversation with yourself in
whatever format you want to because I

212
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,650
will bring you back to yourself.

213
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,590
So that would be my first kind
of foundational starting point.

214
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,180
Then we can keep building
from there if you want. No,
it's great. I mean, you know,

215
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,600
Googlers are often high
achieving individuals, um,

216
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,080
are constantly, you know, plugged in,

217
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,200
dealing with many
different levels of stress.

218
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,880
So what do you do to unplug
or any suggestions for when
you feel like you're on

219
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,570
that brink of burnout or you feel
something coming along, you know,

220
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,890
besides getting in touch with yourself,

221
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:55,840
what some things that maybe you
like to do? I think, you know,

222
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,410
it's so easy to get burned out when
you're a high achiever because you want to

223
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,230
accomplish a lot. I still want to
accomplish a lot. I'm far from done,

224
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,190
but you have to watch your energy and you
have to watch kind of your boundaries.

225
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,490
And I think it's so hard to do because
there's always that goal or that next

226
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:13,630
milestone that you're, you're
trying to get to, are trying
to accomplish. So again,

227
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,300
I think one of the things in
your schedule, put the breaks in.

228
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,510
I think you need to put in
breaks throughout the day,
especially for you guys,

229
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:21,550
right?
Cause you guys are on technology a lot.

230
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,410
And I think that in
itself is very draining.

231
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:26,770
We're learning more and more about the
effects of that as we get further along.

232
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:28,000
But I think putting those breaks in,

233
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,060
I would take three 10 minute breaks
throughout your workday. You know,

234
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:34,930
where you are forced to get up, get
away from computers, cell phones, iPads,

235
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:36,160
all that other stuff.
You know,

236
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:39,220
maybe walk outside the building for
just a little bit. Get fresh air.

237
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,970
It's amazing how just fresh
air and sunlight can shift
your energy very quickly.

238
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,750
So that's just a quick, easy hack
that you can do anywhere. So you know,

239
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:50,530
those three, 10 minute breaks, I
would also strongly advise, you know,

240
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,740
this is so easy to do too,
but really put in your schedule a block,

241
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,520
maybe an hour to two hours a week to
do something that lowers cortisol.

242
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,950
So that means you know,
you're not running necessarily,

243
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:03,610
but you're walking or you're going for
a swim or you're doing yoga or maybe

244
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:07,210
you're just a nature for a period of time
or go ahead and schedule that massage

245
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,190
or acupuncture or something
along those lines.

246
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,340
Those are ways to recharge because the
biggest problem with high achievers,

247
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,660
and I'd be so curious to
see what everybody a Google
test out as in the power

248
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:17,351
type plan.

249
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:22,000
But the biggest problem
with high achievers is that
they never take time out to

250
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,240
de stress. You're in high
adrenaline mode all the time.

251
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,390
And the problem with high adrenaline
is yes you get stuff done,

252
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,640
but at some point you're
going to crash and burn.

253
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:34,570
And that crash and burn comes as
maybe mild symptoms. I'm just tired.

254
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:37,510
It's hard to get to work in the
morning to things that are so severe.

255
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,080
Like I can't move I, you know,
I'm depressed or things like that.

256
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:44,840
So you never want to get to that place.
So putting those natural breaks in,

257
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,520
you know, 10 minutes throughout the day,
two to three hours a week, you know,

258
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:51,760
where you're doing something that's
very different from your job,

259
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:55,840
but you're also doing something that's
forcing you to lower cortisol cause

260
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,600
that's the hormone that you
guys are at the most risk for.

261
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,320
And that could be any of the modalities
that do that, whether it's walking,

262
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:06,940
doing yoga, swimming, you know, doing
acupuncture or doing massage, you know,

263
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:09,400
any of those things
that force you to relax.

264
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:13,000
So those are probably my strongest
tips for that. Awesome. Love it.

265
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:17,590
And I know you said a really important
piece of this wellness journey is knowing

266
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:18,424
yourself.
Yes.

267
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,540
And you've actually developed a really
interesting way to know yourself a little

268
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,580
bit more through this idea of power types.

269
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,150
So could you talk to us a little bit about
the different power types and how you

270
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:32,110
thought of this whole methodology?
Yes, definitely. So again, you know,

271
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,000
I have all this different types of
training under my belt, eastern medicine,

272
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,310
Chinese Ayurvedic Nutrition,
you know,

273
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,460
and then at the same time I'm doing
conventional Western medicine labs.

274
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,520
And our office. So I'm looking at hormone
levels, I'm looking at nutrient levels,

275
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,130
I'm getting real data,
you know,

276
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,470
to match kind of what I'm seeing
with the other diagnostic systems.

277
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,180
And one of the things I
learned, you know, I've,

278
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,910
I continue as I sit with
women in particular, even men,

279
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,850
there's probably a book for then
coming soon. But, but even, but

280
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,830
what I've noticed is, again,
this, this loss of what to do,

281
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:05,870
they don't have a roadmap,
they don't have a plan.

282
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,050
And that was the question I get asked
over and over again. Like, you know,

283
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,470
it's classic go bring a bag of
supplements or they'll bring five books or

284
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,930
whatever. Like I don't know what
to do, please tell me what to do.

285
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,020
And so we're all different, right?
We're all unique, we're all individual.

286
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:22,130
But as I was talking to women and I'm
about 12,000 women in over the last decade

287
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,610
of seeing patients and you listen to
them and you're hearing their stories and

288
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:29,150
then you're interpreting data, the
pattern started the lineup, you know,

289
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:33,980
and so somebody who have this medical
condition and this hormone imbalance was

290
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:37,550
also this ayurvedic type,
this Chinese medicine Meridian imbalance,

291
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,440
this nutritional deficiency over here.

292
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,990
And I could start to see him at
a certain point in the practice.

293
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,990
And then I started to track them
and I started to write them down.

294
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:47,240
And when you start to write them down
and track them, then you're like,

295
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,740
oh my gosh,
there's something here.

296
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,660
We would have this powerful prescriptive
formula for empowerment really to help

297
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:58,190
us all feel amazing if we use the tools
of both and merge them together and we'd

298
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,470
be able to understand,
I think this is why I do this.

299
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:01,820
This is why I need to eat this way.

300
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,360
So that's how the whole
concept of power typing began.

301
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,420
So it started with a
bunch of spreadsheets. Uh,
probably Google spreadsheet

302
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,820
is lots of Google spreadsheets and
entered a lot of data just to track what,

303
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,290
what was happening.
And then as I developed the five types of,

304
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:21,170
these are five power types and they each
have a distinct way that they need to

305
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:23,930
eat, they need to move their
personalities tie into it.

306
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:26,390
Their emotional tendencies
tie into that as well.

307
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,660
There are know supplements that they
might need their hormone imbalances.

308
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,800
And so as I develop them, then the next
step was to name them. And so the names,

309
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:37,130
again I've stolen literally from
eastern systems of medicine.

310
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:39,500
So the five power types,
just to review them real quickly.

311
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:43,790
The first one is the Gypsy girl and the
Gypsies. My creative super creative.

312
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:48,020
Some of you may be Gypsies, but have
that Vata energy from Ayurvedic Medicine,

313
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:48,411
you know,

314
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:52,550
have that sort of adrenal issue where
they're more likely to go into adrenal

315
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,500
fatigue, have anxiety,
those types of things.

316
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:58,580
So there's a whole set of issues
that are both pros and cons that are,

317
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,060
that come with being a gypsy.
And the second one is the boss lady.

318
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:05,150
And that's your high achiever. That's
your go getter. You're commander.

319
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,820
The boss lady is amazing.

320
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:10,550
We have a lot of boss ladies we know
and apparently there are a lot of boss

321
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:15,260
ladies you know that are very
high achieving women in at work,

322
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,870
but they're the biggest
problem there is an IRS data.

323
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,120
They're more pitta and they hold all
their stress and their digestive system.

324
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:25,610
So the first thing to go for a boss lady
is usually something with their gut.

325
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,780
So Ibs, constipation, reflux, you
name it. But then that goes on.

326
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,910
And this is where modern science,
Intersex,

327
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,700
we know that all inflammation
today begins in the gut.

328
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,880
We know that in science we're seeing that
when we do research on the microbiome

329
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,800
and all that other good stuff.
Chinese medicine,

330
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:43,040
Ayurvedic Medicine had already
talked about that. So again,

331
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,390
if you knew this ahead of time,

332
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,790
if you knew you're a boss lady and you
know that you're going to hold your

333
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,320
stress in your digestive system,

334
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,200
that all the more important to be on the
right diet for you to protect against

335
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:55,620
inflammation, to protect against those
autoimmune diseases and things like that.

336
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,470
Uh, the next one is a blend.
And that's what both of us are,

337
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:02,490
we're both savvy chicks and that's a
blend of the Gypsy and the boss lady.

338
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:04,960
So part creative part go getter.

339
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:08,250
So at times we're probably lost somewhere
in space and at other times we're like,

340
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,860
go, go, go. Right. So, so it's the blend,

341
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:14,040
but then you have the medical issues of
both in the hormone patterns of both and

342
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,230
the nutritional needs of both.
Um,

343
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,010
I think after that it was the earth
Mama and the Earth Mama is the nurture.

344
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:23,250
I will say as the person that's like
the center of a home in the center of a

345
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:27,270
family. You guys probably know
in Earth, mama around you or,

346
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,770
or within your own families.

347
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:33,771
But they are the worst about establishing
boundaries and really attending to

348
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,221
their own needs.

349
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:39,090
They're usually worried about everybody
else and they defined themselves really

350
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:42,450
through everybody else.
But there's a medical consequence to that.

351
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:44,100
And that's what we find with Earth Mamas.

352
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:48,690
They often have issues with
insulin resistance, with
diabetes, with hypertension,

353
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:50,580
more cardio metabolic type issues.

354
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:54,120
They're the ones the most likely
to get depressed because again,

355
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,950
they don't have their own like foundation
and so forth. So that's the Earth Mama.

356
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:03,480
And then the last one is the Nightingale
and the Nightingale is that mission

357
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:08,481
oriented service focused person who just
is about a higher calling and a higher

358
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:13,470
cost. But again to the point
that they sacrifice themselves.

359
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:17,670
And so they may be your friend that's
on mission trips constantly and then it

360
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:20,640
turns around that they're getting like
pneumonia and bronchitis and like all

361
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,410
these different illnesses
over and over again.

362
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,140
It typically taxes their immune system,
you know,

363
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,040
that's the first thing that goes
for them. So you know, for them,

364
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,250
I've had a lot of Nightingale's and
practice as well and it's always reminding

365
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:36,150
them that the mission is important, but
the mission is only as good as they are,

366
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:39,330
right? So they've got to take the time to
rebuild their immune system. And again,

367
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:40,800
there's a diet that matches that.

368
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,370
Their supplements that match that
there's a certain way they should move.

369
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:47,550
They should not be running and doing
marathons and all that other stuff when

370
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:50,240
they're in that Nightingale phase.
So you know,

371
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,690
it's fascinating to help women understand
who they are, see them, do the plan,

372
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:55,980
and then see them make changes.

373
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:59,850
And then the other important thing
though is as women in particular,

374
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,420
at any given time, we may be any one of
those power types. We're going to shift.

375
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:05,160
We're hormonal creature,
so we're going to shift.

376
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:08,730
We may have a phase of our lives where
we're full on boss ladies, right?

377
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:12,240
But then we may switch and have a phase
where we're the earth Mama or have a

378
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:15,490
later phase where we're the Nightingale.
All of that's irrelevant, right?

379
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,400
It's more important for you
just to connect to who you
are at any given phase so

380
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:23,490
that you understand how to take
care of yourself and that face.

381
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:26,790
There's so many people. When I first came
out with this was, well, what's better?

382
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,790
Which is the best one? Which is
like the best one to be. I'm like,

383
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,240
they're all good. Every single
one is good. It's just the,

384
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,950
the point of this was to understand who
you are and really put some thought into,

385
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:41,700
hey, this is who I am and
therefore this is my roadmap.

386
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,310
And then once you have
that roadmap for me,

387
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,370
what I really wanted in writing this
particular book and the power type formula

388
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:52,780
is I wanted anyone who touched it and
picked it up to begin that conversation

389
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:56,070
with themselves to begin to
understand themselves. You know,

390
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,010
I'm not saying I have all the answers in
there for every aspect of their health,

391
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,390
but I sure do have a way for them to
at least begin that that road and that

392
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,880
journey so that you don't
waste five or six years.

393
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,330
Like I did like feeling bad about
yourself, not like going for it,

394
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:12,370
are doing everything you're
supposed to do. You know,

395
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:16,060
you really are just full fledged ahead
being the super woman you're supposed to

396
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:18,760
be. I didn't and I firmly
believe that. Yeah, I love it.

397
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:22,060
And you got the superwoman title
from your daughter, right? Yeah.

398
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,780
So this was a fun story.
So, you know, we were,

399
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:29,410
I had this concept already in my
head of types of women and you know,

400
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:32,750
it was tracking and doing all that
other stuff. And I think it was a,

401
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,300
we were on a car ride with my daughter.

402
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:37,390
We had just come from an event where a
lot of women that come up to me that we

403
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:41,050
know and has been making comments and
she was with me and we get in the car and

404
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,200
we're driving and she's like,
mom you need to write a book for women.

405
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,100
And I'm like, I do. And she's like,
yeah, you need to write a book. I go,

406
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,250
well what would you write? What
would you call it? You know,

407
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,590
and she says a old soul,
but she's like,

408
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,790
you need to write a book called Super
Woman Cause you're a super woman.

409
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,120
I feel like every woman I meet is all
talking about how you're a super woman.

410
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:03,280
So maybe you need to help
everybody else be a super woman.

411
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,040
Cause I just see you as
mom, you know. So anyhow,

412
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,200
so she actually came up with a
title. I'm like, you're right.

413
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,350
That's a really great ideas.
So we call the book the Super Women Rx,

414
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:15,790
and I dedicated the book to her
because it is her idea and her title.

415
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,420
And she helped me actually to
with the power type names as well.

416
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:23,120
And she took the test. She was only
eight I think when I started the concept.

417
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,290
She was a nine almost 10
when the book was published.

418
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,470
But she still goes in and takes the test.
I'm like,

419
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,090
half these questions aren't relevant
to you. She's like, it's okay.

420
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:34,690
I already figured it out.
I'm a gypsy is hilarious.

421
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,580
She's a cutie. I love it. I love
it. So we're at Google, right?

422
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:42,100
We're all about technology
and the digital world.

423
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,630
How do you think about digital technology
and how it integrates with medicine

424
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:47,380
today?

425
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,950
Or even the things that you do on a daily
basis or your practice or how you help

426
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:55,390
women? How much time
do you have? Well, no,

427
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,890
so you know,

428
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,150
I am the biggest technological
idiot you've ever met in your life.

429
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:05,060
So my tech support when I was like
21 was my nine year old sister.

430
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:09,190
So I never thought I'd have to spend
as much time thinking about technology,

431
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:13,990
but it is a reality of today and it
has absolutely impacted our business,

432
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:17,440
is impacted the practice as impacting
patient care quite honestly.

433
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,770
So technology is a must and I have
forcefully had to immerse myself in that

434
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:25,030
world and try to understand,
you know,

435
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:29,770
how this piece of of the equation
fits in into what I'm doing.

436
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,610
And here's what I think.
I think that technology is amazing.

437
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,560
We need technology to track that, to
track our data, to track our numbers,

438
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,210
to help remind us of habits and
behaviors and to help with resources.

439
00:23:43,211 --> 00:23:45,100
We absolutely need technology for that.

440
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,350
And I think one of the limitations that
even I'm experiencing with this type of

441
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,690
medicine that we're
doing is, uh, you know,

442
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:54,920
there's not a central place to get this
information right. It's not coming out.

443
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,560
So a lot of it is having to come out
of my mouth or something that I write.

444
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,190
It would be amazing to have this stuff
available in real time for women,

445
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,230
so they understand, okay, I just
told you you're a gypsy girl.

446
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,530
And they'll go figure out your, all
the other resources you need, you know,

447
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:08,180
and we continually updated.

448
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,230
So I know that there's a need for that
type of technology that is resourceful

449
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,200
data tracking, motivating, educational.

450
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,890
There's that from a practice standpoint,
what we have noticed,

451
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:22,010
and we're actually developing our own
platform because it's such an issue,

452
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,150
is that to do the medicine that I'm doing,
there's not the technology out there.

453
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:29,930
So it slows me down from a practice
standpoint and it prevents my growth.

454
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,660
So for medicine to really move forward,

455
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,800
we've got to have systems that
integrate all the information, right,

456
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:38,800
that put all the information
together, you know, and,

457
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:41,620
and really help patients with the
full picture of their health. I,

458
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,520
I define wellness for you earlier.

459
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,610
Well that technology needs to
match that definition, you know,

460
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:51,020
and it needs to be able to show
people this is the cumulative additive

461
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,870
properties of your health,
this is what your wellness looks like.

462
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:58,100
And it's taking all of that into account.
And then from a operational standpoint,

463
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:00,230
with the practice and with the,
with the business,

464
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:03,290
it needs to mirror that as well.
Right? So that's where we are.

465
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:07,520
We're trying to develop a platform so
that we can then take this medicine,

466
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,010
make it more efficient,
make it scalable,

467
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:13,040
and then allow it to
grow beyond just Atlanta,

468
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,550
the few centers that we have in Atlanta
and be able to grow beyond so that women

469
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:19,820
everywhere it can have access to it.
And then same thing with, you know,

470
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:21,080
the super women theory.

471
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:24,860
We want technology there so that women
can continue to grow in that process of

472
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:28,550
having that conversation with themselves
and understanding who they are. Because,

473
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,690
you know, I love the books,
I love writing, but not that
many people read anymore.

474
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,570
Right? They want like, they
want quicker information,

475
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:38,930
they want to download it faster.
So the book is a great foundational step,

476
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:42,530
but the next step is probably
technology slowly. Super interesting.

477
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:45,140
And I know you mentioned
this idea of expansion.

478
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,590
So what's next for you for the center?

479
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,530
What are you most excited about
in the next six to 12 months?

480
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,820
Maybe in your personal life at centers
space, but also in the medical world,

481
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:59,890
what excites you and gets you out of
bed every morning? Oh my gosh. Um,

482
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,801
there's so much.

483
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:05,390
I think that in the medical world it's
fascinating to continue to watch the

484
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:08,840
intersection of genetics,

485
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,900
new food and nutrition and all these
other data points that we've been talking

486
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:14,691
about for years.

487
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:19,280
How they intersect and
are really redefining what
prevention is and redefining

488
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:22,820
what healthy is. You know,
so the conventional world
needs some time to catch up.

489
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,630
But what's super exciting is seeing the
integrator worlds and the functional

490
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:30,080
medicine world really start
to gain their spot. You know,

491
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,950
it really start to come into the forefront
and lead some of these conversations

492
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:37,760
on what prevention really means. What
does healthy really mean, you know?

493
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:41,090
And that for the longest time there was
just a one line or flat definition of

494
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:44,520
that. I think the other thing
that me out of bed in the morning,

495
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:49,320
just from a medical standpoint is I'm
a huge believer and family wellness.

496
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:53,760
I've lived in a situation where the
family was not well and the center of that

497
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:57,510
family all was the woman, you know? So
that's why I decided to start with women.

498
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,940
You know,
because when the woman is not healthy,

499
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,140
it reverberates out into her children,
her husband, her extended family,

500
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:06,750
her community, her, you know, her city.

501
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,050
And so I think it's so
important to shift culture.

502
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:13,980
We have to create strong families
and we have to create really unified,

503
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:17,310
healthy families. And it starts with
a woman. So what gets me excited,

504
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,470
and the challenge quite honestly,

505
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,230
is understanding that when
it comes to women's health,

506
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,460
there are miles and miles and miles
of work to do journeys to travel.

507
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,300
Because we historically have gas lit,
women's health issues,

508
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,570
women's health issues were always
brushed to the side because it was a male

509
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:36,390
dominated field when
western medicine was born.

510
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,870
So to really change what's
happening within a family,

511
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,170
I've got to change what's
happening with women, right?

512
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:45,180
And if I can change what's happening with
women than I can turn around an impact

513
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:45,781
that family.

514
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:48,750
So that's what gets me out of bed in the
morning is knowing that that's sort of

515
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:52,710
the framework from which I'm functioning
and I love it. And to this day,

516
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:55,890
there's not a day that I walk into my
practice and I don't learn something or I

517
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,020
speak and I don't learn
something from somebody I meet.

518
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,590
And it's just such a fascinating
journey as far as the practice goes.

519
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:02,820
And as far as I go,

520
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,460
I mean we're just going to continue
to grow and scale and expand.

521
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:06,390
We're trying to again,

522
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:11,391
use technology to make this old way of
doing things better and more efficient.

523
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,730
Right? Cause we're now in
a culture that, you know,

524
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,860
we can't sit and talk for two hours
about something. So how do we create,

525
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:23,910
this takes the old system of medicine
integrated with the newer modern medicine,

526
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,320
but then it's at the same time preserve
the character of the flavor but also

527
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:31,560
make it efficient and run the way it's
supposed to run. So that's our challenge.

528
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,920
So that keeps me going in the center
and technology is a big part of that

529
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,410
conversation.
So six to 12 months from now,

530
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:40,080
I hope that we have our technology rad.

531
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,520
I hope that we are opening in launching
maybe here in New York and La and other

532
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:48,000
places around the country.
And as far as I go,

533
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:51,180
I hope I continue to do the work that
needs to be done to get this message out

534
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,490
louder and louder.
Well that's amazing.

535
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,020
What a great mission and we're
here to help and support. Um,

536
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:02,430
so we'll open up the floor for questions.
You know, as you're, as you're talking,

537
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:07,431
it makes me think a lot about the
obesity epidemic in this country.

538
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,060
Um, and how, you know,

539
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,650
I'm just wondering,
you know,

540
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,430
where does that all connect in here and
how do you think about bringing that to

541
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,230
folks who probably need it?

542
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,060
That's such a great word than maybe some
of us or some others. Definitely. I mean,

543
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:30,120
I think the obesity epidemic has happened
for a number of different reasons.

544
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:35,130
Probably the number one reason is honestly
our food sourcing and the production

545
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:37,830
of our food.
The more and more we dig into obesity,

546
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:41,680
we're understanding that a lot of what
was used over the last 30 40 years

547
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:45,550
between additives and
fillers and preservatives and
things like that have been

548
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,580
hormone disruptors and have
contributed to that conversation.

549
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,890
So when it comes to obesity,
again,

550
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:55,891
if we can educate a family on the
right way to eat in a way that's not,

551
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:56,561
you know,

552
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,400
everyone has a sort of preconceived
notion that eating healthy is expensive,

553
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:00,671
right?

554
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:04,930
So if we can help families
learn to navigate that
terrain so they understand how

555
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:08,200
to make healthy choices. And again,
it usually starts with a woman, right?

556
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:10,180
Because the woman's doing the
cooking, the shopping, the buying.

557
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:13,390
So the more empowered you can
make the woman of the family,

558
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,920
typically it'll go out into the,

559
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:18,700
into the children and into the other
adults with the family to help with the

560
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:23,470
obesity crisis. Um, we just are
also a culture of over consumption,

561
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:24,700
quite honestly.
You know,

562
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:28,630
we're eating way more than we need to
eat and that goes to our children and it

563
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:30,670
goes to us as adults as well.

564
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,670
So helping people understand
what normal consumption is,

565
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:34,930
I think is a big part of it.

566
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:37,970
And that's where the whole conversation
on food waste also comes up, right?

567
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:41,380
Because we waste so much food too.
So the obesity conversation,

568
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:46,360
I know there's been a huge spotlight
with movement and activity. Uh,

569
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:50,830
I'm going to push back on that and say
it's honestly 80% food and it's only 20%

570
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:51,640
activity.

571
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,640
And I think that's where maybe we have
the conversation wrong to a certain

572
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:55,510
extent.
You know,

573
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,580
I do also think that technology is an
issue for obesity in the future. You know,

574
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:01,930
how are we going to take this tool,

575
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:05,500
this amazing tool that we have of being
connected to anyone anywhere in the

576
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,050
world and get information
at any given moment,

577
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,710
but at the same time
create some boundaries and
parameters so that people are

578
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:15,700
using it in a way that is productive and
proactive and not working against them.

579
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,090
So the biggest thing I've seen in
pediatrics, you know, which is another,

580
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,820
it's another one of my
medical love so to speak,

581
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:26,821
but is that children don't have the
boundaries to navigate technology.

582
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:30,790
And adults don't have the education to
help them navigate those boundaries.

583
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,980
And again,
as much as I know I've had,

584
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:36,370
I've struggled with that with
my two children, you know,
and what's, what's normal,

585
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:40,270
what's not normal, what's, okay. So I
think technology, I think food first.

586
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:43,220
I think our food is the
biggest problem. I think, uh,

587
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,420
looking at technology and looking at
how children are trapped in rooms,

588
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,220
a lot of the times they're not outside.

589
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,580
I think the overscheduling of
families as an issue too. I mean,

590
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:56,380
all of these things are factors that
play into obesity for sure. And then,

591
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,920
you know, when it comes to different
socioeconomic groups, you know,

592
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:04,630
helping them with food deserts in areas
that aren't getting high quality food.

593
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,381
I mean,
there's so many.

594
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,250
I could talk forever on this and I'll
probably need to stop, but, but, um,

595
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,300
but there's so many great studies,

596
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:13,420
like if you give a young child
any socioeconomic status,

597
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,260
if you give them salads and healthy
vegetables and all that other stuff,

598
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:21,490
they will continue to choose that. But
the minute you introduce like a high salt,

599
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:24,340
high fat food, their
palate changes. You know?

600
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,840
And when they did a study comparing lower
socioeconomic kids and their parents

601
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:32,560
and giving them food choices, the kids
actually chose the healthier foods.

602
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,510
The parents had been so acclimated to a
certain tastes that they chose the the

603
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:41,930
junky or foods, you know, so a lot of
how it training is happening, you know,

604
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:46,460
there's a lot that needs to take place
there. So I think it's education. Again,

605
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:47,360
I think it's change,

606
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,140
it's got to be changed in our industry
and our food processing and then creating

607
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:54,260
environments where children can
thrive and adults can thrive as well.

608
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,440
That's super interesting. Yeah.
What's your view on sugar?

609
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,000
That's another hot topic.

610
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,940
So sugar is probably maybe the number
one culprit and he had to as sugar and

611
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,240
salt. I think those are the two things
and and all the different forms of it,

612
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,850
right? Yeah. High Fructose
Corn Syrup, you know,

613
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:14,510
all the different sweeteners and fillers
and Splenda and all that other stuff is

614
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:17,660
probably the number one thing
there is sugar and everything.

615
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,620
So sugar is probably one of the biggest
culprits for the obesity crisis, I think.

616
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,420
And when you go back and look
at food manufacturing and
you look at what changed,

617
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,510
there are a couple of things that
changed, you know, 30 to 40 years ago,

618
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,790
the amount of sugar and sweet nurses,
one of them,

619
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,160
the amount of additives
and salt is another.

620
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,820
The third is the use of a certain
pesticides and chemicals in our food

621
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:41,760
manufacturing. Those are probably your
three biggest changes, you know? And I,

622
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,190
you know, I go into a grocery store
and sometimes I'm like, I don't,

623
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,280
should I get organic? Should I not get
organic? Should I get this tape set?

624
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,180
What are your tips? Or what do you do
when you go food shopping? So what we do,

625
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:54,710
I mean we're majority organic,

626
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:57,740
but I know that that's hard to
sustain and it's hard to maintain,

627
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,170
but I think it's again, the dirtiest
foods, right? The dirty dozen.

628
00:34:01,171 --> 00:34:04,880
And that's on the EWG,
the environmental working group's list.

629
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:08,600
If you want to familiarize yourself,
those are worth buying organic.

630
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,160
But here's the challenge.
You know,

631
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:13,340
even even people that are eating
organic and buying organic,

632
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:17,720
there's so much cross contamination
that you're still getting exposed to

633
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,780
different chemicals, different
pesticides, different things. So again,

634
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:24,350
that's why being proactive and
being in the sort of integrative,

635
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:27,530
functional space I think is so critical
because it's hard to control your

636
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:31,880
environment even when you're being so
conscious and so careful and so deliberate

637
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:32,900
about your choices.

638
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,070
Sometimes it's very difficult just to
control the environment and our needs are

639
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:38,360
different than what they were.

640
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:42,380
We had an infectious disease problem
maybe 50 years ago, you know, we had,

641
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,970
we had different medical issues.

642
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,630
The medical issues of tomorrow are
going to be environmentally induced.

643
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,090
They're going to be toxicity issues,
you know,

644
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,280
they're going to be
diseases of inflammation.

645
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,490
Those are the diseases of today and
tomorrow. That's why cancer's on the rise.

646
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:57,260
That's why autoimmune
diseases on the rise,

647
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,420
so it's just so hard to navigate the
space that I think that the more you know

648
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:06,860
what your body chemistry is doing and
you're being as proactive as you can to

649
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:10,100
support it, you're going to have
a better, better sort of outcome.

650
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:13,610
All the way through. Yeah. Oh
absolutely. Super, super interesting.

651
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,760
I think we had a question. Yeah. Awesome.

652
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,280
Thank you so much for being here.

653
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,930
I read the book and loved it and
what I really would love to say,

654
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,760
you made it so accessible for someone
who doesn't have a medical background.

655
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,260
And I would love to hear any tips
or recommendations you have given.

656
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,460
There's just so much information out
there on health and wellness and medicine

657
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:37,160
and you even mentioned with,
you know, being a doctor,

658
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,950
having the medical background,
being disconnected from some of that.

659
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:42,300
So any recommendations you have,

660
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:46,590
just like navigating the noise and knowing
what's a credible source and where we

661
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:48,830
should spend our time. Definitely. I mean,

662
00:35:48,831 --> 00:35:51,200
I think that's probably the hardest part,
right?

663
00:35:51,201 --> 00:35:54,770
So it was trying to find the
information that you can rely on.

664
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:58,460
I think your first step is to find a
medical provider that you can have these

665
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:01,340
conversations with. Quite honestly,
you know, I think there are a lot,

666
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:05,410
there's a lot of noise in
the wellness space, you know?
So again, turning at that,

667
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,850
I'm trying to, you know,
uh, toot our own horns,

668
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:11,540
but turning to the integrative and
functional community where there's so many

669
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:15,170
great providers coming along and they
have worked really hard at getting the

670
00:36:15,171 --> 00:36:18,290
conventional training, but also
getting the training on the other side,

671
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:22,070
so to speak, and understanding
how were those worlds intersect.

672
00:36:22,071 --> 00:36:26,030
I think that's probably your most
efficient way of going about it.

673
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:29,420
Because after that, if you're
trying to navigate like, well,

674
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,550
I read this article over here
and it said to take those,

675
00:36:31,551 --> 00:36:34,130
and I did this over here and it said
to take that, it's really difficult.

676
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:37,090
It's why I wrote the Super Women
Rx, honestly, because I'm over,

677
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,890
they're not integrative and functional
medicine providers everywhere,

678
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,460
but at least that's a start, you know,
like at least if you can understand,

679
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,910
and even in the book, remember their
labs for you to check, you know, there,

680
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,420
there's all that information for
you to advocate for yourself.

681
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,250
You know when you walk
into the doctor's office.

682
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:56,660
But I still firmly believe and you know
as many different types of providers as

683
00:36:56,661 --> 00:36:58,220
there are in the health
and wellness space,

684
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,060
I still really believe that the physician
has to sit at that table and it has to

685
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:05,900
help direct those decisions because the
physician ultimately has the breadth and

686
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:10,040
depth of understanding of how one decision
will play into another and what sort

687
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,960
of all of that relationship is.

688
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:15,650
So I think finding a strong provider who
can help you navigate information will

689
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:19,550
be helpful. And then once you get the
main ideas, this is you, you understand,

690
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:22,190
you then do your digging
and your research and,

691
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,420
and anything else you want to do and read
other books to gain inflammation under

692
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:29,250
that main idea. You know, it's
almost like writing a chapter, right?

693
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:32,090
And like come out with that
main thesis about yourself.

694
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,340
And then underneath that you
can develop things out more.

695
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:38,420
Cause you may then find things at that
particular provider or doctor didn't know.

696
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:40,430
And that's okay. You know,
it's just digging deeper.

697
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,830
But the confusion comes when you know,
well,

698
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:46,160
do I need to eat for my adrenals or do I
need to eat for insulin or do I need to

699
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:48,300
like a Paleo or Vegan or gluten free?
You know,

700
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:53,150
that's where the confusion starts and
gets so frustrating to navigate. Yeah.

701
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,410
Great question. Yes. Um, this
is kind of following up to that,

702
00:37:56,411 --> 00:38:00,370
but I think you're in the unique position
of having both western and eastern

703
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,020
medical background and training.

704
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,700
What do you see as the future of sort of
scaling these eastern medical practices

705
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,960
across western medicine across the
country when so many people are,

706
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,390
it's not widely accepted as you said,
and it's kind of,

707
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,490
it might not be as easy for,

708
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,880
it might not be easy for everyone or as
accessible to find someone who's trained

709
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,140
in both eastern and medical.

710
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,870
And if someone isn't sure
where to start with their own,

711
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:25,750
like eastern medical research
and how to apply it to Western,

712
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:28,000
like what do you see as the future
of the best way to go about it?

713
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:32,180
That they're the future of the
industry for asking about that.

714
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:35,650
First of merging eastern and
Western medicine is passion.

715
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:37,870
I've really feel like it's my purpose.
Like how do we,

716
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,230
how do we get this out there? How do
we get it in the hands of more people?

717
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,590
And there are different ways to do that
and there are different ways to bring it

718
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:47,500
into medicine and change the medical
model. So there are many of us,

719
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:48,221
I'm not the only one,

720
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:51,940
but there are many of us who
want to change the medical
model and want to see it

721
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,220
like more accessible to more folks,
you know?

722
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:58,840
So I think that is a definite goal.
And something that you asked me earlier,

723
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:00,250
what gets me out of bed in the morning.
I mean,

724
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:03,820
I think that's something that sort of
motivates me for you, that it's worthless,

725
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,510
right? Because you're like a
great, great, you're going to,

726
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,000
you're going to work on this
for the next 20 years. So, um,

727
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,560
meanwhile I have to live the next 20
years. So for, so for you, you know,

728
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:16,240
I think it's again put pooling together
as many different resources from the two

729
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:21,190
systems or finding providers
like me. There are others
like me that you know, do,

730
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:24,700
do console, sometimes you don't have
to be necessarily here in the city,

731
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,940
they're remote or things like that that
help provide you at least foundational

732
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:30,880
framework for doing that.
And again, you know the book,

733
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,760
the intention of the book was to do
that for you to help you begin that

734
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:36,370
conversation. And then again
underneath that, you know,

735
00:39:36,371 --> 00:39:38,830
once you understand who you
are and what your needs are,

736
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,310
go ahead and get the opinions from a
Chinese medicine practitioner if from an

737
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:45,880
ayurvedic practitioner, from your doctor
and merge that information together.

738
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,390
But ultimately you want to find someone
to guide you through that process

739
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:53,110
because it can get very overwhelming
and confusing to get information from so

740
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:56,140
many different places. So I
think it's, you know, read,

741
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,770
read the book and see if that
helps you. I would say, you know,

742
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:03,430
try to find a practitioner that is well
versed in both to give you some guidance

743
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:07,600
and direction and then begin your journey
of exploring different aspects of your

744
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:08,770
health so that you can,

745
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,940
you can start to put some of that
information together for you. Hi,

746
00:40:11,941 --> 00:40:13,910
thank you so much for being here.
Um,

747
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,490
I had a quick question about how you
approach the conversation with older

748
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:20,220
generations.
I think with parents and grandparents,

749
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:24,720
sometimes it can be harder to have
these types of conversations and the

750
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:27,480
education background and they're not as,
um,

751
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,030
I guess open to changing
habits or lifestyle.

752
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,970
Have you had older clients or can
talk through experiences where you've

753
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:38,300
approached it with parents
or grandparents, um,

754
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,670
that have been successful or any tips
for that? Yeah, what a great gosh,

755
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:43,650
and I've experienced this
one personally for sure.

756
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,690
We do have older patients
that come to the practice,

757
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,120
but they're are typically more engaged,
right?

758
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:50,640
They've already like done a little bit
of digging and research or they're a

759
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:55,590
little bit more open now and
within our own family, you know,

760
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,940
my dad doesn't listen to anything I
say. Um, he'll say, okay sweetheart,

761
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:02,100
I'll do that.
And I'm sure he doesn't do any of it.

762
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,270
So they're tougher because they come from
the generation of the doctor was right.

763
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,140
I'm going to do what the doctor said and
Pharmas best. That's their generation,

764
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:13,760
right? So they believe in their
medicine is transactional. You know,

765
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,850
you go to the doctor, you get a script
in your hand, that visit is now complete.

766
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,970
If you did not get a script in your hand,
there was no point to the visit.

767
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,570
So that's the generation that they came
from. So it's much more challenging.

768
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:29,100
So the best way to start is two or
three things I've noticed. Like, hey,

769
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:32,520
why don't you just try doing these
two things and not give them too much

770
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:33,110
information?

771
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,560
I've actually seen the reverse where
it's like somebody our age or younger,

772
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,260
they want the information, they want
to understand how everything connects.

773
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:41,420
They want to be empowered in an advocate.

774
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,150
The older generation doesn't
want all that they don't under,

775
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:48,380
they don't care about the connection
and the big words like inflammation and

776
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,690
oxidative stress,
they're not interested in any of that.

777
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:54,890
All they want to know is almost that
same transactional language. You know,

778
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,110
your joints hurt,
tried this,

779
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,220
and then you give them two things to do
and then you follow back up maybe after

780
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:04,700
give them two weeks and see if after two
weeks they were able to put those two

781
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:08,630
things into effect. You know?
So I would think, you know,

782
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,140
transactional is the only word that
comes to my mind. But simple commands,

783
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,680
you know, this hurts, do this, that's
not working. Try this, do those.

784
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,970
I've noticed that anytime I sit with
my mother in law and my mom or my dad,

785
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,000
any of them, and they're all so
different in their personalities,

786
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,190
but essentially the conversation
always goes the same way.

787
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:29,660
Anytime I try to connect the dots,
put the pieces of their health together,

788
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,380
explain all of this, I lose
them. You know? So don't do that.

789
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,860
Just to just be very simple and be very
direct and see if they feel better.

790
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:40,580
And oftentimes we'll get results and then
that motivates them to move on to step

791
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:45,490
two or step three. I'd try
that. Come in for you grandma.

792
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:50,390
Have crowd. Yeah, go for it.

793
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,670
I have a question on,
uh, technology again. Um,

794
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,870
so there are like so many apps now to
like can track your steps or your workouts

795
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:04,640
or calories or a turndown you're the
blue light on your screen after a certain

796
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:06,610
time, right? There's all
these friends writings.

797
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,220
So I guess do you have any advice to
new people in this room who may be

798
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,900
designing apps like to use?
Um,

799
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:17,090
or for the rest of us who we use all of
these things like, um, how to navigate it,

800
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:18,560
how to design better,
you know,

801
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:22,910
how to incorporate like a holistic thing
because I think it right now it gives

802
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:26,360
like almost a false sense of
connection role. Yeah. Like, oh well,

803
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:29,030
like my phone told me to stand up today,
so like I'm great.

804
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:33,140
Like I'm dying on the fitness journey.
That's such a great question.

805
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:35,690
And I have seen that, you know,
people rely on their data. I,

806
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,670
they come in the room and they were like,
well let me show you.

807
00:43:37,671 --> 00:43:41,060
I know I'm getting rem sleep cause my
sleep tracker set up getting rem sleep.

808
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:44,930
I'm like, why is your sleep tracker in
your room? But anyway, but you know,

809
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,680
I see that all the time. It does.
It's, it's good and bad. It's not all,

810
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:51,590
it's not all either direction.
It's good because you're getting data,

811
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:52,940
you're getting information,

812
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,270
you're getting sort of an initial
look at what you're doing, you know?

813
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,540
But it's bad because it's not the whole
picture. Right. That's the bad part.

814
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,450
So I think anyone who's designing
anytime they can design,

815
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:03,860
and I challenge myself with those two,

816
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:07,790
anytime you can design to where you're
trying to bring in the whole picture in

817
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:10,310
some form or fashion,
if you're designing a sleep tracker,

818
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,950
well maybe ask a few more
questions around sleep. You know,

819
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:17,390
just because they checked off on they
got this many hours of rem sleep does not

820
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:21,200
necessarily mean that they're healthy
or that all that sleep quality was good.

821
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,820
You know?
So maybe you know,

822
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:26,090
working with somebody who has sort of
this well rounded approach who can bring

823
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:29,990
more of the whole picture into any of
these and then take p taking some of these

824
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:34,500
folks were using data and
using apps through workflows
that if this is happening,

825
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:36,420
then you may want to consider this,
this and this.

826
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,930
Not Turning into a doctor's
office necessarily, but hey,

827
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:42,510
have a conversation with your doctor.
You might want to get your labs checked,

828
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:46,050
you know, or you may need to eat, drink
more water, you know, whatever it is.

829
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:50,040
But having that more well rounded approach
where rather than just fixating on

830
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:53,670
one or two day data points is going to
help the patient on the other end of that

831
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,140
be more successful in the long run. Yeah.
So I don't know if that was helpful.

832
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,180
No, it is interesting because there
are so many dare so many right now.

833
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,050
Just because you hit your stacks
doesn't mean that you're healthy.

834
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,050
It's a great way to check in with
yourself, but it's not accomplishing like,

835
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,870
who am I? What are my
main needs? You know,

836
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:17,820
what do I need to build
under that main idea?

837
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,310
And I know you went over it in the book,
but you know,

838
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,670
if I was going to go get
a blood test tomorrow,

839
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:26,610
what would be the two
or three top you know,

840
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,390
signals that I should be looking for.
So I mean I can answer that very easily.

841
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:33,000
I think the number one thing
we're not checking for routinely,

842
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:36,780
which every doctor should be
checking every patient for
our inflammation markers.

843
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,790
They're easy to do. They're covered by
insurance, but checking like a CRP, Esr,

844
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:44,600
which is a set rate, uh,
look into homocysteine.

845
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,740
Those three things you should
be doing every six months.

846
00:45:46,741 --> 00:45:49,800
Cause to me those are the earliest
warnings that something is wrong with your

847
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:51,450
body and something's not quite right.

848
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,990
And then the investigative work can come
after that. So that's one for women,

849
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,750
I think it's so critical to
look at your hormone levels.

850
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,170
I talk about this all throughout the
book looking at estrogen, progesterone,

851
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,033
thyroid,

852
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,220
the derivatives of those hormones
because then it tells us what your body's

853
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:09,360
doing with them and you want to do them
periodically. Cause you want to track it.

854
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:10,141
Speaking of data,

855
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:12,660
you know you want to be able to track
it because it was normal for you is not

856
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:14,240
normal for me.
So you know,

857
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:18,000
you might feel really good at a Tsh of
two but I feel good at a Tsh of one.

858
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:18,331
You know,

859
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:22,170
so when five years from now you have a
baby or something happens in your Tsa

860
00:46:22,171 --> 00:46:26,100
shifts and you're quote unquote normal
by the conventional range but you feel

861
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:28,650
like crap, then we can go look
back and say, oh no, no, no,

862
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:31,590
that's not where your TSH needs to
be for you. So I think, you know,

863
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:33,750
tracking this data,
tracking these labs,

864
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:37,810
that's the beauty of technology
is tracking it over the
course of your lifespan

865
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,860
and knowing where you felt great,
where you didn't feel so good.

866
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,810
And it also helps you later when you
guys enter sort of the anti aging or kind

867
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:49,590
of the more prevention conversation
because then we know where to correct you

868
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:53,400
back too as well, you
know? Totally. I love it.

869
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,320
Well thank you so much. You are coming.
I know. We're all really excited.

870
00:46:58,321 --> 00:46:59,260
So given them

871
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:04,550
[inaudible].
