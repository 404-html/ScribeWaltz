1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,380
Thank you so much Rachel.
It's a pleasure to be with you all.

2
00:00:09,381 --> 00:00:12,560
I'm really thrilled to be here.
It's fun to be in the Google plex,

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,400
so here's the situation we have the
best technology that the world has ever

4
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:23,264
seen,

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,450
has ever had to deal with conflict
and yet family conflict abounds,

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,080
workplace conflict, community
conflict, international conflict.

7
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,700
What's what? What's the situation?
We've got principled negotiation.

8
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:45,560
We've got diplomacy, we've got
win-win technologies. What's wrong?

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,423
What's missing?

10
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm arguing today we need
new conflict technology.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,390
There are at least two types of conflicts,

12
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,390
so we're going to talk about two of them
and then we're going to focus on one.

13
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,010
There's routine conflict,
right? I'm hot, you're cold.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,820
I want the window open.
You want the window closed.

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,290
How are we going to solve this?

16
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,350
I'm calling that it's really a main
frame problem and it can be and has been

17
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,480
solved over the last many years.

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,370
Those kinds of problems are solved by
conflict resolution. It can be resolved,

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,650
right? We figure out how to have a win
win solution and we can figure that out.

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,060
Different from routine conflict is
what I'm calling difficult conflict.

21
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,900
This is the kind of conflict
that comes up again and again.

22
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:43,790
No matter how many times we try to resolve
it, it just seems to keep coming up.

23
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,910
I'm calling this more like the cloud.

24
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,890
It's more more of a cloud like problem.
It's a complex problem,

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,160
array of different factors caused these
kinds of problems and we need to master

26
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,270
these kinds of problems.

27
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:04,271
Conflict resolution is not adequate
to address these kinds of difficult,

28
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:10,820
complex, complex conflicts. So,

29
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,700
uh,
what we're going to do today,

30
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,740
I'm going to introduce to you seven
practices that you can use that you can

31
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:23,030
practice to master conflict.
We're going to rip through them,

32
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:27,200
cause I normally spend at least
three days going deep into each one,

33
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:30,470
but we're going to rip through them today
so that you have a sense of what's the

34
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:34,940
entirety of this set of seven practices.
And uh,

35
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:39,680
so for those left brainers out there
amongst us, myself included, you might,

36
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:40,700
you'll be happy.
You'll see,

37
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:44,290
we're going to walk through them in
a logical sequential order for the,

38
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,540
for the rest of us. I'm going
to tell you a story. Okay.

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,640
So for the last 20 years I've Been
Consulting, coaching senior leaders,

40
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:57,641
CEOs and their senior teams to help them
deal with very difficult conflicts like

41
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:02,500
the ones we're going to be
about today. And, um, I,

42
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:05,500
I've worked with people across
many different kinds of industries,

43
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,340
particularly focusing on high
tech professional services,

44
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,680
financial services.
That's my work.

45
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,860
And so I'm going to be
drawing on one story.

46
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,630
It's actually a composite of a couple
of different clients of mine from recent

47
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,040
years, uh, to protect the innocence. So
don't try to guess who these people are.

48
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,620
Um, and, and we're going to walk
through the seven practices using there,

49
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,200
the story as an example so
you can see how it works.

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,320
In addition to that, I want this
material to be really relevant to you.

51
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,560
So before we move on,

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,160
take a moment and I want you to think of
a difficult come conflict in your life

53
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:52,180
that you are aware of.
It could be one that you,

54
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,430
yourself are currently experiencing.

55
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,450
It could be one that you are helping
other people in your life deal with or it

56
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:04,180
could be one that you're simply
aware of from watching the news.

57
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,590
So just take a minute for those of
you watching online, take a moment,

58
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:09,424
write it down.

59
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,490
And in a minute I'm going to ask you to
turn to someone sitting next to you and

60
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:16,210
talk about it. But just take
a, take a minute and think of,

61
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,040
write down a difficult conflict that's
important to you so we can really ground

62
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,980
ourselves in. What are we talking
about here? What's important to you?

63
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,360
It could be family, workplace,
national, international community.

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,673
Okay.

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,530
So now turn to somebody
sitting next to you.

66
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:39,260
For those of you in the room and uh,

67
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,950
you can make your example generic if you
don't feel comfortable talking to them

68
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:46,610
about exactly all the details. Or you
can say pass and just listen to them,

69
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:51,611
but take a minute and tell the other
person or listen to them talk about their

70
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,700
difficult conflict that came to mind.
So just take a minute and do that.

71
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,560
All right, great. Coming back together.

72
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,690
So I want to hear a couple of examples.

73
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:18,550
Can anyone in like a sentence
sentence or two, tell me what,

74
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,600
what did you say? What is it? Difficult
conflict that's important to you. Yes.

75
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,153
What happened?

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,120
Thank you. Yes. I had meant to
say earlier actually then, right.

77
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:33,980
One very obvious example of difficult
conflict that we in this country are

78
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:38,981
facing this week as we head into the
presidential election is exactly what you

79
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:43,040
just said, right? It's
going to, yeah. We're,

80
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,580
we're in the midst of one of the most
conflictual presidential elections we've

81
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,710
ever seen. Thank you. Who else? What,

82
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,240
what's an example of a difficult conflict
might be from your own personal life

83
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:55,250
might be from work.
Ah,

84
00:05:55,251 --> 00:06:00,251
so you have inside of you have
a conflict going on about well,

85
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,530
should I raise it this way or
should I raise it that way?

86
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,860
Or maybe this third thing is something
I should say. Yes, thank you.

87
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,300
So you have actually conflict going on
inside of yourself about how to deal with

88
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:15,860
a conflict that you have going on
with somebody else. Makes Sense. Any,

89
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,880
any other brave people? One more
example just to ground us? Yes.

90
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,110
Okay, so cultural differences. I'm, I'm,

91
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,043
yeah,

92
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,010
so there are cultural differences among
people who work at Google in different

93
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,450
countries.
Is that what you're saying?

94
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,880
Tell me more what you mean Google
versus the Chinese government. Huh.

95
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,110
Okay, great. Got It.

96
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,460
There are regulations that Chinese that
the Chinese government has placed on

97
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:47,480
Google and Google has to figure out how
to deal with this. Excellent example.

98
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,390
But one of the most, right. That's a great
example of a cloud complex conflicts.

99
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,380
Thank you. Okay, so we have a sense of
what are we talking about here, right?

100
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,980
How many people have ever felt
like conflict is mastering you?

101
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,660
Anyone felt that way? Right? This
conflict is really mastering me,

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,860
not the other way around.

103
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,750
So we are going to be talking about
how can we turn that around and master

104
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,700
conflict.
So as I said,

105
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,820
we're going to be talking about
seven practices and here they are.

106
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,350
Map it out except what
is identify your values.

107
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,190
We'll talk more about what specific
values we're talking about.

108
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,600
Transform negative emotions,
invision,

109
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,580
optimal possible outcomes,

110
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,210
prevent unintended negative consequences
and take courageous pattern breaking

111
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,500
action. Okay, and the purpose, why?

112
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,630
Why are we going to do these practices?

113
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,810
The purpose is so that you can live
at your highest potential and master

114
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,380
conflict.
That's what it's about.

115
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,220
So we're going to take each of these
in turn and we're going to apply this a

116
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,900
story that I'm about to tell
you to this conflict number one,

117
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,600
practice number one,
map it out.

118
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,770
So often in difficult conflicts it
seems like we're dealing with just me,

119
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,830
us vs them, right? China versus Google.

120
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,870
But in actuality it's much
more complex than that.

121
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,200
And so paradoxically,

122
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,230
the first piece of advice about how to
deal with difficult conflict is not to do

123
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,740
anything at all.

124
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,050
It's actually to take a step
back and observe the situation,

125
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,180
observe the situation.

126
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,990
And one of the best ways that I know
how to do that is to draw a map for

127
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:51,200
yourself.
I'm going to show you in a minute.

128
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,000
Well here it is,
right?

129
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:58,001
This is one of the most complex maps that
has probably ever been drawn to show a

130
00:08:58,651 --> 00:08:59,820
conflict situation.

131
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,140
The U s military drew this map
of the situation in Afghanistan.

132
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,430
And I show you this map because it's
really an exaggerated example of what I'm

133
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,264
talking about,

134
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,680
about taking a situation that might
look like one side versus another side,

135
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:18,270
and then really seeing what, what's,

136
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,400
what's the complex situation that's
going on here? So I told you,

137
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:26,401
I'm going to tell you this story
about a CEO and a salesperson that,

138
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,120
uh,
that he works with.

139
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,480
Your organization is a high tech
startup company in New York City.

140
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,723
MMM.

141
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,880
Bob Is the CEO.

142
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,690
Sally is his top salesperson and
they've been friends for 15 years.

143
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,990
They're co founders of this firm.
They founded the firm eight years ago.

144
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,770
I'm Bob's coach.
He hired me.

145
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,630
I've been working with him
for about a year and a half.

146
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,320
And about six months before
I started working with him,

147
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,960
he and Sally had a big,

148
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,970
big blow up screaming match on
a street corner in Manhattan.

149
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,270
Why you ask?
Well,

150
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,750
it's because they were talking
about Sally's compensation package.

151
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,680
This was something that Bob had wanted to
bring up with her for a very long time.

152
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,110
Right. Just like your example.
Oh, what am I going to say?

153
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:28,380
So he was probably like you going
back and forth in his mind of,

154
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:31,410
should I say this? Should I
say that? And it took him,

155
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,190
it took him a long time to even raise
the issue with her because he knew from

156
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:38,910
past experience that anytime he did,
she got very upset.

157
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,380
And sure enough this time they went
out for lunch as they often did, um,

158
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,140
near their office,

159
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,200
casually as friends and they're walking
back from lunch to the office and um,

160
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,150
he decides to bring up the
topic and he says the words,

161
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,420
your compensation package.
And according to him,

162
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,070
she immediately starts screaming at him,
how could you bring this up? All that.

163
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,560
So what does he do?
Screams right back.

164
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,640
So there they are yelling at each other
on the street corner and at some point

165
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:20,220
he just says, you know what? Forget
it. Forget I even ever mentioned it.

166
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,340
You can keep the package
the way that it is.

167
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,240
And that was the end of the situation.
Now,

168
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:32,241
what you need to know is the reason why
he felt so strongly about bringing up

169
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:38,211
the issue is that Sally is compensation
package had not changed since the

170
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:42,840
company was founded eight years
ago and she was being compensated,

171
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,160
uh, as if she, they were
still back eight years ago.

172
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,750
But now the company has grown
tremendous amounts and according to Bob,

173
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,793
she could even,

174
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,130
she could just not even pick up the phone
and she would max out her commissions,

175
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,390
right? She would make as much money as
she possibly could for herself because the

176
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:06,390
company is doing lots of other things
to help sell, sell, sell there.

177
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,720
So their software.
So that's the situation.

178
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,590
The other thing you need to know about
Sally is that she grew up in a family

179
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,660
where her parents didn't have a
lot of money, they were quite poor.

180
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,760
And as a result,

181
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,560
she herself has always been very concerned
about her ability to support herself.

182
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,800
She's single, she's the primary
person taking care of herself.

183
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:36,430
There's no one else who can take care
of her financially except for her.

184
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,260
So she's got some worries about
her own financial standing.

185
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,360
We also have Sally's coach who's
involved here. Sally's coaches,

186
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,210
a colleague of mine who works with me
at my firm, and who else do we have?

187
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,780
Can't forget about the executive team,
including the CFO,

188
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:56,770
who also has a stake and cares a lot
about what Sally's compensation package

189
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,940
looks like. And finally,
Bob Spouse, right?

190
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,830
That she's involved here too.
So what started out looking like?

191
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,900
It's just about Bob and Sally.

192
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,750
We map it out and we see
it's more complex than that.

193
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,100
What's the ultimate purpose of
doing an exercise like this?

194
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,460
It's to see levers for change that
we might not have seen otherwise.

195
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,170
Right here we start to see,
hmm.

196
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,620
Some things going on here about
Sally's upbringing. There's,

197
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,250
there's other people involved.
The CFO might be putting pressure on Bob.

198
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,670
All right.
We're not coming up with solutions yet,

199
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,780
but we're observing what,

200
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,840
what is the next practice
is accept what is.

201
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,150
So where the first practice, again, pat,

202
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:47,260
paradoxically we're taking a step back
rather than jumping in and doing anything.

203
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:52,060
The second step is quite the
same and even even further, uh,

204
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,760
taking a step back.
So this quote says,

205
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,920
the definition of insanity is doing
the same thing over and over again and

206
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:04,510
expecting a different result.
How many of us,

207
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,650
how many of you have ever been
in a conflict where you say,

208
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,800
let's do it this way.
Let's do it this way.

209
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,680
And you just keep meeting up
against resistance, right?

210
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,640
Either they push back or
they're just shut down.

211
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,750
So you're not re, regardless of how they
react, it's one of those two things.

212
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,230
They pushed back or they're shut down.
You're not getting anywhere, right?

213
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:29,830
You could say the same thing.
How many people have had that experience?

214
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,230
I can't imagine it would. You're right.
It's, it's a pretty common experience.

215
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,360
That's what we typically do.
We want them to do it our way.

216
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,430
And so we just keep on telling them,
right?

217
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:44,431
We might say it in 17 different ways on
17 different days and we start to think

218
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,470
we're actually going insane.
You start to feel insane.

219
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,910
So there has to be a better way.

220
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,580
And what I'm suggesting is that it has
to do with accepting the situation.

221
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:00,710
Now how,
how do you do that?

222
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,870
Three things.

223
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,430
First is accept who they are.
Second,

224
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,120
except yourself and third,
except the situation.

225
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,500
So to be clear, I don't want
anyone walking out of here saying,

226
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,450
she said we should just agree with
everything that they said. No,

227
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:23,580
that's not what I'm talking about,
right?

228
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,800
I'm not saying you have to agree with
them and I'm not saying you have to like

229
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:31,170
them.
I'm just saying,

230
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,380
can you accept what is,

231
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,630
how do you do this?
You ask two questions.

232
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,870
The first question is,

233
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,120
what do I wish were true?
If I'm accepting who they are,

234
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,910
what do I wish were true about them?

235
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,020
So another part of this story
about the CEO and his salesperson,

236
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,550
Bob and Sally. Bob said to
me at some point, you know,

237
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,230
I just wish she wasn't so selfish.

238
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,950
Why does she care so much about her own
compensation to the exclusion of the

239
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,460
company? She doesn't care about the
company. She only cares about herself.

240
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,990
At that point, I looked
at Bob and I said, Bob,

241
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,890
I get that you really wish she
wasn't saying what she's saying,

242
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,050
that she wasn't worried about
her own financial wellbeing.

243
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,363
And

244
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,120
my question for you is,
can you accept

245
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,013
that

246
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,340
that's how she, that's what she's
experiencing in life right now.

247
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,940
She has fear about her own financial
wellbeing and that that may be driving a

248
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:53,600
lot of her behavior. Can
you accept that? Okay,

249
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,660
now all of a sudden we have some movement.

250
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,310
What about except yourself?
What do you,

251
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,320
what do you think Bob,

252
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,070
the CEO wished he had done differently.

253
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,670
So they're on the street
corner yelling at each other.

254
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:14,150
He brought it up as they're walking home,
walking back to the office,

255
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,070
he backs down.

256
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,030
What do you think he wishes about himself
that he had done differently in the,

257
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,700
in that situation?
Exactly. Great. Thank you.

258
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,320
He wishes he had brought it up in
a more formal place in a meeting,

259
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,820
in a meeting room in a more
formal way. Great. Yes.

260
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,780
Great.
So I heard you say two things.

261
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:43,670
One is give her some advanced warning
so that they're not just boom,

262
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,560
she's immediately expected to react.

263
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,950
Give her advanced morning by sending
her an email first saying, hey,

264
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,650
let's talk about this. Um, and,

265
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,470
and also you're saying he shouldn't,

266
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,460
he might wish that he hadn't
said it's going to change,

267
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,940
but rather let's talk about it.
So great.

268
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,240
He probably wishes that
he had done, I, in fact,

269
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:09,870
I know that he wishes he had done
all those things. Looking back.

270
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,610
So the question for him is he,

271
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:16,500
except that he didn't do those things,

272
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,330
can he accept his contributions to
the problem? Right. In the past,

273
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:24,540
his narrative has been, it's all
her fault. It's all her fault.

274
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,820
It's all their fault. It's
all China's fault. Right?

275
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,510
But can we accept the contributions that
we have made to the situation as it is

276
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,990
that he brought it up in the
middle of a street corner,

277
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,540
that he didn't give her advanced warning,

278
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,290
that he brought it up in a way that
didn't give her a chance to even have any

279
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,520
say in the matter at all.

280
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,710
Can he accept his contributions and
except the situation. What do you think,

281
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,730
thinking about yourself now for a minute,
what do you think most people,

282
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:58,731
what do you tend not to accept
about a difficult conflict?

283
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,680
What's hard about the situation itself?
What do you, what do you wish? Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,760
You just want the uncomfortable feeling
to go away. It's really uncomfortable.

285
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,140
Most people, if you ask them, what do you
wish could change about the situation?

286
00:19:14,141 --> 00:19:18,220
They just say make it go away and fast.
Right.

287
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,590
It never feels like I've
done anything wrong.

288
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,230
I wish they could just see that they're
wrong and I'm right and that would end

289
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:31,000
it. Yeah, exactly. Yes. Yes.

290
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,600
It is hard. Exactly. In fact, the things,

291
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,010
these seven practices as you're already,
I'm sure noticing this is hard work.

292
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,930
So don't let anyone tell
you that this is easy.

293
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:45,070
And that's why it's called
mastering conflict cause
it's like earning your black

294
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:48,370
belt in conflict mastery
as you do these practices.

295
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:52,060
So for sure I wish it wasn't so hard.
Why does it have to be so hard?

296
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,850
Yeah.

297
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,850
Then of course the second question
is can I accept that it is hard,

298
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,550
right? That this isn't going
anywhere, anytime soon. Um,

299
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,000
and you know,

300
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,020
you might also ask yourself what's
unlikely to change about this situation?

301
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,830
Right? It's unlikely that she's going to
go back and have a different childhood.

302
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,150
Sally. It's unlikely that
the CFO is going to stop, uh,

303
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,170
putting pressure on the CEO to
have this conversation, right?

304
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:27,210
Those things are unlikely to change.

305
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,540
So can we live with them?

306
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:35,541
Can we learn how to master conflict and
live with what is rather than just keep

307
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:39,060
wishing that it somehow,
which is work itself out and go away.

308
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,870
Cause unless we master it, it's
not likely to. Third practice,

309
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,210
identify your values.

310
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:50,211
And we have three different kinds values
here to identify in most difficult,

311
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,820
in most in all difficult conflicts.

312
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,730
There's something running the show,

313
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:01,000
running the conflict that
I'm calling taboo values.

314
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,480
These are the things
that we all care about,

315
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,560
but we would never admit
that we care about them,

316
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,010
sometimes not even to our own selves.

317
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,580
We are so ashamed,

318
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,610
embarrassed about caring about these
things that we won't even let ourselves go

319
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:25,990
there. We'll push them down. We push them
away into some shadow side of ourselves,

320
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:27,190
right?
We don't want to look at that.

321
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,330
And that prevents the conflict
from having any movement,

322
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,760
any opportunity for movement
out of the stuck place.

323
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:42,270
Because until and unless we can take
those shadow taboo values and look at them

324
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,430
and talk about them with the other side,
with other people,

325
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,600
they're going to be running the show.
So ideal values are quite the opposite.

326
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,390
If you ask someone,
what do you really care about?

327
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:59,980
What drives your behavior in your life?
Those are their ideal values.

328
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,290
That's what they say is important to them.

329
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,300
So if we think about the
CEO, Bob, in this situation,

330
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:12,670
what would buy? You don't know him. Well,
I know him well. Um, but what do you,

331
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:17,110
what do you think Bob would say are
his ideal values? Thinking about the,

332
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,760
the company has created, it's
this high tech start up, um,

333
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,550
what would he say are important
to him? Just take a guess. I mean,

334
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,410
you don't know him. Company interests
before your own interests. Great. Yep.

335
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,270
Absolutely. Like collaborative.
Great. Yes, absolutely.

336
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,970
He cares about people.
He cares about employees in his company.

337
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,750
He's a caring person. So a value of his
might be care. Yup. Great. So what, what,

338
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:45,640
what's the value behind that? You
said people that, that they want the,

339
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,080
the products and services to
do well in the company. What,

340
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,970
what would you call that?
Maybe achievement.

341
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,210
Yeah.

342
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,340
Great.
Affinity for products,

343
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,930
great ambition for myself
and for the company. Yeah. So

344
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,010
you, you all hit it on the head, right?

345
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:12,730
These are the things that I knew about
him from having worked with him is that

346
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:16,150
he said, look, I'm a generous
person. I take care of my employees.

347
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,030
I'm an authentic person.
People know that.

348
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:24,031
What I say is how you know how I behave
in they're one in the same and I'm a

349
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:27,190
collaborative person, right? I
like people to work together.

350
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,760
That's what he said about himself.
That's what he believed to be true.

351
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,680
What about his current values?
How does he actually live his life?

352
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,560
So sometimes for some people,
if we're lucky,

353
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,480
our ideal values and our current values
are one and the same because we're

354
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:47,450
living in a way where our behavior
is aligned with our matches.

355
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:52,490
What we say is actually important to
us. For others, probably more of us.

356
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,680
Um, our ideal values might overlap a
little bit with our current values,

357
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:01,260
but we've got other things that are
really driving our behavior and for,

358
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,020
for some of us are ideal
values or one set of things.

359
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:09,290
And the way we live our life is a whole
other set of things. Right. So what, what,

360
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,790
what do you think might be his current
values? What's driving his behavior? Yeah.

361
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,990
Yeah.

362
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,910
So scarcity and compensation
might be running the show here.

363
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,040
So, well, let's see. So
I've got here authenticity.

364
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,620
He is authentic, right?
He says what he means.

365
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,170
And also that he's an adventurous person
too. So he's a risk taker, right in life.

366
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,150
Somebody you know taught him that risk
taking and having adventures is a good

367
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:42,740
thing. And he started a from eight
years ago and he's an adventurous guy.

368
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,440
What about his taboo values?

369
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,710
And I think this is really more like
what you were just saying, right? So

370
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,870
this is a person who really
wants power in his life,

371
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,160
wants authority in his life,

372
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:03,161
wants the financial stability that you
were just talking about yet pushes those

373
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:08,390
things down. Because at some point along
the way in his life, somebody told him,

374
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,930
it's okay to be generous.
It's okay to be collaborative.

375
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,390
It's okay to be authentic.
But boy,

376
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,310
if you ever dare tell somebody that
you want power or you want authority,

377
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,670
you want financial stability.
No, you've got to be adventurous.

378
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:26,060
You've got to be a risk taker.
That's his profile of his value.

379
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,820
That's what he learned
along the way in his life.

380
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,760
And so for him to come out and say,
I care about power,

381
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,670
authority and financial stability
for myself, you can't go there.

382
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,500
And as we said before,
if he can't go there for himself,

383
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,600
if he can't admit those things to himself,

384
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,040
they're completely undiscussable
with Sally as well.

385
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,080
So he needs to admit that these things
are important to him so that he can

386
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:59,081
discuss them with Sally and then
they have some place to move,

387
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,790
right? It might be that
he and Sally go, Hey,

388
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,540
actually we both care about financial
stability and that's something we actually

389
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,230
have in common.

390
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,640
Then you start to move more towards a
more classic collaborative or win win

391
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,930
negotiation, uh,
Opportunity. Next practice.

392
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,540
We're going to talk about emotions.

393
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,700
Negative emotions are core
to every difficult conflict.

394
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,593
It's basically,

395
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,770
it's impossible to have a difficult
conflict without having negative emotions

396
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:28,640
that come along with it.

397
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,210
I'm suggesting here that there are four
ways that we as humans typically respond

398
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,500
emotionally in difficult conflicts.

399
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,000
The more American culturally,
um,

400
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,080
assumed way is exploded. Others, right?

401
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:51,081
We get angry and we aggress either
physically or verbally or both.

402
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,970
We aggress it.
Others.

403
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,430
That's how we typically think
about it in this country at least.

404
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,710
But there's these three other ways as
well, right? We, we shut down with others,

405
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,610
right? Push, push, push, boom.
I'm not talking about my feelings,

406
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,330
I'm avoiding the situation and
we'll just see what happens.

407
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:11,280
But I'm going to avoid this at all costs.

408
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,320
Something else that we don't typically
talk about is that many of us actually

409
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:19,740
attack ourselves.
So while some of us attack the other,

410
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,060
some of us go inside and
feel so much shame and guilt.

411
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,830
We ruminate on that.

412
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,190
And somehow we think that that ruminating
is going to make those feelings get

413
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,180
better or go away. We're going to
figure them out finally. Right?

414
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,870
But what the research
tells us about ruminating,

415
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,940
especially about negative emotions,

416
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,490
is that it doesn't make those
negative emotions go away.

417
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:48,360
You don't ever figure them out. It
just makes them worse, not better.

418
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,900
And finally,
for some of us were,

419
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:56,080
so we've been taught
culture impacts. This, uh,

420
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,210
were so shut down.
We're even shut down to ourselves.

421
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,580
So we might be confused
and might be feeling hurt,

422
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,440
but we don't have the names for that.

423
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:07,530
And so we ourselves are
just emotionally shut down.

424
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,770
So what do we do about this?

425
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,410
If these are our typical
ways of responding?

426
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:20,120
Clearly none of them particularly helpful
in difficult conflicts. What do we do?

427
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,890
We transform them.
Can anyone tell me,

428
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:27,440
what do you see up on the
screen? What's this? A picture of

429
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,700
transformer. And can you tell
it's not such a great picture.

430
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:37,140
Can you tell what is the
transformer doing? Meditating. Yes,

431
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:43,050
we have a transformer meditating.
I understand that at Google. Uh,

432
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,990
many of us around here,
you know, meditate.

433
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,000
So I thought this would be an appropriate
picture to show you. Um, so you know,

434
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,910
transformers, how many of you
played with transformers as a kid?

435
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,140
Maybe you might still,
I know it's fun, right?

436
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,620
So transformers were these dolls or action
figures really that you would press a

437
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:06,500
button or do something you throw.

438
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,840
My son has one and you throw it on the
floor and it like turns into something

439
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:11,580
else.
It transforms into something else.

440
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:15,810
So why am I showing you a picture
of transforming meditator?

441
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,530
It's because the Buddhist brought a
2000 year old technology to help us

442
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:25,470
transform our emotions.

443
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Now there are a ton of people out there
in the conflict space who will tell you

444
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,780
rather than transform your emotions,

445
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:41,781
what you want to do is you want to
try to make it so that people don't

446
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:46,420
experience negative emotions around you.
So give them what you know,

447
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,170
do things to help make it better.
And then people won't be angry at you.

448
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,430
But what I really want to
suggest is that that's,

449
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,070
that's like asking you
to tame a wild beast.

450
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,450
Complex conflicts are naturally
going to bring up negative emotions.

451
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,930
So I'm not going to ask you to tamp them
down or make them go away or try to do

452
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:10,540
something so that other people you
can, you know, you can do that.

453
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:15,070
You can try to make it so that other
people don't get angry or don't aggress

454
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:19,660
against you. But still these
negative emotions are going to arise.

455
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,790
So what do you do?

456
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,230
You sit and you let the emotions settle.

457
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,420
And in doing that,

458
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,380
usually what happens is those emotions
have the opportunity to transform into

459
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:36,580
something more constructive,

460
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,880
to not hum the Vietnamese Buddhist monk,
he talks about,

461
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,840
uh, a glass of water. So if
you're in the desert and you are,

462
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,130
you need to drink and you have this
one last glass of water and it's muddy,

463
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:55,540
it's full of mud. What do you do? You take
the glass of water or you set it aside,

464
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,110
you let the mud settle to the bottom,

465
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,840
and then on the top you have
the clear water to drink.

466
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,440
And that's another metaphor.
Another

467
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,830
idea.
Now,

468
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,590
what happens if you're not able
to transform these emotions?

469
00:31:13,591 --> 00:31:16,890
You try to let them settle and they don't.
They're still,

470
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,780
these negative emotions are still present.

471
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:20,940
Okay?

472
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,070
One thing to do is to ask yourself,

473
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,950
what are my emotions trying to tell me?

474
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,920
Very often our emotions are
trying to send us messages.

475
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,990
It might be danger or
it might be opportunity.

476
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:42,300
And if we're shut off to our emotions and
we're not aware even of what they are,

477
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,160
it's not possible for us to hear the
wisdom in them. So I encourage you,

478
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,383
sit,

479
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,540
let them settle and then listen to what
they might be trying to tell you to do

480
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,420
or not do or say or not say.

481
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,510
That's my quick quick
advice about emotions.

482
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,640
Next practice.

483
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,720
Envision possible optimal outcomes.

484
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,750
What do I mean by this?

485
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,240
So often in difficult conflicts we are
looking at what happened in the past,

486
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,020
right? Who said it? We're blaming, it's
not my fault, it's all their fault.

487
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,530
We're so focused on whose
fault it is and blaming,

488
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,810
looking at what has gone wrong.

489
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,680
We're not at all aware of think that
how important it is to think about the

490
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:36,150
future and what we do want.

491
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:41,570
So this practice is aimed at helping
us look forward to the future.

492
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,650
And there are a few recommendations
that I have for best practice.

493
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:53,540
Ways to do this.
One is to use all five of your senses.

494
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,080
So we typically rely on seeing and hearing

495
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,280
what about smelling, tasting, touch,

496
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,620
and also our emotions actually.

497
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,040
So there's research that suggests that
if you use all these five senses plus

498
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:15,760
your feelings to visualize
what you want in the future,

499
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,030
or visualize your performance,
digitalize your app outcomes,

500
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,160
there's actually sports research on this.

501
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:26,670
People who visualize it were as likely
to achieve the outcomes they were seeking

502
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,450
as people who actually did
the practice of that sport.

503
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,060
So visualization works.

504
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,380
Okay.

505
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,020
Many of us come from fractured families.

506
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,110
Thanksgiving is around the corner,
right?

507
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,240
So what I encourage you to do is think
about a Thanksgiving meal that you might

508
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:49,240
be about to have and envision.

509
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:54,250
What could this be like without all that
conflict that normally comes along with

510
00:33:54,251 --> 00:33:55,084
that dinner?

511
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:00,040
What could it be like to be
joyful and have love in the room?

512
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,910
What would it look like? What would it
sound like? What would it taste like?

513
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,080
Can you taste the Turkey?

514
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,220
Can you smell the food
wafting through the kitchen?

515
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:14,850
Can you imagine what it would be like
to hug and be with your friends or your

516
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:18,430
family?
If you can imagine it,

517
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,270
you bet you have a much better
chance of making that happen.

518
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:26,470
Can you feel those feelings much better
chance of making that happen then if you

519
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:27,850
don't envision it at all.

520
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,340
Next practice prevent unintended
negative consequences.

521
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,893
So again,

522
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,820
because we're often so focused on what
went wrong in the past and we are so

523
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:45,450
inaction mode, just trying to fix it,
right? People have talked about, well,

524
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:46,830
should I do this or should I do that?

525
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:51,810
And so we're just like all over the
place often trying to make things work.

526
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:57,780
And what happens is we're not thinking
ahead about the possible consequences of

527
00:34:57,781 --> 00:34:58,800
our own actions.

528
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:03,030
We're not thinking about how we might
be contributing to the situation.

529
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,920
So has anyone heard of Suzy Welch?
And you want to know who? Susie,

530
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:11,220
who's Suzy Welch? Anyone know? All right.

531
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:16,221
So she is the spouse of Jack Welch who
was the former CEO of General Electric.

532
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:23,400
She is the former uh,
Harvard business review editor in chief.

533
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,030
She interviewed him for an article
she was writing. That's how they met.

534
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,550
And she also happens to have written a
book a few years ago called 10, 10, 10,

535
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:38,100
10 minutes, 10 months,
10 years, a life idea.

536
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,420
And the idea in her book
is very quite simple.

537
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,440
It's when you have an important
decision to make in life,

538
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,570
it can be really helpful to think about
the impact of that decision on yourself.

539
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,630
Not just today,
10 minutes from now,

540
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,710
but also 10 months from now and 10
years from now. Really fantastic idea.

541
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,700
The idea here in this practice is building
on that and it's not just a stretch

542
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,870
the time horizon,

543
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,900
but also stretch out who are you thinking
about your impact of your behavior on.

544
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,900
So typically we think about on yourself
now we think about what am I about to

545
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:24,030
do? How is my behavior that I'm
about to take going to impact me now?

546
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,660
So I'm saying think about it,

547
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,070
how is it going to impact you midterm
and how's it gonna impact you long term,

548
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,580
but also ask yourself how's it going to
impact the other side now midterm and

549
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,073
longterm,

550
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,700
and don't stop there because there's
some other very important people as we

551
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:49,701
discovered doing the map exercise who
are impacted by your behavior as well,

552
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,850
which is everyone else involved
in that conflict, right?

553
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,390
Others now mid term and long term.
So if we back up,

554
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,440
let's go back in time and think about Bob.

555
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,510
If he thinks about the impact of his
raising the idea on the street corner on

556
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:13,530
him now he's like, wow, that's so
great. I got it off my chest right.

557
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,000
Him mid term. All right, cool.

558
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,900
So now we've talked about it and probably,
you know,

559
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:23,860
we're going to change her compensation
package and longterm the company's

560
00:37:23,861 --> 00:37:26,260
financial wellbeing will be,
we'll be good.

561
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,160
But what about on Sally now,

562
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,800
what do you think if he
took the time to think,

563
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,940
I'm going to bring this up on a
street corner. You said it before.

564
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,720
What's the impact on Sally of doing that?

565
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,063
Okay.

566
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,210
Right. She's fearful, she's
angry. She gets caught off guard.

567
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,800
And what's the impact on Sally
over the medium term or, Yup,

568
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,660
absolutely.
Right now she's completely shut down.

569
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,810
Conversation finished longterm.

570
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,563
Yeah,

571
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,630
absolutely. Trust is damaged, their
relationship is damaged for sure.

572
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,980
That is exactly what happened.
What about others?

573
00:38:17,981 --> 00:38:22,390
So thinking about the whole company,
the executive team, the CFO,

574
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:27,630
uh, each of their families,
what about others?

575
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,700
What's the impact on,
on the company of his behavior?

576
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,600
He brings it up on the street corner now.
So for the company,

577
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:42,130
so it's negative all around. And for
the CFO, for the rest of the company,

578
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,020
also negative,
right?

579
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,070
Because now the CFO has been pressuring
the CEO to have this conversation and

580
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:50,680
now the whole thing got shut down,
right?

581
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,960
Midterm also shut down.
Company's losing money.

582
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,550
Sally's making,

583
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,620
making a ton of money and companies was
losing money and longterm, same thing.

584
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,890
So it can be really helpful. You want
to think about yourself as, you know,

585
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,750
like a chest master when you're playing.
How many people play chess out there?

586
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,380
Yeah. So when you play chess, right?

587
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:17,350
One of the things that you have to do
is you've gotta be thinking a few steps

588
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:20,980
ahead. And that's the same idea
here is be training yourself.

589
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:23,770
And this is a practice. It's
not easy for sure. Not Easy.

590
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,510
It is a practice to train yourself.
Uh, just like a chess master does.

591
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,490
To think a few steps ahead about what's
going to be the implications of my

592
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:37,270
actions today on all these other folks.

593
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,703
Over the long term.

594
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,523
That's the idea

595
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,000
and the reason to do this obviously,
right?

596
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:50,001
The purpose is it'll prevent you from
doing things that are going to cause

597
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:55,020
problems for you. That might even, it's
going to prevent disasters basically,

598
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,120
and it's going to set you up for success.

599
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:59,940
It's going to help you maximize the
outcomes that you're looking to achieve.

600
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,850
Final practice,

601
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,450
take courageous pattern breaking action.

602
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,690
What do I mean by pattern breaking action

603
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,120
and I'll, I'll ask that as a
real question. What do you think?

604
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,020
I mean pattern breaking. What does
that mean? You got it. You got it.

605
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:22,890
Something you typically won't do
as part of your normal routine.

606
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,820
You're breaking the pattern in your
behavior and how do you know that you're

607
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:33,750
breaking a pattern in your behavior
of how you typically do things?

608
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,380
It feels really uncomfortable.

609
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,620
It basically sucks,
right?

610
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:46,080
You feel like what is going on here?
This is so weird,

611
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,230
so strange.
I don't understand what's happening.

612
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:53,730
That's how you know you're doing
courageous pattern breaking action,

613
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,140
so it's going to feel weird.

614
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,270
Okay.

615
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:02,270
Unlike a few at many of the previous
practices that we just went through,

616
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,410
particularly the first one, second
one, right? Except what is observe,

617
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:10,140
what is this? Uh, the sixth one,

618
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:15,141
which was just think ahead about your
actions and what be like a chess master

619
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:15,990
and think ahead.

620
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,310
This final practice is all about action.

621
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:25,860
So it's great. You have to think
ahead and if you're only analyzing,

622
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,950
if you're only thinking ahead, right.
That's what when we started out you said,

623
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,920
well, I'm in my own head and I'm thinking
should I do this or should I do that?

624
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:36,921
If you end guaranteed failure
because you haven't done anything,

625
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,800
most,
well not guaranteed,

626
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:43,580
but most likely sometime every
once in a while avoiding, you know,

627
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:47,210
helps but not in difficult situation,
not in difficult conflicts.

628
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:50,450
Avoiding doesn't usually help.
It usually only makes things worse.

629
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,230
So a couple of pieces of advice about
how to take courageous pattern breaking

630
00:41:56,781 --> 00:42:01,640
action. First one is, um,

631
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,780
mini experiments.
What do I mean by that?

632
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,430
So a different CEO who I was
consulting to a couple of years ago,

633
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,660
he got feedback. I wish it was
my job to give him the feedback.

634
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:17,690
I collected feedback
from his direct reports,

635
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:22,580
people who reported to him and I
delivered this report to him and the main

636
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,060
message of the report was,
you don't listen to your people.

637
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,560
They don't feel heard.
And he said,

638
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,880
uncharacteristically for him. He
said, you know what? You're right.

639
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,870
I don't.
And then he said,

640
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,970
I never have listened to anyone.
That's how I got where I am today.

641
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:45,823
Yeah,

642
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,650
on the playground.
As a kid,

643
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,660
I used to tell everyone else what to
do and they listened to me and that's,

644
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:57,670
that's how I've always been. So in that
moment, I said to him, first of all,

645
00:42:57,671 --> 00:43:01,690
Kudos to you for
acknowledging your behavior.

646
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,630
And then it got you to
where you are today.

647
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,130
These people are ready to
quit on you. So you, you're,

648
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:10,090
you're thinking about how
can I do this differently?

649
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,140
My advice to him was do many experiments.

650
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,810
Don't expect that all of a sudden
you're going to just start listening to

651
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:20,890
everybody. Go home, be with
your partner or your spouse,

652
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,900
with your kids and listen to them
once a day. Only once, once a day.

653
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:30,280
Make it your practice to listen to them.
You might tell them what you think.

654
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:33,280
You've just heard them say,
you might check that you heard them right.

655
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,300
Do whatever you need to do to make sure
that you listen to those people and then

656
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:39,580
come back and tell me, I'm your
coach. Tell me how it went.

657
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,360
That's an example of start
small once a day and start safe.

658
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,440
Do it at home, test it out, see
how it goes. Mini experiments.

659
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:56,200
Second idea
comes to us from Nike.

660
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,130
Just do it right.
Don't hesitate.

661
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:04,210
You gotta just at some point, right?
At some point you got to just do it.

662
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,760
Has anyone ever done an aids ride
or a three day breast cancer walk?

663
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:13,480
Anybody here? No. I should do
it. It's really great experience.

664
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,120
Maybe kind of almost almost did it.

665
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,520
So a man named Dan Pallotta was the
original founder of the aids rides and the

666
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:22,271
breast cancer.

667
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:27,040
The three day breast cancer walks with
Avon and I did one of the breast cancer

668
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:30,460
walks, uh, many years ago and
he, Dan Pallotta was there.

669
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,180
He gave a speech at
the closing ceremonies,

670
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,900
and in that speech he said that he had a
friend named Alan and Alan was the kind

671
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:42,510
of person who didn't hesitate when
the right thing needed to be done.

672
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,250
He just did it.

673
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,700
So Alan used to drive around in his car
with blankets and food in the back seat.

674
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:53,340
And when he saw somebody on
the street who needed help,

675
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,350
he gave them what they needed.

676
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:01,170
That's what I'm asking of you today is
that at a certain point you got to just

677
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:02,004
do it.

678
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,690
So I want to leave you with an
invitation and with a promise.

679
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,910
The invitation is to actually
put these practices into play.

680
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,770
Practice them in your real life.
It's not going to be easy.

681
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,390
I can guarantee you that it's gonna make
you go deep. You're going to go deep.

682
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:22,340
You're gonna.

683
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,340
I'm asking you to look at things that
you have not wanted to look at about

684
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:30,150
yourself in your life about others.

685
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,033
And yet

686
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,020
the promise that I can make you
is that as you do those things,

687
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:39,300
as you practice those practices,

688
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,940
you will come to experience what
it's like to be a conflict master.

689
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,590
You'll walk into your office and
you'll be thrilled to be there,

690
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,580
to be with the people at work and at
home who bring you love and enjoy.

691
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,990
And what's even better

692
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:04,940
is that it's contagious.
So as you master conflict,

693
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,800
you lead the way for others as well.

694
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:12,210
You allow them to master
conflict in their own lives too.

695
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,440
And in that way you build masterful teams,

696
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,510
masterful organizations,
communities, masterful families.

697
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,500
Okay.

698
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,520
It's all right there

699
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,593
for you.

700
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,650
So stay in conversation
with each other with me.

701
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:34,150
Please let me know how your mini
experiments go. I want to hear about it.

702
00:46:34,151 --> 00:46:37,600
Stay in conversation,
stay in practice.

703
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,670
I've a more specific invitation for you.

704
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:44,190
I'm actually teaching in a couple
of weekends but it's sold out.

705
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:49,670
But the next one is March 4th through
sixth 2017 the weekend workshop where we

706
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:53,820
go much deeper into each of these seven
practices is at Columbia University.

707
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:55,950
So that's my invitation to you as well.

708
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,820
Feel free to come and let me know or
email me for those of you watching online.

709
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,230
Happy to get you connected and registered.

710
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,420
Thank you so much. It's been a total
pleasure being with your mom today.

711
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:11,400
I had a question around timeframes,

712
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:16,430
so that's a lot of steps and
then I liked the process,

713
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:18,350
but what would you say is,
is like a,

714
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:23,810
so in that situation with Bob was like
what time frame does that really all take?

715
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:26,100
Cause it sounds like a lot.
Yeah,

716
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,780
so he's on a street corner and he's the
middle of yelling back and you're saying

717
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,810
what does he do then? Right? Yeah.

718
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:39,430
So typically as, as I said, emotions,

719
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,330
negative emotions are involved in
almost every difficult conflict.

720
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:49,000
So often it's actually a matter of us
being aware of what's happening in our

721
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:49,630
body.

722
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,410
How many of you would say you're on a
regular basis aware of what's happening in

723
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:58,030
your body? All right, cool, great.
Are you guys from the meditation,

724
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,610
the Mindfulness Group? That's
awesome. Right? Usually.

725
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:08,080
So maybe about 10% of the room.
It's a, it's, it's difficult work.

726
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,020
Um,
so

727
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,560
in order to get in touch with what's going
on, you have to first be in practice,

728
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:22,420
being aware of sitting, feeling,
what am I feeling? What's going on,

729
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,283
what am I feeling?

730
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:27,670
Typically emotions are linked to
bodily sensations that we have.

731
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,070
So if I know that when I get angry,

732
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:35,560
my face starts to turn hot and red and
my heart starts to beat faster and my

733
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,920
pulse, you know, and my hands
get all tingly or something.

734
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,200
That is my cue to take
a couple deep breaths,

735
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,230
calm it down,
try that.

736
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:52,231
Either not yell back in the first place
or stop yelling in the midst of it.

737
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:58,360
Um, and it's, I would say when
you're stuck in the moment,

738
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,210
the emotions is the place to go,
to really calm yourself down.

739
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:04,690
And you can say to someone, look, I'm
not proud of what is happening here.

740
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,240
And I'd like us to take a break.
Can we take a break?

741
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,350
Cool it off and come
back in an hour tomorrow,

742
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,570
you know,
next week,

743
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,530
let's think this through and really come
back and have a better conversation.

744
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,190
So that's just, you know, a
quick answer to your question,

745
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,320
but for sure these practices are,

746
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:26,620
and the reason why we call them
practices is because they're meant to be

747
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:31,270
practiced over time to help prevent you
from getting in difficult conflicts in

748
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:34,330
the first place. Um, but you know,

749
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,070
or use them after you just
had a big blowout with
someone or something or you're

750
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,130
ruminating about something,
use them as a way to ask yourself,

751
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:44,650
how could I get back on track here?
How can I get back on track?

752
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:49,000
But you do need the time to sit quietly.
So taking a break is,

753
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,340
is a good idea when you're in the midst.

754
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,290
So the question is how do you
identify your taboo values?

755
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,550
And once you've identified them,
what do you do with that? Well,

756
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:02,290
first of all, for some of you, we,

757
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:07,291
we made some printed copies of a
sheet that walks you through the seven

758
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:12,070
practices. And on that sheet
there's a list of values.

759
00:50:12,071 --> 00:50:13,180
So it's a little cheat sheet.

760
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:18,670
And I recommend using either this list
that I provided for you or some lists of

761
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:19,091
values.

762
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:22,660
I'm sure if you go online you can find
a list of what our typical values and

763
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:26,890
look through them. And um,
the advice is make your,

764
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:31,070
of what are the taboo values in my
life, generally speaking, right?

765
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:34,820
We all have them. So you want to ask
yourself what are things like for example,

766
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:39,320
power and authority were
true for this CEO. Um,

767
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:44,000
for some people it has to do with
affluence. Money is a big one. Um,

768
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,130
independence,

769
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,053
uh,

770
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,550
the, we all have different,
different taboo values and in fact,

771
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:53,930
I've done this exercise with many,

772
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:58,931
many groups where we notice that some
people's taboo values show up on other

773
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:02,750
people's ideal values and vice
versa depending on how you grew up,

774
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:06,980
what messages you got sent. So
it's, it's deep introspective work.

775
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,040
You might work with a friend
or a colleague or a coach
to help you identify what

776
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:15,370
might be some of these
taboo values for me. Uh,

777
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,060
and then the second part
of your question was,

778
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:21,890
and what do I do with them once I
know what they are? Really two things.

779
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,490
The first is admit to yourself
that this is true for you.

780
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,820
And you that,
that you may not be proud of it.

781
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,220
And then the second piece is,

782
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:37,330
can you find a way to make
this discussable with the
other person? So, you know,

783
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:38,300
you might say to them,
look,

784
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:43,040
I just realized for the first time in
my life that it's very hard for me to

785
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:47,930
admit I,
I actually do need autonomy in my life,

786
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,900
or I do need to be,

787
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:55,580
to feel powerful or to feel respected.
Those are important to me.

788
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:58,820
I've always thought that those are not
things I should want. But now I get that.

789
00:51:58,821 --> 00:51:59,654
I want them.

790
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:04,810
And I'm telling you this because I want
to fess up to my part in this conflict.

791
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:09,950
My part is that I wasn't clear
with myself and so I couldn't,

792
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,500
there was no way I could have been clear
with you that those were things that

793
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:16,130
were important to me and they've been
driving my behavior in this conflict and

794
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:16,964
I'm not proud of it.

795
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,610
Um,
and then

796
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:24,460
see what, see how they respond
to that. My, my hunch, what
I've seen to be true for,

797
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:29,350
for so many of my clients is that people
respond really well to that kind of

798
00:52:29,351 --> 00:52:33,700
conversation cause they see how authentic
and how honest you're being with them

799
00:52:33,701 --> 00:52:37,030
and that you're taking responsibility,
right? Like we're going from the place of,

800
00:52:37,031 --> 00:52:39,940
it's all your fault.
I have nothing to do with it too.

801
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,120
Wow. You know, I really,

802
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,680
I really get how much I've
contributed here. Is that helpful?

803
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:51,100
One last question. Yeah. Um,

804
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:55,270
if you go back to the previous slide
to ask you about the, you know, the,

805
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:58,560
the research that had gone through to,
you know,

806
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,740
create these seven steps because, um, I'm,

807
00:53:01,741 --> 00:53:05,790
I'm wondering like is this
the most parsimonious a set?

808
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:10,020
Because if I were thinking to myself
what the procedures I would take, yeah,

809
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:12,930
I would want to, you know,
understand myself, understand others,

810
00:53:12,931 --> 00:53:17,100
I would want to maybe calm my own
emotions and then bro, you know,

811
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,900
breach the topic in a tactical manner.

812
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,010
The other person in, in different,
different ways. Are these other steps,

813
00:53:23,011 --> 00:53:26,490
like envisioning the optimal outcome or

814
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:31,230
mapping out some taboo values?
Is that even necessary as steps?

815
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,700
Hmm, that's a great
question. So first of all,

816
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:39,350
let me say thank you for your challenge.
I love parsimony.

817
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,760
I think it's a great
challenge. Um, second of all,

818
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,080
I hope I didn't, it's possible
that I did say the word steps,

819
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:51,590
but I'm calling these practices
because they're not a,

820
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:53,600
I presented them in a sequential order,

821
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,320
but they're not meant to be that you
must go through each one of these seven

822
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,483
steps.

823
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,020
They're not steps at all actually there
practices that you can cultivate in

824
00:54:03,021 --> 00:54:05,840
order to become a master
of difficult conflicts.

825
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,800
And so for some conflicts it may be
that what you just said, you know,

826
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:13,160
there are three pieces here that are
really helpful for you and go for it.

827
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,530
If that's true for you,
um,

828
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,380
for other conflicts or for other people,

829
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,870
other practices might be
more helpful to them. Uh,

830
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:27,410
and I, you know, I take your challenge,
I'm in the midst of writing the book,

831
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:32,180
so it's not done yet. Um, but I'll,
I'll say one more thing that it might,

832
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,640
might be helpful for you in,
in answering the question,

833
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:37,460
which is these seven practices are,

834
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:42,461
what I have seen is missing from
the existing conflict literature,

835
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:47,570
scholarly literature and
practical literature,

836
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,050
literature and practice. So, um,

837
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:56,240
some of the bestselling books of the
last four decades did an amazing job of

838
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:58,550
helping people deal with
these routine conflicts.

839
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:01,730
And yet they never talked about,
you know,

840
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,670
envision what it could be like.

841
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,330
They talk about create options
that will work for both parties,

842
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:12,650
but I think this takes that
idea in a different direction.

843
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,100
This takes that idea,
like another step further and say,

844
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,130
really get yourself to
imagine what it could be like.

845
00:55:19,131 --> 00:55:21,350
So it may be that you already
do that and you don't,

846
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:22,850
I'm that practices and speak to you,
but

847
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,080
[inaudible].
