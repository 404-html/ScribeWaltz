Now, I would love to welcome to
the stage both Alfredo and Anita.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,330
Please join me in welcoming

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,080

bit about yourselves. Um,

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,550
and [inaudible] let's start with you.
Well, thank you for having us today.

5
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:27,310
My name is [inaudible] bias and I am
the program director of our advocacy and

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,180
mediation program at Robert F.
Kennedy Human Rights.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,230
My name is Alfredo [inaudible]. I'm the
executive director of [inaudible] Salon.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,580
Would you saw ng or human rights NGO
that works in Venezuela and we assist,

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,770
uh, pro bono, the big themes
of repression in Minnesota.

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,560
Great. Thank you. Um, I forgot
about through your work, um,

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,820
through your Human Rights
Organization for opener,

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,610
you've helped over
10,000 people. Um, I had,

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,420
I had outdated data. I, I thought
it was 40,000. It's actually 10,000,

14
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:03,270
which is incredible.
So you've helped over 10,000 people.

15
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,590
Can you tell us a little bit about your
work as it pertains to the restrictions

16
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:08,910
on freedom of expression?

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,381
Well,
yes.

18
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:15,240
We have assisted more than 10,000 people
because we've been working since 2002

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,910
actually, uh, we started,
um, oh, I started myself, uh,

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,780
assist in the family of one guy.
His name is Jesus,

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,950
actually was Jesus an 18 years old,
a boy who was killed.

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,650
He was shot in his head.
So at that time,

23
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:36,460
I thought there was going to be, you
know, my only case, I thought, okay,

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,470
I'm not going to cease this guy because
I'm, the family actually came to me.

25
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:44,960
I can tell you the whole story is
longer than that. But then after that,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,380
a second family came to me and the
third one on the fourth one or whatever,

27
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:54,100
and I actually thought it was going to
end, uh, into southern too because, uh,

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,440
I,
I mean,

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,270
I wasn't used to assist the big
themes of a state repression.

30
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:03,490
This guy was actually
killed in a mass process.

31
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,500
Protests that happened in 2002.
Um,

32
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,480
well actually, repression
increased a lot. And,

33
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,970
um, so, uh,

34
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,010
this moment we have assisted more than
10,000 people or where I'm talking about

35
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,450
a big themes of a [inaudible]
including people that are,

36
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,820
he has been or be tried to taint, uh, um,

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,580
they're also forced,
disappeared. Basically. Uh,

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,660
people have been killed.
People that have been tortured,

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,160
so on the number has increased
a lot. How we help them, well,

40
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,460
we have sees them legally,
but it is legally many.

41
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,290
You've talk about illegality in Venezuela
over the judicial system is something

42
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,530
that is not a uh,
with,

43
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,840
I mean it is very important for the
world is very important and for us,

44
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,841
but for the Goldman index
actually controlled the
actually absolutely everything

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,590
to work as a lawyer is minimum of
percentage of the work that you do.

46
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:08,170
So actually we do
campaigns. We do, I mean,

47
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:12,100
a lot of different things in order
to increase the cost of repression,

48
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:15,640
that's actually what we do more
than assistant legally. Uh,

49
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:19,510
all these big themes of
repression. So, um, we,

50
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,100
you know, hug, I will say
the families and we, um,

51
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,200
held that we won, uh, and the
families or the friends or whatever,

52
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,900
even looking for people
that are being disappeared.

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,710
So that's actually what we do. But there
is a very important thing that we do. Uh,

54
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,380
and I realized, uh, that, that,

55
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:45,381
that was extremely important recently
that we registered all detainees on

56
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,150
victims of repression.
And you can imagine,

57
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:54,151
and then I realize that if we haven't
eve not meaning if we were in there and

58
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,470
Ray Easter and everything,

59
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:01,390
nobody will know how many people have
been detained or very important or where

60
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,580
they are. And, uh,

61
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,340
that's a very important thing that we are
doing right now besides, you know, well,

62
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,220
all things that we do with victims.
And

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,330
can you talk a little bit about,
um,

64
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,820
okay.

65
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,820
Basically how the organization
has reacted in the,

66
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,770
um, how assembly and
creating awareness, um,

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,340
due to technology. Um,
how has your organization,

68
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,970
um,
in the context of Association in Assembly

69
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,410
reacted in terms of
restrictions on that as well?

70
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,800
Well, we were live in a country
that everything's been controlled.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,690
Um, um, freedom of expression.

72
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,570
I mean,
it doesn't exist as the,

73
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,430
as you know it here in the United
States and in free countries.

74
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,770
So we don't have like a new opportunity
to go to the media and talk about what

75
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:03,030
we do.
Actually,

76
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:07,020
that's something that happened until 2007,

77
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,690
there was a very important thing
that happened that they closed.

78
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:15,190
The government clothes are very
important to be channel. Uh,

79
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,040
the name was our,

80
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,140
our see TV and I'm telling
you about it because that,

81
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,210
that channel Lisa, I was able to go
and, and denounced what was going on.

82
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,260
And, um, all the situation
of what's going on, um,

83
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,790
are these moment is impossible.
I mean,

84
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,330
do you don't have a media that you
go and talk about what is going on?

85
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:41,250
And the media actually doesn't show
what is going on. Um, I mean, they,

86
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:41,580
they,

87
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,540
they doesn't show and somebody is detained
or when somebody is killed or when

88
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:50,150
somebody searchers something that we do,
we do it by ourselves. So what we do, uh,

89
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,530
in order to,
you know,

90
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,830
to continue working and showing people
what is going on and to increase

91
00:05:55,831 --> 00:06:00,050
political cost where they use media for
our social media is extremely important.

92
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,000
Um, that's something that actually
I didn't know too much about it.

93
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,330
I started using social
media and to southern nine,

94
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,520
that was the first student
I actually helped. He,

95
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,040
he was the first student that was
actually, are we trying to tame his name?

96
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,110
Is Julio on? I remember

97
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,750
just to tell you an anecdote
about it. Um, he will listen.

98
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,360
He will stick into the court and the,

99
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,280
this guy who was at 21 years old at
the time, maybe 20, he was very Thien,

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,600
you know, very naive like, and, and, um,

101
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,580
he was at the doors of the court
and I took a picture of him,

102
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,860
uh, you know, and it wasn't
Twitter actually. So I,

103
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,990
I Polish it in Twitter. I didn't know too
much about Twitter at the time. And, um,

104
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,690
I used it and actually the picture,
I mean, the whole old Venezuelans,

105
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,380
it's just saw the picture
and they were all, you know,

106
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,110
reacting about this student.

107
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,390
It was taken to prison and he was
extremely important because, uh,

108
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,200
after that a hunger strike
started of the students,

109
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,870
um,
you know,

110
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,150
claiming for the release of the sky and
actually he was released in 22 days.

111
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,540
And, um, so that was very
important. After that we'll,

112
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:30,530
I'm being using social
media as, um, as the most,

113
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:31,760
I will say is most this,

114
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:36,080
the most important tool for
increasing the cost of repression.

115
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:40,510
Because it's not that you
can, you can tell it, uh, to,

116
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,570
to the world like easier because it's
not that you have the media there too.

117
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,490
I mean, the me story control, even they,

118
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:52,940
they controlling the by themselves
or because the government section put

119
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:57,110
pressure on them or they've Cobram and
just control the whole media because they

120
00:07:57,111 --> 00:08:00,690
have all state, you know,
the public, uh, the,

121
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:03,490
the channels or though the media that's
being controlled by the government but

122
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:04,760
the state.
But,

123
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:08,920
so that's the way that we actually show
people where it's going on on the world.

124
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,850
So it is extremely important.
I mean the way how we can, um,

125
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,340
in some way work without,

126
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,080
without having freedom of
expression, you know, that the way,

127
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:24,290
at least as you know, how
you know, how it works. Yeah.

128
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,920
And you briefly touched on it a little
bit about your work with detainees and

129
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,620
alerting the families.
Can you talk a little bit about that,

130
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:35,000
what that looked like before your
work? What it looks like now? We work,

131
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,540
I always say that we work in
the darkness and solitude.

132
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,160
So because when there is a mass protest
and a lot of people are out there on the

133
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:47,900
streets and protesting, at least
you are, you know, with your family,

134
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:50,690
your friends and all of that. And
when we start working well, where,

135
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,840
when people are arbitrary that taint
after I did the protest and eh,

136
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,930
and because of a cause of repression.
So,

137
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,230
so we go what we do actually,

138
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,650
people in Minnesota knows followup,

139
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,810
they know for a panel and they know that
we help people that are being arbitrary

140
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,070
thing.
But more than that,

141
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,910
they know that they only way to know
where their son or daughter or mother or

142
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:25,260
father, Eh, ease, I mean was taken,

143
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,580
is to call for up in us.
So what we do, we have,

144
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,190
we are more than four and volunteers
right now. It's incredible. I mean,

145
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:35,520
he's a very big organization now when
these volunteers do is not just lawyers,

146
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,354
lawyers,

147
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,980
we are right now formed by more than
160 lawyers or around the country.

148
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,520
But what the balloon juice do, the
volunteers are the ones, I mean,

149
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,240
I'm talking to volunteers on a
student, a mother or whatever. I mean,

150
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,440
even volunteers are, we're already
big of repression in some polling.

151
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:55,440
So they help for helping other victims.
Um,

152
00:09:55,441 --> 00:10:00,000
so they go, because when you're
detained, technically in Venezuela,

153
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,650
you are forced,
disappeared.

154
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:04,950
I mean your [inaudible] they're
forced disappearances so why?

155
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:06,450
Because you didn't know
where you being taken.

156
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:11,451
It's not that you call 800 government
Bhavana soil and then you find out who,

157
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,730
who, where, where your, your son
is being detained or your daughter.

158
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:19,210
So that's what we do actually.
We work at night, uh,

159
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,730
until the morning in order to
know where these new know where,

160
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,520
where the people that they need are.
So the families are sold,

161
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,730
the feminist called us and we tell
the family go to the, to that place.

162
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,090
So because we have found out
that these guys send that place.

163
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,600
So whenever we found
out, for example, Pedro,

164
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,070
he's in whatever place
and how we find it out.

165
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,530
Well because we talked to the,
to the custodians there and you know,

166
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,340
he's not like an official thing.
And so we do it like underground.

167
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,960
So we talked to them, this,
that, these guy here, whatever.

168
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,480
So then when you find out
that these guys there,

169
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,360
because somebody tells you
that he, these guys, they're,

170
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,970
sometimes you find out
that there are 10 others.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,700
So we start helping these people.
So we tell the families on,

172
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,820
we use Twitter basically or
the social media to tell gay,

173
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,060
these guy has been detained in this place.

174
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:15,060
So the families called also in come to
the place and they know where they are.

175
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,420
So, and then you know, the
whole process started. So they,

176
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,390
some of them I've taken to
the course room, they are not,

177
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,190
but it's more important that because
you have to provide food to these people

178
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:29,880
because these people is not that you're
being detained and you have food and

179
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,220
water.
I mean you don't have it.

180
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,770
Even food and water if you
are not detained so that you
can imagine in Venezuela.

181
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,330
So you can imagine if, how
if you are detained, I mean
you have to provide water.

182
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:43,200
So you have to bring water, you
have to bring food, you have to um,

183
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,650
general bring everything to these
people that are being detained. So,

184
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,550
but he's extremely important
because as I said before,

185
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,290
you imagine if we were in there,
I mean,

186
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,290
nobody will know where the detainees are.

187
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,590
So I'm going to talking
just since 2014 January,

188
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,420
2014 they are being exactly till today,

189
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,810
11,903 people that have been Abby
triple detained for political reasons.

190
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,821
So,

191
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:17,821
and we have a race third now we
have a very sophisticated database.

192
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,360
So we have register everything, the
place where they, where the Tane the age,

193
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,870
the profession. I mean we know everything.
How many women have you detained?

194
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,040
So this is a very confidential
information, but you have
absolutely everything.

195
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,240
So it's not that we,

196
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,740
when I said that there had been
more than 10,000 detainees,

197
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,340
11,000, 903, it's not because
I'm, the media tells me, well,

198
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,840
the media gets information from
what we tell them where we have.

199
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,910
So, oh, this is some of the
things that we do. And um, oh,

200
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,590
some of the things that we actually,
we have our car,

201
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,630
I kind of a mathematical way of analyzing
and the actions that we have to do in

202
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:03,550
order to increase the political costs.
It's a kind of interest in thing. Um,

203
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,420
because we, we, we use like
a tactical plan. I mean it's,

204
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,610
it's not something that we do at
right now. Like I'm like, you know,

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,470
as an informal way,
we do it in a very tactical way of,

206
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,370
you know, doing a specific thing.
So we analyze it and all of that.

207
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,500
And I'm telling you this because I was,

208
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,550
I was telling you about
the legal assistance,

209
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,160
actually the,
the,

210
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,820
the number of actions that we have
in order to release a person is,

211
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,060
Eh, is for reactions. 40.

212
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,540
So the legal assistant is just
one of the 40 actions of the cell.

213
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,220
So there are many. So, and
social media, he counts. Um,

214
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,580
the value for social media
is five of the 40 actions.

215
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,070
It's that kind of, I mean, it's the berry
a methodology that longer too. I mean,

216
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:59,600
there's that long explanation,
but that's how we work.

217
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,290
And why have you chosen to become a human
rights defender when it comes at such

218
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,600
a great rest of your life and your safety?

219
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,790
I didn't choose to become
our humorous offender.

220
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,780
I mean the two of these,
it will sound,

221
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,970
I don't know how we'll sell,

222
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:21,030
but at the beginning I was
graduated from Catholic University,

223
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,520
good university in Venezuela,

224
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,760
g-suite university in by the you suits.

225
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,650
And um,

226
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,650
and then I came to Georgetown University
and I got my master's degree in Latin

227
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,400
American stories from the
School of Foreign Service.

228
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:44,080
And then I went to London School of
Economics and I got my master's degree in

229
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:44,770
banking law.

230
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,770
So I care about human rights
and is not that id didn't care.

231
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:52,530
I didn't know anything about the
human race that even start humor.

232
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:55,880
It's what happens. What are the,
was telling before that in 2002,

233
00:14:55,881 --> 00:15:00,470
one guy was skill, he's was shouting, he
said 18 years old boy, his name was Jesus.

234
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,630
He's mother name was Maria.
So,

235
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:06,464
um,

236
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,130
and I was at that time and a dicer
to the Supreme Court of Justice,

237
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,440
um, to the Constitutional
Chamber of the Supreme Court.

238
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,280
And I was working as a corporate lawyer
is still work as a corporate lawyer with

239
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:30,440
all the restrictions and all
of that. Um, so as, so I said,

240
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:33,440
I saw this site did to help this guy.
That's it.

241
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,270
I thought that a fight,
you know, help the sky,

242
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,660
then I will, it will finish and
I will continue with my work.

243
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,570
But then I realized, and for
example, there was a, um,

244
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,493
right now my,

245
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,120
my friend and member of that my NGO and
also part of the vote of the extras go

246
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,630
salary meal who is also my compadre like

247
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,001
and uh,

248
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:04,001
we started helping these people
and actually we realized that no,

249
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,340
there was known NGOs doing
legal assistance pro bono
to these people because I

250
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:15,380
realized, I thought that there were
a lot of NGOs hoping these people.

251
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:19,180
So I thought, okay, we'll help this guy
and then our NGO will come to us and,

252
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,060
and continue with, uh, with
assistance as a of these people.

253
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:27,890
But actually there was his sous,
then there was another okay.

254
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:32,240
Schools, John Carlos and you know, and
now we have Geraldine, we have Maria,

255
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,670
we have all these people
that actually were,

256
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:39,350
became super pressured and they
came to us and ask for help.

257
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,220
And,
um,

258
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,240
yeah,

259
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,680
I became a humorous offender and actually
in 2002 I thought it was the end.

260
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,370
MMM.

261
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,450
It's just on three.

262
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,450
I thought he was the end and do
something and for it was the end.

263
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:57,030
And now we're in 2017 and we are still,
um,

264
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,360
helping all these people
are being tortured like, uh,

265
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,740
with electric shocks or um,
you know,

266
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,720
sexually abused or were killed. Uh, like,

267
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:15,050
um, you know, I can, I
can tell you many names.

268
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:19,310
They are already the families
of these people already.
No, no, no. Just my friends,

269
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:23,750
they are part of the follow up in a
family of my NGO family because they had

270
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:28,751
become part or photo banana and they
are not just my friends or my family.

271
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,743
And

272
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,173
uh,

273
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,710
you know, a, a very
interesting thing that we,

274
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,430
when you start helping people,
you'd never know. I mean,

275
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:42,350
you didn't want to do it of course.
Okay.

276
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,910
But then you feel like a
need of helping another one.

277
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,330
And when you listen to them and they
tell you their story about what is

278
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:55,800
happening to them and more,
most of these people are very poor people,

279
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,680
so they don't have low, I mean that
they have money to pay for a lawyer.

280
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:00,840
If they would have money,
they of course,

281
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,890
they didn't call those a to
pay for a lawyer. So, um,

282
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,360
so you're getting to do,
get involved with all these people.

283
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:14,310
And when a mother of, for
example, Carter, Julio Velasco,

284
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:17,610
an 18 years old boy student
who's right now in jail,

285
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,190
and he has to be, um,
you know, he's sick, uh,

286
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,660
and all of that, and he's there in
jail and his mother took to you and,

287
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,440
and, and crying and then
you get involved with it.

288
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,020
So it come to be a human rights
defender and to help people,

289
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,880
he had become an addiction.
To me. It's true. I mean,
it's like an addiction. So I,

290
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,020
I, I always, sometimes
I wake up, I said, okay,

291
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,550
I have to finish with it because
I'm very tired. Because as I said,

292
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:52,980
I work in the mornings,
I mean,

293
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,390
very late at night. And, uh,

294
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,310
I came to my house sometimes
at 4:00 AM for example,

295
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,150
because somebody called me
that he was being detained.

296
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:07,290
And so I go to the prison
center to the military,

297
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,690
uh, you know, place where they are being
detained or the police station, whatever.

298
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:16,450
And uh, and then the next
day I said, I'm very tired,

299
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,420
so I have to continue with my work,

300
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,030
with my regular work or have to, you
know, continue musician also, sorry,

301
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,150
I need to play music or things.
And I,

302
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,240
and I realized after I slipped a
little bit a wake up and again, I said,

303
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,750
okay, I have to continue because
these people asking for help.

304
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,750
So in the end is not that daddy's
real sacrifice because if you were a

305
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:46,891
sacrifice,

306
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:51,891
I'm told sure that I will stop doing
it is actually a great benefit.

307
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,780
And I'm,
maybe I'm talking too much,

308
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,870
but I will tell you another little thing.

309
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,910
We have four principals in a migraine
section or what they call the four C's

310
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,340
versus the forces because the, the, the,
the words to start with a c in Spanish,

311
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,940
it's Constantia, which means perseverance.
The second one is compromised,

312
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,520
which means commitment.

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,630
The third one is [inaudible]
would you means conviction.

314
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,000
And the fourth one and the most important
one is quarter sawn, which means heart.

315
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,690
This is very important one because
I is not just a beautiful words,

316
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,450
the it has a meaning
but that everyone but,

317
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,760
and I explained to everyone
whereas the meaning,

318
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:42,240
but the last one is very important
because w I explained it and he said what

319
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,990
means Corazon are hard. It's not just love
of romantic word, it's more than that.

320
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,520
That when you two good things to people,
you will receive good things to you.

321
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:52,001
I'm actually,

322
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,710
I'm very happy doing what I'm
doing and I have a great family,

323
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,710
a lot, a lovely flat, lovely family,

324
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,670
a nice songs on and they
appreciate what I do.

325
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:05,590
And this is just,

326
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,430
the family is very important
for me but have very well be.

327
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:14,330
So ward term receiving, uh, it's not
usual that you receive at like that.

328
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,760
So he's probably would buy more than that.

329
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:20,710
Is that you feel Barry Nice helping
people and easy something that really

330
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,190
everyone has to feel it because he,
as I said,

331
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,160
he's very great indemnification
to your life until you're,

332
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,540
you know,
do you,

333
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,791
absolutely.

334
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,960
So it sounds like one thing that you
thought or one incident you thought was

335
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:41,830
just going to be the one time thing
turned into this whole, you know,

336
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,310
series of events that basically found you.

337
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,641
Yeah,

338
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:50,641
I get out of my comfort zone and I
thought that I will come back and yeah.

339
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:54,220
Now you're still going for
the one with I'm doing.

340
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:58,940
So this is like right now it's my comfort
zone to be, to be a here Moreso fender.

341
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,850
I don't see myself doing something
different, even though that I can,

342
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,660
I mean I have to,
because to be a humorous offenders,

343
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:12,190
nothing something that actually you have,
do you have a lease in economic

344
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,380
indemnification that, um, so
you have to continue working.

345
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,720
And this is something that I always say
to Kim or resist the defenders if we are

346
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:23,140
to be calm or human rights offenders,

347
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,770
think about doing it because it's not
that you will receive a payment for that.

348
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,270
So you have to continue
working in what you do and,

349
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,700
and tried to finance
yourself. And, um, uh,

350
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,150
as I said,
I always say that whenever I help people,

351
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,410
I will always receive something
a better from, from life.

352
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,910
That's a perfect segue, um, to Angelita.

353
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,290
Angelita can you tell us a little bit
about partners for human rights and how

354
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,870
your partnership with a fellow came to
be? So my organization, Robert Defcon,

355
00:22:57,871 --> 00:23:00,610
he humorize has been
giving every year for,

356
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:04,110
this is the 34th here that
we give, uh, these, uh,

357
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,830
annual human rights award that eads
was created to recognize people like,

358
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:09,611
afraid of,
you know,

359
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:13,830
the most courageous human rights
offenders from around the world. And, um,

360
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,190
the program that I direct is
precisely a support program within our

361
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,460
organization.
For those that win the award,

362
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,900
the award is an idol only
recognition, uh, eight cells. So,

363
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,930
or offering as an organization to Alfredo
and his organization to really provide

364
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:35,530
all the support we can, all
the tools we use, uh, no,

365
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:40,531
or expertise or human resources
or contacts right yet to help,

366
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,943
um,

367
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,330
amplify the voice of
[inaudible] as a network of,

368
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,060
of laureates that, that we have. Um,
and that's, that's what we hope to,

369
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,510
to, to be able to from now on, continue
working very much hand in hand with,

370
00:23:57,511 --> 00:24:00,110
with Alfredo and photo penile,
uh,

371
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,220
knowing that Venezuela right now really
needs the international attention and

372
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:08,130
the support from, from people
all around the world, uh,

373
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,970
to put it into these,
these situation in this crisis.

374
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,080
And one of the areas that
as an organization we've
been focusing more and more

375
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,470
is the protection of civic space and,
uh,

376
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,120
including of course the basic freedoms
that make civic space possible.

377
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,000
Freedom of expression,
freedom of Association and assembly.

378
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,550
And by partnering with Courageous
Human Rights Offenders, second flow,

379
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,950
we tried to protect those basic rights
because in helping those that are the

380
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,600
front line, like Alfredo putting their
lives at risk, their reputation, no,

381
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,800
and he didn't say so,
but he's attack constantly by him,

382
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:49,801
by government and by sectors of society
that don't like him being a supportive

383
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:54,050
of those that are being, uh,
whose rights are being violated.

384
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:59,410
And by partnering with Alfredo and put
up an avenue salon or we're trying to

385
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,350
lend our support and extend our hand to,
uh,

386
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,840
organizations that really are in,
in,

387
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,850
in the day to day trying to take the
most important and basic freedoms that we

388
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:15,750
all need,
um,

389
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,690
to really be able to participate
into express ourselves. And,

390
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:21,920
and, and, and, you know,

391
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:25,700
have even to the people
that have been detained,

392
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,850
but sometimes they're just
protesting for the basic right of,

393
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,330
of having food under the table,

394
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,820
being able to work or being able
to disagree with the government.

395
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,000
And those rights are being
completely curtail. So again, we,

396
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:44,001
we aim at supporting organizations that
are doing incredible work just like

397
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,140
[inaudible] and protect that
space that is so important.

398
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:53,870
I mean those basic freedoms such
as expression and association.

399
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,840
So,
you know,

400
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:01,841
we are in a very interesting time right
now where there are a lot of causes that

401
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:06,080
could use support. Um, and
so what was it specifically,

402
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:08,990
because I know that there
were thousands of applicants.

403
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,920
What was it about unfair though and his
specific organization that led to the

404
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:17,570
selection of the 2017, uh, Robert F.
Kennedy Foundation, Human Rights Award?

405
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,920
Many reasons. Um, I
fairways definitely the,

406
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,290
the very clear and a unanimous
decision by the jury.

407
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:29,570
We have an external jury that chooses the,
each year the,

408
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:34,120
the low and we don't plan.
We saw somebody that is courageous,

409
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,320
that has being able to
choose a different path.

410
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:43,321
And having had that even carrier has
made and has received the calling of,

411
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:46,970
of being a human is offender and has um,
yeah,

412
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,950
really fell through. We did. And, um, we,

413
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,700
we also saw it and see that,
um,

414
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,890
ability and the to take it
like the methodology that
is used by my Alfredo and a

415
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,160
up an advantage. This, um,

416
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,780
idea of really creating a network,
um,

417
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,970
it's unending support that goes beyond
just the legal systems but also attends

418
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,780
to all the other aspects of, of uh, needs
of victims of human rights violations.

419
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,600
So he's a very integral approach
and it involves people, uh,

420
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,860
and in your victims and families
of victims and society at large.

421
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,240
So that was one,

422
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,650
one of the many special things then that
had flavor has and his leadership and

423
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,280
also, um, yeah,

424
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,540
using data even though there is no
independence of the judiciary and um,

425
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,950
the, the, the government has
absolute control over everything.

426
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,580
What I've been at and pretty have nine
entirely given up on the rule of law and

427
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:57,581
know the need to use the law to defend
the basic human rights of people.

428
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,030
But at the same time also use
all these other creative ways,

429
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:05,970
including social media to
try to get the message out.

430
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,870
So that's another reason why we
thought, um, I couldn't really embodied

431
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,110
the courage and the creativity and
the perseverance that we would look to

432
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,760
recognize with a human rights award.

433
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,830
So we've touched on technology a few
times today and the use of social media to

434
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:25,900
create awareness on what's going on,

435
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:30,460
to notify family members and to
even just get the word out. Um,

436
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,080
so last week there was a law passed,
uh,

437
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:39,150
that gives printed prison sentences up
to 20 years if a post or if something,

438
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,060
uh, on broadcast television or on
the radio is deemed as hateful.

439
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,530
Um, you know, in the wake of
that recent, that recent lot,

440
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,590
how can technology still be used as a
something that can help your organization

441
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,050
and, um, as a human rights
defender in general?

442
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,320
Well,
um,

443
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,830
and I guess also the impact photo

444
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,780
is too,
who will say five,

445
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,790
but do you have to have all
these obstacles since we started?

446
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,550
Um,
does he sell low?

447
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,450
That actually restricts severally
this kind of expressions,

448
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:25,070
which are geos, expressions, I will say
expressions or message us or whatever.

449
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,031
Yeah.

450
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:29,030
Against the government because the
government is the ones who buy your leads.

451
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,740
Sorry, human rights. If
you abuse people. Um,

452
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,240
the problem with this law,

453
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:40,241
I mean they call it a law
against hey toy games.

454
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:42,910
Um,

455
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:47,890
but what the problem is that they
don't even explained what does in mean?

456
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,960
I mean, what is, um, a
message that actually,

457
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,330
uh,
you know,

458
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:01,030
this is included in this law
and it will be sanctioned,

459
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,100
um, or criminalized. You don't
know. So it's very discreet.

460
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,590
It's on the government discretion.

461
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,540
Why when it's a message
against the law or no,

462
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,920
that's a big problem.

463
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,850
But this is our law and new law,

464
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,410
but they already have been detaining
people for Twitter messages. Right now,

465
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:27,190
for example, there was a guy called, his
name is Victor [inaudible] for example.

466
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,300
These guys be in jail for more than
three years just because of a Twitter

467
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,000
message.
Um,

468
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,940
there is another guy
called Leonel Sanchez.

469
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:40,660
He was in you still in jail because of
that other being more than nine people

470
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,780
because of social media
using social media.

471
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,720
Um, and they come to your house and
they take you out of your house,

472
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,873
uh,

473
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,900
because well they can find out
where you have sent the message.

474
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,640
So

475
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,090
the important thing is that the whole
world knows about it and they understand

476
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:07,210
that they're using this loss in order to,
you know,

477
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:13,020
officialized or legalized in
some way in have to formalize,

478
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:17,290
I will say, Eh, political persecution.

479
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,560
But this is something that we
are used to it. And, um, um,

480
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,630
well we have to continue doing our
job in there are very objective and,

481
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,890
and um, and the way that we're doing
that we use still need the two.

482
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,660
And of course for the government,
no, but that's why they,

483
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,560
they restrict or media on all freedom of
expression because they don't want the

484
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:43,780
truth to be known all around the worst.

485
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:48,160
So that's why it is extremely
important to be here. Um, for example,

486
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,780
uh, I will say this,
companies like Google or,

487
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,460
or international companies
that have the access to,

488
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,540
I will say to people and
that they can tell the truth,

489
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,560
I hope that they can help
countries like Venezuela,

490
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,180
that we are always more
and more restricted. And,

491
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,130
and sometimes it's is important because

492
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:19,240
I'm totally sure that if you leave
here in the United States or in a free

493
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:23,470
country, you will say, well come and
why these people are stupid. You know,

494
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,560
why, why these people can be
controlled by a guy or two guys.

495
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:30,940
Why they don't protest to,

496
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,600
I didn't do things like that where they
don't just go out of the street. Oh,

497
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,830
people have gone out of the street,
made anytimes. But having killed,

498
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,910
having tortured on the, when your song
is being killed, I was 16 years old,

499
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:47,500
15 years old for example,
this [inaudible], uh,

500
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,690
15 years old boy that was skilled then
you think twice before going out of,

501
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,780
uh, out of trees. So, so this is
important to understand because, um,

502
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,820
and this is also very
important thing to understand.

503
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,940
You cannot take freedom for granted.

504
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,870
If you live in a free country because
you never know when you're going to lose

505
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:11,300
it.
I used to live in a free country.

506
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,940
I didn't know.

507
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:17,930
I didn't even imagine that it
will be involved in these issues.

508
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,560
Uh, I didn't even imagine that
will become a humorous offense.

509
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,640
I didn't imagine that will be here at
some point in my life is not general

510
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,480
something I was looking for,
but I'm glad it happened.

511
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,320
And um, that's why he's important, um,

512
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:42,050
for the whole world to know,
um, you know, for the people to,

513
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,780
to be some kind of interested in,

514
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,100
in human rights and human rights abusers.

515
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:56,470
And um, in thinking about your
partnership together with,

516
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,020
uh, throughout the Robert
F. Kennedy Foundation,

517
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,300
I guess in thinking of the year ahead,
um,

518
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,690
what's your vision between this
partnership and even the organization?

519
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,850
My vision. Why? Well, for
both of them, um, uh, we, uh,

520
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:15,670
as we have been growing for open,
Eh,

521
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,000
very much, uh, we're more, as I said,

522
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:22,860
more than four south and volunteers
are these moment in Venezuela,

523
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:28,510
a EDC important to what he called twin
tart internationalized for open al.

524
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:33,810
And the, the, and the message and he
know there's a message, the method,

525
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,880
the methodology that we used [inaudible]
increased the cost of political, of,

526
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:43,890
of state repression. And I
think this partnership, um,

527
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:49,030
uh, I have to find out how we will
work together. Yeah. A lot about,

528
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,910
I know that, uh, it is extremely
important, um, to have, uh,

529
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,661
uh,

530
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:59,661
an NGO or an organization dependent
one that can actually help in Eh,

531
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,000
you know,
pulled in the message

532
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,850
and you know, and the place
where it, where it needs to be,

533
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,460
you know, food and this
and the way that, uh,

534
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,310
we need everyone to know what
is going on and um, you know,

535
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,790
make people interested in,

536
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,060
in what he's going on and actually for
even for our safety and so in some place

537
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:29,640
in some way because,
uh, when you, as I said,

538
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:34,590
we work there leg in the darkness
and if you talk about Venezuela,

539
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,590
maybe you will think, well, first of all,

540
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:41,190
where he's been a sweater in South
America. Okay, let me see. Okay.

541
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:43,200
And what is happening
there? I mean, yeah. So,

542
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:47,330
well there is a guy whose name is Alfredo
Romero with an organization that works

543
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:52,200
in a system, a big theme for the state
repression. So people have been killed,

544
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:53,130
people are being tortured.

545
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:58,050
Well three central gate station here in
the United States that actually can in

546
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:03,051
some way speak or a Lauder
and say that this is going on.

547
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:07,590
I mean in case something happened to us,

548
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,800
then we have some one here then
at least putting attention,

549
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,240
uh, of what is going on there. Yeah.

550
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,590
Yeah. I mean for us it's, it's,

551
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,450
it's a privilege and it's an
honor and we're really, um,

552
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,990
truthfully very, very, um,
eager to help as much as,

553
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,330
as we can, including there's many tools.
One of them of course he did one video,

554
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,300
all the advocacy work international book.
I see that we can,

555
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,850
we can do around the word bet and what,

556
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,200
why these going on in Venezuela and the
work that for a banana is doing. Um,

557
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,120
we also do international mediation.

558
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:46,360
We've been cases like
implematic cases that uh,

559
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:49,150
before international tribunals where,
um,

560
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,130
cases that I representative of a
wider, larger problem. And, uh,

561
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,930
for example, the law, the recent law,
then my spice in Venezuela. It's,

562
00:36:59,540 --> 00:36:59,780
it's,

563
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,800
it's interesting because it's just an
example of one of the tactics that more

564
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:07,801
and more countries are using repressive
countries where social media was like

565
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:10,030
another frontier that was not,

566
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,380
it was completely out of control
for repressive governments. And so,

567
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,600
and it's so new also and he's so new,

568
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:20,530
so they're really by adopting this type
of laws are trying to also control that.

569
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,830
And um, and so it's, it's, you know,

570
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:27,940
there's a lot of things to do there
even to try to combat these laws.

571
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,860
But there's,
there's many aspects of the work that,

572
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,790
and the tools that we can use together,
um,

573
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,430
including read international mechanisms,

574
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:40,150
then targeted advocacy that
we really look forward to,

575
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,210
to work together on and just put the
message out and continue calling the

576
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:49,240
attention of, of, of the world
and what's going on in Venezuela.

577
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,560
So I have one more question before
I open it up to Q and. A. Um,

578
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,940
so for the people here, for the
people that will watch this, uh,

579
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,160
for anybody that's interested, how can
people help? How can people get involved?

580
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,660
Um, you know, being in the
United States, what can you do?

581
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:08,710
What can you do to help?

582
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,620
We incorporate everyone to our
network so everyone can be part,

583
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,040
can be a member of four opener so they
can register for open al.com and actually

584
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:28,020
this is extreme,
very important because it's what I say,

585
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,830
even if you work one minute a month,

586
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,260
I said Boland tear doing that,
you know,

587
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,430
saying something about what is going
on even if you just worked two hours.

588
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,930
Um, I dunno, participate in, in a,

589
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,710
in a an assembly or in a forum that
we do eat is extremely important.

590
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:55,360
So, um, as I said,

591
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,330
everyone is important here.
I mean,

592
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,140
and we train people to become
powerful or organizations.

593
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,320
So that's some very
important thing because if,

594
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,540
if you are registered in our organization,

595
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,990
then we know where you
are and we can some way,

596
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:15,630
Eh, send information
and, and because he's,

597
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,560
I mean, he's extremely important
to understand what is going on.

598
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:25,250
This is the most important thing. How
you, I will say not translated in the,

599
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:25,570
you know,

600
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:30,570
the judge did not use the language is
how to make people understand what,

601
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,040
what does in mean to live in a country
that the freedom has been a lost even the

602
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:43,510
children. I mean we
incorporate 14 years old, uh,

603
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,080
boys or girls bogus and I
listened to them exhibited from,

604
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,420
well I will say that in order for
anyone to understand what you say,

605
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:55,210
you have to talk to a 13 years old boy.

606
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,580
That's the way that you have to,

607
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,870
that people can understand what you're
saying is difficult, but it is important.

608
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,350
So that's the way, the best way to, to,

609
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,150
to support what we do. Um, and um,

610
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,710
for example,
as you know,

611
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:19,150
I'm not talking about lawyers of course,
not just students or,

612
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,550
or intellectuals I'm talking
about is singers, about artist,

613
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:27,030
about DC 16 year platform, every, no,

614
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,820
but everything is extremely
important. I used for example, music.

615
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,171
I'm a musician,

616
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:36,250
so use music in order to sing and some
time to explain where I'm doing with that

617
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,340
with a songs. And when,
whenever I, for example,

618
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:44,170
I publish a song either in Youtube,
whatever singing,

619
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:49,830
I will get more views that just talking
about a state repression and you know,

620
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:54,670
all the technicalities of these, of people
that are being tortured or whatever.

621
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,340
So everyone can help just,

622
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:02,370
I always ask people to register to become
part of our organization and I'm sure

623
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,620
that they will do something very good
for people in Venezuela and also all

624
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:16,020
around the world where,
where governments and um,

625
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,800
dictators actually have
the control of people.

626
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:25,330
And I needs to control people with
repression or to keeping power.

627
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:33,030
Google is known for having some of the
most talented people on technical field

628
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:34,030
and

629
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,430
communications field. They think that
putting that talent also in getting,

630
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:41,780
coming up with ideas, particularly on
when it comes to getting the message out.

631
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,250
Um, uh, securities also big thing,
not only for, you know, a fair bit.

632
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,750
All the people in the network,

633
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,530
why they're doing what photo is doing
is documenting human rights abuses that

634
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:52,550
comes at a high risk.

635
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,940
So anything that can help
do that work in a safer way,

636
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:01,820
in a more secure way, in a
more mainstream way. Um, it's,

637
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,990
it's always going to be welcome.
Even Venezuela and, and,

638
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:08,290
and in other places in the
world where, uh, but in,

639
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,090
in this specific case of Venezuela is,

640
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:14,150
especially now with the additional
challenges that are being created by the

641
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:16,700
government,
really disseminating information.

642
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:21,080
That's also something where these,
the brains that we have here,

643
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,940
I'm sure it can be very,
very useful.

644
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,720
Just very quick. It was, um,

645
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:32,300
also another story bearing tourist in
order to understand how, for example,

646
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,410
people in the working help and again,

647
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,240
daily and what is going on and to increase
in the cost of political repression

648
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:46,310
that they call the political
cost of repression. Just once,

649
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,710
about one year ago, there was,
um, a woman that was detained,

650
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:56,840
uh, she was protesting or
whatever and she was, um, she was,

651
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:01,370
her name was Joseph alleine show.
She was sustained actually,

652
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,990
and she was taken to,
um, to a military base.

653
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,640
And these guy, from
what she's told me, uh,

654
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,730
this military officer was starting,

655
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,180
it started touching her on,

656
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,450
she was with her like in a,

657
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,580
in an office in his office and somebody
started knocking the other door.

658
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,260
There was a soldier or whatever,
and this guy is a stand up,

659
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:32,510
very quick stop touching her.

660
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:38,950
And then the guy came back to the office,

661
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,850
I start yelling and took her and to
her to whatever place, I don't know.

662
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,210
And she said, why are you, why? Well,

663
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:50,880
because there's social media is with your
picture, with your name. I'm married.

664
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:55,460
Then we were the ones that were actually
publishing pictures of her and their

665
00:43:55,461 --> 00:44:00,410
name on her name. And so this is extremely
important. So this is the only way.

666
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:04,160
Sometimes you can not totally sure.
And she says that,

667
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:07,240
that we held her, I mean if, if we,

668
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,160
if we were in their publishing
the pictures, I'm so,
I'm sure she will be, um,

669
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:17,270
raped. So, um, it's
extreme important. I mean,

670
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:22,990
just if you mentioned something
in social media network,

671
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:28,130
whatever he could, he
could save a life. So, uh,

672
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,440
that's how you can help. For
example, I will give you,

673
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,330
I know their idea is something that I,

674
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,180
I don't care because whoever can do
it and Google is a place. For example,

675
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,950
I have thought on a map of big
teams of repression the world.

676
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:47,980
So there isn't a map. So how many
political prisoners are in? They were,

677
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:52,200
nobody knows it. I know I didn't make
country because we have a register.

678
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:56,820
So it's important to know where are the
big teams of repression or around there

679
00:44:56,821 --> 00:45:01,500
so people can actually put their names
so that the whole world knows there is

680
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:03,310
like a map or so
something's happening here,

681
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,070
something's happening there and
Google is a great platform to do that.

682
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,150
Now I want to open it up for questions.
Does anyone,

683
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,420
does anyone have any questions
on either side?

684
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,833
We can start with you.

685
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,380
Sure. Hi. Well thank you for everything.

686
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,640
So global are also data driven company
and I see you're looking at a lot at you,

687
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,900
at your data. I'm just curious,
how have you seen trends?

688
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:34,330
I mean with number of cases,

689
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:39,331
number of repressions and things it
change or has it only gold and on par.

690
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:42,500
Has there been any change?
I mean I'm interested about it.

691
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,880
Yeah, this is, this is a very
important question. Again, we,

692
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,800
how we work or how I analyze everything.
I analyze this as a, as a cost,

693
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,220
as a political cost benefit analysis.
That's it off the repression.

694
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,960
So we are the organization that actually
shows the list of political prisoners

695
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:04,730
in Venezuela,
just to give you an idea.

696
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:09,731
So they use what I have called
the revolving door effect.

697
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,580
So when they incarcerate some and they
release and others and they incarcerate

698
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,331
the recent others.

699
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:22,331
So I always said that there'd been more
than 11 south and 900 whatever political

700
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:29,360
detainees. But so there've
been affected. I mean the,

701
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:34,160
the intimidation effect
is really important. So
everyone is being intimidated.

702
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,210
So everyone is a big team.

703
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:39,870
So she told me that if one of
our families was a big thing,

704
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:43,400
so they called us and you can see all
that as well as all around the world even

705
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:45,140
telling me the same thing.

706
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,300
So in order to increase the political
costs we have showed how many political

707
00:46:54,351 --> 00:46:56,420
prisoners are.
So for example,

708
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,890
before April, 2017, before the,

709
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:05,930
the last broadest mass processes started,
they were a one south,

710
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:10,790
117 political prisoners monthly.

711
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,050
If you see our statistics,
there were 100 every month,

712
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,700
there were not the same. We're 100,
you know, with uh, uh, political, uh,

713
00:47:19,701 --> 00:47:24,701
with a revolving door effect
around talking about it in
July because of protest,

714
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,520
the number of political prisoners
increased to six and 76.

715
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,840
And we started saying that
there were 676 right now.

716
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:41,960
After that I started,
uh, we started, uh, Eh,

717
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,910
Eh, sending the list of political
prisoners to the Oi Aes,

718
00:47:46,911 --> 00:47:50,530
to the Organization of American States
in order for them to certify it at least,

719
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:53,670
and to verify it, at least not
for the government to say, well,

720
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:57,120
where are the political prisoners?
Where they here? So the OAS has,

721
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:59,980
it has the least. So we have it here.
So we have the names on everything.

722
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:05,720
We'll re now the government called dose.

723
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:12,010
Actually send me a letter asking for the
least of people that had been detained

724
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,230
in a bile int eh actions or whatever.

725
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,550
This is the least of political prisoners.
So I answer the letter,

726
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:27,690
I sent another letter, um, saying, okay,

727
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,880
here's the list of political prisoners.

728
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:34,320
Actually they use the lease and they
went to all [inaudible] centers.

729
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,320
Some of the prisoners
centers, actually the, the,

730
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,910
the number of political prisoners
have decreased to 342 is a,

731
00:48:41,911 --> 00:48:42,750
is the last one.

732
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:47,751
So every week they had
decreased the number two about
in about 1120 or whatever.

733
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,230
So they have to go again to
the 100, Eh, Eh, you know,

734
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:57,064
number.

735
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,390
And this is important because this is
how you increase the political cost.

736
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,480
This is how you do because the government,
they are not,

737
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:09,320
they don't want to have a, you know,
one south and political prisoners,

738
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,170
they don't want to have 600 political
business. Well, they don't one,

739
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,970
it's not that they don't want to have it.

740
00:49:13,971 --> 00:49:17,330
They want to have it because it's an
intimidation effects or they don't want

741
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:20,870
people to protests or they, they want
people to say, okay, if I go to protests,

742
00:49:20,871 --> 00:49:21,770
they haven't gone to jail.

743
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:26,460
So I prefer not to protest or I'm being
killed or whatever. So they, they,

744
00:49:26,461 --> 00:49:28,110
they don't care about, uh, about, uh,

745
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:32,690
incarcerating people by data one the world
to know they have political prisoners

746
00:49:32,691 --> 00:49:35,270
so shall the ones who are showing that.

747
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:40,450
So that's why I was telling you about
this map because if a country in the world

748
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:44,360
knows that the mat that they,

749
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:48,680
the map shows that they have 100
political prisoners, they will like,

750
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:53,010
they will better not to
have anyone if nobody knows.

751
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,870
For example,
in Egypt,

752
00:49:55,470 --> 00:50:00,470
I was talking once to a human rights
defender there and I asked her,

753
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,350
how many political prisoners
do you have in Egypt?

754
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,610
I'm talking about Egypt because Egypt
is not, he's not a socialist country.

755
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:09,140
Cause you know,

756
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,880
it doesn't matter if you're a
socialist or capitalist or whatever.

757
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:12,743
It doesn't matter.

758
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,400
Political prisoners or repression
can happen in a socialist country,

759
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:22,320
in a capitalist country. And
she told me, I didn't know,

760
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,520
I dunno, 10,000, 20,000.
And she asked me and I said,

761
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:30,800
we have bought that, that, that the number
specific number. And then I realized,

762
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,510
okay, this is how you, uh,

763
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,461
these,
the way,

764
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:41,840
the methodology to release political
prisoners or to stop repression or to

765
00:50:41,841 --> 00:50:45,500
decrease the state repression. And, well,

766
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,580
that's why I think, I don't
know if I answered your
question specifically, but I,

767
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:52,520
I think, uh, that's, that's the best,

768
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,740
the most important thing
that actually we do.

769
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:57,363
Thanks for your question.

770
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,770
So I just want to end on actually
a quote from Robert F. Kennedy. Um,

771
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,693
it reads,

772
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,870
it's from the numberless diverse acts
of courage and belief that human history

773
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:08,943
is shaped.

774
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:12,280
So thank you both for your courage and
thank you for everything that you do.

775
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:14,640
And thank you for being here today.
Thank you all for coming.
