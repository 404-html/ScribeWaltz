00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,480
Rebecca katz of clean
soups. Welcome. Thank you.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,900
I know the weather cleared a little,
but when we were planning this event,

3
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:19,500
we thought what a perfect time to
get together and talk about not only

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,600
comforting,
nourishing food,

5
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:25,290
but something that'll make you feel
your absolute best for the new year.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,460
And I was speaking at length with Rebecca
before the event about how obsessed I

7
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:32,550
am with this book.
So do not hesitate to get your copy.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,140
I can't stop making soup and I not
even really like a super person,

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,700
but tell us what's the idea behind
this magical vision of yours?

10
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:46,701
So today I think what we're gonna do is
I'm going to make one soup out of the

11
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:48,780
book.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,780
It's the Moroccan carrot soup
with Chermoula and it's one of my,

13
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,950
it's, it's what I call from the
cashmere sweater soup collection.

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,570
I'm going to use this handy
Dandy Ferrari of blenders,

15
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:07,020
the Vitamix to whip in this
incredible amount of air.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,260
And so we're gonna make this
soup and it has a special broth.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,010
It's called the magic mineral broth,
which we will talk about.

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,480
And,
um,

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,660
and I'm just going to start so we can get
the soup cooking and then I'll go into

20
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:28,620
a little bit of like, um, more
about what the book is about.

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,920
So the big challenge for me today is
how well I'm going to be able to use the

22
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:36,874
stove top.

23
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,560
But anyone who's been to an event with
us now as it's not the most intuitive

24
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:45,390
cooked, but I feel like I have a lot of
technical support. We have your back. Yes.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,260
So I'm, I think I'm good. So, um,

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,610
when I start making a soup,
the first thing that I do

27
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,110
is I add some fat to
the bottom of the pot.

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,680
And in this case I'm using all of whale
and I'm going to talk a lot about this

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,580
card that you have with the
acronym that is called Fass at ass,

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,160
which is bad acid salty.
Sweet.

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,700
And so just to give you an idea that
is like a little magic carpet that

32
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,660
transverses your taste buds a
carries the flavor back and forth.

33
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:35,550
So if you're eating food that doesn't
have any fat in it, it's kind of like,

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,593
Eh,

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,010
there's something that's not satiating
about it and you just kind of keep

36
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:45,720
wanting more and more and more. So
it used to be that fat was like, Eh,

37
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,790
but now we know that fat is really good.
Fat is really good for our brains,

38
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:54,440
but it's also the key to carrying flavors.

39
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:59,441
So I'm letting my pot get nice and hot
and I'm starting to see that my olive oil

40
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:06,340
is shimmering. So far,
so good, and said here,

41
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:10,570
I'm going to add the first ingredients,
which, which are some audience.

42
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,490
So when I make soup,

43
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,310
usually I'm starting with the
base of like onions, carrots,

44
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:22,150
and celery.
But this soup is just onions.

45
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,210
And the second thing that I do is
once the Iranians go into the pot,

46
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,220
I give them a generous pinch of salt.

47
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,060
Now salt is like a little scrubbing
bubble and it goes into the onions and it

48
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:43,010
pulls out the Iranians natural sweetness.
I mean,

49
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:45,490
we don't really think of
onions as being sweet,

50
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,620
but there's a lot of
liquid in here. Um, the,

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,790
a lot of sweet liquid
that's going to be released.

52
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,950
Now I'm going to turn this down.

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,400
And so every time I add what I call
like a new food to the pot or new,

54
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,500
it's like I call food, like my
little cast of characters. And, um,

55
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,360
every time I add something new to the pot,

56
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:15,190
I'm always going to add a pinch of salt.
And this is what we call layering.

57
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,010
And this is like,
so you're,

58
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,050
you want to constantly layer your flavors
because that's where you're going to

59
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:26,890
get what I call the maximum Yom. So, um,

60
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,130
I'm just letting this go for
a little bit just to get,

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,240
just to get a little kind of like golden
glow or golden hue on these onions,

62
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,960
because I'm in,
this can be a little bit,

63
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,360
if you don't let them get golden,

64
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:48,361
if you don't kind of let them get to
that translucent stage in cooking,

65
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,590
they can be a little sour.

66
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,250
So adding the salt in to help release
the sweetness and just letting them go a

67
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:01,090
bit is a, um, is a good thing.

68
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,360
So,
um,

69
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,000
you asked me why soups,
I like what's the deal,

70
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,540
what's the deal? Well, so
I've been a suit maker, my,

71
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,860
well since I was five and I was sitting
on my mother's yellow formica counter in

72
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,680
her like 1953 Youngstown kitchen,

73
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,810
which she still has with the old
coil electric stove, the whole bit.

74
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,320
But Anyway, um, uh,

75
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,160
I come from a family of
soup Sharmans and then,

76
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,070
um, when I was in culinary
school, I really, um,

77
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,850
I gravitated to soups and um,

78
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,420
I feel like soup is like
giving somebody a culinary hug.

79
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,420
You can get so many,

80
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:56,380
I mean there's nothing more nourishing
than a really good bowl of soup.

81
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,870
And there's a lot of the alchemy in making
soup and creativity and making soup.

82
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,520
And I think it's also of all of the,
the,

83
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,850
the culinary mediums,
like all the things that you can do,

84
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,180
saute grill,
be a saw ca or whatever.

85
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,160
Soup is the most forgiving
and it allows for creativity.

86
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,550
So,
um,

87
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,370
it's really good for people like to color
out of the lines which would be made.

88
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,670
Um,
and it's so I laugh because I like as a,

89
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,230
I create recipes and I have to write
everything. You know, I have to,

90
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm getting everything dialed in. Like
all my measurements are dialed in and,

91
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,580
but really, oh, you're just throwing
stuff, just find stuff. Then. I mean,

92
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,990
so it's like I have to use my left
brain when I'm creating a book,

93
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,490
but when I am left to my own
devices, I am just like, you know,

94
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,810
um, hats off to the
wind. I'm this throwing,

95
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:58,820
but this is not your
average soup cookbook.

96
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,420
This is not just a regular soup cookbooks.
Yeah.

97
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,050
So you're right.
So I have,

98
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,740
I do a lot of work in the health and
wellness space and this is my fifth book

99
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,290
child.
And um,

100
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,010
and the cookbook that came before and all
the soup chapters in my previous books

101
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,510
were my favorite chapters to write.

102
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,930
And I really believe that soup is a
portal for really amazing nutrition.

103
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,420
And I don't mean nutrition that's like,

104
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:40,040
or a healthy food like hippy
gruely or you know, just like Eh,

105
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,270
meth. I mean, like, like really Yummy,

106
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,770
sustainable food.
And so through the book,

107
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:53,771
what I do is I give you sort of you the
keys to the Kingdom of a how to make

108
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,214
soup.

109
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,260
Like what do you need to have to do it
and what are the tricks of the trade,

110
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,611
what,

111
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:05,611
what are the tactics behind it and what
are all the nutrient dense things that

112
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:11,771
you can put in a soup to make you feel
like all your cells are sort of waking

113
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:16,400
up, right? So now I'm,

114
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,960
my onions are exactly where I
want them. They're like, see,

115
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,920
they're like Nitel Golden,
they're beautiful and golden.

116
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,090
So now I'm going to add
the star of this soup,

117
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,670
the carrots.

118
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,180
And so with those carrots I add another
generous pinch of salt and now I'm just

119
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:46,630
going to stir them up

120
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,690
and get them nice and coated.

121
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,440
And now here is where I'm going
to add like all my spices.

122
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,260
Now oftentimes when people make soup,

123
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,500
they think they never know
what to do with their spices.

124
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,790
Like when they're first starting,

125
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,970
it's like I'll throw them
in at the end or I've,

126
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,660
I've heard all different
variations on a theme.

127
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,600
Usually standing in like
the supermarket line.

128
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,820
I'm hearing people and I'm like, no,
you don't want to do that. So, um,

129
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,890
so here I've got this,
this is the base,

130
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,760
right?
And there's all this lovely fat and um,

131
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,250
everything is dancing in the pan.
This is where I'm going to put my spices.

132
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,110
Now full disclosure,

133
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,170
I am putting in saffron a pinch
of Red Chili pepper flakes,

134
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,070
cumin and coriander and some cinnamon.

135
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,380
Now when you look at the ingredient
list of a Rebecca Katz Book,

136
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,180
you go, really, God, it's like so long.

137
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,330
But when you realize that like I'm
usually using like five spices or three

138
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,910
spices and that takes up space.

139
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:10,140
But if you have your pantry set
up and you have your spices,

140
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,700
then really you're only dealing with
carrots and onions and olive oil.

141
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,260
I could completely testify.

142
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:20,160
I've been making soup side of this book
since the New Year and I have only had

143
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,660
to shop for ingredients one time.

144
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,620
Everything else was things that I had
on hand just was able to play with.

145
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,130
Yay,
really accessible and really delicious.

146
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,610
So one of the things that's really
interesting about the herbs and spices is

147
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:43,161
that we don't necessarily think of
spices as being like we think of them as

148
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,260
being flavorful,

149
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:50,580
but we don't necessarily think of
them as being like these antioxidant

150
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:52,350
powerhouses,
like,

151
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,680
like amazing spices can do amazing things
to our bodies and we don't necessarily

152
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:03,060
think that way. Um, but for example,

153
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,610
I have a teaspoon of cinnamon,

154
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,440
has more antioxidants than a half a
bowl of a half a cup of blueberries.

155
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,310
So super powerhouses,

156
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,820
so many phytochemicals
and things that you know,

157
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,220
can shift gene expression and
all sorts of things. So the here,

158
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,720
I mean we're making soup,

159
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:28,470
but we're also again adding some
incredible nutrient density.

160
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,480
So I am going to add,

161
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,440
right now I have a cup

162
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,290
of the magic mineral broth,
which you and I will truly magical,

163
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,080
truly magical, which, which we're
going to talk about in a minute.

164
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,450
But this is what,
um,

165
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,580
this is what I call
creating a flavor seal.

166
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,980
So I've got half a cup of Broth,

167
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,960
which I'm just using.

168
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,020
I'm just gonna let it boil and reduced
just a little bit before I sync the rest

169
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:04,990
of the broth in.

170
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,320
And what that does is it concentrates all
the flavor and it almost like seals it

171
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:16,591
up so that when I go and put the rest
of my broth then and I let it cook,

172
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,250
all those flavors are going
to kind of do their thing.

173
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,260
They're going to just permeate those
little carrots and onions and everything

174
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:30,070
else. And that's honestly,
that is the trick.

175
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,960
This part right here,

176
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,520
it's like Saute your
audience and good olive oil,

177
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,440
salt.
Put your spices in the main event,

178
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,660
put some more salt in,

179
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,110
do this little thing with half
a cup of liquid and you are sat.

180
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,430
So in the book I have a
template where I literally,

181
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:59,110
I do this template about how you,
you know the stages of which you,

182
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,000
what you,
how you put things in.

183
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,420
And it's like once you learned that you
can make any soup any way you want with

184
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:11,110
any vegetable. I mean we could be
working with any vegetable here.

185
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,590
Carrots are kind of easiest specially
because they're so easy and accessible and

186
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,260
warming and easy to chop.

187
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:25,180
And when I was in culinary school and
we were doing knife skills, oh my God,

188
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,130
we had to chop carrots.

189
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:32,131
I remember hauling back to my apartment
like five pound bags of carrots just to

190
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:37,810
practice. So, um,

191
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,540
now this is just where I want it.

192
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,060
So I'm going to put the rest of
my magic mineral broth in here.

193
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,430
And this is about
eight cups.

194
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm going to probably use six
and just keep some just in case.

195
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,220
And this is a great way

196
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,100
to store, um, your broth in the freezer,

197
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,030
in these types of containers.
All right.

198
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,390
And now I just need to
find a lid. Ooh, Lid guys

199
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,610
coming. Lid coming. Great. Incoming.

200
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,160
Thank you. Thank you
Noah. Thank you. Okay,

201
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,660
so you ready to go over and tow yet the
main event? Talk about this broth. Okay.

202
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,820
CanNot get enough. All right, so,

203
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,030
so this broth has a little history.
So this is,

204
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,850
these are the ingredients
for the magic mineral broth.

205
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,880
And I created this broth 20 years ago and,

206
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,740
um, it took gallons, two
cycles around the earth.

207
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,490
Um,
and I,

208
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:01,700
it would like so specific just in terms
of all the ingredients and getting it

209
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:06,701
dialed in and it's Kinda has a cult
following now of which I am one newly,

210
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,210
I cannot get over it.

211
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,390
And it's the reason that it's so different
than a normal vegetable broth is that

212
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,610
I'm using it like normal things
that you would find in stock.

213
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:27,611
So carrots and celery and parsley and,

214
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,780
um,
but then I add like sweet potato,

215
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:36,140
like this is a Hana sweet potato.

216
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,410
It's like there's so many different
variations of sweet potatoes,

217
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:44,000
but this is a had a sweet potato or you
could use a white Japanese sweet potato,

218
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:48,800
or if you don't want to fuss,
you could just use any sweet potato.

219
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,180
But,
um,

220
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,560
but chef dd was kind enough to
get me the varietals here. So, um,

221
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,970
Garnett, a garnet sweet potato, um,

222
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,440
a white sweet potato because this
has a bit of a nuttier flavor to it.

223
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,720
And then just some red
skin potatoes and onion.

224
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,600
And then this is where
we kind of get funky.

225
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:16,601
I have some bay leaves and peppercorns,

226
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,000
eye of newt. No, just kidding.

227
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:25,060
And then just a little
and some garlic and onion.

228
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:30,020
And then this is um,
Combo.

229
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,070
So now I wouldn't use all of this,

230
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,700
but I would use about this much.

231
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,110
Now Kombu is usually used to make Dashi.

232
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,580
Um,

233
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,580
but here it adds a very
distinctive like Umami flavor.

234
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,900
But also this is so chockful
of trace minerals and,

235
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,180
and certain compounds of B vitamins
actually in this little strip.

236
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,180
So this is like nutrient
density to the, to the, to the,

237
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,050
to the, you know, whatever combo.

238
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:14,210
And it's a seaweed. So it's a kelp. Yeah.

239
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,540
So you can get an in any Asian market,
you can get it at whole foods.

240
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,600
It's got the shelf life of a hundred
years. I ordered some online. Yeah,

241
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,920
Amazon prime. I had
mine the next day. Yeah.

242
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,780
So very accessible and long shelf life.
So like,

243
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,590
so you're a magic mineral broth may occur.
So you,

244
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,640
this looks kind of intimidating,
right? A little bit. It's a lot.

245
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,140
At first when I got it all assembled, I
was like, okay, a big pot, luckily. Right?

246
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,090
So there are two ways you could go about
this. If you've got a big pot, right?

247
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,070
Um,
you can just do

248
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,340
one whole batch at once.
Okay.

249
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,230
Now I call this the chop and throw,
which was the best part. I mean,

250
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:02,730
once I cleaned everything, there's,
there's really no other work, right?

251
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:05,010
Because you know, here's the deal, right?

252
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,510
All of this skins on all of these,
right?

253
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,990
The mineral content in your
vegetables are right is right there.

254
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,640
Okay? So this isn't what I
call Glam Arama stock. I mean,

255
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:25,000
this is not like, you
know, a gorgeous Boone,

256
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:26,730
y'all or whatever.
I mean,

257
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,720
there's sediment that you will
get when you strain the stock,

258
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,040
and that's great for the kind of
soup making that we're doing, right?

259
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,300
Because it's adding more nutrient density
and it's not this clear concent may

260
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,930
that you're serving to the
queen of England or anything.

261
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,570
So we're okay about it.
It's like a rustic stock.

262
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:51,571
So literally it's like chop throw.

263
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,730
Really. It's like, um,

264
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,750
I think I even did a video where I was
like chopping and like throwing it in the

265
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:04,740
back or whatever. So,
and these are cut. Um,

266
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,690
these are, these are like the hugest
sweet potatoes in the land. I mean,

267
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,080
this is like, should
I go and dog? But, um,

268
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,210
so you could cut this smaller and again,

269
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,340
you're throwing it in all of this.

270
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:22,320
Now if you don't have a
huge stock pot, right? Um,

271
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,610
you could buy all your ingredients,
chop it all up,

272
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,860
take half,
put it in a zip top bag,

273
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,450
put it in your freezer and
make just a half a batch. Okay.

274
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,630
The other thing is if
you have an instant pot,

275
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,880
this cooks really fast in an instant pot
and it also is great in the slow cooker.

276
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,430
The thing about cooking it on
the stove is that you get this,

277
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,900
just checking on this. Hang on. See,

278
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,860
I'm becoming friends with this.
See, we got it at the time. Yeah.

279
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,410
So the thing about,
um,

280
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,690
the broth is that it's sort of like aroma
therapy because really my house smells

281
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:10,560
amazing. Every time I
make it, it's, it does.

282
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:15,480
I don't think it's the allspice berries
and that culmination of the allspice

283
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:19,140
berries and the w whatever,
but it is, it really,

284
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,490
it smells beautiful.

285
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:25,410
The ultimate winter candle and it's like,

286
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:30,411
so you're Starsen now like on the big
proponent of making this broth and in my

287
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:38,241
book there's a Venn Diagram and the
diagram is the middle is the magic mineral

288
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:40,620
broth,
right?

289
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,070
And of this broth you can
make five other really fun.

290
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,220
So he make

291
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,510
this once, right? Then you
can make a Thai coconut broth,

292
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,280
which is amazing. I pay her. Amazing.

293
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,060
Okay. Just Fyi. No, I showed
up today and was like,

294
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,950
let me tell you all the reasons
why I'm obsessed with your book.

295
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,630
We scheduled the event long ago
and I have become a complete diva.

296
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,170
She ever say she's a major.
She's,

297
00:21:09,171 --> 00:21:13,570
she's like on the verge of becoming
the major magic mineral broth. I mean,

298
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,050
I'm going to get a sign, I'm
going to walk around. Right?

299
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:20,290
You didn't tell people about it. Maybe
you could get it from her. Right. So,

300
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,210
and you can make a bone broth out of it.

301
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,790
You can make a beautiful
pasture be foam broth,

302
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:28,310
you can make a chicken bone broth,
you can make a homemade veg, you know,

303
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,800
you can make it,

304
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,800
you can amp it up and make it into a big
immune boosting bone broth with burdoch

305
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:40,600
and ginger and Tumeric.
But once you've got it made in your,

306
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,250
in your freezer,

307
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,990
and I love freezing it in
these kinds of court. And look,

308
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,710
this is the best, the tape, right?

309
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,920
It's like everybody needs tape like
this to make sure that their broth is

310
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,640
marked. So it doesn't turn
into a science experiment.

311
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,640
But how long could you keep it in
the freezer? Two months. Oh No,

312
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,140
this is six months of this
guy to like a long shelf life.

313
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:12,010
And we're not lasted that long.
I've been using it, but right.

314
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,360
So it lasts a long time.
And if you're tight on freezer space,

315
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,080
you can let your broth cool.
And you can let your,

316
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:23,290
you can let it sit on the stove
over night and let it cool.

317
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,140
And because it doesn't
have any beef in it.

318
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,410
So or or animal protein so you can like
let it and you can deep can't it the

319
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,540
next day and you can
put it in zip top bags,

320
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,890
just get all that air out of
it and then just lie it flat.

321
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,260
Um, so that's if you have, if your
real estate challenged, right.

322
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,000
So the whole key is if you've
got broth in your freezer,

323
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:56,320
you have soup in 20 minutes.
That's the, that's the proposition.

324
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,190
And then you can make,
you know,

325
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,630
all of these different soups and then
when you make your soups and there's a

326
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:09,490
whole thing about storage, like once you
make your soup, what are you going to do?

327
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,680
Like back in the day I would make
soup and it would be like, oh my God,

328
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,610
I'm eating the same soup for five days
in a row. I couldn't be more bored.

329
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:22,900
I never want to eat the soup again.
Now when you make soup,

330
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:28,150
you take half of it and eat
and the other half you freeze.

331
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,420
And either this size or in pint size
containers and you mark it and you develop

332
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:41,161
a freezer inventory so that when you come
home at seven or eight or whenever you

333
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:45,980
have soup,
you

334
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,910
have like a variety pack in your freezer.

335
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,200
And based on how easy it is to make,
I mean,

336
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:58,120
I was able to make the broth and two
subs in an afternoon on a Sunday and have

337
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:02,680
done that then like three times and have
just had like eight or nine different

338
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:05,690
soups hanging around in the freezer.
You're exactly right. It's the,

339
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,150
the quickness of it. It tastes like
it's been simmering all day. Right.

340
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:15,320
But it's actually really quick process.
So I think that's where people, um,

341
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,040
we think of soup as being
this long simmering process.

342
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,620
Like when Mike Dad, I made soup
when she made chicken, you know,

343
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,450
her homemade chicken soup. I mean,
it was like a major production,

344
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,050
uh, because she was doing
it all at once and you know,

345
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:36,260
but it really doesn't have to be that way.
So I'm going to check,

346
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,190
I'm doing this like speed flash.

347
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,890
So can I ask a question?

348
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,723
Oh right.

349
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:51,790
If you are making a bone broth and
we're going to get ready to go here in a

350
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,970
minute. Um, if you are
making a bone broth,

351
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,260
you're the reason to let it simmer for
ever and ever and ever with some vinegar

352
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:07,021
in it is to pull all that
collagen out of the bonds.

353
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,880
Right?
But I'm going to give you a shortcut.

354
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,140
You can buy really high quality powdered
Collagen if you don't want to simmer,

355
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,630
you're brought that long and you
want to add that extra boost,

356
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,890
whether it's a bad stock or
it's a bone broth. If you don't,

357
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,700
if you know you don't want to go down
that road. But yeah, that's, it's, it's,

358
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,470
it's getting all that glycogen and college
and out of those bones and you know,

359
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:37,990
bum bras,
amazing guys.

360
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:42,400
If you ever need a reset broth is
really a good, a nice way to go.

361
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,470
More so than juicing really,
at least at this time of year for sure.

362
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,540
So you ready to blend? Yeah, let's see
it. Okay. Cashmere sweaters. Here we come.

363
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,470
All right.
So,

364
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,130
um,
hang on

365
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,020
the off the off. Ah, great. Okay.

366
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,240
So let's see if I can make it to
the blender without burning myself.

367
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,100
I May, I may, but let's see.

368
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,510
Okay. So normally I don't feel
my Vitamix this high, but, um,

369
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,900
since I'm front of the,
in front of a large group of people,

370
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,160
it sounds,
it's like a dramatic moment

371
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,750
and very cover your eyes.

372
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,770
Okay.
Yeah.

373
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,430
Wow.
Okay.

374
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,270
This is why I take a towel.

375
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,160
Are you sure you might get
spit art on your, okay,

376
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,330
so this is puts the cashmere
in the cashmere sweater soup.

377
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,123
Okay.

378
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,450
Now I'm going to put on my glasses so I
can see what I'm doing and I don't hurt

379
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:24,240
anybody.
I'm going to start on variable.

380
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,860
The [inaudible]

381
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,860
so far so good.

382
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,760
Everyone's saying,

383
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,513
oh

384
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,190
gosh, okay. And everybody
saved so far. Okay.

385
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,103
So

386
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,953
now

387
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,560
I've got soup,

388
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:50,561
but not quite right because one of the
most important things about soup is

389
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,650
what does it tastes like at the end?

390
00:28:57,651 --> 00:29:02,651
How many people have made a recipe and
they get to the end and it's sort of like

391
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,790
[inaudible]. Yeah, I definitely right.

392
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,210
And there's that missing thing and
you're like, what is that missing thing?

393
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:12,800
What is it? What is it? What is it?

394
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:17,150
And I spent all this time and money
and whatever on my ingredients and it's

395
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:21,790
still kind of like,
so this is where I'm going to um,

396
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,850
have like three people to come up here
with Jenna and be my taste testers.

397
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,130
Who else wants to come?
Yeah, come on, come on up.

398
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,900
And we are going to,

399
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,653
okay,

400
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,630
we are going to do what
I call a fast check.

401
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,060
So we've got our fat in here.

402
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,270
Now we're going to talk about um,

403
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,470
how you finish off as soup. So, um,

404
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,920
what I am going to do first,
everybody gets a spoon.

405
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,270
Thank you
k.

406
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,823
Now

407
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,650
we've got to go from Yuck to yum,
right?

408
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,520
One is the worst.
I would never eat this.

409
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,870
10 is that involuntary spasm
of vocal delight where you go.

410
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,790
Hmm.
Right.

411
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,780
And I'm just going to see where we are.

412
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,223
Okay.

413
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,300
So I'm not going to say where we are,

414
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,030
but I'm going to have come in,
bring your spoons over.

415
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,200
This is like the magic trick.

416
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:54,860
This is like once you master this
and you have your little cards,

417
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,050
you will apply it to any cooking you do.

418
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,850
SNEAD's salts.
Yes,

419
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,783
yes,

420
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,450
yes. Oh my God. It needs

421
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,760
who's been studying their card?
No,

422
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,530
I actually got real depth to you.

423
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,140
Oh my God. See fast master. I'm not alone.

424
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,220
You're up bass master.
You know? Okay. So here's,

425
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,050
so let me explain what,

426
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,290
what you're tasting to everybody when
something is kind of hanging in the back,

427
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,750
right of the palate.
It's sort of like in Nowheresville,

428
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,033
right?

429
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:53,430
And what salt does is it moves
flavor from the back of the palate.

430
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,230
I care to the front here.
Right?

431
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,130
And because it's so bland,
right?

432
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,630
You can't taste any of the
flavors that are in there.

433
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,670
So we're going to put some salt in.
And the other reason to,

434
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:15,880
now everybody's walking around that
you're going to be walking around with

435
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:20,140
seesaw, that you're in your
bags and Lennon's right,

436
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,011
because the,

437
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:26,011
what the lemon will do is it will an
acid acts like a little Pixar animated

438
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:31,690
character that goes in and brings up,

439
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,220
makes a food brighter,

440
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:38,530
and also is going to bring up all those
spices that are in here that we can't

441
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,460
really taste.
Okay?

442
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,110
So I'm not even gonna ask for
numbers because I know. All right,

443
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,980
it was spot on completely
right. Yeah. Alright, so

444
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,770
I have a Meyer Lemon here,
which I brought from my tree,

445
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,630
so I'm going to give it now.
People are afraid of salt sometimes.

446
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,493
Don't be,

447
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,710
do not be afraid of sea salt with
its 80 plus minerals because again,

448
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,030
you're trying to make food taste good.

449
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:13,031
It's not like having a lot of
fake sodium in processed foods.

450
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:18,910
Whole foods are full of potassium
and potassium and sodium are likened.

451
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,680
Fred and ginger Rogers there, dance
partners, they go together. Okay,

452
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,780
so you're not going to,

453
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,410
you're not going to have a problem with
adding like a keep adding until you're

454
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:32,330
getting where you want to get.
All right,

455
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,550
so I know that I've got to add three.
Rebecca pinches here.

456
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,950
Okay.
And then I know I'm going to add,

457
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,593
okay.

458
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,330
Probably about

459
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:54,090
a two teaspoons of lemon juice.

460
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,410
Little bit more lemon juice.
See, it's like alchemy. It's

461
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,350
the question is how,

462
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,740
how are you making that decision for our
friends on the live stream? Yes. Okay.

463
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:16,270
How are you making that decision?

464
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,250
Because it's still wasn't bright enough
and I knew if I put in a little bit more

465
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:25,510
lemon juice, I get some more
spices coming up at the top.

466
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,440
All right,
now spoons again

467
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,290
and let's see if this has changed it.

468
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,770
We're almost,
we could be on this therapy

469
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,160
still needs more.
More lemon juice to it.

470
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,003
Yup.

471
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,440
Okay. This is a pot of soup.
Pseudo don't, you know,

472
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:06,150
and my broth was not seasoned, right?
So I'm dealing with no seasoning.

473
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,150
Okay.
More lemon juice.

474
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,160
And then I'm going to do one more
thing that I haven't talked about.

475
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,900
My grade B Maple Syrup, I
call it a drape of mape. Okay.

476
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,320
And I'm only going to use
like a little cap fall.

477
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,040
And what that does with the sweet we'll
do is even though the carrots are sweet

478
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:37,050
and there's like a sweet underneath in
the broth because of the sweet potatoes,

479
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,090
a suite can act not just as a,
um,

480
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,760
acting as a sweetener,
but to round out and balance a flavor.

481
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,160
Okay.
One more time.

482
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,900
And are those things necessarily on
your ingredient list or those are just

483
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:58,410
things we should have in our
arsenal there on my ingredients,

484
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:03,411
I always cue you to taste and that you
might want to add something else to it.

485
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,500
This is good. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Okay. Now,

486
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:17,310
one more taste because I'm
going to put a little topper.

487
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,160
So twist our arms.
Okay.

488
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,940
So don't go anywhere because I've
got to put the topper part on.

489
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,730
So we're going to put the Chermoula,

490
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,760
which is a Moroccan pesto and this like
a soup topper or a dollop as I call a

491
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:41,340
dollop of yum is like putting,
um,

492
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,170
a piece of jewelry on a black dress.

493
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,730
Did I get a, wow, did
I, do we hear a yama?

494
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,690
Yum. In voluntary delay.
Involuntary spasm of Vocal Delight,

495
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,370
right? The Chermoula, it's gotten
more acid and more lime in it.

496
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,080
So you all are going to taste this,
but you just saw,

497
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,910
what I really wanted you to experience
is this is what you take into your

498
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,440
kitchen,
right?

499
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Just these little ingredients here
is going to make such a difference.

500
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,760
Nobody should be eating at a
five when you can eat at a 10.

501
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,980
And what you'll do is you will tinker
and I wanted you to have the little cards

502
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:35,820
and it's in the book to all
about fat acid, salty and sweet.

503
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,600
And you just just follow that,
you know,

504
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,750
and also the Chermoula had some olive
oil in it so that your mola was parsley,

505
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,650
mint.
So those really high bright notes and um,

506
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,980
a little bit of sea salt,
lemon juice and olive oil and that's it.

507
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,320
And some spice,
some cumin and Paprika.

508
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,510
But even if you were just
to put, um, just, uh,

509
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,430
and that by the way, the top or you
can use on fish, chicken, whatever.

510
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,090
It's like it's Shimmy Chimichurri
it's a Moroccan Chimichurri.

511
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,170
That's exactly what it
amazingly delicious. So that is,

512
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,410
that's what I have to share
with you today. You are now,

513
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,240
I hear by now w suit masters.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

514
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,240
Yeah. Does anybody have any questions?
We have just a couple more minutes.

515
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:31,843
Yes.

516
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,150
What should be the temp of the
broth when you're cooking? You know,

517
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,080
um,

518
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,080
room temp is fine and even if you've
just taken it out of the freezer and you

519
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:47,980
sort of defrosted it,
it's fine. I mean, again,

520
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,380
it's going to do what it's going to do it,
there's no hard and fast rules.

521
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,160
It might just take you longer to,
exactly. That's it. That's all.

522
00:38:57,161 --> 00:39:01,060
It's can slow the cooking time down,
but room temperature ideal.

523
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:05,920
But if you're doing it on the fly,
go for it. Hard to mess it up,

524
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,810
right? Yeah. Tenure. How do you
know where to get good saffron? Ooh,

525
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,520
okay. So there are a couple
of places at home would,

526
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:18,250
there are lots of places online,
um,

527
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,580
at whole foods or is as uh,
they,

528
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
it's called Spice Lee.
And,

529
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,490
and also I use them as
a resource. Um, they,

530
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:35,410
what's great about them is they
make these small boxes of spices.

531
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,980
So you're not like buying cute and they,

532
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,930
they had beautiful saffron. Yeah,
because you want it, you don't,

533
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,060
and also the thing about saffron,

534
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:51,330
no more in your cooking than ever than
half a teaspoon or else you will get kind

535
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:58,150
of a must musky thing going.

536
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,590
Now you talk about the number of threads.
Yeah. And there's a sweet spot, right?

537
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,780
There's a sweet spot.
Don't pass,

538
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,230
go over tips on animal
protein based breaths. Hmm.

539
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,380
Yeah. And then you can turn it into,
oh, so once you've had your vet,

540
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,050
you know, you can do the magic
mineral broth one of two ways.

541
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,760
You can do it as a vegetable, vegetable
broth. And then if you decide,

542
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:27,880
hey,
I want to make a bone broth,

543
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,370
you can roast your bones,

544
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,970
put it in the magic mineral broth and
let it do its thing for a long time.

545
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,230
Or you can just start with roast,

546
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:45,580
you can do the whole thing, all
your vegetables, roast your bones,

547
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,540
put it in and let it go.
So either way,

548
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,890
the thing about starting as a vegetable
base is that it gives you a little bit

549
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:58,830
more flexibility in terms of what
you might use it for. But anyway,

550
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:03,250
it's fine. It's really easy to take it
from the magic mineral to one of the broth

551
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:04,630
variations.
Yeah.

552
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,030
Is the instapot actually good
for making bone broth? I,

553
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:16,960
um, I think it is just
fine. It really, you know,

554
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:21,961
because basically you're cooking under
pressure and those minerals are like

555
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,900
great. They're coming right out.
It's not, it's there, there, it's,

556
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,330
if we were talking about, no, it's, it's,

557
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:33,070
it's definitely,

558
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,500
you're not losing anything in the
instant pot because it's all like trapped

559
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:41,270
right in there. Right? Yeah. And
it's all trapped right in there. No,

560
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:45,410
it's perfectly fine. All
right. Well, thank you so much.

561
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,490
Thank you personally and on
behalf of of Google. Loved it.

562
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,720
Thank you so much.
