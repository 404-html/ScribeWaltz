00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,830
Good afternoon and welcome
to toxic Google. Today we're
joined by Arlene bloom,

2
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:15,410
celebrated alpinists in biophysical
chemist as a mountaineer.

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,130
She lived the first all
female ascent of Annapurna,

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,550
one of the 14 8,000 meter peaks on Denali.

5
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:24,010
She Co led the first women's team climb.

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,520
She was the first American woman to
attempt Mount Everest and completed the

7
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:31,270
Great Himalaya traverse across Butan,
Nepal and India.

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,560
As a scientist, she's worked as a
tireless advocate for consumer safety.

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,610
Her research has focused on the use of
toxic chemicals in everyday products.

10
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,420
This work has led to bands
and carcinogenic flame
retardants and children's

11
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:45,100
sleepwear and household furniture.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,720
Currently she serves as executive director
of the Green Science Policy Institute

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,010
and as a visiting scholar at UC
Berkeley's department of chemistry today,

14
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:58,660
she will share stories of climbing and
policy from her memoir breaking trail,

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,250
uh, climbers climbing life. Please
join me in welcoming Arlene bloom.

16
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:12,981
Well,

17
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:17,981
it's really great to be here sharing
adventures in both science and mountain

18
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:24,071
climbing because I suspect many of you
have your own adventures and things

19
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:28,660
relating to science and it probably
feels like mountain climbing. Um,

20
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,840
so I'm going to send, some of you might
be looking at me and thinking, you know,

21
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,400
that I seem like a regular person,

22
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:36,980
and how did I start doing
all those crazy things?

23
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,370
So I will start back where it all started.

24
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:43,640
That's my freshmen chemistry
lab at Reed College.

25
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,470
And my chemistry professor
was a young woman.

26
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,550
She was 23.

27
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:54,551
She had a phd from Mit and thought
chemistry was the neatest subject on the

28
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:59,420
planet. There were four girls in my class,
and we all got doctorates in chemistry,

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,400
which says something about the
importance of role models. Um, also,

30
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:08,610
my chemistry lab partner was
a very handsome young man, uh,

31
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,650
from Portland who was a mountain climber
and late one starry night, he said,

32
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,760
do you want to go climb Mount Hood? And
he was very handsome, so I said, sure.

33
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,360
And we drove up to timberline lodge
and he put a big pack on my back.

34
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:26,120
I was from Chicago. I had never done
anything very physical in my life.

35
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:27,710
I started gasping.

36
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:30,230
He later said he didn't think I'd
make it out of the parking lot,

37
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,280
but he was very handsome.

38
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,300
I was very determined and
we got up on the snow.

39
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,360
It was the most beautiful place I'd been.

40
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,580
I fell in love with him and with
mountain climbing and started a life of

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,440
mountains and molecules, or we said
peaks, public policy and public health.

42
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,850
So I continued doing expeditions.
Um,

43
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,500
back in those days,

44
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:58,130
the world's highest mountains had
not been climbed much by women.

45
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:02,560
And indeed when I applied to
go on an expedition to Denali,

46
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,300
the highest mountain in North America,

47
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,010
I was told that women didn't have the
physical strength or emotional stability

48
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,570
to climb mountains like Denali.

49
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,500
So this is the first all women's
expedition on top of Denali,

50
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:17,890
which I took the picture so I'm not in it.
Um,

51
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,530
and so I continue doing mountains and
molecules and then things really changed

52
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,850
on this beautiful mountain in India. Now
isn't, this isn't a stock like a easy,

53
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:32,830
beautiful mountain. When do you all like
to be there? It's nearly 24,000 feet,

54
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:37,831
but it's general snow slopes and
reclining this mountain and got,

55
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,050
um, up to near the top. It was our summit
day and I'm kind of a slow climber.

56
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:48,280
So the others got to the top first.
And when I got to the top,

57
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,360
someone said what happened to
Bruce who had gotten there first?

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,740
And Bruce had walked along
here to what was here,

59
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,820
which was snow,

60
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:02,821
but it was actually a cornice or the
snow is over a rock face and the cornice

61
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:06,130
broke and he fell to his dad.

62
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,850
And Bruce was the country's
leading young rock climber.

63
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:14,650
He had pioneered the hardest droughts
in Yosemite without using p tons.

64
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,230
And it was just unbelievable that he
died on this easy but high mountain in

65
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:24,250
India. So when that happened, I
got very depressed at the time.

66
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:29,251
I was a postdoc at Stanford studying
how proteins fold and that seemed really

67
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:35,341
irrelevant and I wanted to do something
for the environment in Bruce's memory.

68
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,780
And so I went to a professor of Mine
at Berkeley, but I, my Earth Committee,

69
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:45,040
Bruce Ames and said, is there anything
I can do to help the environment?

70
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,000
And he said,
well,

71
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,140
why don't you look at the flame retardants
in children's sleepwear? He said,

72
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:50,980
right now,

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,690
pretty much all the kids in America are
wearing pajamas that are 10% by weight

74
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,780
of flame retardant called brominated Tris.

75
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,130
And I think it might get from
the pajamas into the children.

76
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,950
And it's a cancer causing chemical,
I think.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,450
And so it seemed a little weird to me,
flame retardants.

78
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,910
But I was depressed and I
thought I want to do something.

79
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:17,911
So I found a little girl who'd never
worn interest treated pajamas and we put

80
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:22,870
her in the pajamas and
collected her urine. And the
first morning she wore them,

81
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:27,120
she had tris breakdown products in her
urine and she wore them for three days.

82
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,670
The level of Tris in her urine went up
and she stopped wearing them and it went

83
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:34,300
down. So it meant the truss was
getting into the little girl.

84
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,010
And then we ran a screening test
to see if Tris was a Mutagen,

85
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,900
did it change DNA? And it was one of
the strongest mutagens ever studied.

86
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,460
So this was a huge worry and we thought,
oh my goodness,

87
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:53,140
we need to tell the parents of America
that most of the kids in the country are

88
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:57,040
wearing pajamas that are 10% by weight,

89
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,700
this harmful chemical.

90
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,760
So about that time I got invited to go
to this mountain. Do you know what Matt?

91
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:05,120
And this is,
anybody know

92
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,080
not Everest. It's the highest mountain
in the world. And at that point,

93
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,670
no American woman had ever even had a
chance to try to climb Mount Everest.

94
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,590
So I was like, wow, this is such an
opportunity and I didn't know what to do.

95
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:27,510
Should I stay and write the paper about
the Tris treated pajamas or should I go

96
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:30,450
try to climb Mount Everest?
So I can't help but ask,

97
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,990
how many of you would have stayed and
written the paper about the tryst cheated

98
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:38,690
pajamas? Most of you, how many of
you would've gone to Mount Everest?

99
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,540
Ah, even more. Well, I did both.

100
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,770
So I did go to Mount Everest and when I
was climbing in the Khumbu icefall every

101
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,330
night I write the paper.
And then up in the great western coon

102
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,110
cow, we put stringing
ladders and making her way.

103
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,430
It's the crevices and we
get up steep ice faces.

104
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,470
And every night I keep working on the
paper until I reached my high point.

105
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,440
Here I am at about 24,
five on Everest.

106
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,020
And my summit flag,
um,

107
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,390
the mutants has a petri dish without Tris.

108
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:23,510
There only two colonies cause it's a
Mutagen. And this one you can't see,

109
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,410
it's blowing in the wind.

110
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,830
That's the Tris Petri dish
with many bacterial colonies.

111
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,440
So this was on October of 1976
and we did reach the summit.

112
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:37,940
We were the second American expedition.
Now people reach the summit all the time.

113
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,940
But the first American expedition was 63
and we were the second one in 76 so it

114
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:46,460
was much less, and we had the
whole mountain to ourselves.

115
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,420
Only one expedition on Mount Everest,
which is a little bit different nowadays.

116
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,120
So I finished the paper,

117
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:58,121
I sent it by mail runner to Katmandu and
it was published in science magazine a

118
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,330
couple months later. And if you
read the subtitle of the paper, um,

119
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,310
the main flame retardant in children's
pajamas is a Mutagen and should not be

120
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:14,420
used. Now that's a little bit
of an unusual title for a paper.

121
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,950
If any of you, I'm sure you have,
if you read scientific papers,

122
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,750
they tend to have the same recommendation
at the end almost invariably.

123
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,720
And what's that recommendation at
the end of all scientific papers?

124
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,640
What is the next step?
More studies.

125
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:37,090
And it's always more studies and it
tends not to be something like a chemical

126
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:40,070
should not be used in kids pajamas.

127
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,890
And at the Green Science Posey Institute,

128
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:46,280
our goal is to really help inspire,

129
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,300
encourage scientist to take their
research and tell people what needs to be

130
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,290
done. Because scientists are
the ones who really know,

131
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,770
they understand the science and then
they understand what needs to be done.

132
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,120
And we believe that that science is to
have a responsibility to share their

133
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,370
science in a way that affects change,

134
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:09,570
particularly if they're working on
harmful chemicals. So, and it works.

135
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:12,870
Scientists are very respected
when they speak up. Things happen.

136
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:16,100
This was January of 1977,
uh,

137
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,610
where we called for tourists
not being used in kids pajamas.

138
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,800
And April, 1977 Tris was banned from
kids pajamas just like it should be.

139
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,090
And that was a really good thing because
whole generations of kids only wore it.

140
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,700
It was only used for a couple of years,
which is a very good thing. So however,

141
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,160
when a chemical is banned,

142
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:42,161
there's a big tendency to replace it
with another chemical that's very similar

143
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:46,230
because industry likes to keep processes
as similar as possible. It makes sense.

144
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,150
Um, and if it was funny, I remember
about six months after the Tris ban,

145
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:55,170
I thought, I wonder what they're using
now, if they're still using tourists.

146
00:09:55,171 --> 00:10:00,171
So I remember I rode my bicycle to
penny's downtown Berkeley and I bought 20

147
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:04,950
pairs of pajamas and all different sizes.
And the sales lady just gushed to me,

148
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:06,750
Oh,
you have such a nice big family.

149
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:10,620
And I sort of felt like a super spy with
all my pajamas. And I thought, well,

150
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:13,320
these might make nice shower
presence for my friends.

151
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:17,340
So I just took a little fabric
out of the inseam of each Pajama.

152
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,830
But I actually didn't need to
bother since none of them would.

153
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,390
I have wanted to give for presence.
And then I analyzed what was in them.

154
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,010
And not surprisingly about a third of
them had brominated Tris, you know,

155
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:32,100
cause it takes time for
the market to turn over.

156
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,360
But then nearly two thirds
of them had a new chemical,

157
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:40,230
which turned out to be
chlorinated Tris almost identical.

158
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,060
And so we went,
oh my God.

159
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:47,061
So we ran more immunogenicity tests
and chlorinated Tris also as a Mutagen,

160
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,980
it changed DNA.
And uh,

161
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:54,981
we at another paper in science and
chlorinated Tris was removed from pajamas.

162
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,480
However,

163
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,220
what we didn't know then as it
continued to be used, for example,

164
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:03,060
in furniture,

165
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,020
and in 2005 when a very bad flame
retardant was banned from use in our

166
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:14,370
furniture,
it was replaced with coordinated Tris,

167
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,410
which was then band in 2012 but if any
of you have a couch that was purchased

168
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:24,411
between 2006 in 2012 anyone have a
couch sleep purchased during that time

169
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,430
anyway, there's about a three
quarter chance that your couch,

170
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,210
5% of the weight of the foam
will be chlorinated Tris.

171
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,460
So if you have 20 pounds
of foam in your catch,

172
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:40,170
you have about a pound of this chemical
in, in your couch. Not the best,

173
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,330
but we didn't know it back then.

174
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,360
And back then I thought it was really
time to give women a chance to climb one

175
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:52,560
of the world's highest mountains.
So, um, in the 70s, all the roads,

176
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:56,110
8,000 meter peaks,
there are 14 of them.

177
00:11:56,111 --> 00:12:00,010
The highest mountains in the world had
been climbed by men and no women had

178
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,680
climbed that high. And I thought
women should have a chance. Um,

179
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,950
we've done pretty well on Everest,

180
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,050
so I got a permit for Annapurna on my
way back from Everest and I thought it's

181
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,390
the lowest of the apple.

182
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:17,170
It starts the first of the 8,000 meter
peaks ever climbed among the lowest,

183
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,920
it must be one of the safest and easiest,
but as it turned out,

184
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,990
there wasn't so much
research in those days.

185
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,350
So guess which is the most dangerous of
all the 8,000 meter peaks Annapurna and

186
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,080
which has the highest,

187
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,210
the highest fatality rate
and is considered perhaps
the most difficult to climb.

188
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,590
Anyway, we didn't know
that, uh, but we found out,

189
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,830
so this is our team. Uh, we had 10
climbers, a couple of filmmakers,

190
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,110
base camp manager, we're
all still friends. Um,

191
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,510
there are copies here afterwards.

192
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:56,380
I'm happy to sign copies of Annapurna
or breaking trail for people.

193
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,550
And Anaplan has just been reprinted.
Um,

194
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,860
like September 15th,

195
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:07,030
a CRQ books had been out of business
and the book had been out of press for a

196
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,031
few years.

197
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:10,420
So it's just back in past and we're
all going to be getting together for an

198
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,350
print, a book party next month. And
I have to say when we get together,

199
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:18,490
it feels like we're back on the glacier
and just like it did in a long time ago.

200
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,900
So climbing Annapurna
was incredibly beautiful.

201
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,901
I'll just share a few of the pictures
place that the beauty was extraordinary,

202
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,270
but the king was really tough
and there were huge storms.

203
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,841
The reset,

204
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:39,640
it's such a dangerous mountain is very
high precipitation and these huge snow

205
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:43,300
falls lead to huge avalanches.
Uh,

206
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:46,330
so it was a very dangerous
place ever since I became a mom.

207
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:50,500
I haven't wanted to go there.
Um, but wonderful climbing.

208
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,300
And we did reach the summit. We were
the first women, the first Americans.

209
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,180
We reached the summit
with two sherpa climbers.

210
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,280
We unfurled are flags,
um,

211
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,950
held together with the save the whales
pen and we felt content that we have

212
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:07,150
achieved our goal,

213
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,380
but we tragically lost two of our
team on a second summit attempt.

214
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:16,020
So climbing an opponent, it's a
very, very dangerous thing. Um, I,

215
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,450
I wrote this book and a Pronoun, a
woman's place, which now as I said,

216
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:22,540
it's just been reissued this week.
Um,

217
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,390
and then I wrote another
book breaking trail.

218
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,250
I'm trying to understand how my
childhood and my life had led to both my

219
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:33,220
scientific research and my,
and my mountain climbing.

220
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,160
And when I finished breaking trail,
it was in 2006.

221
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,420
Um,
I'd spent 20 years writing breaking trail.

222
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:45,160
It was like a personal therapy project.

223
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:50,140
It was a lot of work trying to understand
my family and I just finished the book.

224
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:51,130
My daughter was starting,

225
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,480
I thought I really would like
to go back to doing science,

226
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,070
but I hadn't,

227
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,130
I actually stopped being a scientist in
1980 to walk across the whole Himalayan

228
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:05,960
mountain range.
I had a job at UC Berkeley and I said,

229
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:09,410
I want to take a year off to walk
across the Himalayas. And they're like,

230
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:12,560
we have to decide you want your
chemistry job or the Himalayas.

231
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:16,760
So I chose the Himalayas in 1980 and um,

232
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,740
many things intervened. It
was 2006 26 years later. And,

233
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,680
um, when the last sentence of
breaking trail, it is the sun.

234
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,800
Um,
the future is like an unbroken snow slope.

235
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,270
I hope I can find a way to
break trail to a better world,

236
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,690
but I actually really didn't know what
I was going to do because if you haven't

237
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:40,940
done science for 26
years, I thought, well,

238
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,310
maybe like you had a job washing
test students in the lab. You know,

239
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:45,980
I thought I must be
completely out of date,

240
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,520
but that was nine years ago and the
last nine years I have felt every day.

241
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:56,771
Like I was climbing Annapurna like I
been on my life's greatest adventure and

242
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:02,000
it's been really similar because we're
working with a great team of scientists

243
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:04,970
and business people all over the world.

244
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,250
A bunch of people in Google
or on the same team, um,

245
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,310
really working together for healthier
and safer products. And, uh,

246
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,510
it's a, it's a real challenge,
but you know, a real opportunity.

247
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:22,310
So I felt incredibly lucky that I could
not do science for 26 years and then

248
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:27,170
come back and be able to, to, um,
really try to climb this mountain.

249
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,140
And the reason that we're all climbing
this mountain is there is a big problem

250
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,000
and that is, I sometimes ask this
question, I bet you'll know the answer,

251
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,610
but what do you think?

252
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,690
Do you think if you have chemicals in
your shampoo or your toothpaste or your

253
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:48,320
chair, anyone thinks the government
is making sure they're safe for their,

254
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:52,400
your health? You all know not,
but most people do think that.

255
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,410
I used to think that and the government
actually can't because they don't have

256
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:58,310
the authority.

257
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,050
There's only one law about chemicals
before they go out in the world.

258
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,110
Once they're out in the world, you have
a clean air act, the clean water act,

259
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,270
but you can't really bring them back in.

260
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,530
So they only law before they go out in
the world is called the toxic substances

261
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,460
control act.

262
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:18,790
It passed in (970) 660-2000 chemicals
were grandfathered like you're okay and

263
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,210
even a chemical,

264
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:28,211
I guess bestest that kills 10,000 people
a year cannot be controlled by the EPA

265
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,740
and you might say as best as there, as
best as law suits, asbestos is illegal.

266
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,020
Well as best as is not illegal,

267
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:41,050
there are lawsuits and there's a rare
form of cancer called Mesothelioma that's

268
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,150
only associated with this Bestus exposure.

269
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,540
So if you're an asbestos worker or the
specify in his bestest worker and you get

270
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,350
Mesothelioma,
um,

271
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:58,010
you can sue the asbestos industry that
that's the reason for your disease and

272
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:02,730
you'll probably win the case,
but you also will die.

273
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,320
Everybody who gets Mesothelioma dies
and that's not a good way to regulate

274
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:11,790
chemicals. And that's how we regulate
a stasis through lawsuits. By then,

275
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,750
it's really late.
So the 62,000 chemicals,

276
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,460
nobody can do anything about.

277
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,880
There've been 20,000 new
industrial chemicals.

278
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,320
No data is required.
Most of them have no health data.

279
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,360
Two thirds have no data at all.

280
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,560
The EPA has six weeks to try
to show harm with no data.

281
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,420
And if they do show harm,

282
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,220
the company has several years to
try to prove their chemicals. Okay.

283
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:42,690
And they can sell it during those
several years to raise the money for the

284
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:46,650
testing. And once they're out there
selling it, it's really hard to stop it.

285
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,840
So basically, and indeed, I'm going
to speak at the EPA tomorrow. In fact,

286
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:56,160
if anyone, anybody wants to hear my talk,
you can tell them 10 o'clock tomorrow,

287
00:18:56,161 --> 00:19:00,720
I'll be speaking by the post
office, the main EPA building. Um,

288
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,840
ask the EPA, they say we can't even Banis
best us. I mean, they say that it's,

289
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:09,990
it's really a problem.
Another problem. And in fact,

290
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:14,520
the fact this leads to what
two brilliant pediatricians,

291
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:19,521
herb Needleman and Phil Landrigan said
that we are defacto conducting a human

292
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:22,470
toxicological trial,
um,

293
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,500
our children and our children's
children's or the experimental subjects.

294
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,850
So if these chemicals aren't
tested, uh, in any other way,

295
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:37,230
they're tested on us and
that's not a good thing to do.

296
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,120
And they do contribute to increased
rates of cancer, infertility,

297
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,400
neurological impairments.

298
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,360
So another problem is what we call
the regrettable substitution problem.

299
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,750
If after a lot of work,
a chemical is regulated,

300
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,820
the substitute is often the
chemical cousin. For example,

301
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,880
over here we have, you know,
chemistry. We've got Deka,

302
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,890
Bromo 10 bromines die fennel to fennel
rings that could brominated diphenyl

303
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:14,400
ethers. That's an ether bond
with the oxygen in the middle,

304
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,630
and it's persistent,
bioaccumulative and toxic.

305
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,700
So after many years,

306
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:25,640
and it's about 15% of the weight of
the plastic and an average TV is deck

307
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,820
Abramo. Dot. Fennel ether, um,
it's used in fabric, back codings,

308
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:31,800
many uses,
um,

309
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,160
due to its severe persistence,

310
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,440
bioaccumulation and toxicity.

311
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,640
The decade ether has been phased out,
but what's the substitute?

312
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,860
Deca brominated dive fennel ethane.
So there's an ethane bond instead of an,

313
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,450
it's also persistent biocumulative
and appears to be toxic.

314
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,670
So as the decade ether sales go down,

315
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,320
the decade ethane sales go up,
is that a good deal?

316
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,450
Not much improvement. So it's a
discouraging situation, however,

317
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:06,470
everyone's looking depressed but me,
right?

318
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,610
Because I think there are
things that can be done. And,

319
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,500
um,
to solve this problem,

320
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:19,501
we decided to bring together scientists
who cared passionately about this to

321
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:25,540
really focus on what could be done.
And so we have had a series of retreats,

322
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,100
uh, where we invite five
scientists from industry,

323
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,690
five from academia, five from
Ngos, and five from government.

324
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,850
So it's about 20 scientists,
maybe 25.

325
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,980
And at the first retreat we said,
are there certain chemicals,

326
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:49,120
certain chemical families
that we know are harmful,

327
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,600
that can be avoided? A simpler
way of thinking of this? You know,

328
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:56,650
when you think of that 80,000 chemicals,
it sounds kind of daunting. Like, oh,

329
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,350
you can just kind of put your head down
and get poisoned because who can deal

330
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,060
with 80,000 chemicals?

331
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,600
So we came up with six classes and
this is a solution that really invites

332
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,840
action.
And so briefly,

333
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,070
the classes are highly
fluorinated chemicals.

334
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,420
These are standing water repellent
like Scotchgard. Let me just ask,

335
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,390
how many of you knew or know,
and by the way,

336
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:27,250
there's a handout at the back when you
leave that lists all the classes and more

337
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:29,080
information about them.
But let me say,

338
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:34,081
how many of you know that Scotch
Guard is a problem in these chemicals?

339
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,760
Okay. One person who
works in this area, um,

340
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,820
but when people know they
can make better choices,

341
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,510
the next class is the
chlorinated antimicrobials,

342
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:50,740
like Tyco San and triclocarbans and
liquid soaps. Who knew about them?

343
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,210
A couple of people.
Then we have the flame retardants.

344
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,100
Who's heard about the flame returns?
Okay,

345
00:22:57,101 --> 00:23:00,180
you've all heard about the point
returns. Uh, we have this fantasy.

346
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,780
Remember those bits? Funnily water
bottles, ballet, it's organic solvents,

347
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,690
certain metals.
And you look at this list,

348
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:11,440
this is most of the harmful
chemicals in everyday products.

349
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,610
And when you know they're there
and you know what they are,

350
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,480
you can make safe choices
and avoid their use.

351
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:24,550
And even more than that,
we want to ask if they're in that class.

352
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,680
Is this chemical really necessary?

353
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,490
So if the chemical that makes a carpet
standard palette is a highly fluorinated

354
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:38,380
chemical that's quite toxic and
never breaks down for geologic time,

355
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,070
maybe if you'd say to a mom,
you can have a stain repellent carpet,

356
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:44,680
but the chemicals going
into your baby's body.

357
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:49,460
And what would the mom say? Maybe
she might say, it's not worth it.

358
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,440
It's not worth it. Um, so I believe
just asking these questions,

359
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:57,620
do we really need it?
Is it necessary?

360
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,280
You can stop the use of a big chunk of
these chemicals really reduced their use.

361
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,680
And then if you think they're
necessary and they're worth it,

362
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,110
then say is there a safer alternative
and really invest in that safer

363
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:15,680
alternatives. So we've heard about
green chemistry for a very long time.

364
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:20,540
It's been around for 20 years.
A caustic book was written by John Warner,

365
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,190
who's here in Boston and I'm Paula
Nastiness. Um, and it's a great idea.

366
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:29,390
Everybody loves it, but it's not
happening as much as it should.

367
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,750
And so if a kind of function is needed
and you really want that function,

368
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:39,260
then invest in green chemistry,
not in moving to the chemical cousin.

369
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,380
Um, we have a webinar series about these
six classes. They're 15 minute webinars.

370
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,150
There's a flyer in the back. And uh,
when we played the Webinar series,

371
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:51,290
when we ran them live,

372
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,550
about 1200 people signed up and they
were for many of the retailers and

373
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:59,460
manufacturers across the country.
And amazing things happen.

374
00:24:59,461 --> 00:25:03,620
Like there was a Webinar on
antimicrobials and after it was on,

375
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:05,420
someone from target called and said,

376
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,490
we had no idea that we had [inaudible]
sand in our personal Caroline and we're

377
00:25:10,491 --> 00:25:14,060
taking it out.
And they just took it out like right away.

378
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,950
So companies can do that overnight.
For government, it's much, much harder.

379
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:23,180
So if you want to learn more, you can
listen to this webinar series. Um,

380
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,300
purchasers are key manufacturers
of consumer products can
just stop using toxics

381
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,970
in their products.
And that is starting to happen.

382
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,270
Large retailers can say we're not going
to sell a Kia is our leading example.

383
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:41,540
A Kia has it said no more
fluorinated chemicals.

384
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:45,800
Almost all of the six classes a Kia is
not putting in any of their products,

385
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:50,180
which is really inspiring.
And then corporate big buyers can say,

386
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:55,181
we're not going to purchase products with
these harmful classes of chemicals and

387
00:25:56,361 --> 00:26:00,410
consumers. Consumers is a hard group
to reach. They get many messages.

388
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:01,730
They're pretty busy.
Uh,

389
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,880
so we prefer to work with some of the
larger purchasers and manufacturers.

390
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,040
Um, and the actions for manufacturers
is to come together and say,

391
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:16,160
we want disclosure,
we want to know what's in our products.

392
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,290
And then we want to really ask if
harmful chemicals are needed and ask for

393
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:25,490
products without them. And if that's
not possible, invest in Green Chemistry.

394
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,390
So a very cool thing is there's a buyer's
club out in California and Google is a

395
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:36,401
number along with Kaiser and Facebook
and all these companies and they've all

396
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,610
come together with their tens of billions
of dollars of collective purchasing

397
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:44,430
power to say,
we want transparency for manufacturers,

398
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:46,140
we want to know what's in products,

399
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,300
and then we're going to come together
and buy safer products with less toxics.

400
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,250
And that's really exciting.

401
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:57,060
I know I've just spoke at Harvard earlier
today in Harvard says they want to

402
00:26:57,061 --> 00:27:02,000
organize a buyer's club here in the
northeast and see if they can get MIT and

403
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,850
other educational institutions.
Um,

404
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,660
Oberlin's talking about trying to organize
one in the Midwest with a lot of the

405
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,670
small schools there.

406
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,300
So buyer's clubs can be really powerful
and can really move the market. Uh,

407
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,800
yeah. Here's Harvard saying they want
to make a buyer's club targeting harmful

408
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:21,180
chemicals on campus.

409
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,930
So we're going to talk now
about flame retardants.

410
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,110
That's how I started doing all this.

411
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:32,940
And the reason they're there is back
in the 70s standards were made for

412
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:37,320
products, children's sleepwear, furniture,
foam, plastic building, insulation.

413
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,920
And these standards led to
the use of flame retardants.

414
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,250
And nobody asked if the standards provided
a fire safety benefit or asked about

415
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:49,110
the harm of the chemicals.

416
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,360
And with flame retardancy only way to
change things is to change standards.

417
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,260
Changing the chemicals doesn't work.
There's always a chemical cousin.

418
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,740
But if the standards change,
then you no longer need them.

419
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,760
So back to people's couches.

420
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,760
Several of you bought your couches
bef between 2005 and 2012 and you have

421
00:28:13,261 --> 00:28:17,910
chlorinated Tris, the same chemical
that was removed from kids pajamas.

422
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:22,911
And the reason is a California standard
called technical bulletin one one seven.

423
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:26,340
If you go home, you lift the
center Christian of your couch,

424
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:31,341
you'll probably see a label that says
[inaudible] seven and this is not a very

425
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:32,610
effective standard.

426
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:37,611
It requires the foam inside the furniture
to resist a very small flame for 12

427
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:41,460
seconds.
And so if you think about that,

428
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,150
what happens if you drop a candle
on your couch? What Burns first,

429
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,900
the fabric.
And when the fabric burns,

430
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:52,410
you have a large flame and then the
foam burns and two or three seconds.

431
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,060
And when foe, when foam has is treated
with flame retardants and it burns,

432
00:28:57,061 --> 00:29:00,510
it gives off a lot more
smoke and toxic gases.

433
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:05,890
And what kills people in fires is such
smoke and toxic gases and so technical

434
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:07,201
and,
and one,

435
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:12,180
one seven has been around since 1975
and there's no data to show that it's

436
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:14,070
provided any fire safety,

437
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,940
but it is instead ended up that the
toxic flame retardant chemicals are,

438
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,120
and most Americans bodies the chemical.

439
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,710
So if you brought your couch before 2004,
anybody have a couch from before?

440
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:31,230
2004.
Okay,

441
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,260
well those who are worse because they
all have a very harmful chemical.

442
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,290
Um,
the pent up,

443
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,460
it's pent up brominated
[inaudible] ether a big mouthful,

444
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,840
but the top picture up there
is polybrominated by fennel,

445
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:54,130
a PBB or a PCB.
Those are toxic.

446
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,060
They're persistent. Pcbs, you know,
are not good molecules. If you,

447
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:02,800
instead of having a covalent bond,
you have an ether bond between your rings,

448
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,420
then you have a polybrominated
by fennel ether.

449
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,890
And if you burn or oxidize,
that becomes another ether bond.

450
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:13,840
This is a dioxin and a few man.

451
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,620
So this is the flame retardant that was
used from 1975 until 2004 to meet to be

452
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,150
one,
one seven.

453
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:27,390
It's happily instructure between the
Dayaks and between the dioxin and a PCB.

454
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,940
Not a great molecule to have in your
home, in your dust, in your body.

455
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,310
And in fact,
we had a group of Berkeley students,

456
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:40,420
summer students studying chemistry
and policy at Berkeley collecting foam

457
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,340
samples and getting them analyzed.

458
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,730
And one of the professors said that the
students should not touch that PBD flame

459
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:52,660
retardant except wearing full gear
and a fume hood. And I'm like,

460
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,400
but it's in everybody's furniture.
So that is an unfortunate thing.

461
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,283
Um,

462
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,330
and almost all the use of the chemical
has been in North America in large part

463
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:07,630
to meet this standard, but it has
traveled the world as a global pollutant.

464
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,200
So when we make these sorts of
chemicals, they go all over. Um,

465
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,250
there are hundreds of animal studies
showing a neurological and reproductive

466
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:22,000
harm from the Penta chemical.
And about two weeks ago,

467
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:27,001
studies were finalized showing it
indeed does cause cancer in humans.

468
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,800
If pregnant women have higher levels,

469
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,990
it takes them longer to become pregnant.
Um,

470
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,400
and during critical windows
of brain development,

471
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:41,401
their thyroid hormones are altered so
that their children will have lower birth

472
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:46,990
weight, impaired attention, uh,
poor coordination and lowered Iq.

473
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:51,790
So the average California Chubb has lost
four to five Iq points just from this

474
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:56,791
flame retardant Penta and economist
calculated and $9 billion loss in earning

475
00:31:57,911 --> 00:32:02,020
power in California children
due to Iq loss from Penta,

476
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,740
which is one of the many,
many harms from this chemical.

477
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,070
So how does the chemical end up in us?
Um,

478
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,310
it's a semi volatile
organic chemical and SVOC.

479
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:20,170
So it's continually coming out
of furniture, dropping into dust.

480
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,330
And if you say eat a sandwich,
you have some dust on your fingers,

481
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:30,000
you eat a little bit of dust, the
Penta ends up inside of you. Um,

482
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,080
children,
toddlers who chrome,

483
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:36,520
the dust put their hands in their mass
tend to have three to five times higher

484
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,890
levels than their parents,
which is not a good thing.

485
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:44,360
And cats have up to a hundred times
higher level compared to humans.

486
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:48,860
Why would cats have such a high level
because of their grooming behavior?

487
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,780
So as I said, no fire safety
benefits, serious harm,

488
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,260
uh, we came to realize
that TB one, one seven,

489
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:05,210
the standard could be changed to a
fabric standard that could be met without

490
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:07,940
flame retardants that would
stop the fire in the fabric.

491
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,300
So they didn't need to be any flame
retardants and you could have increased by

492
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:15,640
your safety. Does that sound
like a good idea? So we had, uh,

493
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,650
a bill with Senator Mark Leno there in
front and our bill was supported by the

494
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,990
furniture industry who didn't like
putting toxics in their furniture,

495
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,450
foam industry fabric industry.

496
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,900
Firefighters supported it because they
knew the flame retardants didn't help and

497
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,010
could cause cancer.
Everybody supported it,

498
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,710
but these bills never passed.

499
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,160
And the reason was Californians
for fire safety and they,

500
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,310
this is part of a one week long $7 million
advertising campaign when one of the

501
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:54,350
bills almost passed and they
were very determined, I believe,

502
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:57,170
to keep their market share
and selling flame retardants.

503
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,040
And the legislators tended
to vote for California.

504
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:05,270
It's for fire safety rather
than business firefighters,

505
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:06,980
scientists and the public.

506
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,490
And this went on for about six years and
I go to hearings where the lobbyist for

507
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:17,420
the flame retardant
industry would be saying,

508
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,260
it's not sound science to say there's
harm from any flame retardants.

509
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:26,000
They've all been evaluated by the
EPA evaluated. What did they find?

510
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,080
They don't say that part.

511
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:32,890
So we decided to put together all the
science and in a big meeting in San

512
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,730
Antonio,
we developed the San Antonio Statement.

513
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:40,190
It was signed by a couple
of hundred scientists.

514
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,750
It documented the harm and the lack
of benefit of the flame retardants.

515
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:50,170
And it was published in environmental
health perspectives back in 2010 and still

516
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:54,320
nothing much happened. Um,
I would sort of joke, I,

517
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,000
when I went to parties,

518
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:59,660
people would ask me what I did and I'd
start telling the whole story of the

519
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:02,840
toxic flame retardants and
everybody's furniture, no benefit,

520
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,170
and get all wound up. And after a
while they'd go, I have to leave now.

521
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,200
And I'd see them on the other side
of the room talking to someone else.

522
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,970
And I thought,
oh my goodness,

523
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,900
am I going to spend my whole life being
this woman who rants at parties about

524
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:18,380
filing returns? You know, Stonyfield
just a little crack powder ish.

525
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,410
And then things changed
when the Chicago Tribune,

526
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,450
I had pitched this to many,
many reporters,

527
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:30,760
but the Chicago Tribune
did a fantastic job. Uh,

528
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,490
this is the first front page,
the headline,

529
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:36,590
a deceptive campaign by industry,

530
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:41,591
but flame retardants into our homes and
into our bodies and the chemicals didn't

531
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:43,680
even work as promised.

532
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,990
And this story documents,
it's kind of what I'd been,

533
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,610
all these hearings I had been to,

534
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:55,530
there was awfully sis burn doctor who'd
won the Dalai Lama compassion award.

535
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,950
And he was always talking
about some poor burned baby.

536
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,560
It was this horrific death,

537
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:04,650
this baby at all because there were no
flame returns in her crib and it was

538
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:05,484
horrible.

539
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,030
And it never really connected to what
the subject of the legislation was.

540
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:12,300
It made no sense.

541
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:16,110
But he would do it and then everybody
would be very emotional and it would give

542
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:20,250
the legislators sort of covered to vote
no on these new standards that would

543
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,540
increase by her safety.

544
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,440
And so these reporters kind of research
the hearings and they listened to four

545
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:32,010
times. He talked about the burn baby and
they realized they were all different.

546
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,390
And then they confronted him
and he said, well, really?

547
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,130
I was just kind of talking.
Um,

548
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,210
but there was a baby and he gave them
a picture of a baby and they tracked it

549
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:47,940
down and this baby died for a
completely different reason.

550
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,190
And the mother was really unhappy.
And the doctor said,

551
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:57,960
well, we're not under oath in
California so I can say what I want.

552
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,560
And ultimately it was learned that he was
paid $240,000 for his testimony and he

553
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,790
stopped being a doctor. So,
but real scandal, you know,

554
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,580
in the series, if you want to read
them, you can read playing with fire.

555
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,830
They came in second for the Pulitzer.

556
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:20,280
They won all these environmental
awards and everything changed.

557
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,940
So instead of me being this person,
but parties ranting,

558
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,830
suddenly Dick Durbin was
ranting in the Senate. Uh,

559
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,730
there were hearings in the Senate.
Um,

560
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,660
this really empowered Jerry Brown,
our governor.

561
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,700
That series came out in May,
2012 a month later,

562
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,910
Jerry Brown directed the state agencies
to revise our standards so that we could

563
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:47,700
reduce and eliminate
dangerous flame returns.

564
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:52,110
And at the same time increase fire safety.
So

565
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,460
this made a huge difference.
And thanks to this, uh,

566
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,090
we now have a new standard.

567
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,860
You can go out and buy a couch
that meets TB one one seven, 2013.

568
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,890
Um,
and as you see your couch,

569
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:11,970
we'll have a label on it and it says
either contains flame returns or contains

570
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:16,050
no flame retardants. So you,
you can have that choice.

571
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,270
Um, foam, plastic building
insulation. Unfortunately,

572
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:25,230
the materials that make buildings
energy efficient, polystyrene, poly,

573
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:26,220
urethane and puff,

574
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,280
probably ISO Cyani rate contain the
worst flame retardants and there's no

575
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:32,131
benefit.

576
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:37,131
You think about foam below the
cement below the grade down there,

577
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,820
it has flame retardants,
there's no oxygen,

578
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,710
there is no fuel source and nonetheless
flame retardants are required.

579
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,930
So we are now and it's really hard
been trying to change the international

580
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:54,931
building code to allow foam plastic
without flame retardants where there is no

581
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:59,300
fire safety benefit. The big
hearing is September 30th. Um,

582
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,620
and it's really a struggle because the
same three companies who make the flame

583
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:08,580
retardants are adamantly wanting to
keep them in our building installation.

584
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,100
Um, if you want to reduce your
own flame retardant exposure, uh,

585
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:18,520
it's not a bad time to buy new furniture
or to swap out the foam in your

586
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:23,521
furniture for safer from or else
to vacuum with a hepa filter,

587
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:28,330
wet mop and hand wash.
It all reduces exposure to dust.

588
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,670
Um, so I'm going to go now through the
rest of the classes much more quickly.

589
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,080
A highly fluorinated chemicals I
think are the worst of the worst.

590
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,110
The carbon fluorine bond is the
strongest in the periodic table.

591
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:48,340
Um, it really does not
break for geologic time.

592
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:52,330
So this class of chemicals are
very oil and water repellent,

593
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,320
but they never break down.
They just accumulate on the planet.

594
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:02,190
And the chemical that was mostly used
was something called the Pfoa or c eight,

595
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,300
eight carbons surrounded by fluorines.

596
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,320
And this is a book stain resistant
nonstick, waterproof and lethal,

597
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,510
the hidden dangers of ca.

598
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:19,110
And it's very interesting because it
tells the story of the harm of c eight and

599
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,580
a story that what happened was [inaudible]
was used in the making of tough fun.

600
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,660
Um,

601
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,660
dupont dumped the ca in the water
supplies and communities in Ohio and West

602
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,640
Virginia. Uh, people got sick, they sued,

603
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:44,740
they measured the levels in thousands
of people who had very high level.

604
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:48,610
And then they looked at health effects.
And among those people, this is again,

605
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:53,410
human health effects. They found
higher levels of two kinds of cancer,

606
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:57,280
cholesterol, thyroid disease,
all those health conditions.

607
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,310
And those people sued dupont.

608
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,730
And the first hearing is today.

609
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,340
So this happened a long time ago.

610
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:11,341
Today is the first lawsuit I read about
it and dupont had known since the 60s

611
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:16,450
about the harm of c eight.
They had been monitoring the water supply,

612
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,310
knew it was in the water,

613
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:23,080
but they claimed that the levels they
didn't think were that high and they said,

614
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,850
and if the chemical had
really been harmful,

615
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:29,560
but government would have regulated
it, that was their argument. So,

616
00:41:29,561 --> 00:41:31,930
um,
we'll see what happens with these trials.

617
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,540
But dupont is actually spun
off all this liability.

618
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,760
They have a new company called Kenmore's
that has the liability and makes these

619
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:44,330
chemicals. So it's not clear
what the outcome will be,

620
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,890
but you can follow it online.
Where are these chemicals found?

621
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,750
Food contact paper.
If paper is oil and grease resistant,

622
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:56,510
like pizza boxes,
microwave popcorn bags,

623
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:01,190
it very likely has highly
fluorinated chemicals. Cosmetics,

624
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,810
not many cosmetics,

625
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:07,811
but several thousand of them do
contain fluorinated chemicals.

626
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:12,200
It will say flouro on the package.
Outdoor equipment,

627
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:16,800
carpets, clothing, furniture. Um,

628
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,510
and so c eight has been
phased out in 2015.

629
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:23,750
It took 50 years from when
the harm was first discovered.

630
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:29,110
And what is the replacement for ca
[inaudible] six carbons with fluorines all

631
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:33,320
around.
It's equally persistent.

632
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,580
It doesn't break down for geologic time.
That's millions of years,

633
00:42:37,581 --> 00:42:39,530
possibly longer than humanity.

634
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:44,120
And the world is like filling up with
it and there's nowhere for it to go.

635
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:47,760
It's in water, increasing
levels in human blood. Um,

636
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,620
still at ground to Shane, a professor
at Harvard who studies it says,

637
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:56,570
it seems to accumulate in the brain and
do we really want see a in our brains?

638
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:02,340
Um, so we did a Madrid statement
on highly fluorinated chemicals. I,

639
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:07,410
it was signed by 230 scientists published
last May 1st and environmental health

640
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:11,420
perspectives. Nobody much had
heard about these chemicals. They,

641
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,390
I always say did not get the
attention they had deserved.

642
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:19,250
So we document the potential for harm,
a roadmap to prevent further harm.

643
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,310
And it got a lot of press.

644
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:27,170
Nick Christoff wrote about chemicals
in your popcorn, national geographic,

645
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,440
these chemicals and pizza boxes
and carpeting last forever.

646
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,330
My favorite massive group of scientist
thinks you shouldn't use nonstick from

647
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,380
modern farmer,

648
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,120
but there were hundreds of press hits
and the world is slowly starting to find

649
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:43,400
out about nonstick.
Um,

650
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,340
a lot of brands are eliminating it.

651
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:49,520
Starting with h and m
Levi's has phased it out.

652
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,140
Now these brands don't talk about it
because if, you know, if they say, well,

653
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,200
you're, you know, your new products
don't have this toxic chemical,

654
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:01,460
what does that say about your old products
so that they don't tend to advertise

655
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:02,780
it,
but it is happening.

656
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:07,450
This is in the public domain that all
these companies are facing it out. Um,

657
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,570
what can be done?
Um,

658
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:15,610
Google really wants safe building for
their employees and they're very active

659
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:20,600
and working for transparency and
they're part of the buyer's club.

660
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:25,220
And we're working with the buyers club
in California to give them lists of

661
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,100
products with and without
fluorinated chemicals.

662
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:32,550
This is from a database called Pharos,
but there's a lot more chemicals in this.

663
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:35,310
So if you want any of these products,

664
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,850
you can pick the ones with and
without the fluorinated chemicals.

665
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,360
And the hope is to really move
the market towards without,

666
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:45,750
when people know the extent of the harm.

667
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:48,210
And the fact like with every,
you know,

668
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,690
the chemical industry is saying
a c six is perfectly fine,

669
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,210
but they're 40 forms of c six,

670
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,860
we took 50 years to ban one form
of [inaudible] band phase out.

671
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,970
So with 40 forms of c six,
it's just not going to happen.

672
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,940
But purchasers can move to safer products.

673
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,110
So all of these products can
contain fluorinated chemicals.

674
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,370
So try not to buy nonstick
and if you can avoid it.

675
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,223
Um,

676
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,580
the last class I'm going to talk about
in some detail is the chlorinated

677
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:25,260
antimicrobials.
That's Tyco San and try called carbon.

678
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,930
They're used, for
example, in liquid soaps.

679
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:31,650
It turns out the best thing to
wash your hands is soap and water.

680
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:37,100
You really having bacteria on
your hands is a good thing. Um,

681
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,950
triclose and kills all the bacteria.
I've heard people say, well,

682
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:43,230
maybe in a hospital setting it's useful,

683
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,150
but Kaiser has banded about six years ago.
Um,

684
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,940
now that's pure al. You
know, alcohol is fine.

685
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:55,941
It's try close and the antimicrobial
try called carbon and it's really sad.

686
00:45:56,731 --> 00:46:01,170
But the FDA back, you can
see, get that pointer.

687
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,450
In 1974,

688
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,480
the FDA wrote a monograph on the lack
of efficacy and safety of Trico sand and

689
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:15,330
that report's still has not been
finalized and published. Meanwhile,

690
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,920
back in 94,

691
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,280
there was a handful of
uses for antimicrobials
because they were considered

692
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:25,830
pharmaceuticals and they were
removed from that category.

693
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:30,510
And now there's 2000 uses.
So antimicrobials,

694
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:32,000
microbiome,
Tracko centric,

695
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:36,030
oh carbon or no fast number
of products and building.

696
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,230
They're in everything, you know,
doorknobs, counters, seals, walls.

697
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,210
But the fact is they don't
provide a benefit. They have
huge potential for harm.

698
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,460
They reach out of products, they're not
taken out by sewage treatment plants.

699
00:46:50,461 --> 00:46:53,640
So they end up in our water supply there.

700
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,400
One of the top 10 water contaminants,

701
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,350
they'd been found to be
an endocrine disruptor.

702
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,990
And tragically there in
most women's breast milk,

703
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:05,370
which is not where you want these
chemicals. And the fact is, once again,

704
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,750
we don't need them. They're
not needed. And so again,

705
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:14,751
purchasers can pick products without um,

706
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,980
Tracko San and try called carbon.

707
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,570
And Google is really leading the
way in these kinds of efforts.

708
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,970
Consumer products, um,
cosmetics because um,

709
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:31,030
trackless San is actually considered
a pesticide. It has to be labeled.

710
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,040
And so when you buy things,

711
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:38,041
you can look Colgate total
toothpaste 0.05% triclose San,

712
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:42,190
uh, I heard crest is advertising that
it doesn't contain, tried go San.

713
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:45,430
So that's a good sign. But when
you're buying personal care products,

714
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:49,180
you can just look on the label
cleaning products, apparel,

715
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,720
all these products you can
choose with and without Tyco sin

716
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,540
so quickly. The other classes
I won't go into in much detail,

717
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:02,920
bespoke phenols many of you probably
go out of your way to get water bottles

718
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,590
that say this fennel a free,
anybody do that?

719
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:12,090
So I have a friend who studies them as
toxicologists that UC Davis who likes to

720
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:15,340
shock people.
So he goes around saying,

721
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,290
I really liked my water bottle to say
it's got this fennel a in it because that

722
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:25,291
way I know that doesn't have this funnel
s in it and that the substitute for bis

723
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:29,680
fennel a is often bis fennel
s which he thinks is worse.

724
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,910
So with the class concept,
we don't want bisphenol a to z.

725
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,600
Do you really need something like
this panel? Do you need that function?

726
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:41,500
Is it worth it? Is it necessary?
And if it's worth it and necessary,

727
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,880
then let's really invest
in Green Chemistry and come
up with something entirely

728
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:50,230
different that meets this function
without that potential for toxicity.

729
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,250
Similarly,
thalates that also helps soften plastics.

730
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,210
There's a tendency to go from one
harmful thal eight to the next.

731
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:03,130
So let's find green chemistry solutions
when we need it. And in many cases,

732
00:49:03,131 --> 00:49:04,180
let's not use it.

733
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:10,170
Solvents hydrocarbon coronated
oxygenated solvent's often are harmful.

734
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,000
Many times you can use water.

735
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,720
One way to reduce your own
exposure is to limit dry cleaning.

736
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:19,810
And when you bring things back from
the dry cleaners to air them out,

737
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,340
there's aqueous dry cleaning so
you can use water instead. Um,

738
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,370
and you can find aqueous dry cleaners.
Well,

739
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:31,150
we can own for a long time
about the harm of these metals.

740
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,810
And still there's paints
with letting them,

741
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:37,990
it's still worth checking,
reducing the levels.

742
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,820
So what's happening, uh,
retailers are changing.

743
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:47,320
Many are selling furniture without
flame retardants, a home depot,

744
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:51,460
Lowe's and Menards or phasing
out validates and flooring. Um,

745
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,560
I got an email near the middle,

746
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,460
middle of June that made me really
happy from a major us retailer,

747
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:58,570
but I can't mention their name.

748
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:03,070
People don't like dimension and they
said starting July 1st we're not selling

749
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,730
anything with flame retardants
or stain repellents.

750
00:50:06,731 --> 00:50:09,400
We're not offering any
stain repellent treatments.

751
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,180
And this is a loss of a profit center
for us because we make money with these

752
00:50:13,181 --> 00:50:15,520
stain repellent treatments,
but it's the right thing to do.

753
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,330
So if you go to and try to get a stain
repellent treatment and they won't sell

754
00:50:19,331 --> 00:50:22,750
it to you, you'll know
this is the retailer. Um,

755
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,130
Akia is really the star this year,

756
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,960
a Kia who we've been working
with for quite a while and said,

757
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:33,650
no fluorinated chemicals in
any of our products worldwide.

758
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,790
There are substitutes,
they said for shower curtains,

759
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,200
raincoats and umbrellas,

760
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,490
but that they have a nice tablecloth
that needs grease resistance that doesn't

761
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:46,220
exist without fluorinated chemicals.

762
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,500
So they're going to stop
selling the tablecloth,

763
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,180
which is pretty principled
and pretty neat. So, um,

764
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,170
and a Kia has banned chemicals
and all of the six classes.

765
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:02,450
So based on all that, we have come
up with a very bold statement.

766
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:07,750
We believe that the youth of some or all
of the six classes containing chemicals

767
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:13,511
of concern can be reduced in consumer
products by 50% in five years.

768
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:19,100
And I think that's possible. Just asking
the, do you need it? Question. You know,

769
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:23,840
a Kia has done this.
One large American retailers has done it.

770
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,940
Um, we're having a meeting in
December with the furniture,

771
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:31,580
commercial furniture industry,
the big companies,

772
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,600
and they're interested in stopping
the use of all antimicrobials,

773
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,960
flame retardants and stain
repellents in office furniture.

774
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,800
That is a big deal. And if they do,
that's going to really reduce the use.

775
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:48,290
So I'm really optimistic.
Um,

776
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:51,950
our goal is to take good science
and use it for good policy.

777
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:56,000
And now I'm saying you can use good
science for good purchasing and the

778
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:58,790
purchasing can be even
more powerful than policy.

779
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:04,160
So we send out newsletters once a
month with updates on all of this.

780
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:07,430
If you'd like to be on our
newsletter list in the back there,

781
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:11,690
please leave your card or sign your name.
Um,

782
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:13,650
give me your card.
Uh,

783
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,740
and I'm happy to autograph books if you'd
like a copy of an printer or breaking

784
00:52:18,741 --> 00:52:21,050
trail out there, both here. Um,

785
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:26,051
so I'm optimistic that by reducing
the use of harmful chemical classes,

786
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,930
we can all have a healthier world.
So thank you.

787
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,290
Yeah.

788
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:38,320
So if there are any questions,
please come to the mix.

789
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,970
Hi. Thank you. Um,

790
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,460
so if I go to whole foods and I go to the
cleaning aisle and they have all these

791
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:45,770
things that say they're safe and green,
are they,

792
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,650
I kind of looked for trackless San,
I don't know pop. They're probably,

793
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,620
but I think it's good to take a
quick scan of the ingredients.

794
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,510
Hi. Um, I have a question about
the a, the c six in the Ca,

795
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:02,750
the chemicals that don't break
down and geological time.

796
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:05,510
Does that also make them less reactive?

797
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:11,210
So would they be less likely to cause
harm and biological? Um, you know,

798
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:12,380
chemical reactions

799
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:16,510
because that would be nice. No, right.

800
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:20,890
Unfortunately they appear to cause a
lot of harm and the mechanisms aren't so

801
00:53:20,891 --> 00:53:21,724
well knowing

802
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,470
well they might be like
catalyst or something.

803
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,350
Yeah. Are they fit in? They
fit into, we don't know why,

804
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:33,150
but there's this unique human epi
study of these, I think, I don't know,

805
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:36,430
20,000 people who've been exposed,
um,

806
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,740
in southern Ohio and West Virginia where
they came up with that whole list of

807
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:43,650
health problems that's on the slide.
And in fact,

808
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:46,410
that's what the lawsuit
today are starting.

809
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,250
So it's pretty unusual to have
that much human, you know,

810
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:53,730
cause all these chemicals, by
the way, to say the six classes,

811
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,670
the harm is irrefutable.
You know,

812
00:53:56,671 --> 00:54:01,260
there are things like genetically modified
foods are real worried but there's

813
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:05,940
not a lot of data to show him these.
What we went for is what we,

814
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,970
the things where there
was no question of harm.

815
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,690
We didn't have to do any more experiments.

816
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,960
So the fluorinated chemicals
that have been studied,

817
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,260
there's vast numbers of animal studies
and then inadvertently the very sad quote

818
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:23,040
human studies where human populations
are exposed and you find human health

819
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:23,874
problems.

820
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,880
So I think the harm from ca
is knowing from c six there,

821
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,690
40 kinds. It's going to be
really hard to prove things.

822
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:38,040
I mean the fact that it ends up in the
brain is not a good sign and they are

823
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:42,030
biologically active.
Okay.

824
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:45,630
Well I do hope that you
will sign our mailing list.

825
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:50,631
You can go to green science policy.org
and click on fluorinated chemicals and

826
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:55,140
learn more or click on six classes
and learn about the six classes.

827
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,720
And, um, if I said,

828
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:00,210
if you sign our mailing list
or you can send me an email

829
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:05,211
arlene@greensciencepolicy.org and we'll
write you once a month and update you on

830
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:07,410
what's happening.

831
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,210
I think saying in five years we're going
to reduce the use of these chemicals by

832
00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:17,211
50% in consumer products is a high goal.

833
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:20,490
But it feels to me just like Annapurna,
you know,

834
00:55:20,491 --> 00:55:22,800
that seemed pretty impossible.

835
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:27,090
One of the world's highest mountain that
had never been climbed by a woman or an

836
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,080
American that,
you know,

837
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:32,850
we were able to get a team together
and reach the summit of Annapurna.

838
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:37,470
And so to me, this feels just
the same, um, a great team.

839
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:40,170
If you sign our mailing list, you'll
be part of the team, you know,

840
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,570
working with scientists,
people in industry,

841
00:55:42,571 --> 00:55:46,140
government and NGOs and we
all see the same summit.

842
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,910
It's a healthier world. And I think,
you know, moving step by step,

843
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,090
we can all achieve that goal.
So thank you.

844
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:57,960
Okay.
