1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,430
Hey, so today, welcome to this
talk at Google with just late.

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,260
So I'm Dan Carey and joining me as Jess.
Hi.

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,520
She is a partner at sequoia capital.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,550
Previously she was at Google as a product
manager and then Pauline bear Polyvore

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,120
which you joined as a product manager.

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,750
You were then VP of product honorary
cofounder and ultimately Ceo, uh,

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,220
led the company through the acquisition
with Yahoo in 2015. You were fortunate.

8
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:37,190
It's 40 under 40 list clamorous top
3,535 women in tech and a whole bunch of

9
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:41,660
other things. So welcome. Thanks
for, uh, thanks for coming.
Thanks for having me. So,

10
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:46,510
uh, so what's it like to
be back at Google? Oh,

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,620
totally.

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,370
Yeah, it's trippy. It's very surreal.

13
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:52,970
I used to sit in this building
and like 2000 and a 2005,

14
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:57,230
I think when it first opened. Um, yeah,
it's just, it's kind of cool to be back.

15
00:00:57,231 --> 00:01:01,230
I learned a lot of things, uh,
on this campus. I was an APM, uh,

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,430
and I worked on frugal,
which was product search back in the day.

17
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,430
And then I asked for after shorts did
there I stayed at, I moved to Google maps,

18
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:10,340
but this was when Google maps was a
desktop product and we did not have

19
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:12,650
smartphones. So, um, it's
a pretty long time ago.

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,870
So you joining Polyvore right from Google.
Right.

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,360
And it was kind of a weird journey,
right?

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,450
Like it wasn't normal circumstances for
leaving Google and joining a company.

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,880
Yeah. Yeah. I would say it was a
little bit of an unusual path. Um,

24
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:29,260
so I remember I was sitting
at Google in my, uh,

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,640
in my office with another Google
maps pm and he was like, hey,

26
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:36,690
you should check out this site called
Polyvore that my friend is working on.

27
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:39,480
And I was like, okay. I checked it out and
I was like, oh my God, this is amazing.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:39,990
Um,

29
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,890
what Polyvore does is it lets you mix
and match and create outfits out of real

30
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:46,380
products and you can create those
outfits and share them with your friends.

31
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:50,130
It's kind of like a fashion magazine
created by community of women all over the

32
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:54,060
world, but everything is
shockable. Um, so I fell in love.

33
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:58,650
I started using it two or three hours a
night and just couldn't get it out of my

34
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,530
brain. And then, uh, because
that was a pm I wrote,

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,750
I had a lot of complaints
about the product,

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,410
so I wrote them all down and I sent
an email to the cofounder and I,

37
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:09,210
one of the founders and I was
like, Hey, I love this product.

38
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,090
I think there's going to be huge, but
can you fix this, this, this, this, this,

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,390
and here are some suggestions
for how to fix them. Um,

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,300
and then he wrote back and said,
hey, these are all great suggestions.

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,840
Why don't you just come work here yourself
and fix, fix all this stuff yourself.

42
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,320
Um, and so that's what ended up
happening and that's how I ended up at,

43
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,000
at Polyvore.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,160
So you filed a bug report
and got them assigned to you?

45
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,360
Yeah,
I do.

46
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,680
It's Polyvore is fantastic and awful.
My, my wife used to work at Polyvore, uh,

47
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,070
enjoying Polyvore for the same reason,
uh,

48
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,940
because she needed to pay for all
this stuff she was buying on Polyvore.

49
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,130
So it's a very good site.

50
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,020
So what was it about [inaudible] that
caught your interest when you're using it?

51
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,980
What clicked?
What made you so passionate about it?

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,860
So, uh, before getting into computer
science and Google and all that,

53
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:56,680
my original goal in life was
to be a comic book artist.

54
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,940
And because I love to draw a that just
up not working out because my parents

55
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:04,560
won't let me go to art school because
they're Asian and they thought it wasn't

56
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,520
like a legitimate career. Um, but
what drew me into Polyvore was, um,

57
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,710
the ability to self express.
I mean it's, it's, uh,

58
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,530
it was a creative tool ultimately,

59
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,400
and it was kind of at the intersection
of art and fashion and technology.

60
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,260
So I thought,
wow.

61
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,830
How often does something like that happen
where you pulls together a lot of your

62
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:28,470
passions? Uh, it's something that's
at the very earliest stage. Uh,

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,030
so if I went there,
even though there's not a lot there,

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,980
I would get the
opportunity to learn a ton,

65
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,780
which is actually reminded
me of the APM program. Um,

66
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,650
I got into the APM program thinking
like, okay, I don't know how to do,

67
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't even know what a pm is,

68
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:44,230
but at least if I come here to
Google I'll grow and I'll learn.

69
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,590
Um, and you know, maybe maybe
it'll work, maybe it won't.

70
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:51,430
But at least I would
challenge myself and grow.

71
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,940
And that's exactly how I felt about
polygraphs. Like there's nothing here. Uh,

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,860
maybe I can volunteer and step up
and do some of those things and I'll,

73
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:00,850
I'll grow a lot.
And that's what ended up happening.

74
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,710
I actually kept volunteering to do
various different things at the company.

75
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:06,191
You know,
I was like,

76
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:08,740
Oh let me write the blogs since we
don't have a marketing person or let me

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,220
answer the phone when the advertisers
call, cause we don't have a sales team.

78
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,370
And then what ended up happening
is I would try that job,

79
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,950
learn just enough to be
a little bit dangerous,

80
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:21,100
like just enough and then figure out
it was a very good at it and then hire

81
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,130
someone else to do it.
But having done it myself,

82
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:28,840
I was a little bit better at finding
the right person to hire. And then, uh,

83
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,280
that person would inevitably
end up reporting to me
because I was the only sort

84
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,660
of business person at the time. And then
we just kept growing and eventually a,

85
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,630
all the departments were reporting into
me except for engineering and my title

86
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:43,900
was still VP of product.
And uh,

87
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,990
at that point we decided to make
the switch where I became CEO.

88
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,130
So very unusual path to sort of running
a company. But that, that, that was my,

89
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,520
yeah,

90
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,770
that's really interesting.
And in that time,

91
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:57,780
was there anything that you
came across it were like,

92
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,310
no way could never do this huge mistake.
Way Too dangerous at this?

93
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,480
Yeah. That was like everyday, I mean,
start ups are incredibly hard, right?

94
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,400
It's um, every day is a new
obstacle and I definitely felt like,

95
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,640
especially since I was growing quickly
and the company was growing every time I

96
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:21,610
felt like, okay, I've got it now.
I figured out how to do my job.

97
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:23,290
I think I might've figured it out.
Finally,

98
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,220
that feeling would like inevitably only
lasts for a brief moment because then

99
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,130
the company would get bigger and then
everything would change all over again.

100
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,270
You people,
you know,

101
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:35,560
the process that was the perfect for
communicating with 20 people broke at 50

102
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,180
people.
And then as we got that right,

103
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:40,330
it broke again at 75 and then
at 125 and then, you know,

104
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,870
it's just things when you're growing,
things just keep changing.

105
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:48,250
You just kind of have to get used
to the feeling of constantly, um,

106
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,150
not knowing what you're doing or not,
not knowing how to do something,

107
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,150
which is essentially the same thing as
learning. Yeah. I'm CICI kind of see,

108
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:58,160
I've always felt like you should seek
out that feeling and you should try to

109
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,980
find that really nauseous, horrible
feeling of I don't know what I'm doing.

110
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,840
Cause that's how, you know,
you're getting career growth.

111
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,710
And then was there anything ball,

112
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:09,980
you were a kind of the CEO of Polyvore
that kept you up at night. I mean,

113
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:11,550
what was your biggest worry about it?
Oh yeah.

114
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,570
Yeah. So specifically, um, I mean
there were so many things, uh,

115
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,620
you know, product market
fit, you know, did,

116
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:22,740
where we was our product serving
the users while we were very,

117
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:24,930
very community driven and
then figuring out like,

118
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:28,530
is the market that we're in big enough?
Do we have to evolve the product? Uh,

119
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,250
lots of hiring, lots of
the, especially later,

120
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:36,710
all the issues became very much
related to like people. Um,

121
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,350
so did I have the right VP of sales that
I have the right VP of engineering or

122
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,131
these people clicking?

123
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:44,190
I mean there were so many moments at
number strangely they all felt very

124
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:47,580
existential cause I think when you're the,
when you're running the company,

125
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,440
even your identity becomes intertwined
with the company's identity and every

126
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:55,440
bump in the road feels
very, very personal. Um,

127
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:58,740
which is part of what makes
a startups so hard. Yeah.

128
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,230
So I was kind of stalking you on your
sequoia page before this and you talk

129
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,670
about grit a little bit.

130
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,520
You talked about being able to create
delight and overcome obstacles. Um,

131
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,970
just kind of sticking with it.

132
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,530
I'm sure everything wasn't always like
on the up and up and it's a startup.

133
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,480
So there's tons of times where
you feel like you're dying. Yeah.

134
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,000
So any advice for people in
terms of developing grit?

135
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,940
Is it something that's an eight and you
just kind of have to express it or is it

136
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:23,774
something that you prefer?

137
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,020
Yeah, I definitely think, you
know, some people start out,

138
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,100
there's this concept of distance travel.

139
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,730
Like when you're looking at say an
interview candidate and you look at their

140
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:34,730
resume. I think if you look
at the distance traveled,

141
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,640
like where did they come from
and how far have they gone?

142
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,730
That's actually a good metric.
That's how I really think about grit.

143
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,050
Like if you started at an easier place
in life, um, like more privileged,

144
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,130
maybe your distance,

145
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:50,780
you know that your distance traveled might
actually be less than someone who had

146
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,050
none of the, the privilege.
So I think sometimes your,

147
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,120
your upbringing and where you came from,

148
00:07:56,121 --> 00:08:00,620
that original distance travel to get to
where you are actually increases your

149
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:02,980
grid sort of naturally like could
be your family circumstances,

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,660
could be your socioeconomic classes.
But on top of that,

151
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:08,180
I think grit is something you
actually develop over time.

152
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,220
And the way you do that is you push
yourself to travel further. Um,

153
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,940
you get used to just forcing
yourself to do things that are hard,

154
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,750
that feel bad, that that nauseous feeling
of learning that I was talking about.

155
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,840
Um, and that's actually what increases
your grit because grid is really,

156
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,130
it's really pain tolerance.

157
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,660
So if you can put yourself into those
painful situations and the challenges

158
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:33,350
rather than kind of taking the
easy route or coasting, um, that's,

159
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:34,640
I think how you develop grit.

160
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:38,270
And I think grit is one of the most
important ingredients in startup founders

161
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:42,530
because it's just so hard. You don't
control so many of your circumstances.

162
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,150
You don't control what
happens with the market.

163
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,100
You can't control the fundraising climate.

164
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:49,550
You can't control what all the people
on your team, you know, decide to do,

165
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:53,360
or if there's a competitor that comes
along. So you really have to have grit.

166
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:54,860
You have to practice at getting it,

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,350
getting stronger and stronger to
put up with all the ups and downs.

168
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,950
So is that something you look for now
that you're on the other side of that

169
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,720
funding table now that you're at sequoia?

170
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,820
Yeah, absolutely. Um, you know,

171
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,350
I think a combination of Grit and passion,
right?

172
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:14,310
Like to get through the pain of just
the basics of starting a company. Um,

173
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,260
you either have to really care about the
problem and be mission oriented or you

174
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,580
have to have that natural grip,

175
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,230
but there's has to be
something driving you right.

176
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:26,760
Because on average it takes I think eight
or nine years to build a company from

177
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:30,960
ground zero to a successful outcome, like
an exit or large Mna. And so, you know,

178
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,260
to imagining that amount of time,

179
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,590
like it has to be something you probably
care about. One of the other great to,

180
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:38,730
to power through all the problems.

181
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,250
Yeah.

182
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,040
One of the other things that you mentioned
on your sequoia profiling and a few

183
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,300
other interviews that I've seen with you,

184
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,010
cause you talk about focusing on one thing
and doing it really, really well. Yeah.

185
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,980
That was one of the core values
that Polyvore yeah. Do one thing.

186
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,750
So how has that one thing kind of change?

187
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:56,560
I'm sure being a want to be comic
book artist being a PM at Google,

188
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,680
being at Polyvore and all those
different roles, it's changed a lot.

189
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:00,940
How do you kind of pick that one thing?

190
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,570
Yeah. You know, I,

191
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,810
I think when I was a a pm one of my
strengths with was I was actually empathy

192
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,600
was being able to think, you know, what
does the user want in this situation?

193
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:16,601
Like as they're printing out their driving
directions before Google back we used

194
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:18,890
to print driving directions
cause remember this is a desktop.

195
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,900
What are they thinking, what do they want?
And that empathy helps guide a lot of,

196
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:28,820
you know, product decisions.
Right. But then as you become,
you know, then I became,

197
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,470
you know,
uh,

198
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,230
I transitioned and at Polyvore I
started answering the phones for,

199
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,300
for sales calls. Then the
empathy was applied to, you know,

200
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:39,590
what does the advertiser won?

201
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:42,890
And like trying to research and understand
enough about the advertising industry

202
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:45,350
to imagine, okay, it's not
just this is an advertiser.

203
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,770
The person that I'm talking
to is an account manager.

204
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,940
At a large agency who was trying to
advance their career and wants to do good

205
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:53,870
for this client.

206
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,440
The client probably thinks this way and
be able to take all of that and figure

207
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:58,940
out what the right ad product was.

208
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,450
Then as the company got large and I
started managing people, it was, you know,

209
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,460
what am I,
what does my team care about?

210
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:06,560
Like where is this person in their career?

211
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,100
How do they feel about the current
state of the company, their team,

212
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,690
their career goals? And now that I'm on
the investor side, again that applies to,

213
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:15,190
you know,

214
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,140
try and understand the founder and the
trying to understand the market that

215
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:21,890
they're in, the users that they're
serving, what do they care about? Right.

216
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:24,750
So I would say that, you
know, first I thought, oh my,

217
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,640
my one skill is actually product design
and product mention that I looked a

218
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:31,700
little bit deeper and I realized it was
probably something to do with empathy.

219
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,683
Yeah.

220
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,100
Do you think that's just the
key for consumer businesses?

221
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:38,190
Is it empathy kind of across the board?
Is that the thing to nail?

222
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,770
Not necessarily because I think,
you know,

223
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:45,180
with the help of amazing user researchers
who can tell you like these are your

224
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:49,290
three personas of, you know, the
three types of users that you're,

225
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,950
you're solving for. Like you can actually,
if you're an analytical, smart person,

226
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,140
if you have that data given to you,
rather than having to imagine it,

227
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,120
you can still be a
fantastic product designer.

228
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,390
I think the key with great consumer design
is product design is creating like a,

229
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,470
a kernel of, of delight, right?

230
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:11,380
Like it's not enough to have
a product that like does,

231
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,310
solves a problem and sort of
does what people ask you for.

232
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,780
You have to go way above and beyond and
there has to be this moment of like,

233
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,790
Whoa,
I didn't expect that.

234
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:26,791
Or that was amazing or unexpected to the
point where you would bother to tell a

235
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:31,660
friend, right? Like you're like, a
good example is actually snapchat.

236
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:35,470
When you take your, when you do the
filters and you do one that's uh,

237
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,570
the face swap,
right?

238
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,550
That's really clever because you didn't
expect that inside some sort of chat

239
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:45,440
app. And then it's inherently
viral. Like I'll, I'll,

240
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:49,390
I will sit there and show it to my friend,
like we'll do it together.

241
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,060
And that's a moment of
word of mouth delight.

242
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:56,800
So I think the secret to great
consumer products is you have to,

243
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,050
you have to grow, right? And you, you're
growing. If you're growing organically,

244
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:02,350
it's because people are talking about you.

245
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,860
And the way to get people to talk about
your product is to be, do something,

246
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,320
something above and beyond. That's
really, really delightful. So,

247
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,340
so that's how I think about it.

248
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,370
So what do you think the most important
thing was that you worked at while

249
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:13,030
you're at Polyvore?

250
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,240
And I'm wondering if you knew how
important it was at the time. Yeah,

251
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,130
I don't think I did. Um, but it
turned out to be culture. Uh,

252
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,500
in the beginning when you're starting,
you, the product you build as a, as a CEO,

253
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:30,790
as a founder, is the product, the
service that is delivered to your users.

254
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,070
But then as the company grows,

255
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,090
you know your attention actually you
get further and further away from the

256
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:41,110
product because you know, you're, you're
not the one writing the code anymore.

257
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,820
You're not the one making
the day to day decisions.

258
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,990
You're a managing through a team and the
product actually starts to become the

259
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,030
company and the organization.

260
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,100
And the same way that you instrument
your product and measure, you know,

261
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,930
is this feature working or not your
ab test or you carefully, you know,

262
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,910
you put Google analytics on everything.

263
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,060
You actually have to do the same thing
with your company and your team to make

264
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:08,020
sure it's healthy. Like are you measuring
your employee engagement scores?

265
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,980
Are People happy and thriving?
Like his code being checked in?

266
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:14,800
Like you actually have to pay a lot of
attention to how people work together.

267
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,300
And most importantly, the
culture is basically the
operating system. So it's, it's,

268
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:23,530
it's about building the
operating system for the company,

269
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,970
which is the culture.
And then all those,

270
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:28,690
those metrics and things that you monitor,
uh, and the larger, larger you'd get,

271
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:31,900
the more and more important it becomes
because you need people to be aligned on

272
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:32,734
how to behave.

273
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,050
And that's something I've always
thought was really great about Google.

274
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:36,860
I always felt like,
um,

275
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,240
there was a clear culture when I was here
and it was measured and defined and um,

276
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,430
really cared about and thrived and
everyone knew what the googly men,

277
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,400
and I think that's part of why
Google has always been successful.

278
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,980
So did you just for Google culture,
bring it over to

279
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,813
Polly?

280
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,710
No, actually I'd made them. There
are a lot of, is the same, right?

281
00:14:56,711 --> 00:15:00,180
Like the empowering engineers
to make decisions, um,

282
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,970
and powering product people and trying
to try to be a little bit more bottoms up

283
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:08,080
or at least that's how it felt when
I was here. I copied a lot of that.

284
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,930
But the one thing I did not copy was the,
um,

285
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,960
and I think you can't at a startup is
you have to be very cognizant that you're

286
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,460
on a clock and you're running
out of money all the time.

287
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,500
Google has one of the best business
models in the world, right?

288
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:28,060
And is basically adwords and adsense are
printing money in the basement to power

289
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,070
all kinds of amazing project.
Now that's you know,

290
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:33,520
evolve to android or many
other business lines.

291
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:36,320
But that luxury of um,

292
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,820
oh we need to just purely focused on,
you know,

293
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,470
building the right product and not
have to worry too much about revenue,

294
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,300
which was the case.
It's probably changed since then.

295
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:48,190
But that was certainly
the case when I was here.

296
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:53,430
I could not copy that over to a startup
or you had 24 months of runway and it's

297
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:56,140
not even just the runway of money,
you're funding.

298
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,690
It's also the runway of people's
time and patients, right.

299
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,040
If you're underpaying your team and see,
cause you know,

300
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,490
they're not a Google or Facebook,

301
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,170
then you have to make sure they
see like a path to success.

302
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:11,920
So I think being much
more conscious about, uh,

303
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,120
spend as well as urgency

304
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,260
and people's time was,
was more,

305
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:20,860
it was a big part of our culture that
I would say it was different than the

306
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:23,620
Google. So a couple of
things I, I keep hearing is,

307
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,940
is learning people caring or these
are the things that motivated you,

308
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,080
has kind of your motivation been the
same across being an APM, being a CEO,

309
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,240
being at Yahoo,
being at sequoia,

310
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,690
uh, personal motivation. Um, I think I
care about two things. One is impact.

311
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:40,310
Like what kind of impact are you leaving,

312
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:41,750
what sort of debt are
you making the universe.

313
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:46,250
And the second is just personal growth and
learning, right? I found that if, again,

314
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,660
if you optimize for learning,

315
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,920
then you think about success and failure
in a different way because sometimes

316
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:55,430
you learn the most in the
toughest situations where
you are most likely to fail.

317
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,760
So if you reframe that conversation
into my learning or not learning and

318
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:00,620
learning is success,
then it kind of,

319
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,690
you stopped thinking about whether you
were getting the a or the sea or whether,

320
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,640
you know, you sold for, you know,
$1 billion or you know, 100 million.

321
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,820
Like you just, you just stop
thinking purely about the outcome,

322
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:16,370
which makes you afraid sometimes cause
you don't want to risk what you already

323
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:20,060
have. Um, and the other
is impact. Uh, you know,

324
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:23,570
one of the things that I really loved
about Polyvore was it was as it very

325
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:25,370
democratizing effect on fashion,

326
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
it was about letting a community of
women all around the world say, no,

327
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:32,930
this is what I think is stylish and I
don't want to listen to, I don't know,

328
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,750
the fashion magazines telling me this
is what you're supposed to look like.

329
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:40,190
And for the women who used it, it was
very empowering. And that allowed them to,

330
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,401
you know,

331
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:43,130
when you feel like you look a little
better than you might feel a little more

332
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:46,710
confident. And we had so many girls
from school age to call, you know,

333
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,870
girls applying to college,

334
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,460
told women just talking about
how it helped their confidence.

335
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:52,790
So for me that was always
part of the mission. Um,

336
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,920
and then part of the mission
for me at sequoia is, you know,

337
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,970
venture is probably 7% women,
uh,

338
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,050
and that I think has downstream impacts
on the percent of women who start

339
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:05,940
companies and uh,

340
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,230
the percent of innovation that happens
in fields targeted at women. Uh,

341
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,750
and then that affects exacts and you know,
all the way down the chain.

342
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,640
So I thought,
you know,

343
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,560
maybe if I could move into venture and
change the ratio just a little bit and

344
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:23,070
help backs, you know, amazing
founders, both men and women,

345
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:26,880
but I might be a little bit more
inclined to understand some of the female

346
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:31,290
founders who are working on products
targeted at women, which I was at 1.2.

347
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,900
So those are, that's
the, on the impact side.

348
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,890
How are you approaching your role
as a partner at sequoia? Now?

349
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,410
I know it's still relatively new,
but anything where you're like,

350
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,510
this is what I'm going to do.
I'm going to be focused on this,

351
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:46,240
I'm going to provide this value to
people. So I think my, you know, the,

352
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,160
the investors that do the
best are probably the ones
that are actually helpful

353
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,910
to their founders. So I've tried to focus
on like where can I be really helpful.

354
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,600
Um, and some of those areas are in
consumer, right? Because that's,

355
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,010
that was what I did that my whole
career has been mostly in consumer. Um,

356
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:06,320
I'm also starting to look at some spaces
like a ar and VR and robotics. Um,

357
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,390
I spent a lot of time meeting
female founders as well. Um,

358
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,910
I've been looking at
direct to consumer brands,

359
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,590
which is fairly new for venture and for
sequoia. Uh, yeah, those are, those are,

360
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:21,591
those are some of the areas that I tend
to focus on in any kind of niche fields

361
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:26,460
that you're kind of geeking out about,
excited about. I'm pretty excited about.

362
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,230
Um, robotics. I think now that computer,
you know, computer vision is of age,

363
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:32,970
computers can see,
uh,

364
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,600
you're seeing a lot more tech
moving out of like the phone.

365
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,940
Like instead of it being in a
little screen or on your desktop,

366
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:43,470
it's like moving out into the physical
world. Um, and maybe the first,

367
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,550
basically it's sort of the intersection
of, it's all the tech that,

368
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,810
that we know from the Internet and
moving from pure bits into the world of,

369
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,510
of atoms, right? So

370
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,820
maybe the earliest version of this
might be something like door dash or

371
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:03,060
instacart where a or Google
shopping express, right?

372
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:07,980
Where it's not just software
and you know, the, on my bugs,

373
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:11,520
okay, it's like software and then, oh my
God, all the problems of the real world,

374
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:16,521
like the driver was drunk or miss
the delivery or the food's cold.

375
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:19,530
Like these are not things that
software can catch. Right.

376
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:23,490
Which is why I think a lot
of these companies are run
by a hardcore operational

377
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:27,030
people who just know how to grind it out
and have a lot of grit because it's not

378
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:28,860
beautiful,
elegant software anymore.

379
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,700
And I think you're going to see more and
more of that as we move to fields like

380
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:37,110
robotics and more automation in the
real world. You realize that, you know,

381
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,660
you have to combine fashion and
robotics and I guess Google maps.

382
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,520
I have not seen that pitch yet, but that'd
be pretty cool. I'm sure we'll come up.

383
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,160
So before I ask you
about the most important

384
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,800
thing that you're working on at poly fort,

385
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,730
but what's the most important
thing that you're working on today,

386
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,803
if you're aware of it?

387
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,040
The most important thing,
um,

388
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,490
I think at the end of the day, like
Sequoia Sequoia's mission is to, you know,

389
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,870
help daring founders build
really legendary companies.

390
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:11,130
So the most important thing is to
find those people and help them. Um,

391
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,570
I've done two investments.

392
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,930
I spent a lot of time with those
founders and you know, one is a seed,

393
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:18,810
one is a series B because
I'm on the early stage team,

394
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:23,520
we do everything from a c to
two, basically series B, um,

395
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,680
is every day is just trying to
figure out how to help them. Um,

396
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,270
and then the other pieces,
you know,

397
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:33,150
I've been working on various initiatives
to try to figure out how to help female

398
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:36,660
founders more. So there'll be more
than that probably in a few weeks.

399
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,360
Okay. Yeah. I know you've been
doing a lot of talks lately, um,

400
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,580
conference couple weeks
ago for women in tech.

401
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,180
Yeah. Yeah. I love going to those events.
It's so amazing to see all the, um,

402
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,720
all the activity and the excitement.

403
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,970
So when you were running a startup, when
you're talking about product market fit,

404
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:54,590
how did you know when you nailed it?
I mean,

405
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:57,010
delight won't give you product market fit,
it'll give you vitality.

406
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,990
How do you know what you're actually
providing that value early on?

407
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,220
Um, so I actually do
think that when you found,

408
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:07,410
when you found delight and
you found product market fit,

409
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:10,310
that you do start to see organic growth.
Um,

410
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,140
you do start to see that that
word of mouth, you're right.

411
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:16,870
There are moments where you're
seeing that word of mouth for, uh,

412
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,541
other reasons.

413
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:22,560
Like maybe you had a really viral
piece of content on your platforms.

414
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:25,650
You have to be able to figure
out how to distinguish that.

415
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,070
But generally I think organic growth means
that you've found product market fit.

416
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,353
Um,

417
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,560
the question though is how large of a
market is it that you're working on and

418
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,131
how,
you know,

419
00:22:35,131 --> 00:22:40,131
you can have product market fit for some
very tiny sliver of a market a or for a

420
00:22:40,411 --> 00:22:43,290
particular user and you have to be able
to distinguish like is that enough?

421
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,730
Is this enough for a
sustainable company or not mean?

422
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,520
I think that's the biggest lesson that
I've learned on the venture side is you

423
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:54,510
know, I can assess the match
between maybe your user an product,

424
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,560
but thinking through the market structure
like is this a good market to be in?

425
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,410
Are there tons and tons
of competitors that are,

426
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,490
are the platform companies most likely
going to dominate the space in the long

427
00:23:05,491 --> 00:23:07,470
run and therefore your
tech will be commoditized.

428
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,280
Thinking through those kinds of issues
and market size and market structure has

429
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:13,110
had sort of been one
of the biggest lessons.

430
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,450
Any tips for learning that stuff other
than joining a VC firm and thinking about

431
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,640
40 or 80 hours a week?

432
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,880
Yeah.
You know,

433
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:24,860
I think this is maybe something I didn't
do enough of as a PM is competitive

434
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:29,030
analysis, right? Like look through
what other people are like, you know,

435
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:31,490
you should always see, figure out
what's great about your product,

436
00:23:31,491 --> 00:23:35,390
but you also have to think like,
when I say delight,

437
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,900
when you're going above and
beyond what people expect,

438
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,470
what people expect is set by what's
available in the market, right?

439
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:46,640
So just because you solve their problem
doesn't mean you're going to win if

440
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:49,580
there's another product that also
solves their problem but has much better

441
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,020
distribution than you do,
right?

442
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,490
So you really have to think about that
line of what people expect being set

443
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,470
partly by competitors,
right?

444
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,970
I'm a good example of this is when all
the smartphones came out right before

445
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:06,650
that, like blackberry was the best
phone, right? It had a keyboard,

446
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:10,640
you could do your email, and then when the
iPhone came out, I mean, that was just,

447
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,790
I don't need a keyboard. Like, I
can browse the entire web with us.

448
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:17,570
It just reset everyone's
expectations. And it took, you know,

449
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:20,120
a lot of companies died during that
because they didn't catch up and they were

450
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:21,680
just focused on what they were doing.
Right.

451
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:24,170
That you have to think about who
else is innovating out there,

452
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,004
what are they doing?

453
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,370
So I would say spending a lot of time
on competitive analysis and then also

454
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:32,720
thinking through, here's where we are
now, where will we be in five years?

455
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,840
Where will my competitors
be in five years? And then
skate towards that, you know,

456
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,300
skate to where the puck is going,
not to where it is right now.

457
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,980
So just getting really good at
thinking about that, um, is, is, uh,

458
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,300
is I think the most important thing

459
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,660
and I'm guessing that advice holds
true for CEOs for basically everybody.

460
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,650
Yes. I think that matters a lot for
founders and CEOs as well. Yeah.

461
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,120
The stage matter.
They're like,

462
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:58,930
shit early stage startup founders be
worrying about their competitors or should

463
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:01,690
they just be focused on delight
and value like you said.

464
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,470
Um,
I think you still have to think about it.

465
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:07,590
It's nothing that you spend
like everyday obsessing about.

466
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,740
Like I don't think you can be constantly
looking behind you in the, you know,

467
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:11,610
looking in the rear mirror,

468
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,270
but you have to know what the baseline
is and you have to have a sense and

469
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:15,961
that's part of it,

470
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:20,550
part of how you set your strategy and
then you just focus on getting to that

471
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:24,090
point. But you have to make sure you
do those checks periodically. You know,

472
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,960
maybe it could be once a
year if you're smaller,

473
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,520
it could be every quarter of your larger,

474
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,000
but it is really
important to have that to,

475
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,240
to check the expectations of the
market, uh, on a regular basis.

476
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:38,790
But focus most of your
time on actual execution.

477
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,710
Really curious what you think about, um,
you know, the early stages of community.

478
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:46,070
Obviously Polyvore had a
really good community. Um, I
had a good company culture.

479
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,233
Um,

480
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,690
do you see differences between how you
seed culture internally a company and how

481
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:52,340
you see that in a product?

482
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,580
Hmm. You know, I think it,

483
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:01,350
I think it's best if they're
somewhat aligned because if they are,

484
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:04,960
then I think it comes across
more authentically. Um,

485
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,510
for the community.
What we did is we,

486
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,110
the same way that we cared
about our individual employees,

487
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:16,570
we cared about our community.
When we would have a community event,

488
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,800
we would apply to do a few things well
rather than having a massive conference

489
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:23,920
where we couldn't really spend time
with people and we'd also just have the

490
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:26,950
money for that. We chose to
have smaller meetups, right?

491
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:31,951
So we sent like got 20 people that
come to New York fashion week with us.

492
00:26:32,861 --> 00:26:34,840
Then we through a beautiful
breakfast for them,

493
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,670
we took a couple of them to some shows.

494
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:39,730
You tried to give them the
tickets instead of us going, um,

495
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,100
we owe our community manager and went
through all their Polyvore profiles and

496
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:48,390
picked out items at products that they
had used regular like regularly and then

497
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:51,990
bought them. We got our
advertisers to just give us swag,

498
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:54,210
like free stuff and coupons
and shoes or whatever.

499
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,190
We pack them into these bags and the,

500
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,850
I remember we had these breakfasts and
like some of these women would open it

501
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,880
and just start crying because they were
so happy and it was just the immense

502
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,020
delight was amazing and it was just
such a bonding moment for those teams.

503
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:10,080
And then they went on to talk, you know,
to the other committee members about it.

504
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,070
So it was great for us.
You know,

505
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,880
it's hard to measure whether that was
really like an Roi positive investment.

506
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,470
We just sometimes how
people think about can you,

507
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,180
but I think that's just not the
right way to think about it.

508
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,770
Like think about Zappos,
right?

509
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:24,180
Zappos has an amazing reputation
and that's because of,

510
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,770
you know,
good customer service,

511
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:30,771
but also like those stories of like the
woman who wrote in or was on a call with

512
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:36,720
a Zappos person for an hour
talking about how, you know,

513
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,020
she had like a whole series of life
events and therefore needed to return the

514
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:42,660
shoes and they'd let her return it and
then they cut counsel her for like an

515
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,850
hour and then gave her something for,
I don't know,

516
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:46,860
I don't even remember the Lord anymore,
but that's the point.

517
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,180
All I remember is there was a story and
it was amazing and that's part of what

518
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:53,820
cemented, I think the,
uh, the brand for Zappos.

519
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,930
Do you think people are focusing founders
as much as they should on culture

520
00:27:57,931 --> 00:27:58,530
today?

521
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:03,450
Do you see a lot of these
really big scalable networks
that don't really have an

522
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:04,284
identity to them?

523
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,310
Yeah. Um, I think,

524
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,640
I think some,

525
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,230
sometimes it's easy to just be obsessed
with winning and not think about

526
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:18,200
culture.
And that's fine if you're always winning.

527
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,830
Like people love to work at companies that
are winning. That's a huge part of it.

528
00:28:21,831 --> 00:28:23,840
I can't just have an amazing
culture and then like, you know,

529
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:26,150
driver company into the ground,
you have to have both.

530
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,770
But I think some companies have prioritize
the winning over over that treating

531
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:35,771
people well and that works as long
as you're on that upward trajectory.

532
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:39,230
But as soon as the going gets tough,
um,

533
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,870
I think people start to look around
and question and they're like,

534
00:28:41,871 --> 00:28:46,310
why am I like the, I mean treated
horribly and then they start to, to bail.

535
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:51,311
So part of culture and creating that
right operating system is it smooths out

536
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:55,360
the bumps in the road,
right? Because you, you,

537
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,420
when the going gets tough, which it
almost always does at a startup, right?

538
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,960
There's always going to be
something that goes wrong. Um,

539
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,700
you get to keep your team together for
just a little bit long and they have a

540
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:10,400
little bit more loyalty,
a little bit more patience.

541
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,460
And that extends that runway that I was
talking about because it's not just a

542
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,440
runway of money and not
being able to pay people.

543
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,850
It's a runway is a runway of people's
patients, right? Like, as an employee,

544
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:24,230
you have a million things to choose, uh,
as a job, right? Like, if you're great,

545
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:25,340
you can,
you can come work at Google,

546
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:27,920
you can come work at Facebook
and then you get paid more or to,

547
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,970
but they choose to work at your startup
and you have to figure out like,

548
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,290
how do you,

549
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,260
how do you get that little bit of extra
loyalty when the going gets tough?

550
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:37,820
So I think culture is very,
very important.

551
00:29:37,821 --> 00:29:42,580
And I think in general a silicon
valley does focused on culture. Um,

552
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,320
and every kind of culture there's,
you know,

553
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:48,510
they're co essentially the culture is, it
can be extreme. That's fine. Right? Um,

554
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:53,290
you know, yeah. But I think you treating,
treating employees right, it's really,

555
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,370
really important.
Yeah.

556
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,210
So if you weren't in Tuck your,
I'll say your daughter Sequoia,

557
00:29:58,211 --> 00:30:01,420
let's say you're banned from
the tech industry forever.

558
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,780
Are you gonna go become a comic
book artist? Like what would you do?

559
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,800
That's a good question.
Uh,

560
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,830
I don't think I would make
it as a comic book artist.

561
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:15,790
I don't think I'm talented enough, but
I might give it a try anyway. Yeah.

562
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,430
Or professional costs
player. Oh really? Yeah.

563
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,050
Can we touch on that? Because
that's, that's divergent. Ah,

564
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,810
yeah.
Well I,

565
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:30,490
I I love anime and I cos
play now like rarely.

566
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:33,160
But yeah, that was pretty fun. Yeah.

567
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,080
So you were at Yahoo for a bit of time.

568
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,800
You were at Polyvore for a very long time.
You were at Google for a bit of time.

569
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,700
Um, those are three companies
and relatively similar spaces,

570
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:46,660
at least parts of them.

571
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,410
Okay.

572
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,630
What was it like working
across them over time?

573
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:52,910
Did you have to adapt yourself
to provide the most value,

574
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:56,140
provide the most impact? Or was it more
of this is what you bring to the table,

575
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,250
here's how you can influence
through group around you?

576
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,790
Oh, it changed a lot. Um,
so Google, I was, you know,

577
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:06,560
an APM fresh out of Stanford computer
science. I had never led a team before.

578
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:09,050
I had no idea what I was doing.
I never had a real job.

579
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,590
And you come into that situation with
a bunch of experienced engineers and,

580
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:16,040
and you're like, how do I get these
people to listen to me at all?

581
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:20,840
Like I have no credibility. Um, so
there, you know, I remember I was like,

582
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:23,600
how do I get them to respect me?
I know I'll fix a bug.

583
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,550
So I just checked in code and the,

584
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,790
and tried to prove that I was useful
and that was willing to work hard and

585
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:34,100
slowly built that
relationship with that team.

586
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:38,660
But it was all about rolling up your
sleeves and like getting stuff done. Um,

587
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,950
when that,
then when I had the credibility,

588
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:46,100
I was able to lay out more of like the
product roadmap, but everything was very,

589
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:50,960
very in the weeds and you know,
uh, working, working with the team,

590
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:55,980
making decisions myself.
Um, at Polyvore it was, uh,

591
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,580
early days, very similar,
right? Like, I mean, I,

592
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:03,430
they hired me and I didn't have to work
so hard to earn the respect, but um,

593
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,850
it was a lot of in the weeds
of making decisions, writing
code, all of that stuff.

594
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Then when you switched to becoming a
manager or VP or getting moving up in the

595
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:19,490
org,
you're no longer focused on the solution.

596
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,970
You are focused on the
problem. Right, and the art.

597
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:26,030
I think the reason why no one likes Mike,

598
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,830
like no one really likes micromanager
and what's annoying is that the micro

599
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:33,980
manager is a person who's trying to tell
you, here's how you, here's the solution.

600
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,230
Let me tell you like do it this way,
do it my way.

601
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,890
And what you really want is an of like,
no,

602
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,750
this is the problem we're trying to solve.

603
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,080
The reason I don't like your solution
is because you didn't think about this

604
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:46,040
part of the problem.

605
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,110
So if you just articulate the problem
clearly and the guard rails of like,

606
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,000
you know what's acceptable and not,

607
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,290
then people start to come up with the
solutions that are a little bit closer to

608
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,060
what maybe you think is ideal and inner.
They don't.

609
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:01,640
You have to sell except it sometimes,
but because it could be totally right.

610
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:03,200
I've been proven wrong
many, many times, right?

611
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,150
As I'm sure we all have if we're managers,

612
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,140
but that just keeps changing
as you grow in the org.

613
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,500
So you start with a solution creator,
then you become a problem creator.

614
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,770
And then at some point no
one tells you anything.

615
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,840
There's no problem given to you
and you don't have to articulate,

616
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:21,080
you're just here you are a VP at Yahoo,

617
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,210
create value for our company and then
no one tells you, you know, so we had,

618
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,590
we invented products.
Right. So that's, that's,

619
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,000
that's a very different
way of thinking. Um, but I,

620
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,700
I would say that that was the difference
between all the different roles in

621
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:35,534
stages.

622
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,530
So did you approach that by trying to
find problems for people or did you just

623
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:44,210
try to find a teams and then say,
bring me problems are important. Yeah,

624
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:46,440
so I sat up very, we, you know, I was,

625
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,320
I was the VP of the lifestyle group and
we know, we knew that to create value,

626
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:56,321
we wanted to build a bigger mobile user
base for Yahoo Cause it was still quite

627
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:00,830
a homepage, desktop centric. Um, I
actually had a lot of young, younger,

628
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:04,700
whether it's amazing,
but still more mobile growth.

629
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,290
And we wanted lifestyle, which
to me meant, you know, younger,

630
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,800
a younger audience,
um, and a lot of women.

631
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,710
So then what we did is we
started outlining like what
are the verticals that we

632
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:20,330
could go into health and wellness,
fashion,

633
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,400
beauty, uh, social. And so
we picked verticals. And,

634
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,550
uh, then what we did is we started
to build out user personas.

635
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:31,160
What are the different types
of people in this space?

636
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:34,730
And then what are the problems? And
uh, what I did was I didn't tell them,

637
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:38,000
here are the people I know exactly
like what, you know, women 18,

638
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:43,030
13 to 25 wine. I said, here are the
breadwinners of those users. Um,

639
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,220
come up with a process to
understand these people.

640
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:47,480
And then the team got really good at that.

641
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,990
They got great at creating user personas.
They became amazing at running,

642
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:55,250
coming up with, uh, a brainstorm.
Um, Eric go is, it was involved in,

643
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:56,600
it's actually your why she's,
she's awesome.

644
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,560
And they would run a process with the
team to brainstorm different products.

645
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,960
And then we came up with a process
for how to test that very quickly.

646
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,010
And then what we ended up doing is
creating a process to get apps shipped in

647
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:10,621
eight weeks.

648
00:35:10,621 --> 00:35:13,100
So we would brainstorm and then eight
weeks later we would push something to

649
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:15,800
android and it would be an MVP,
but we'd get enough data.

650
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,870
And then we do two or
three more iterations.

651
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:22,871
And there we actually shipped I think
four or five apps inside of Yahoo under

652
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:25,090
some, you know, umbrella companies.

653
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,290
I didn't say Yahoo on it because
we didn't want to risk the brand,

654
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,430
but it was like a great fun thing
for the team to work on. Um,

655
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,180
for various reasons. Well, we
didn't ship all of them, you know,

656
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:38,910
some of them actually sucked. Uh, and
some them had interesting traction,

657
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,900
but we ended up deciding that
they weren't strategic. Uh,

658
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:44,280
and the one that eventually
launched was Cabana by Tumblr,

659
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:47,760
which is a live streaming, a
group watching APP. Um, you know,

660
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:49,890
I think there's a lot more work
to be done, but you know, I,

661
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:54,891
I think that that's sort of how we manage
that process or how I manage it as,

662
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,650
as the, the VP without, while
wanting to empower the team,

663
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,470
but also making sure we were doing
something useful in strategic for Yahoo.

664
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,430
It's really interesting. Yeah. And
these were teams of five people,

665
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:08,010
so three I think three
or four, no, six, three,

666
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,520
three or four engineers and then a
designer and a pm. So very small team.

667
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:12,420
Eight weeks.
Yeah.

668
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,070
So we do have, um, a dory
with some questions and we
also have a mic in the back.

669
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,280
So the dory link for anyone on the live
stream is go slash ask Dash Jess Lee.

670
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,440
Um, but why don't we bring this
up and take a few of these? Okay.

671
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:33,180
So what's the difference between being
a PM at Google and being a CEO at a

672
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:35,400
startup and in your case,

673
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,250
did you see any challenges during that
transition and how did you get over them?

674
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,720
Yeah. Um, so I think I've
mentioned some of that. The,

675
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,300
the culture and the environment in terms
of like having to think through revenue

676
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,130
very early on was it was
different. Um, you know,

677
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:52,430
at Google the,

678
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:56,540
the responsibility was much more
about the product and less about the,

679
00:36:56,541 --> 00:37:00,430
the people in the org or the product
became, um, the company at, at,

680
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,580
at the CEO stage. Um, it,

681
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,340
it was a challenging
transition. Like I said, I,

682
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:10,840
I've constantly felt like I didn't really
know what I was doing and I just kept

683
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,381
the job,

684
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:14,170
just kept evolving underneath me and
then I figured it out and then it would

685
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:17,040
change again. So, yeah. Okay.

686
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,410
So you've been on both the building
and financing side of products and

687
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:23,680
businesses,
so which would you pick?

688
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,650
Oh, that's a tough question. Um,

689
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,490
there are pros and cons to each
write on the building side.

690
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:35,200
As a founder and a CEO, um,
that's, there's a lot of, uh,

691
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,910
existential stress,
right? Because you become,

692
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,940
your identity becomes the company
you're constantly worried about.

693
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,160
Are we going to make it,
you know,

694
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:48,790
I've brought 125 people with me on
this journey. Like what am I, you know,

695
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,230
is this going to work out for all of us?

696
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,580
So it's much more existentially stressful
than being on the investors side where

697
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:56,140
your,
um,

698
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,160
the value of your work is spread out
across a portfolio of companies versus all

699
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:03,850
your risk tied to one single company
that you are responsible for.

700
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:08,440
So existential stress is much
higher on the founder side. Um,

701
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:14,620
I do miss getting my hands dirty,
right? Like writing code, you know,

702
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:15,550
making product design,

703
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:18,580
they get to do a little bit of it with
my earlier stage companies so that,

704
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,950
so that scratches that itch.
Um,

705
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:25,850
I would say though that the learning is
enormous and that's a huge upside. Um,

706
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,440
by being an investor.
Like too,

707
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,750
it's such a privilege to meet so many
amazing founders working on so many

708
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:36,610
different markets. Like everyday I
learn something about the latest,

709
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:39,880
greatest state of some technology or
a market that I wouldn't have known

710
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:43,900
anything about. Uh, and it's
just a privilege to meet
all those awesome people.

711
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:46,090
And to just constantly be learning.
Okay.

712
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,280
So a lot of times people,
I mean you always hear,

713
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:51,010
don't identify too much with your work,
but you see people do it all the time.

714
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,250
Do you think that's actually a useful
thing for startup founders to be doing?

715
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,530
You said as a startup founder,

716
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,400
you sometimes see people's opinions of
the startup being a reflection of your

717
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:04,480
work. Is that a good thing to care
that much? Like to be that invested?

718
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,770
You know, I think that there's, uh,

719
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,380
there's certainly a personal
sacrifice that comes with it,

720
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:12,370
but part of me also feels like it's
necessary in order to get through it.

721
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,030
So yeah, I think it's, it's
a, it's a little inevitable.

722
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,110
Like if you're too checked out,

723
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:19,240
you don't really care what happens
with your company. Like, yeah, I don't,

724
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:22,670
I think it's hard to actually tough
it out and, and, and make it work at,

725
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,180
and I feel like I've been making startups
not really terrible. It just not right.

726
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:28,840
It's, it's just that it's epic
highs and epic Lowe's. Right.

727
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:31,180
And the epic has made it all worth it.
Like,

728
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,970
I had so many moments where I was like,
I can't believe this is my job.

729
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,570
I found my calling in life.
This is amazing. I love my team.

730
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:40,900
Like this is the best feeling in the
world. And then also moments of like,

731
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:45,580
oh my God, why did I leave Google? Right.
But that's just par for the course.

732
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:49,330
And I think it's like that for, for
every, every founder and every CEO. Yeah.

733
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,570
That's why we take a live
question in the back.

734
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,220
Thank you. Thanks so much for coming to
Google. It's really interesting talk. Um,

735
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,320
I have a question.
Did you come across in sequoia?

736
00:39:57,321 --> 00:40:02,090
Any interesting fashion
tech companies? Yeah. Um,

737
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,220
I have seen a lot.

738
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:08,180
The problem is I know where all the dead
bodies are buried because I did fashion

739
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:08,990
tech.

740
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,920
So they actually say that to a lot of
times investors are less likely to invest

741
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:16,490
in things that they've kind
of, they know too well. Uh,

742
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,200
so I feel a little bit like
that. Um, something, let's
see. What would have I seen?

743
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,740
I think there's a lot of interesting
computer vision stuff that's happening now

744
00:40:24,741 --> 00:40:28,190
that enables fashion,
fashion companies.

745
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,650
Fashion is one of the hardest,
uh,

746
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,520
recommendation problems,
right? Like, you know,

747
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:38,080
Netflix had the whole Netflix prize
for figuring out movie recommendations.

748
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:40,010
But do you think about it,
there's not that many movies,

749
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:42,470
like how many movies come out per year,
not that many.

750
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,740
And then how much does your movie
tastes change versus fashion?

751
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,950
It's like not only does your tastes
change over the years, like trends change,

752
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,740
seasons change,
and then you know,

753
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,240
the amount of product out there is
astonishing and it's very difficult to

754
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:03,790
describe, right? Like little touches
like silk or white stripe here.

755
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,720
Like it's just so unstructured.

756
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,450
It's very difficult and people like
very specific things. And so it's,

757
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:12,590
it's one of the most difficult
problems. Um, so one of, you know,

758
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:16,280
there's some really interesting computer
vision companies that are, you know,

759
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,890
classifying products that look similar.

760
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,480
And I think that that's
a very interesting space.

761
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:23,690
I think he'd do a lot more once
you have vision. Yeah. Okay.

762
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,880
Another question in the back. He's
just, thanks so much for coming here.

763
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:29,240
I'm going to shun the
BM and search. Hi. Uh,

764
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,640
one of the things I'm curious to know
a little bit more about is how did you

765
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,980
having a focus versus writing a blog,

766
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,420
being the marketing person,
being the salesperson,

767
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,470
being the product manager
and so on and so forth.

768
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:43,790
Can you touch a little bit more on that?

769
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,281
Yeah,

770
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:48,720
so what I tried to do was I always had
my core duties of product management and

771
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:53,160
then I tried to only do one new
frontier thing outside of that.

772
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:57,510
So I was not writing code and doing ad
sales and the blog at the same time.

773
00:41:57,511 --> 00:41:59,370
I did the blog first and I was like,
oh,

774
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:02,460
there's a lot of community stuff to do
here. Let me hire a community manager.

775
00:42:02,461 --> 00:42:04,890
And then she took over that. Then I, um,

776
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,940
I think after that I moved to add sales.
Uh,

777
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,960
I did a little bit and hired a great
New York Times salesperson. Um,

778
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,110
and so they were more one,
you know,

779
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:18,570
it's one extra thing.
Yeah.

780
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,950
How many people were at
Polyvore when you joined?

781
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,980
Uh, just the founders. So
three. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

782
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,680
And when you left 125, a
little bit bigger. Yeah. Yeah.

783
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,210
Okay. Another question, the back

784
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,760
adjust. Uh, so, um,

785
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,580
do the things that you talked about
being very important to you were having a

786
00:42:38,581 --> 00:42:42,330
big impact and a kind of doing a
lot of learning, like cross cross,

787
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,970
cross disciplinary areas.
Um,

788
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:50,760
it Kinda seems like at a company like
Google scale, it can be hard to, uh, um,

789
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,600
have as big of an impact on the thing
that you're working on and also to kind of

790
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:58,590
be given those additional responsibilities
or even like to be able to seek them

791
00:42:58,591 --> 00:43:01,350
out yourself. Did you have
any like, advice for a,

792
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,710
I guess trying to find
those opportunities, um,

793
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,950
when you're in like a bigger company?

794
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:10,040
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. It can
be harder. Um, for sure. Uh,

795
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,330
what I would recommend and what I
think I ended up doing actually inside

796
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:18,260
Polyvore as well. It was
just go do them, you know,

797
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:23,261
like if you see something like come up
with the solution or do a little bit of

798
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:27,680
that work and then bring it to the person
who maybe owns that area by being mad,

799
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:32,630
you'd be like, Hey, you know, could I
work? Look, I already did some work here.

800
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:37,631
Can I prove to them that they should
have you helping before you ask them,

801
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:41,630
can I help you? Right. Like,
just go ahead and do it. Uh, so,

802
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:45,980
so that was a big part of, of my drain,
I think, um, that works anywhere.

803
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,790
Um, in terms of impact, I, yeah, I mean,

804
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,980
Google touches so many,
many,

805
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:54,950
many people though that even when
you own a small part of something,

806
00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:00,110
you might still be as impactful as working
on a huge thing inside of a company

807
00:44:00,111 --> 00:44:04,910
with much less many fewer
users. Um, yeah. But, you know,

808
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:09,440
I think autonomy is maybe one of the key
differences between small startup and

809
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,930
at large company.
So that one's very hard to,

810
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,650
I think you just have to pick
where you want to be. Yeah. Thanks.

811
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,070
So another question from the dory,

812
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,130
it's part of being a CEO and
a pm is making hard decisions.

813
00:44:20,131 --> 00:44:22,230
Can you share an example of one
of these really hard decisions?

814
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:23,070
How you approached it?

815
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,720
Yeah. Um, so let's see.

816
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,870
We pivoted our business model twice.
Um, and then, uh, that's probably,

817
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:35,570
those are hard decisions.
Uh,

818
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,930
and then other hard
decisions were probably, uh,

819
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,460
when people had to leave.
Right.

820
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,740
I would say one thing that's
interesting about startups,

821
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:45,240
I didn't realize until I went through it,

822
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:48,480
is there are people who are just
awesome at the early stage, right?

823
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:51,990
They love being one of 10 people.
They're so good,

824
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:55,890
they're jacks of all trades and they
just love the freedom and the autonomy.

825
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,160
And then as the company
gets bigger, you know, they,

826
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,930
they start to feel really like encumbered
and they don't like it anymore. And

827
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,880
You keep trying to make it work
because you just like love that person.

828
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,540
But really the best thing
to do is actually let them
go free and find the next

829
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:16,110
company. So those were some of the
hardest decisions because I was like,

830
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,580
why isn't it working?
Let's just make it work.

831
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:21,400
We'll just like rearrange the universe to
work and it just doesn't work that way.

832
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,680
Some people are just great for different
stages, so I think that was a hard one.

833
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,450
Um, the other one was like
I mentioned just pivoting,

834
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,730
sometimes there there's
pull, they're like, you know,

835
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,790
your business model is not working and
you're not making money and you have to

836
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:39,990
do something else. So those are
difficult to roll out to a team. Right?

837
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:43,380
Like if a whole group of people work on
this particular business model and our

838
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:45,940
low longer needed, right. Like
that's very difficult. But you,

839
00:45:45,941 --> 00:45:50,760
you have to do the right thing for the
company and for the greater good of that,

840
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:51,840
of that group.
Yeah.

841
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:56,100
Now that you are evaluating new
companies and potential investments and

842
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,780
potential founders that you're looking at,

843
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,790
do you consider that
when looking at founders,

844
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:03,630
like is this person a great
in the beginning but I worry
about them the long run

845
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:05,430
or is it too hard to protect?

846
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,660
It's pretty hard to predict.
Like honestly,

847
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:11,200
I think if you met me like before
Polyvore you might not have assume that I

848
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:14,320
would have been able to get
to the larger company stage.

849
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:18,730
I'm on more on the introverted side.
I hate public speaking. Like it's,

850
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,100
uh, I don't, you know, I,

851
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,360
I don't think you would've said that
person can definitely scale to run like,

852
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:29,550
you know, have vps and stuff reporting
into them. Uh, so I, I try to be very,

853
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:32,620
very open minded about that and
they just look for that grit, right?

854
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:35,320
Like it distance traveled. Like,
can you keep pushing yourself?

855
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:38,350
You have a history of pushing herself
because he might be able to push yourself

856
00:46:38,351 --> 00:46:42,130
all the way through because it's not,
it's not rocket science, right? It's hard,

857
00:46:42,131 --> 00:46:46,480
but it's, it's a lot of trial and
error and just learning on the job.

858
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:48,580
So is that, that's more
what I look for. Yeah.

859
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:51,680
Any advice for introverted
PM's are founders? Yes.

860
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,920
Yeah. I mean, I think you can be a
great leader even if you're very,

861
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:58,140
very introverted, right? Um, you know,

862
00:46:58,141 --> 00:47:00,900
you might not be the highlight
of a cocktail party or something,

863
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,960
but that who cares, right?
At the end of the day,

864
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:08,720
you have to be able to convince your team
of what the vision is. You have to, uh,

865
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,640
be able to rally them. Um,
you know, for my all hands,

866
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:14,790
I really hated speaking in front
of the whole company a lot.

867
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,140
So what I did is I actually had,
um,

868
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,800
a lot of the other folks on the team
speak and explain what they were doing.

869
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:21,720
Right. Which is actually nice
because people like be, you know,

870
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:22,900
other people like being in the spot.

871
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:24,330
They like getting credit
for what they're doing.

872
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:27,540
Instead of me talking the entire
time that, that was, uh, uh,

873
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:29,930
that was something that I
did. And, and, w you know,

874
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,930
I was still able to have
lots of really meaningful,

875
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:34,630
great one on one conversations
or small group conversations.

876
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,440
And because I didn't like public speaking,
I would always have slides. Right.

877
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,180
I'm a, I love to draw. I'm a designer,

878
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:42,250
so I would make sure that
whenever I was giving a talk,

879
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,100
I had a beautiful set of slides so
that everyone would be looking at that

880
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:49,150
instead of it. Um, and that helped me.
He made me less nervous. And it also,

881
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,840
I think with a guide for what I
needed to say. And um, yeah, you know,

882
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,100
you just find your, your
tips and your tricks. Um,

883
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,600
I think he'd be a great leader
as an introvert or an extrovert.

884
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,460
Yeah. Can we take out the other
questions from the back? Okay. Um, okay.

885
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,680
I was wondering if you could share your
most recent public investment and I

886
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:08,080
guess like what drove you to
actually invest in that team?

887
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,000
Yeah,
so it's installed

888
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:14,790
so I can't share it.
Um,

889
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:19,260
maybe I can tell you a little bit about
what they do. Um, so this company is an,

890
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,820
uh, an item demand staffing
up platform. So they match,

891
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,440
uh, workers, blue collar
workers to jobs, uh,

892
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,790
or shifts at companies like
target or Uniclo or you know,

893
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:36,330
at a warehouse. Um, they're live
in like eight different cities,

894
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:39,540
so it's not just a San Francisco problem,
but you know,

895
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,830
there's a lot of people who,
I mean,

896
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:42,940
there's a lot of unemployment
in this country. Um,

897
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,710
and some of it is actually
due to inefficiencies.

898
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:49,320
So they are a marketplace that matches
people. Um, really great hardworking,

899
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:50,790
humble team.

900
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:54,690
They continue to do jobs on the weekends
themselves just to make sure they don't

901
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:56,910
forget what it's like.
Uh,

902
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,560
and a lot of distance traveled with these
founders. So I really love their, uh,

903
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:02,394
their grit.

904
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,830
Yeah. Well, I guess
kind of a follow up, um,

905
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,800
do you think that there's a trend of,

906
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,160
I guess like a lot of startups that focus
more on middle America and like a lot

907
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:17,370
more blue collar things, um,
that tend to succeed? Um,

908
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,540
and might be harder to find as an investor
since like investors tend to be in

909
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,850
like the Silicon Valley bubble or
like New York, stuff like that.

910
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,960
Yes. I do think that that's true. Um, I,

911
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:30,660
it's something I think about
a lot. Like I think, you know,

912
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:35,820
is this thing gap widening,
uh, like, or you know,

913
00:49:35,821 --> 00:49:38,880
does it help with obviously I,
you know,

914
00:49:38,881 --> 00:49:43,881
we're not pure impact social investors
like sequoia is where it is and has been

915
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:49,731
for 45 years because it
produces tremendous returns
consistently and his back

916
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:55,410
legendary companies like
Google or apple or Nvidia,

917
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,400
uh, and airbnb. Uh, and it is so,

918
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,770
it is important that it, it does drive
performance and drive returns, but I do.

919
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:07,860
Those are, those are things that I think
about and I think those are a lot of,

920
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:10,830
there are a lot of untapped opportunities
and I think that the company had just

921
00:50:10,831 --> 00:50:14,430
mentioned falls perfectly in that realm.
Yeah.

922
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,500
So why don't we take it
one more Tory question.

923
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:24,130
It's what is something that Google can
learn from other companies now that

924
00:50:24,131 --> 00:50:28,220
you're back here after like a decade,
what lessons you brought back for us?

925
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,110
Huh, wow. I mean it's hard
to tell Google like, hey,

926
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:37,860
you're not doing very well because
that's clearly not the case. Um,

927
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,050
I thought it was very clever to break up
Google into multiple companies to give

928
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:45,170
more autonomy and breathing room to,

929
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,590
and like leadership for a lot of people.
I thought that was a very,

930
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:49,371
very clever thing.

931
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:52,610
So I guess that's more something that
other companies can maybe learn from

932
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:54,020
Google. Um, and I, and again,

933
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,910
I think that comes from maybe caring
about you that growth and investing in

934
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:01,600
people or maybe there's financials.
I don't know, but, but that,

935
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:06,020
that's how I thought about it.
Let's see. I do think the, the

936
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,050
focus, the one thing that I
had already mentioned was, um,

937
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:16,070
just knowing that you have a runway
and that sense of urgency. Um,

938
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:19,700
I do think that sometimes that can be
really helpful, helpful, forcing function.

939
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:24,140
Like when you're in a meeting with someone
for the third meeting about the same

940
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:27,740
topic and you can't get everyone to agree
and you're trying to get consensus. Um,

941
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:32,390
sometimes it's good to think like we,
we have six months to live, right?

942
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,790
Like do we,
should we be arguing about this right now?

943
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,400
Cause I think getting rid of some
of those extra meetings would,

944
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,310
would make people a lot happier probably.
So maybe that's my one thing.

945
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:44,040
And then why don't we take one last
question from the back and then we'll wrap

946
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:47,970
up. Right. Thanks. Thanks Doug.
Thanks. Thanks for organizing it.

947
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,630
So first let me apologize by saying that
I know we're been to Polyvore side and

948
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:54,540
so, um, part of me, um,

949
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,180
so I understand that the users
were a big component of your,

950
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:02,580
your product design and success
of the company, uh, in sometimes,

951
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:04,290
but you just get to two powerful,

952
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:08,670
sometimes there are power users that
troll you and the entire user community in

953
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:09,070
the fall.

954
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,230
Sometimes there are power users get
their power users within the segment of

955
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,360
users, the troll, everything. Uh,

956
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:19,200
was this the case in [inaudible] case
there you've got blindsided by what users

957
00:52:19,201 --> 00:52:24,201
were saying in some certain cases or
where you had to take a decisions against.

958
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,410
What do you use?
We ask asking for thoughts.

959
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,390
Yeah.

960
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:33,070
I think knowing your users and listening
to your users does not mean doing

961
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:34,030
everything your users.

962
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:38,350
Cause sometimes they ask for things
that just don't make sense. Right?

963
00:52:38,351 --> 00:52:42,730
Like if every user was a
product, you know, designer,
then we'd all be, you know,

964
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:45,160
designing products and we all
be reach entrepreneurs. Um,

965
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:48,310
so you have to listen to, you know,
when they say I want something,

966
00:52:48,311 --> 00:52:50,650
you have to think, okay,
you're giving me a solution.

967
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,780
What was the problem you
were trying to solve?

968
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,950
And then you have to remember that for
every vocal user there is a ton of silent

969
00:52:56,951 --> 00:52:59,920
users out there, which is why for
us personas were very important.

970
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,890
So we had clear personas for
the different types of users.

971
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:06,610
There was a creator who made all the
content and was constantly asking us for

972
00:53:06,611 --> 00:53:10,510
features and talking. And then there were
the more casual shoppers and browsers,

973
00:53:10,511 --> 00:53:12,790
and we had personas for them as well.
Um,

974
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:16,930
so I think you use user research
plus talking to your users,

975
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,040
plus personas and all these other tools
to get a sense of how much to prioritize

976
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,150
across your entire user base. But yeah,
I definitely don't just listen directly,

977
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:30,070
do everything that is,
let's thank Jeff for coming.

978
00:53:30,071 --> 00:53:31,980
It's been great for having me.
