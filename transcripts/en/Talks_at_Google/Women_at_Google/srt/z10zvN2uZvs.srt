1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,310
Please join me in welcoming along
with her daughter Peta Ani to Franco

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,600
[inaudible].

3
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,720
Oh, hello. Thanks.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,993
Okay,

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,810
the mothership. Really cool.
Oh, what's happening to me?

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,240
Technical difficulties.
Oh,

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,350
let's just leave it like that.
Okay. You want to sing a tune?

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,240
This is not from my latest record.

9
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,390
This is just a song that Pete
and I like to sing together.

10
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,530
You facing east or west or north to south.

11
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,970
When it gets cold out,

12
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,520
do you get brought in that you get left?
You in the shade.

13
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:23,990
If something big but
you ride out in the sun,

14
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,100
are you down then at
the top 10 either way,

15
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:34,730
you better take your,

16
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,810
make your lemon may have you raised.

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,713
Yeah.

18
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,210
Have you felt the longing in a sea

19
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,610
if you felt it swimming in?
It's sneaky

20
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,260
pushing through

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,440
and you know what I'm saying
when I'm saying it's going to be,

22
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:21,230
oh,
you just got to take your,

23
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,840
make your,
have your radio.

24
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,830
Listen to beating of the drum.

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,840
Look at the spouse.

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,553
Yeah.

27
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,860
Who says it's better to be dry?

28
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,220
The mighty oak trees are
so happy they could cry.

29
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,910
So you just gotta take your,

30
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,380
make your nay have your rainy,

31
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,580
have your rainy day.

32
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,580
Have you been rainy?

33
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,463
Rainy,

34
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,593
okay.

35
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,170
Never play guitar twice.
They get dirty.

36
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,760
So that was fine. I was thinking
when we were singing that song,

37
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,190
if that second verse, have you felt
a longing in a seed, that's you.

38
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:16,191
You're the seed that I was writing about
and now you're here singing with me and

39
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:20,840
this is a song that I
wrote for Peter's dad

40
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,250
long after the seal is broken.
You stumble.

41
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,790

I love you even more.

42

[inaudible] they got the field.

43
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,270
Can you hold on to your passion now?

80
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,650
[inaudible].

81
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,430
I want to thank you so much.

82
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,430
Thank you for the beautiful performance
and thank you for taking the time to

83
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:39,050
come and visit with us here in New York.

84
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,370
I know you have a lifelong
history in here in New York,

85
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:47,580
but having relocated, you've been
spending a lot of time back up here. Uh,

86
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,680
you were up here a few months ago to
receive a lifetime achievement award.

87
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:52,514
Is that correct?

88
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,310
Right, yes. One of those.
That's always good.

89
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
Now I can die

90
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,650
of a lifetime is what I'm understanding.

91
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,440
Yeah, no, that's cool. I love coming
back to New York. I do. I do. I, um,

92
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,620
I used to miss it like a
person after I left. Um,

93
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,940
and now I just like to visit,
like we were talking about,

94
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:20,800
we were talking all morning off Mike, so
now we get to talk into Mike's. But yeah,

95
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:25,570
now the whole pace of New
York and the, just the circus
of it, I'm like, wow, cool.

96
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,453
Got to go.

97
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,081
Well,

98
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:32,081
and you're here now for kind of a wild
event supporting Cindy Lopper and the

99
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,590
true colors foundation.

100
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

101
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,670
The benefit to help an organization that
tries to get a homeless queer youth,

102
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,840
a place to be and people to support them.
Yeah.

103
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,310
It brings me to the first topic that I
wanted to discuss with you, which is, um,

104
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,080
th this, all of these things
speak to a career of proactivity.

105
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm looking back through the,
you know, through the years you,

106
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,870
you have always been at the,
the pointed end of the proactive stick.

107
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,240
And I find that interesting and the fact
that a lot of artists are very reactive

108
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,710
and event would take place and there's
a response to it or attribute to some

109
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:18,370
tragedy or, uh, some
sort of reaction based.

110
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:22,270
And I'm curious if you can speak about
what it's been like to always be in that

111
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:25,750
proactive space instead of
just a simple reactive space.

112
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,610
Wow. I dig it. I dig this, the whole,
the whole pointed end of the stick.

113
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,770
I mean, what's, yeah, Jeez. I mean,

114
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:38,110
I guess like anybody,

115
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:43,060
I've just been trying to speak
my truth, my experience, my,

116
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,610
my thoughts, my dreams,
my perception in my songs,

117
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:50,920
in my writing.
And um,

118
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,890
I guess personally,

119
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:58,540
I'm always compelled by art
that is takes risks, you know?

120
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,340
So, um, uh, I've always
kind of pushed myself.

121
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:07,660
I used to be really hard to
be that in the beginning.

122
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,940
You know,
I used to,

123
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,550
she's who's going to be at this show
tonight and on my mom or you know,

124
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:19,780
we'll high. Okay. And what will happen
when I say this or, you know what?

125
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,250
And a lot happens,
you know,

126
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,970
when you're like jabbing at stuff and,
um,

127
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,500
but I would say that the most important
thing that happened over the years was

128
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:36,190
that people came out and nowhere and
said, me too, or thank you, I'm a guy.

129
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,400
And all of that,
like hearing people repeatedly say,

130
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,860
I can't believe you just said that.
Thank you.

131
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,640
Just meant so much more than all the rest.

132
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:53,140
So it's kind of encouraged
me to just let it go.

133
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,350
Those ideas of what's private or personal
or inappropriate or this or that or

134
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:02,740
the other. It's like it's all
universal. It's none of it's unique.

135
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,370
It's curious that you said it used to be
more difficult for you because I would

136
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:12,371
almost think that now is a time period
of difficulty for anyone being proactive.

137
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:18,341
There's so much tension and so much
pushback to any push that is there.

138
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,070
Um,
does that weigh in at all when you're,

139
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:25,970
when you're about to step up and make a
bold statement of, like you said before,

140
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:29,360
it was the, you know, the idea
of all my moms in the audience,

141
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:33,730
I don't want to run a foul of
that, but now how, you know,

142
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,250
some fraction of the world,

143
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,370
the audience that are even more
dangerous than mothers. Yeah.

144
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,860
I mean
I feel like

145
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,450
the was really good to just come out of
the box with my mouth and spirit open

146
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,940
and just start.
I mean,

147
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,500
when I was a teenager and I
started making my own songs,

148
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,060
I,

149
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,290
I started pushing against that wall of
acceptibility and what you can and cannot

150
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:11,180
say and Ken and cannot be. And really
early on I just was like, you know,

151
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,040
f it just, just, what's going
to happen to me? Let's find out,

152
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,110
you know, and 25 whatever
it's been, you know,

153
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:24,980
30 years later,
I'm in a great position now.

154
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,930
People know, I mean, I weeded out the
riff raff a long time ago. You know,

155
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:30,764
people,

156
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,370
I think it's much more difficult
if you have a secret to let it go.

157
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:42,470
If you've never had secrets, it's easier.
It's better, you know, uh, you know,

158
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:47,090
people used to ask me about coming out
or this or then psych. I never was,

159
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,150
I was not in anywhere.
So,

160
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:54,200
and I think that that from
my experience it's better.

161
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:57,620
It's easier to do it that way to just,
I had a,

162
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,810
a young lady opening up my
shows recently who's had some

163
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,730
success with a,
a song online and she's a lovely,

164
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,470
lovely young gal and she's sort of
just embarking on a career in music.

165
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:14,840
And she was saying, Oh, you know,

166
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:19,490
I'm weird talking after one night.
And she said, I'm pro choice,

167
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:24,410
but I'm so afraid, you know, I Duh Duh,
Duh. I come from a traditional family,

168
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:28,400
I this and I that. And I said,
just say it, just say it.

169
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,660
The sooner you say it, the better.
Say who you are, what you believe,

170
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,650
what you think. Cause from
there it gets easier. Every day,

171
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,320
I'm going to change my plan now that
they brought this up because this,

172
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,940
this idea of just saying it.
Um,

173
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,950
I wanted to speak later
in the conversation about
the idea of directness and

174
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:52,850
metaphor. Um, but we sort of skipped
ahead to that in, in your music,

175
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,070
there's use of metaphor,

176
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,100
but where you really get masterful is
with just direct statements or like you

177
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:03,080
said, just taking it head
on and tackling it that way.

178
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,430
And I'm curious if you can talk about
the choices of when you want to say

179
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:11,870
something in a very direct fashion
or when you reach a little deeper for

180
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,100
metaphor to try and mask and idea
or, or, or Bo and ideas. Yeah,

181
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,030
yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Um,

182
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,490
I guess I use,
always had maybe just such a burning,

183
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
every time I see a eastern
medicine practitioner and they say,

184
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,460
Ooh, your spleen, whoa with
the spleen. I'm like, yeah,

185
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:39,230
I know you should see my 20 records,
spleen music.

186
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,440
And it's just, you know, it's just,

187
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,530
I have such an urgent need to,

188
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,990
I don't know,
beat back lies and silences,

189
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,330
um,
that often it drives me to just say it.

190
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,080
Um, I think that's just, you know,

191
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:02,000
where my music is coming from.

192
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:07,001
Sometimes I'm interested in how could
you say it without saying it or how could

193
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:13,250
you say, you know, um,
but oftentimes I've, I,

194
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:17,330
the direct route is what
is most appealing to me.

195
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,480
I used to get a lot of flack for
it. Like we were talking about, um,

196
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,370
a lot of resistance, a lot of pushback. I,

197
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,900
when you were forming your question,

198
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:30,920
I was remembering the first
time I went to Italy to play,

199
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,780
we were talking earlier about
touring in Europe and um, this was,

200
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,261
you know,

201
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,220
first time I went to Italy was probably
20 years ago and it was in an age of

202
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,220
flack, you know, that I was living in.

203
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,140
And I remember the first interview I
did an elite and the dude was like,

204
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,330
so many artists, you know,
they, they, they say,

205
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:54,830
they say it,
but they don't say it.

206
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:58,580
They say they laid in bed for
the hint that you just did.

207
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,200
And I was like, that's good. You're
saying that it's good. You know,

208
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,270
I'd never heard a positive
response to that before.

209
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:09,350
I just remember that.

210
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:13,160
So clearly that moment of maybe
somebody thinks that's good.

211
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,230
Well, it's curious with the things
that you've chosen to talk about,

212
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,200
and we spoke with a little bit
about this before as you said,

213
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:26,180
but I was immediately in
preparing for this conversation.

214
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,710
Just went through the entire
catalog again of flashing back.

215
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,820
Can I bless your heart live
to tell the tale, the fan.

216
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,730
A couple of things that caught with me
where this directness and uh, you know,

217
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:44,120
I mentioned before the
song like gratitude. Uh,

218
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,150
and recently of course me too has
found a life online and this sort of

219
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,810
understanding of, of women not being
alone in these situations and men as well.

220
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:58,050
In fact, um, but I
immediately went back to,

221
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,070
was it early nineties when gratitude
spoke exactly to that topic.

222
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,630
And you know, another example
would be like to the teeth.

223
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,780
This is something that is
decades old at this point,

224
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:12,750
but it's still modern day prescient.
Um,

225
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,730
when something happens in the world
that you have spoken or have tackled

226
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:22,320
directly on that flashes you back
10 years, 20 years into your career,

227
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,210
how does that land for you? How does,
how do you process something like me too,

228
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:30,870
in light of the fact that 20 years ago
you were standing up shouting exactly

229
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:31,704
these words.

230
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,790
Yeah. Sometimes it's a little
hard sickening. Um, you know,

231
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,720
to the teeth that you mentioned
is a song about gun violence.

232
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,570
A Song I wrote,
I dunno,

233
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,630
pushing 20 years ago when I thought
it was completely out of hand.

234
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,580
Um, so to pull that song
out now and play it is,

235
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,390
you know, kind of devastating. It's just,

236
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,973
and,

237
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,030
but things do change and often you think
he thinks this is just the way it is.

238
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,180
We just have to accept this is the way
it is. And then overnight it's not,

239
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,370
you know, and this me too moment
that we're in, you know, I think it,

240
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,700
it really speaks to how
much the dominant culture

241
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:27,963
yeah.

242
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,090
Is sees women now compared to
when I was writing that song,

243
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,280
even, you know, um,

244
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,570
the fact that we're hearing women give
voice to their experience as though it

245
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:46,390
matters, you know, um,

246
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,420
because they're becoming human in the
dominant culture and now we have to

247
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,920
accommodate that experience and those
people and those voices and those stories.

248
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,310
You know, it's one more
voice in the, in the chorus,

249
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:07,690
one more person with a seat at the
table, you know, and that's incredible.

250
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,580
I've seen a lot change, uh, in, you know,

251
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,880
I've seen the work of
feminism take hold around me.

252
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,900
Uh, you know, um,

253
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:24,550
from when I was first stomping
around saying stuff in my songs, uh,

254
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,270
I've never, and I've actually
on that tip, you know,

255
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:30,580
I've never felt a more receptive

256
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,070
world around me for a
lot of my feminist ideas,

257
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,290
you know,
so I actually am very hopeful right now.

258
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,890
You know, I know it's a
time of great peril. Uh,

259
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,430
and I mean to underplay that in a time
of great pain for a lot of people.

260
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:55,650
But I think that the possibilities,
I think there's a,

261
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,330
it's a transformative moment we're in,

262
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,480
especially around gender politics.

263
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,870
And there's, there's more of that on the
new album binary, which by the way, in,

264
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,510
in addition to this
incredibly proactive career,

265
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:12,960
it's also an incredibly prolific career.
And the fact that is,

266
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,400
I read somewhere that it's the 20th studio
album and I read somewhere else that

267
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,590
it was more than 20, uh, 20 albums.

268
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,360
Yeah, I know. What the hell.
That's amazing. It's at least 20.

269
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,380
There's 20 of those suckers. Um, yeah,

270
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,590
I don't know a lot of songs.
Kids change the game now.

271
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,100
I've slowed right down,

272
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,620
but, but, but not for lack of just
still creating amazing artwork.

273
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,030
There's the great,
great album here and more stuff.

274
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:48,930
Speaking to what we were talking about,
uh, immediately play, God jumps to mind.

275
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,990
Maybe you could talk about that song
and how, uh, the nexus and genesis.

276
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,190
Absolutely. Thanks. Um, yeah, I mean,

277
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:02,570
I started writing that song as kind
of a bragging, I was like, what if I,

278
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,020
what if I was like,
you know,

279
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,600
frost between Howlin Wolf and
missy Elliott, what would I,

280
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,110
right, right now, you know,
and I started, you know,

281
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,960
talking about my life as an emancipated
teenager, you know, I was on my own at 15,

282
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:25,940
and, um, you know, never
got nothing from nobody,

283
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:27,980
kind of,
you know,

284
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:33,040
and then the spleen took over and

285
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,060
something inside me just felt as I was
writing this bragging verse about how I'm

286
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:47,360
not a child and even when I was a child,

287
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:51,780
I didn't get a chance to
be a child. And I was, um,

288
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,700
not,
I was contributing in society.

289
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:59,360
I was a part of society really
early on. And then, you know,

290
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,490
my brain just sort of
flicked the that too.

291
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,210
And so you cannot treat me like a child,
you know,

292
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,240
you tell me what I can and cannot do
with my body when I should reproduce.

293
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,690
Uh, when I, uh, you know, if
I must reproduce or, you know,

294
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:18,524
this is

295
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,720
the kind of way that women still,
you know,

296
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,830
are treated in society is as though
they are inferior as though they are

297
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:29,240
children.
You know,

298
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:33,820
so I I think of reproductive freedom,
um,

299
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,690
as a civil right. You know, I think
that we need to talk about it that way,

300
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:39,740
address it that way.

301
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:44,741
I think we could use another
constitutional amendment
to guarantee women civil

302
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:47,690
rights.
Um,

303
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,163
yeah,

304
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,260
and I,

305
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,260
so the song just sort of mutated into a,
uh,

306
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,690
a women's civil rights anthem.

307
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,700
There's a lot of, um,
any, it speaks to the,

308
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,430
the title of the album binary.

309
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:08,490
There's a lot of dual meaning and I find
that interesting and that that story

310
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:11,230
started in one place and ended another,
um,

311
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,330
to talk about the concept of the entirety
of the album and being binary and what

312
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:19,440
that means,
where that's where that's coming from.

313
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,780
Yeah, sure. Here at Google, I mean,

314
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,380
binary to me, um, first of all is not,

315
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,620
I'm not really talking about either
or I'm talking about both always.

316
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,970
You know, I, um,

317
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,350
I had a run in with the
Internet a few years ago.

318
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,380
It came and found me in my house and
bit my head off and chewed on it for

319
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,860
awhile. And, um, uh,

320
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,630
that was sort of

321
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,290
the beginning of a lot of
meditations on consciousness for me.

322
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,000
Uh, oddly, you know,

323
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:08,001
these ones and Zeros came
and changed my life and hurt,

324
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,490
hurt me bad. And, um,

325
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,213
I,

326
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,630
I started to look at the whole world
is made of relationship basically that

327
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:27,690
every, anything that looks to be a
singularity is really a relationship.

328
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:33,030
Everything is two things spinning,
you know,

329
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,620
from our atomic structure, you
know, to the planets and the stars.

330
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:42,621
There is this fundamental design I
think that is made of relationship,

331
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:47,100
you know, and I'm kind of us, I'm
fascinated by quantum physics.

332
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:51,990
I don't understand it of course,
but I like to read about it and you know,

333
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:55,500
the quantum physicists I think through,

334
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:56,830
okay,

335
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,690
a long trajectory of masculine science
have come back around to sort of the

336
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:05,650
reality of the mother that
nothing exists on its own.

337
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,520
Only in relationship do
we, you know, I mean,

338
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,470
we are just, there's an infinite
field of possibilities until

339
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,390
something is observed and they will go
on to tell you that observing something

340
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:25,650
affects it,
that observing is interacting.

341
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,010
So with interaction comes existence,
you know,

342
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:32,250
I guess that's basically men
of course it's, you know,

343
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:35,940
it's not disconnected
with my feminism. And, um,

344
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:42,020
I think that that kind of the ways that
my brain has been spinning for the past

345
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,580
few years kind weaves through this record.

346
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,360
So that's why I took that song
title to title the whole record.

347
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,830
Well, and it goes even
further than that. Uh,

348
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,760
because this is a very interactive record
for you, I think in the creation. Right?

349
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,170
There's a lot of collaboration on this
record and it even on the technical side,

350
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:03,240
more collaboration than I
think you've done in the past.

351
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,480
How was the process of making binary a
different or familiar or unfamiliar or

352
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:09,960
taking a risk?

353
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:14,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, often
I make records by myself.

354
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,460
I crawl into a hole depending on what's
happening in my life and make a little

355
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:23,440
record or a, you know, I, I
track the songs with my band,

356
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,890
but then I phots on my own
and finish it or something.

357
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:29,110
Solitary the record right before this,

358
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,310
I did a lot in the wee hours,
you know,

359
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:38,110
when the kids were sleeping
and headphones. And this time,

360
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,510
you know, my youngest is four, four
and a, you know, uh, uh, I just,

361
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,570
I needed to re enter the
world and interact with
adults and creative beings and

362
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:53,710
people who would bring ideas to
the table other than me. So I,

363
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,610
I tracked the tunes with not
just my core band rhythm section,

364
00:27:57,611 --> 00:28:02,020
but a few other musicians,
uh, that I love.

365
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:06,010
Ivan Neville in New Orleans where I
live and Jenny Scheinman a beautiful

366
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:09,550
violinist from out west.
Um,

367
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,050
and then I just started calling up a lot
of other brilliant friends that I have.

368
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:16,510
I just don't,
didn't want to be alone.

369
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:20,650
I wanted community back in my life.
Um,

370
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,740
so there's a lot of beautiful players
and I had this kind of experience of like

371
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,320
the best Christmas ever again
and again, where, you know,

372
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,540
I sent Justin Vernon a track and then
my present comes in the mail being,

373
00:28:34,541 --> 00:28:34,841
you know,

374
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:39,340
and I get to open it up and see this
beautiful chorus that he sang on my song,

375
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:44,341
or it's just the most wonderful presence
came back to me from my friends.

376
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:49,420
And, and then I even went one
step further than I've ever gone,

377
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:53,140
which is to have somebody else mix
the damn thing. I've always just do,

378
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:56,350
I can do this. Okay, that
sounds good. Right. You know,

379
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,890
Eh, you know, so my records,
so over the years are unique,

380
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,930
you know, and expressive,
you know, and suit. But,

381
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:12,100
you know, having brought, uh,

382
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,490
a creative mind like Chad Blake to
into this project to mix it remotely,

383
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,431
once again,

384
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:23,431
I just sent him raw tracks and I got
back mixes was breathtaking for me.

385
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,090
I was like, oh wow. What
if you're not crazy?

386
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,200
And you didn't just write the
songs? And so, you know, and,

387
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:35,530
and you came in with an objectivity and a,

388
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,320
and a skill that I could,

389
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:40,990
we'll never achieve and mixing
and perspective different

390
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,430
what, what a gift. Wow. You can really
do things in the mixing as it turns out,

391
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,080
you know, so, um, I don't
think I'll ever go back to,

392
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,800
I haven't been, you know, I mean I've
been thinking about it lately, you know,

393
00:29:56,801 --> 00:30:00,940
the emancipated minor thing when
you're just, I got this, you know,

394
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:05,800
and you're just taking care of everything,
you know, now I'm 47 and I'm like, ah,

395
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,810
I don't have to do that anymore.

396
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,990
It took me a while to let go.

397
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,610
It is. It also, um, I found
that in listening to the record,

398
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,050
it's,

399
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:24,050
it's super broad in style and approach
and there's some stuff on here that is a

400
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,420
very classic Ani Difranco style.
Um,

401
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,430
there are other tracks on here
that are nearly hip hop songs. Um,

402
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,650
uh, and then, uh,

403
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,740
like spider is kind of this other end of
that spectrum and very indie rock kind

404
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:45,610
of way. Um, where did, where did the
diversity come from from this album?

405
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,960
Was it out of this collaboration or,

406
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,150
or where their trigger
moments that were like, Hey,

407
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,510
I'm going to go in this
direction for a reason.

408
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,980
Speak to that. Yeah. I mean,
I like, and I've been hearing
it from others that this,

409
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:02,240
yeah, the, the sort of diversity of
the sounds on this record and the,

410
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,770
and I think that has to do with
Chad and with, uh, you know,

411
00:31:06,771 --> 00:31:07,940
the people that I worked with,

412
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:12,941
the musicians helping me translate my
songs and fully have helping me manifest

413
00:31:15,981 --> 00:31:16,820
them fully.

414
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,980
I think that I've always
written really in a diverse way,

415
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,300
you know, um, I never kind of
want to write the same song twice.

416
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:30,590
So I'm always let me write a song,
standing on my head, you know, with the,

417
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:35,150
you know, a bucket on each foot
and see what that turns out like.

418
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:38,540
And so I've done that
all, but then, you know,

419
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:43,541
I think then I just play it like I
always do on whatever's sitting around.

420
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,320
And then I just sort of mix it
so you can hear everything. And,

421
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,770
but I think when other people come in
and enhance the creativity that exists in

422
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:58,250
the, you know, in the seed
of a song and they say,

423
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:02,870
well this sounds to me like we
should go over here and look,

424
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:07,040
I have a, I have an arc, we
can go over there, you know?

425
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:12,041
And so I think that these songs were
more fully realized in their differences

426
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,770
then then maybe on other records.

427
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,401
Well,

428
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:21,350
I'm happy to hear it because it does take
a lot of the music in a new place. Um,

429
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,310
and speaking of the new place,

430
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:25,970
you spoke of a little bit of the Internet
coming to bite you a few years ago.

431
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,850
I'm skipping past that.
I know that for binary,

432
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,300
there are some videos and we
were speaking about it before.

433
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:34,700
These were things that you had
sort of independently done.

434
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,300
I'm wondering if you could talk about
what it's like to be, as we said before,

435
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:40,190
sort of an old artists,
uh,

436
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,930
approaching that way and being thrust
into the situation to where maybe now just

437
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:46,010
an album's not enough.

438
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,350
Yeah, I, yeah, that seems to be true.

439
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,660
I think I've just a focusing or you know,

440
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:55,810
I'm a working musician and
playing live for people,

441
00:32:55,811 --> 00:32:58,720
just being gathering with people.
I've,

442
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,570
I think the sort of fundamental,
uh,

443
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:09,850
reality of music as a social act is
really how I feel it and that's what

444
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:14,350
inspires me.
And so I think I'm most inspired on stage,

445
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,250
um, you know, spending an hour and a half,

446
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:23,251
two hours with people and the kind of
connections that you make and the kind of

447
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:28,900
less alone that we all feel when we
walk out of there. And the kind of,

448
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,540
that is what I live for.
Um,

449
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,340
and the rest of it,
I don't know,

450
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:40,990
it's all changed around me and I'd
be the last to really know, you know,

451
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:45,040
I think at one point in the
90s people were like, Ani,

452
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:48,310
how do you do it? You know,
show us how it's done.

453
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,150
And I'm so far from
being that guy anymore.

454
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,620
I'm an old lady and I have no idea how

455
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,350
you utilize the technology
and the media and

456
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,540
you know, to have a career
in music in the 21st century.

457
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:12,810
I just know that I like to play for
people live and if I can just do that and

458
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:17,650
pay my rent, tell I'm dead. I'll be okay.

459
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,680
When you were saying before that you
felt very flattered by your audiences

460
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,100
enjoying that moment with you in
participating in that moment with you.

461
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,860
I think it's very common for people to
go to shows and the first thing that

462
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:29,290
happens is the phone comes out.
Right?

463
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,900
Yeah. Right. We were talking
earlier this morning, um,

464
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,640
and I was telling Matthew,

465
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:40,500
I've have noticed this last couple
of months being on the road, um,

466
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,450
less, no phones, no
phones in the audience,

467
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:49,860
almost no phones, which is noticeable.

468
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,960
I feel like my audience where sort
of the last of the to bring to live,

469
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:58,280
you know,
the show through the phone and uh,

470
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,910
and when it came into this,

471
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,930
the space of my show is I just like,
ah,

472
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,810
I guess this is the world now.
This is,

473
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,900
there's nowhere to go that this
is not the world. So, all right.

474
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,540
And then these last
few months people just,

475
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,670
I got the feeling like people are,
haven't had enough.

476
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,141
They've had enough.

477
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:26,970
It's like I want an hour and a half of
being in a place and a time with the

478
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:30,090
people that I'm with.
And it just, it was like,

479
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,100
look at you guys.

480
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,150
There hasn't been one
glowing blue face tonight.

481
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,100
Congratulate fucking

482
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,480
lesions. We're all here. Maybe the um,

483
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,780
the escapism that the
phone initially served, uh,

484
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,020
is found again and putting the phone
away and, and actually being a part of,

485
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:53,240
yeah. Well we got deep. We got, did
you guys miss the whole conversation?

486
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,530
That meant anything cause we,

487
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,120
what's going on in new music and who
are the groundbreaking young artists of

488
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,391
today?

489
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:07,391
And I of course Peta will teach me
everything I need to know eventually about

490
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:07,851
that.

491
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:12,851
But we were wondering together if
this absorption into the Gizmos,

492
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:20,621
this endless distraction and
entertainment you know is has prevented a

493
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:26,210
generation or two of groundbreaking music.
You know,

494
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:27,440
you are not bored,

495
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,470
you are not desperate for connection so
you don't have to go into your garage

496
00:36:32,961 --> 00:36:37,961
and invent some convoluted
way to connect users.

497
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,390
But,
but we were,

498
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,830
we concluded this morning or
at least we left off with,

499
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,470
well maybe,

500
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,720
maybe we're moving past the
end list days of absorption.

501
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,930
Maybe that in itself is becoming
boring for young people.

502
00:36:56,931 --> 00:37:01,931
So maybe that next awesome band or
artist or what a is is right around the

503
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:05,650
corner now.
Hmm.

504
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:09,400
Well the, the speaking of next
is a good stepping off point.

505
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:12,100
So I will say that those of you
who have questions in the audience,

506
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:15,830
if you guys want to make
your way to a microphone, I
encourage you to do that. Oh,

507
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,510
spotlight right by the mic there.
Nice. Before we get into that,

508
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:21,250
I would like to talk a
little bit about next.

509
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:25,350
I know that next year has a lot of
interesting things. Cute up. Um,

510
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,810
specifically I think babe
fest is coming to New York.

511
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:34,490
Yeah, possibly. That's the
big idea babe fest in Central
Park. Oh, that would be no,

512
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,830
I hope. I hope. I hope.

513
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,630
Yeah. Anybody who has any
contacts with the summer stage,

514
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,960
people start pulling
your strings now a book,

515
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,420
but what else is coming up for for 2018

516
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,490
a book, a book, a book, what kind of book?

517
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,200
Complete sentences.

518
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,150
Spelling spelled all correctly.

519
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,270
Like I'm writing a book,
I'm trying to write a book and um,

520
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,090
are we,
are we talking to Ne Narrative?

521
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,260
We're talking memoir. Oh. But of
course it's all made up, right?

522
00:38:08,261 --> 00:38:12,340
We all, you know, we're all
just making up the story,

523
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,950
but I'm, I'm, yeah,

524
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,870
I is an idea that I floated for years,

525
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,440
you know, uh, back when I was, you know,

526
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:25,420
the groundbreaking indie girl,

527
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,980
the concept was more like part manual,
part memoir.

528
00:38:29,981 --> 00:38:31,720
This is what happened.
This is,

529
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:36,430
here's some tips on how course
that moment is past. Um,

530
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:42,220
and I'm just, I'm just
writing stories, uh,

531
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:46,780
in a different format. It's totally
different from songs and poems.

532
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,560
I,

533
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,030
it's crazy to me and it's all called
writing cause it's just feels so different

534
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,420
and it's processed. But I just, I dunno,

535
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:58,990
I just looking for challenges
I guess as a writer.

536
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:00,580
So that's what I'm up to.

537
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:00,981
Well,

538
00:39:00,981 --> 00:39:03,290
when you finish you'll have to come back
and we'll do this all again and talk

539
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:07,250
about it. Okay, cool. Let's take a
question from the audience. Uh, hi.

540
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:10,440
I had a bunch of questions, but
when I saw you sing with Pr, uh,

541
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,950
I flashed back to 20 years ago in
my home tone seeing a delayed Craig,

542
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,780
Chris Whitley, perform with his
daughter Trixie on stage, uh,

543
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,460
probably around the same age as Peter.

544
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,000
And so I'm kind of curious if you
could talk a little bit more about the

545
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:26,070
dynamics of a family and music,
uh,

546
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:30,080
who's nudging who to perform together on
stage. How does that decision get made?

547
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,590
Um,
how would you draw a line balancing,

548
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,620
exposing her to the public on a stage two
photos versus I'm helping her find her

549
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:42,800
own voice and her art and their
craft for about your music future.

550
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,860
Yeah. Cool. Cool. Um,
well I guess first of all,

551
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:50,970
I start with Shi. I started with
her what she wants, you know,

552
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,240
she's been touring with me a lot,
you know, when she was a kid,

553
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:56,400
she was a road baby til three and a half.

554
00:39:56,401 --> 00:40:01,401
And so she's pro at the touring business
and at some point more recently she

555
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:04,380
started saying,
mommy,

556
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:08,910
I want us to come sing on that
song or that. Okay. All right.

557
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,870
You know, don't push them
onstage, but say yes, if,

558
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:17,640
if that's what they choose
and it's, sorry, Peter,

559
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,710
that we're talking about. Yeah. Um,

560
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:25,010
but it made all the difference
for me as a working musician mom,

561
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,230
because
music was my first baby,

562
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,363
you know,

563
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:37,080
and the subsequent babies that have
arms and legs did day in and day,

564
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:40,770
not well for the guitar.
I mean,

565
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:45,720
they could be playing happily for if I
pick up the guitar and try to do my thing,

566
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,850
they shut me down, shut
me down. No drifting off,

567
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:54,810
mommy into your world.
Me. It's about me now.

568
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,460
And so that was hard as
an artist, you know, uh,

569
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:04,350
the little guy, I have a four year
old son and he's the same way now,

570
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:08,670
but as soon as peta decided
I want to be a part of that,

571
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,050
then it became our thing.
It was not my thing anymore.

572
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,210
And it changed everything. It changed
the whole atmosphere around music,

573
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:22,110
which is just thrilling to
me. I mean, I love to sing,

574
00:41:22,111 --> 00:41:26,250
but I love to sing with my daughter
even more, you know? So yeah.

575
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:29,520
Now that we can make it
something we do together,

576
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:33,240
it's opened up a new whole new era for us.

577
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,500
Paper question stick one from the side.
Excellent. Hello. Hi. Hi. First off,

578
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:40,830
thank you so much for coming.
Um,

579
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,930
I truly believe you are one
of the greatest poets of
our time and don't actually

580
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:47,570
have a question. This is a statement I'm
going to embarrass myself. I apologize.

581
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:52,250
Um, I was one of those kids. I grew up
in rural Michigan. I was the g and LGBT.

582
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:57,110
I didn't have anyone to talk to and your
music got me through and I would not be

583
00:41:57,111 --> 00:42:00,980
here today without you. So I just
wanted to say thank you. Thanks.

584
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:02,960
We had on but I get off
cause I'm probably gonna.

585
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,413
Yeah,

586
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,590
I'm going to cry with you.

587
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:15,760
Yes. Yay. Yay To realness and
being your whole authentic self.

588
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:19,150
Thank you for that moment
of vulnerability. Yeah,

589
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:21,340
I hear that a lot and it keeps,

590
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:25,150
it keeps me going
through the hard moments.

591
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,160
That means the world to me.

592
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,940
I got the question for me to you,
thank you as well,

593
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,530
but I want to kind of know about your,

594
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,980
how you feel about your brand
from an external standpoint.

595
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:43,610
I kind of see you have this personal
brand as I've been in this side of you all

596
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:47,040
of these years.
You now have a business brand,

597
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,820
you have this cultural brand as well.
And you also,

598
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:54,840
now I'm hearing you have this other thing
that's mommy hood that might prevent

599
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,490
either the evolution of, or the
building or separation of another brand.

600
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,410
What does your brand mean to you?

601
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,110
And can you share your
thoughts of that over time?

602
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,030
Yeah, sure. Um, let me see.

603
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:14,200
I think what I tend to do
is not think about it. Yeah.

604
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,113
Okay.

605
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,820
I, um, when,

606
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:25,570
when you were talking about the
elements in your question, um,

607
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,100
I was thinking about a story.

608
00:43:29,101 --> 00:43:33,690
I hear so many wonderful stories from
people who have intersected my music or my

609
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:38,640
brand to even, um, I heard a story,

610
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:42,030
you know, and I get these
letters and, and uh,

611
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:46,770
the judge just like food for me, you
know, that, that nourish me back.

612
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,910
And, uh, I got a letter a little
while ago from a mom who, uh,

613
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,590
is a fan of my work and she had
a righteous babe sweatshirt,

614
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,900
you know, with the logo. Um,

615
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,790
and her young daughter said to her,
mommy, is that a girl or a boy? You know,

616
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,420
striking this muscle man pose,
but with a skirt, you know,

617
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:16,010
the little logo that started off
as a picture of me hamming it up,

618
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,220
you know, I hate cameras, so I'm
going to do something ridiculous.

619
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:23,180
And then that became the logo and
that became the brand, you know,

620
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:26,610
righteous babe.
And um,

621
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,730
so here's a little girl who I don't know,

622
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,970
talking to her mom who's found
something in my music. Mommy,

623
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:37,020
is that a girl or a boy? That's a
girl, sweetie. And then she took,

624
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:40,800
the little girl said is,
she's so, so, so, so strong.

625
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:46,920
And her mom said, yeah, she's
so, so, so, so strong. And she,

626
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:48,450
you know,
and this is all in the letter.

627
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:52,770
And then she said there was a
pause and her five year old said,

628
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,570
I want to be like that. And
I thought, Whoa, a logo.

629
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,713
Hmm.

630
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:00,790
I,

631
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,480
and I don't think that that's going to
inspire me to think about it or how can I

632
00:45:04,481 --> 00:45:09,481
tweak the logo or how can we work
the brand to make more value for,

633
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,220
I just try to
do what I do and be who I am.

634
00:45:15,221 --> 00:45:20,110
And write the best song I can be and
give it in the most honest way I can in

635
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:24,670
whatever moment and hope that
these peripheral things like,

636
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,201
you know,

637
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:31,201
the idea of righteous babe records and
the look of that logo and we'll do their

638
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:34,480
own work around that.
You know,

639
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:38,860
if I just stay focused on what I
know and what I'm good at, that,

640
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,670
you know, those, those peripheral
things like the righteous bay brand.

641
00:45:42,671 --> 00:45:46,200
I mean we are trying to put
a festival together and,

642
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:50,770
and maybe I have been inspired by
my new team to contemplate it more,

643
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,850
um,
to try to reinvent righteous babe.

644
00:45:54,851 --> 00:45:58,160
And what does it mean to
stand at the intersection of,

645
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:03,161
of art and politics and who else can
we help or invite in or what other

646
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:07,060
communities can we help,
uh,

647
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,740
to bring closer together to make
stronger through a festivals,

648
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:12,670
through a brand did festival,
you know,

649
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:18,270
so I try to work with people who
do understand such things and can,

650
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:23,590
you know, build momentum around them.
But for me, I just try to, you know,

651
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,360
focus on being an artist

652
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,860
and a mom.
Yeah.

653
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,370
A, it's curious, I'm going to
follow up on her question if I can,

654
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:36,610
cause the label came out of it as
a function of need, right? Uh, you,

655
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,820
you created it not to hate,

656
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:40,860
we're going to make a ton of
money by releasing albums,

657
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:43,950
but because you needed a
way to get your music out.

658
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,360
And I think what I have noticed is
even with other artists on the label,

659
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,860
it's not out of,
hey,

660
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:51,600
we're going to put this out and
make a ton of money off of it,

661
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:54,210
but it seems to come from
this music deserves it.

662
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,300
And I wonder if that
functionality speaks to,

663
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,870
to what you were saying as
far as not having to worry
about developing the brand,

664
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,210
just doing what needs to get done.

665
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,271
Yeah.
Yeah.

666
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:09,070
It's one of the great ironies
of my existence if you're me,

667
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:14,071
is this label entrepreneur that has
followed my name for 30 years and it's so

668
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,610
not the point.

669
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,620
It's like so far from the point that it's,

670
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:28,450
it used to really bug me, you know what
I mean? Of all the things that, you know,

671
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:32,140
songwriter, activists,
some, some entrepreneur,

672
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,420
you know. Okay. Right. I guess
I started a record company,

673
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:43,000
but the whole point was really to
avoid the music business. You know,

674
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:48,001
the whole point was can you just make
music your job without having to,

675
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,483
you know,

676
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,830
get in bed with business
people, prof, you know,

677
00:47:55,831 --> 00:48:00,030
bottom line oriented people.

678
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,680
Not that the music industry is full
of bad people, they're good people.

679
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,540
Uh,
it just,

680
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,760
I think I was such an idealistic
kid that it's sort of, I looked at,

681
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:12,811
you know,

682
00:48:12,811 --> 00:48:17,610
the intersection of sort of business
and corporate culture and an art.

683
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:19,470
And I see commodification,

684
00:48:19,471 --> 00:48:23,010
I see everything beautiful and
vital come out of the underground,

685
00:48:23,011 --> 00:48:27,230
get commodified and die, you
know? And I thought, yeah,

686
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,580
I don't want to be a part of that process,
even if it serves me, you know, I just,

687
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,660
I find that to be such a
bummer. Um, what, uh, what,

688
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:40,890
how else could it be done? You
know? So the point was really just

689
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,110
to never too, I mean for me to
just follow my teachers, you know,

690
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:52,111
the people that really made my world
bigger and less about myself instead of,

691
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,760
you know, you should wear this and play
this song and make this happen and do,

692
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,350
here's how to, you know, it's just
like, I don't want to think about that.

693
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:07,180
I want to think about something
meaningful. You know? So

694
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,430
yeah, I guess it was just like a,
it was a problem solving process.

695
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:17,170
It was never about running
a record company, but about
how can I dedicate it as,

696
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:21,040
as little energy in that
direction as possible.

697
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,160
Yeah.

698
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,340
We are running close to time,

699
00:49:23,341 --> 00:49:26,930
so if you guys have a couple more
questions with taken please. Hello? Hello.

700
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:27,301
All right,

701
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:30,090
so that actually dovetails perfectly
with my question because I'm curious,

702
00:49:30,091 --> 00:49:31,560
you said you set up the record label,

703
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,950
not out of the joy of wanting to run
and be a business owner, but just to,

704
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:35,551
you know,

705
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:38,940
improve your direct connection with the
audience and be able to get your music

706
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:42,720
to more people. And I'm curious if like
now speaking of the ones and Zeros,

707
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:45,060
do you feel like that's still working
or do you feel like you're sort of

708
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,470
inevitably in an embrace with Spotify,
Pandora, apple music, Google play music,

709
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:53,430
whoever, uh, and if you were a
young artist starting out right now,

710
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,300
would you try to leverage those or would
you still try and do the whole thing

711
00:49:57,301 --> 00:49:58,134
yourself?

712
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,640
I mean,
there's so much to know and navigate now,

713
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:08,530
you know,
to have a career in music.

714
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:14,130
And I certainly don't think I'm a voice
of authority or knowing necessarily,

715
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:19,990
um, my basic approach is
to just let go, you know,

716
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:23,770
to just let go too,
you know,

717
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:28,640
as the music business and the world of,
you know,

718
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:29,810
changed around me,

719
00:50:29,811 --> 00:50:34,280
like let go of the old and
there's music free now.

720
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:39,281
And can musicians have a job of music if
it's just free and you can't commodify

721
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:45,830
it at all, or how do you, and the
little guy is struggling so much and,

722
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,330
and you know, people have asked me what
I make about these streaming, you know,

723
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:54,880
and these, and for me, I think, uh,

724
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:58,610
you know,
I just have this sort of really basic,

725
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:04,550
you know, primal approach,
which is acceptance.

726
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,840
I can't control how
people get their music.

727
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,230
I,
I just let it all happen.

728
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,290
And I hope that the,

729
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,510
and I have found through this
just sort of ignorant but,

730
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:28,570
but faithful approach of I'm going to
apply as much consciousness as I can,

731
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,040
dig through my work and hope that that
comes back at me from the universe.

732
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:41,120
You know, hope that the universe
has a place for me in my art.

733
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,030
Um, it, it has found a place for
me. So I'm one of the lucky ones.

734
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:51,490
I mean, maybe it's easy for me to
speak in such trite terms because the,

735
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,940
the universe has held me
and I'm, I'm very lucky. Um,

736
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,290
but I think that when
you are in the groove,

737
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,160
when you're in the flow of yourself,
you know,

738
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:06,380
whoever you are and
whatever you have to offer,

739
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:10,250
there is a place in the universe for it,
you know,

740
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:14,120
so to calculate,
you know,

741
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:18,820
what obstacles, you know,
change the flow or guided or,

742
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:21,890
or, you know, I don't worry about that.

743
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:26,720
I just worry am I being true to myself?
Am I giving what I have to give?

744
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:30,470
Am I listening to,
you know,

745
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:33,530
the voices that guide me.
Um,

746
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,640
and uh, so far it's, it's worked out.

747
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:43,610
Yeah. I don't know if that's ever
the answer, but thank you. Thank you.

748
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,180
Well,

to come here and be with us today.

750
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:52,150
I want to thank you for your
thoughtfulness in this conversation.

751
00:52:52,151 --> 00:52:53,320
It's really been a pleasure

752
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,180
and I hope that everyone else would
join me in thanking you as well.

753
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,830
We are running close to time,
but I'm wondering if you would do us,

754
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,790
your honor, would you mind performing
another song? Yeah, we'll play one more.
