00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,060
Hello everyone. Welcome to this decoding
race series. So happy to have you here.

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,960
My name is Rachel [inaudible] and I'm
the project manager for race at Google

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,310
race that Google is a new comprehensive
effort across Google to organize around

4
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,400
racial justice issues.
Um, but more importantly,

5
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:27,401
this started back in 2013 after the
verdict of Trayvon Martin came out and a

6
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:33,470
group of BG enters, organize and
did a Hoodie march around campus.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,510
And that's when we really started
grappling with race issues.

8
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:39,830
So I just want to take a moment to
honor one of our panelists, Sabrina,

9
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:44,540
for her sacrifice to get us to this point
where we could have a packed out room

10
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,510
and have race dialogues that
everyone wants to participate in.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,900
And now I'm going to pass it along to
Felicia who's going to tell you she leaves

12
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:54,020
are decoding race series and she's going
to tell you a little bit more about

13
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,310
what you can expect from this talk.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey everyone.
Um,

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,840
first thank you so much for Rachel's
leadership and getting us to this point.

16
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:04,870
I started in January as the head
of black community engagement.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,680
And I'm so very proud of our
company, uh, here at Google,

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,740
being willing to have open and
constructive conversations on race.

19
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:15,070
I think it's a huge step forward and
it's no secret that in our country,

20
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:18,160
racial tensions are high.
And so we want him to have a,

21
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,610
or do our part here at Google to have
those conversations again constructively

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,370
with external leaders.
And so just thank you for being here.

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,730
This is the third of a series
of conversations happening. Uh,

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,050
so we're so glad that we could do this
in San Francisco and be sure to join us

25
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:36,010
also in mountain view. Uh, December
12th for can computers be racist,

26
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,720
but today is about deconstructing race.
And so again,

27
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,050
we want to make sure that we are in
a room where we can be open, honest,

28
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:46,300
constructive with each
other. Uh, so we definitely,

29
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,990
definitely look forward to a
conversation, but also an exchange, uh,

30
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:52,780
at the end of this program. So thank
you so much. Without further ado,

31
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:56,230
I want to bring to the stage
Michael Skolnik. Michael A,

32
00:01:56,231 --> 00:02:00,130
we contracted a to help us lead
the decoding race series. Uh,

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,810
he's done tremendous work already,

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,720
but even before his partnership
with Google on this,

35
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,700
he political advocacy, uh, for Russell
Simmons who we both worked for for years.

36
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:14,050
He's a national leader and activist in
his own right and we're so proud to have

37
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,570
him here as a strong supporter
and partner. So welcome Michael

38
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,740
[inaudible]

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,540
over here.
I want to thank the panelists.

40
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,450
These are all personal
dear friends of mine,

41
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,130
other flown from other country to be here.
Uh,

42
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,720
and our leaders are heroes and sheroes.
Um,

43
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,030
I sit on the board of the
Trayvon Martin Foundation,

44
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:42,720
so Sabrina and I work
very closely together. Um,

45
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,310
but so thank you all for taking
time out of your schedule,

46
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:48,250
especially during this
time, uh, to come here. Uh,

47
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,460
I would say think very briefly because I
know we want to hear from these amazing

48
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:55,570
people, uh, today. Um, the
day after the election, this,

49
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:58,030
this event was planned
way prior to thinking,

50
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:00,910
what would the outcome of the election
going to be? So there's no, um,

51
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,660
there was no quick maneuvering to
get this thing to happen today. Um,

52
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,190
this had been planned for a few months
now, but the day after the election,

53
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,040
I got a lot of phone calls from,

54
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,860
from friends or text messages and
emails from friends and family. Like,

55
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,750
what do we do? Um, from all
folks who voted for Trump,
folks who voted for Hillary,

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,733
what do we do?

57
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,380
And what I recommended to people to do
was to get together and have dinners in

58
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:29,560
their homes and just bring together
your family and your friends and your

59
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,850
colleagues. I invited 20 over
to my home on Wednesday night,

60
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,110
85 showed up. Uh, the
next night I invited 30,

61
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:42,560
90 showed up. So it's
no surprise Felicia, ah,

62
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,720
that best room was packed because I
think people want to get together in

63
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:51,190
community and have conversation.
But this is one of many. Uh,

64
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,210
so I would end by saying I am here
to be of service to you as Googlers.

65
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,460
We do have one coming up, uh, at mountain
view on the 12th. We have, I believe,

66
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:05,290
seven more after that are around the
country and around the world. Um, these,

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,520
uh, amazing people were folks
who are called on first. Uh,

68
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,290
but we have other folks we
want to call on after this.

69
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,890
So if there are people who you want
to come speak at your campuses,

70
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:19,840
across the country and across the world,
please let folks at Google know, um,

71
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,810
that you want them to come and
which we're taking, you know,

72
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:26,200
recommendations you want to bring the
best and the brightest minds we have in

73
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,120
this country and around
the world on this issue.

74
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,380
So please offer suggestions after
you hear this conversation today.

75
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,190
So this series really means something
to you. So without further ado,

76
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:39,310
I'm going to pass it off to my dear
friend, Michaela, Angela Davis,

77
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,200
who will lead the discussion today.
Thank you.

78
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,750
Thank you.
[inaudible]

79
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,170
Michael, thank you for setting, um,

80
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,420
setting the stage of this
as a conversation and, um,

81
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,380
I don't do panels. I don't
do keynotes. It's too real.

82
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,410
Like it's too real right now to not want
to make the effort to like really have

83
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:09,580
real talk. Where's my
sister? Felicia. Okay.

84
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,910
Don't get it twisted just
because he looks that years

85
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,740
girlfriend has been in the trenches
and I love you and there is no

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,800
mistake that it was sisters that put
this together because that's what we do.

87
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,390
So, uh, I appreciate it.

88
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,700
And on that note, I think it's first.

89
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,680
How y'all doing? No, I mean
real talk. How are you doing?

90
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:47,830
I I
there is um,

91
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,880
is very difficult to talk about something
as complicated and triggering as race

92
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:59,041
without particularly today
without checking in with
our humanity and a lot for a

93
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:05,231
lot of people they are rocked and terror
and traumatized and terrorize and it is

94
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:09,200
real. I haven't, you know,
I was talking to Felicia,

95
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:14,201
I have a 92 year old grandmother who
was a refugee from Jim crow south.

96
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,660
She was in World War Two.

97
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,820
She saw the assassination of Martin Luther
King and she told me my mother is the

98
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:26,210
worst thing that happened in her lifetime.
That's her.

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,160
For some people this is like, this
is the, this is the American dream.

100
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,520
We are having such a range of feelings,

101
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,760
like real ass feelings that
I d I just don't want to put,

102
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,780
I don't want to start this conversation
pretending that now we're just going,

103
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:48,500
we're going to solve race today at Google.
Right. But that we are um, that we,

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,560
that we ground this in our humanity and
in the ways that we can because I am

105
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:56,954
struggling.

106
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,790
I am radically revisiting
a lot of my relationships,

107
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,240
a lot of my projects, a lot
of my platforms. I am side,

108
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:09,320
I in so many people right now
when the numbers came out,

109
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,850
I'm going to just be honest.
I, I just, so I have to,

110
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,160
I want to be honest so we
can grow because they, we,

111
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,421
we can't be,

112
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:22,421
we can't shape shift around issues if
our intention is to understand each other

113
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,240
because sometimes it is more important
for I think for us to feel understood

114
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,410
than to be loved. Like I, you don't
have to like me and love me today,

115
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,650
but hopefully we walk away a
little bit more understanding.

116
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,980
So I just want to set that as my
attention today in this conversation is to

117
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:48,800
have, um, some honesty and get to
some understanding and understanding,

118
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,850
always leads to solution.
I think you look so familiar.

119
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,850
Yes. Hi. Anyway, so

120
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,930
it was just feeling your
editor. So, um, so I,

121
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,310
so instead of doing like
formal bio's, I'd love for, um,

122
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,810
and we'll start with you Jose.
First.

123
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,710
How are you feeling and how
do you identify yourself?

124
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:17,240
Like who are you as you
get to define yourself?

125
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,810
Um, I am a product of the bay
area, so this is where I'm from.

126
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:27,200
This is where I grew up. I grew up in
mountain view before Google got there,

127
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,210
okay.

128
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,250
To score at San Francisco state and lived
in Valencia and 17 when a studio was

129
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:38,170
$800.
So that's the first thing I would say.

130
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,900
Um,
but identity wise,

131
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,540
and I think identity is the
thread that ties it all together.

132
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:48,541
So I'm the Asian looking person
with a Hispanic name who's gay,

133
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,500
who was undocumented,

134
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,930
who majored in African American
studies at San Francisco State.

135
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,340
So that's my identity. What do you do? Um,

136
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,110
and then two years ago I made a
documentary for MTV called white people.

137
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,520
And I did that because I was really struck
after coming out as undocumented five

138
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,830
years ago, meeting so many young
white people across the country,

139
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:17,820
the millennial tolerant, diverse way
white millennials across the country.

140
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,870
I was struck that many of them
didn't know where they came from.

141
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,200
I mean in some ways immigration,

142
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:29,820
Angela Davis says it's like the link to
all of this because where we come from

143
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:34,650
and how we got here forcibly, right?
The African American slave experience,

144
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:38,550
right. Forced like nation, not forced
migration, whatever that is. Right.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,470
And all struck at how many young white
people we interviewed just didn't know

146
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,900
where they were from him. And then
I started thinking, wait a second.

147
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:49,620
So how do you ask me where
I'm from and how I got here.

148
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:53,730
If you don't know how you got here,
like white is not a country, right?

149
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,740
And we have an organization called
define american.com and the whole job is

150
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,060
actually who were,
as everybody's doing Mikaila,

151
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,080
like going through like how do we talk
about our work in this new atmosphere and

152
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:10,860
what we came up with and crazy seven
hour meeting the other day is this idea

153
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:14,190
that we're actually trying to do
is tell America's whole story.

154
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,660
The story that has never really
been told like here in the valley.

155
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,510
And having grown up here and having
a lot of friends who, you know,

156
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,900
work in the tech industry, we like
to say that immigrants built America.

157
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,730
The moment we say that we are leaving
behind leaving off two groups of people,

158
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,760
maybe of Americans and black people,
right?

159
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:37,050
Like that is how do we tell America's
whole story in that way? Um,

160
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,270
one last thing about my feeling,

161
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,840
my feeling right now is as you know,

162
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,940
undocumented immigrants,

163
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,590
people like me have been at
the heart of this campaign. Um,

164
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,660
I would argue that Donald Trump was very
smart in making integration a central

165
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:58,350
part of his campaign because most
people don't know what that is, right?

166
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,820
People here, no h one B visa,
you know, Dream Act maybe.

167
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,050
But for the most part I spent,

168
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,400
I visited 48 states and done like 850
events like this in the past five years.

169
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,010
Most Americans don't know what that is,
right?

170
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:15,510
And he was able to kind of use that as
a central part of the campaign and to

171
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:18,240
blame people.
Americans are struggling,

172
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,910
every American is struggling and they
want someone to blame and they think it's

173
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:24,930
us. And I wonder what happens
when he, he becomes president.

174
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:27,510
President takes the lighthouse right now,

175
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,260
you know there are 700,000
young people who are,

176
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:35,790
who came to this country as children
illegally whose names, addresses,

177
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:40,170
phone numbers have been
given to the government that
Donald Trump is going to be

178
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:41,004
in charge of.

179
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,690
And I'm just finding out that some of
those young people are actually Googlers

180
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,190
who have that. So what are y'all going
to do when he starts rounding them up?

181
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,040
What are you going to do?
Right, and what the showing up

182
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,740
for each other. Me and
I loved that. The panel,

183
00:11:56,741 --> 00:12:00,190
this is the versus it is
because I think representation,

184
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,530
like what do we all going to
do to show up for each other?

185
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,780
I think for me it's something
I'm really grappling with.

186
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,070
Um, I'm Krista Alonzo, I'm
a standup comic and, uh,

187
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,840
I feel
I feel broken.

188
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,080
Um,
I've been doing standup for 13 years.

189
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,190
I have traveled the country on the
road in a rental car by myself.

190
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,820
And, uh, I always felt
American. I was born in,

191
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,980
in Texas.
Um,

192
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,360
it wasn't till I started traveling by
myself that I realized how different the

193
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:41,900
country was. And, um,

194
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,760
I remember the first time I was, I wasn't
allowed to check into a hotel room,

195
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,050
which was in 2013.

196
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,910
And I was shocked and that's when it kind
of realized that I realized that life

197
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:04,311
was different outside of my bubble
when I went into the real country,

198
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,113
you know?
And,

199
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,380
and then I started realizing that I was
terrified of my life because I was put

200
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:15,210
in situations that were very
uncomfortable and I felt my God,

201
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,790
if I feel like that,
how many others don't feel like that.

202
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,530
It got to the point where I, um, I
used to do the Walmart test and a,

203
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:26,430
I would go into small towns and I go
to Walmart and if I saw that they had

204
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,890
Latino products,
I felt safe.

205
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,770
And if I didn't see the Latino products,

206
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,740
I wouldn't stay there
because I was scared.

207
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,860
Wait, let that settle in for a
second. Y'All feel that for a minute.

208
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,940
Particularly people that,
cause you know,

209
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,050
there are a lot of people in
here that could, maybe it's not,

210
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:50,430
they're looking for Latino, um, products,
but they have something similar,

211
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,050
right? If there's not a Martin
Luther King Boulevard maybe,

212
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,370
but settle into this, and this is for
the people of Whiteness in the room.

213
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,220
Particularly,
just imagine like

214
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,250
you're,

215
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,370
you're probably doing your own Google
search in your mind and there is nothing

216
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:11,670
like that, right? So just let that settle.

217
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,110
There's nothing in it,
in your database that goes,

218
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:21,111
let me check to see if I feel safe because
of my actual identity in this space.

219
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Okay. So just, okay.

220
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,100
Um, I think that for me, uh,

221
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,960
this election has been a
life changing for me because

222
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,470
being completely honest, that's it.
That's how we got, um, I realized that,

223
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:43,950
uh,
I was actually seen as illegal too,

224
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,840
a lot of people because of my skin color.

225
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,360
And that's when I realized
that the term illegal,

226
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,600
not white because you think
how many immigrants from
European countries can come

227
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:58,730
in here and nobody asks them,
Hey, where are your papers?

228
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,460
Because their skin color dictates that
they belong here to potential first.

229
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,640
Like I'm coming to that
soon to be first lady. Yes,

230
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,920
absolutely.
So for me,

231
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,120
when I feel like that and I was born
here and I belong here and I don't feel

232
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:23,810
like I belong here, my God, how
does that make everybody else feel?

233
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:24,321
And for me,

234
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:29,090
I think I want to talk about it because
I think the most important thing that we

235
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:33,470
have to do is listen and we
need to accept our truths.

236
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,730
We can't negate and say, that
didn't happen to you. It did happen.

237
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:40,730
That's why you said it,
and I think that's how we change things.

238
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,630
To actually take everything
that we say as truth,

239
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,060
process it and say,
you know what?

240
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,770
I might be part of the problem and that's
how we learn to accept that maybe we

241
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:56,771
don't have our eyes completely open
and maybe understand that I'm at fault.

242
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,060
It's something. Maybe there's
something, I don't know.

243
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,213
I'm broken.

244
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,050
I did a panel last week with the Lotus
[inaudible] who fought for farm workers,

245
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,920
farm workers union.

246
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,650
I was crying nonstop after the election
and I walked into the room to meet her

247
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:20,000
and we've known each other for years.
She's like, why are you crying like this?

248
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,410
This election broke me.

249
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,280
She said country felt like
that when Nixon got elected.

250
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,740
They let me tell you about how it felt
and to hear those emotions that you don't

251
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,590
read them books. It took
it to own life. She,

252
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,790
she was standing next to Bobby Kennedy
when he was assassinated and she

253
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,660
describes hope dying in front of her face.

254
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,660
And when she talks about it,

255
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,040
I realized that this is the first
setback I've been through personally.

256
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,800
And that's why I'm so affected by it.
But when you see her,

257
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:56,690
you realize we're going to get through
this. Yeah, it's going to be hard,

258
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,780
but we're going to get through this.

259
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,340
And sometimes you need to hear the
history of somebody else to accept it and

260
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:05,174
process it.

261
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,660
So it's a perfect

262
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,990
Sabrina because when you

263
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,140
talk about people going
through it and what,

264
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,070
what is difficult and what
is pain and who, you know,

265
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:30,650
we often get into pain Olympics and

266
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,900
my pain and I couldn't see my cat and

267
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,870
no real talk. And also who, how people,

268
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,970
what people can stand through. And
you know, we, we opened this by, um,

269
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,750
I think that you inspired
this and Sabrina,

270
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:55,050
I am just indulge me for a
second because I love you.

271
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,190
I saw it. I loved you before I met you.
I saw you stand one. What does that mean?

272
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,173
Yeah.

273
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,790
You started a different kind of activism
for me because my entry point to

274
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:09,930
Humana,
I'm just going to be real.

275
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:12,480
My entry point to humanity
is through black women.

276
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,190
That is my on ramp into most things.
That's my,

277
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,880
you know how I start?
So when Trayvon was murdered,

278
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,990
I look where there was a lone black woman
standing with microphones and met you

279
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:29,070
had buried your boy.

280
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,860
The hardest thing that anybody who is it,
you know in your personal life,

281
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:37,470
if you are a parent in this room,
you know what I just said?

282
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,733
Okay,

283
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,750
you did that and you still stood and you
still created a moot the mothers of the

284
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:49,620
movement. Be Clear.
We're in this election.

285
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,780
You all were on the front grounds. You
all, you all were in towns, in churches,

286
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:57,480
in beauty shops.
You had every,

287
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,220
you had every reason to be broken
in bitter. How the Valley Brogan,

288
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,520
you buried your baby that never goes away
and still you were able to see how you

289
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:14,100
could help move this
country forward. Ew. Ew.

290
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,910
Ew. Trayvon is our Emmett till.
We know that. We know this,

291
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,940
the black lives matter started

292
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,430
okay

293
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,950
as a rallying cry for people to try to,
to,

294
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,910
to heal around what happened to
Trayvon because he was our son.

295
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:33,911
He is our son and if he is our
son then you are sister forever.

296
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,240
So thank you.
And why I think it's really,

297
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:42,920
really important for you to be in any
room is because we do look at life through

298
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:47,921
our own sets of disappointments and is
hard to do that with juices like you,

299
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:55,310
like really like how and and
and so how are you feeling?

300
00:19:55,311 --> 00:20:00,311
And also I just sometimes get tired just
to be real real of we will make this

301
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,440
through this.
We're going to get up again.

302
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,730
Like there are times like I
don't want to live my life.

303
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:11,900
How much pain can we go through?
How much can we take?

304
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,130
And often people in the margins, that's,
I mean of course it's what we do.

305
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,250
Do we go to church, we got to our spirit,
we go to our flow, we go to each other.

306
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,390
But at some point when do we stop
getting knocked down? That's,

307
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,500
that's how I am today.
I might change,

308
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,340
but there are times that we
know we have to tell each other.

309
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:31,730
We won't be all right.
But sometimes it's like dance,

310
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,330
stop knocking us down.
Okay.

311
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,303
So,

312
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,450
oh,
and how do you identify who are you?

313
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,160
Before I was

314
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,810
Sabrina Fulton. Now I am Trayvon
Martin's mother. That's my name.

315
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:56,410
Trayvon Martin's mother.
And people even call me Ms. Martin,

316
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,270
which I have not been Ms. Martin and
many years cause I did divorce. I am.

317
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,990
And what I can't understand for the life
of me is how everybody can go through a

318
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:11,220
divorce and they don't
even see their exes.

319
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,770
But every time I turn around,
my ex is right here. And so

320
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:25,250
let me start off by saying my conversation
to you and what I have to say is not

321
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,680
polished,
is not filtered.

322
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,210
I may not say the right things
all the time, but it's how I feel.

323
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,760
Um,
when this happened,

324
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,470
I had a normal life,
you know,

325
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,000
uh, one house, one car,

326
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,380
two kids, Everage life. You know,

327
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:54,640
I was a government employee
working for the housing agency, um,

328
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,620
to try to assist low income residents.
Um, just normal life. I mean,

329
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:02,920
I had to save money to
take my kids on vacations.

330
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,750
I would go to work,

331
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:09,070
complain and keep looking at the
watch to this time to go home. I mean,

332
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,960
just an average things,
you know,

333
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,510
come home from work and asked my kids,
why didn't you take out the garbage?

334
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:20,740
Did you do your homework, cut your
hair, something, clean your room. Just,

335
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,190
just every day,
average things.

336
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:26,860
And I don't know how for the life of me,

337
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,340
my life got interrupted.

338
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,060
Okay.

339
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,030
So I constantly picked,

340
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:40,070
tell people however tie am because
this could have happened to anybody.

341
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,080
Average, average, average.

342
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,640
I want to continue to say that
to myself because I had a,

343
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,590
my family is very tight knit.
I have a very close family.

344
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,460
I have really good friends. I
have a strong church. I mean,

345
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,650
I think I did all the right things.

346
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,973
Okay.

347
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,560
And this happens to my son.

348
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,930
So it went from having a
decent average lifestyle. Um,

349
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:14,370
I'm from Miami, Florida. So
this looks like Miami and here,

350
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,070
you know, it's a mixture of everything.
It's not just African Americans,

351
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:23,460
it's everything is,
it's, it's Puerto Ricans,

352
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:27,900
it's kill Benz's Bahamians is Haitians,
Jamaicans is Colombian.

353
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,050
I mean everything. We have
everybody there. And, um,

354
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,080
I just don't understand for the life of
me how an average person paid my taxes.

355
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm a citizen. I paid my taxes, you
know, I to work, I saved my money.

356
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,760
I did whatever I needed to do to take
care of my household and my kids and to

357
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:53,900
get rid of my ex husband.

358
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,470
Okay.

359
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,760
So on a,
on a serious note,

360
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,880
I went from a very average
life to a broken life

361
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,660
and then it continued to break.

362
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,800
So not only did I know or I found out
my 17 year old son had been shot and

363
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:32,701
killed and not just shut in Keel because
I don't believe everything that was

364
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:38,680
told to me by the Sanford
Police Department and by
the person that killed my

365
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:43,150
son. I just don't, and
you wouldn't either. Um,

366
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,710
but it was a part of me that said that
I was never going to San Fran again

367
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,130
and that I was just going to try to pick
up the pieces to my life and move on.

368
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,970
But that never happened
because the mother in me,

369
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:05,030
even though my son was to seize the
mother and me came up and stood up because

370
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:11,730
my son was shot down. So let,
let me just say that again.

371
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,090
When my son was shot down,
I stood up.

372
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,440
You never heard Trayvon Martin's
name before February 26 2012

373
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,510
so it'll bring out some things in you
and they can bring us some negative and

374
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:32,880
you went and bring out
some positive in you.

375
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,940
So don't think for one second that was
not negative thoughts in my mind there

376
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:38,994
were,

377
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,540
but I chose not to act on those
negative things and I chose to try to do

378
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:47,160
something positive to you.
Well,

379
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:52,161
what had happened to my son and just
the play on terms and just the play on

380
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,080
words.
Beyonce had a video out there,

381
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,980
you know that remember name?
Yeah,

382
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,643
lemonade

383
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,440
is when you're tying something
sour into something sweet.

384
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,050
And so that was something that was very
important to me because I didn't want to

385
00:26:11,051 --> 00:26:16,051
live the rest of my life better because
it would have taken two lives instead of

386
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:20,020
one,
not only what Trayvon be deceased,

387
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,880
but I would be here on earth decease
and I had another son to live for.

388
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,230
I had my whole life to
live for and I decided,

389
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,380
I made up my own mind with
my broken pieces that were
on the floor that I wanted

390
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,990
to do something positive to help this
country because this country did not see

391
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:42,370
just how broken it was.

392
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,150
This country is broken.

393
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,290
We have to say that we have
to come to terms with it.

394
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,100
What is going on now is a reality show.

395
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,090
There's a show in is
happening to us and real life.

396
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,100
Well we have to say it,

397
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,730
a lot of people don't feel
like the justice system is
broken until you have a 17

398
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:12,080
year old son that's killed and you know
the exact person that shot and killed

399
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:14,420
him.
But because of a technicality,

400
00:27:14,421 --> 00:27:17,330
because of the laws and
how the laws are applied,

401
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,830
the person walked free
and not just walk free,

402
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:26,831
but continued to do things
to antagonize the situation.

403
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,380
Like sell a gun.

404
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,250
Really,
really?

405
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,610
You mean to tell me the gun
that stopped my 17 year old.

406
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,360
You have people bidding on it.
So by it,

407
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,160
think about that for a second.

408
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,350
I know we're all walking around
here with the heart. What?

409
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,360
Some people are heartless,
some people are actually heartless.

410
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,900
But what I decided to do is I refuse
to let somebody else's ideas and

411
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:05,500
suggestions and comments
determine who I am.

412
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,780
And so a lot of people tell me how strong
I am. It's not because I want to be,

413
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,990
it's because I have to do this for my son,

414
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,800
for my son that's in heaven
and my son is here on earth.

415
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,970
I don't have a choice.
This is my new life,

416
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,450
this is who I am and I will
continue to fight for all children.

417
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:32,350
And two, I rest in peace.
And so it does not matter.

418
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:37,351
When I hear a story on the news and it
talks about a six year old that had been

419
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,460
drowned in a pool or
got in a car accident,

420
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,590
I don't care the color
of that child's skin,

421
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,760
it does not matter and we have to get to
that space where it does not matter if

422
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:58,510
it's your six year old brother
or your six year old son.

423
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:03,630
It does not matter the color of his skin
because I can sit here right now before

424
00:29:05,051 --> 00:29:08,500
you and there are a lot
of things I can take off

425
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,970
my jacket, my blouse, my pants, my shoes,

426
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:18,180
but I cannot remove the color of my skin
nor do I want to because it's Hawaii.

427
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:21,944
I am

428
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:27,390
[inaudible].

429
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:30,730
Whenever I hear that,

430
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,770
when people say that the system is broken,
the country's broken.

431
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,950
I hear no,
I think the system is working and the,

432
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,080
I think that there are tons of,

433
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:49,081
we don't really acknowledge that we are
living in a post genocidal country at a

434
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:54,210
post. Like we started off with
stolen land and stolen labor. Yup,

435
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,600
that's true. The history.
Right? So perhaps,

436
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,290
and I'm not even here yet,
this is just a philosophical,

437
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:06,310
like I'm just working it out with y'all.
Perhaps we are not broken.

438
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:10,510
Perhaps we're getting closer to being
fixed because we started off with genocide

439
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,390
and slavery. Let's be clear. Yup. Right?

440
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,500
So how does even a post genocidal country
say that they were ever whole and how

441
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:24,811
does the justice system that was designed
to contain and you know most most

442
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:27,810
people,
so,

443
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,920
so hopefully I'll get there in my heart
that maybe sometimes healing and being

444
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,380
scars feel the same when they are
healing and when they are happening.

445
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:44,130
And so perhaps this pain
that we're experiencing isn't
the breaking it breaking

446
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:45,371
of America.

447
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:50,371
It may be the actual unifying of it
because now some people can actually feel,

448
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,980
this is the first time some of my white
liberal friends aren't life fucked up.

449
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,620
They're like,
oh my God,

450
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,580
what you've been saying is real.

451
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,610
Oh my God. You know, it's
not theory. It's real.

452
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,420
There's possibility in this moment y'all,
even though we're broken,

453
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:18,080
we're crying because this doesn't
happen to everybody. Sabrina list,

454
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,930
you know this, I've never heard
of white colleagues say, Oh,

455
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:23,540
I'm afraid my child might
not come home from school.

456
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,010
Okay?

457
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:25,420
And I,

458
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,950
I didn't see the fathers of Sandy Hook
get together march across the country and

459
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,420
talk about gun reform.
You did not have to do this.

460
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,510
There are people whose babies have been
killed by gun violence and they think,

461
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:37,820
oh my God,
that was a phenomenon,

462
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,000
a horrible phenomenon

463
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,840
that my young white child
got shot four black families.

464
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,820
Okay?

465
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,020
For Latino families, there are people,
there are mass graves at the border.

466
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:58,370
We don't even know your names.
They are Latino people being lynched.

467
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,500
We don't know their names.

468
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,510
So this doesn't happen to everybody.
Let's just be clear about that.

469
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:08,810
Let's be honest. You,
you are extraordinary,

470
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,680
okay?

471
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,680
[inaudible]

472
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,260
are you feeling and how do you define,

473
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,450
um, I'm feeling incredible amount of
dissonance. That's going to be the word.

474
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:30,470
I don't have a feeling word right now,
isn't it? Says where I'm, where I'm at.

475
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,410
And I think to your point of how do we,

476
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,830
when we're shifting from something
soured, it's something sweet. Uh,

477
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,300
moving to lemonade. It makes me think
alchemy, it makes me think of the process.

478
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,570
What does it take for a piece
of coal to become a diamond?

479
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:49,370
And it's an incredible amount of pressure
that's put on it and you have to face

480
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:54,140
face it if you're going to
actually Walter, that I want
to borrow from Juno Diaz.

481
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:59,090
I read the New Yorker article of artists
and I think this is such an important

482
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:01,400
time for people who are artists,
creatives,

483
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,450
writers to help us make
sense of the chaos,

484
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,910
make the chaos coherent is sort of
where we're at. And I think, um,

485
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,350
election night and the next morning I
reached out to one of my dissertation

486
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,590
advisors John Diamond and was like,
I don't understand.

487
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,980
I feel like I re reword it to like a
five year old. And it was like, you know,

488
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:20,990
like someone makes sense of this for me.

489
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,550
And one thing that I thought was
really useful about the way Juno Diaz

490
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:30,050
characterize it is he saying that we
are grappling with a level of rejection

491
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,290
that's at a macro level. I think
if you're black, if you're brown,

492
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,050
if you're Muslim,
if you're Lgbtq,

493
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,220
if you're a woman who didn't
vote for Trump, um, you're,

494
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,300
you're in a place of flow in a macro level
of rejection and incredible amount of

495
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,134
fear.

496
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,300
The vulnerability that I think most
many people have walked around with.

497
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:55,200
But I feel like it's heightened now. I've
been looking at the SPLC count of, uh,

498
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,750
incidents of harassment.
Yeah,

499
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,700
I think there are over 400 since
election night has been announced.

500
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,120
And just literally for me,
I have to like,

501
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,470
there's a prayer before I exited my door
of like lawyer wherever I encountered a

502
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:12,140
day, just, just like
cover me on the train.

503
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,780
There was a video of that
was put out or women on bark,

504
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,120
I think she was from Algeria and she
was recording a woman on Barton who's

505
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,270
telling her,
how are you going to be deported?

506
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:21,180
It Trump's going to send you out of here.
Um,

507
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,380
I used to be an elementary school
teacher and people who are teaching in

508
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:28,170
classrooms, um, that are in my network,
uh, where kids are yelling, you know,

509
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,940
build a wall to Latino kids
sitting in the classrooms. Um,

510
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,970
my dad who's immigrated from Nigeria sent
me a video yesterday morning of Trump

511
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:41,240
actually talking about not allowing
west African immigrants to come into the

512
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:44,900
country. Um, so I, I think
there's a level of fear.

513
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:47,090
There's a level of rejection
as a level of vulnerability.

514
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,790
And I see like we're in
morning and a lot of ways,

515
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,980
and I think that we're mourning this
experimental idea of democracy because I

516
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:57,740
think America is unique from other
countries in the sense that it's not to

517
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:00,320
roadshow and multiethnic,
multiple religions.

518
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,070
I'm all in one space and it does have a
history of genocide and the history of

519
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,870
involuntary immigration, um,
for, for, um, African peoples.

520
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:12,560
But I would say for the way that America
has pursued it's foreign interest,

521
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,250
what suggested even other people who
are immigrating here voluntarily,

522
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,830
you may not necessarily be
so volunteering. Right. Um,

523
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,630
so, um, I think there's
a level of despair.

524
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:27,230
I think what's been challenged is
our vision for this country, I think,

525
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,910
and the ideals that have been held up.

526
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:33,290
So most of us have been sold a story
since birth about what America is about

527
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,124
democracy.

528
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,400
And a lot of us who identify that people
identify white had been sold a real

529
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:41,760
good story about the history and a
lot of things have been left out.

530
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:43,880
A lot of things have been sugar coated.
Um,

531
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,760
and I think that a lot of people who
are in who are now just coming into this

532
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,970
and waking up like, oh my gosh,
I didn't even know this was real.

533
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,990
I think it says a lot about the bubble
and you've grown up in and what's the

534
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:58,500
implications of segregation?
The implications of like
the choices I've made.

535
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,150
The New People here can wake up and turn
on the television and see only people

536
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:04,320
who look like them on the TV.

537
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:07,950
They can go to any magazine rack and
the hundred most influential people all

538
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:10,800
look like them. The most beautiful
people in. We're always looked like that.

539
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,750
And they can go to their church,
they can go to the synagogue,

540
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,540
they can go to a funeral.
And it's everybody who looks like them,

541
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,760
the toys that they buy for their kids,

542
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,250
the media that they consume
in terms of entertainment.

543
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:23,230
Like sometimes I literally have
watched television and I'm just,

544
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,730
I'm gonna go through each station to
see if I can just find one black person,

545
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:31,500
like without going to be,
if I do find us,

546
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,300
like how are we being characterized?

547
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,420
Is there some variation or does it
fit the stereotypical narrative?

548
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,110
So I think I'm in a place of dissonance
and I'm in a place of, of mourning,

549
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,300
like deep mourning internally. And, um,

550
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,360
I have to think about my grandfather.

551
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:48,420
He was born in 1911 in Texas
and when I was very young,

552
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,390
I was still at his feet and
just stare at his hands.

553
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:56,750
And he had these hands that were full of
wrinkles and scars and tears and Marx.

554
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,270
And he had been working in cotton
fields since he was seven years old.

555
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,380
His mother was half native American,
half African American and wasn't slaved.

556
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,470
And I remember I would,
I don't know why,

557
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:11,520
but his hands just carried
the story of his family.

558
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,830
And what does it mean to pick cotton?
What does it mean to start doing that?

559
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,220
A seven years old? What does it
mean to have to drop out of school?

560
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,660
Because your older brothers were fighting
in a war then when in a country they

561
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:24,390
weren't citizens of, um, and,

562
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,020
and what it meant to actually
keep going back despite that.

563
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:32,430
And he adopted my mom. I'm at six months
old. We didn't have any kids of his own.

564
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And I sit with that right now of what it
meant for him to survive 1911 until he

565
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:42,960
passed.
And then like in the late nineties,

566
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,440
and I think about Dave Chappelle when he
talked about what it meant to be alive,

567
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,450
um,
through that time.

568
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:51,630
Like we just think about the depression
in and of itself would admit to survive

569
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:56,130
that if we think about the 1960s a number
of black people who were killed from

570
00:37:56,131 --> 00:38:00,330
like 1960 to 1969 in a very public forum.

571
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,560
I can't even imagine this psychic
violence that, that, that creates.

572
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:07,110
And those were all people who were, who
were activists, who were organizers,

573
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:08,490
who were putting themselves on the line.

574
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,540
And what does it mean now
for us to witness digitize
killings of black and Brown

575
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,870
people, native American people
on the Internet, on Facebook,

576
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,790
and the psychic violence
that creates for us. Um,

577
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:23,870
and then to have the same electorate that
supported Obama twice with elect Trump

578
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,210
now or select, I don't know if it was
elect yet, there's a popular vote,

579
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:31,660
didn't really count this time.
Um,

580
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,240
so I'm in a place of extreme dissonance
and incredible amount of, of morning.

581
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,780
Um, but I'm, I'm also, I'll
get to the hopeful place and,

582
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:42,400
and like less work and less fight,

583
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:46,450
but right now I want to sit in the
dissonance and I want to say it with the

584
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,283
morning.

585
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,690
Thank you that that's honest. I'm sorry.
This is really how this had to go today.

586
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,040
You know,
like we had to,

587
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:59,820
we couldn't get it all academic
about but we um, but we,

588
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,940
but we do want to be in conversation
so it would be great too to shift to,

589
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,710
to you. Um, oh great. Okay.

590
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,800
India.
Oh Great.

591
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,060
I'm going to read a question of,
of our door.

592
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:21,430
You were Googlers all over
the world. Um, are, um,

593
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,890
asking questions. Yes. I'm
not in the frame. I'm sorry.
Okay, here we go. All right.

594
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,551
Okay.

595
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:31,200
So we actually have someone from India
asking this question we hear a lot about,

596
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,000
so he's asking for a comment.

597
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,680
We hear a lot about black and Hispanic
experience experiences and related

598
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:38,401
interventions,

599
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:43,190
but not much about how other races
experience the multicultural workplace.

600
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,010
For example, Asians,
Indians who are also agents,

601
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,140
etc. So any comments on that?

602
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:54,460
Uh, have a lot to say about
this freight to see it here.

603
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:58,030
But here it goes back to
what Miguel is saying.

604
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,450
I actually think we are where we are
because our conversations are far too

605
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:05,470
comfortable and simplistic. We've had each
other in the back. We think we're down.

606
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,070
We think we know what's happening,
all of that. Before I say what I say,

607
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,690
I think I also from a, I've been just
doing a lot of reading is grounding me,

608
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:18,370
but I've been thinking that in some ways
11 nine that is when Donald Trump got

609
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:22,750
elected. It's in many ways the
culmination of nine 11 right?

610
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,710
After nine 11 we,
after we were terrorists as a country,

611
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:29,200
we started terrorizing each other,
right?

612
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,170
We sort of terrorizing each other
like the other and all of us.

613
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,440
I have to say that having traveled
the country like the other,

614
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:38,860
now many people feel are working
class white people. Right?

615
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:42,190
I can't tell you how many times I've
interviewed working class white people who

616
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:45,790
feel that they're not welcoming
their own country and I'm like, Yo,

617
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:48,580
you built this. What are you talking
about? Right. So that conversation,

618
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,610
so I'm going to name one
statistic that I think is crucial.

619
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,490
In the next 50 years in America,

620
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,910
88% of the total population growth is
going to come from Latinos and Asians.

621
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:06,690
88% at a time when the black lives matter
movement that you had sparked should

622
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,450
forever be central.

623
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,330
Because how we deal with anti blackness
and the Latino and the Asian community

624
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:14,860
in the Arab community is important.

625
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:20,020
And at a time when white people
are an emerging racial minority,

626
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,640
which is already the case in high schools
all across America and grade schools

627
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:24,550
in high schools across America.

628
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,860
Now it's fascinating whenever we talk
about race and identity that Asian people

629
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,410
who are now the fastest growing
racial and immigrant group,

630
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,330
72% of all Asian adults
in America are immigrants.

631
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,540
We are more immigrants than
Latinos are immigrants.

632
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:46,040
And yet we are just kind of
invisible in our, you know,

633
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,450
rice noodles, and I hate to
say it out, I'm just, you know,

634
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,340
I don't want to stereotype this,
but if you think about it,

635
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:57,350
the Asian community as it is, is a huge
community with different languages,

636
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,260
different cultures. We don't
all speak Spanish, you know,

637
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:03,710
the only thing that I've got that has
really organized Asian people in the past

638
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:08,711
two years was a letter
those edited on Google docs.

639
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,340
And I don't know if you remember this,

640
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,570
when Asian people in Twitter
started getting together
after Philando Casteel and

641
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:19,571
wrote an open letter to their families
about why they stand up for black lives.

642
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,000
And I remember going into the letter, I'm
like, I'm a journalist, I can copy edit.

643
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,630
So I'm copy editing the letter.
And at one point on Google doc,

644
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,140
this amazing Google doc thing,
there was like 200 of us.

645
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,550
Do you think Jose Mpas,

646
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,520
I mean just in the world of
engineering or safety standards,

647
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:43,521
often things are built because of some
kind of horror or tragedy or you know,

648
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,731
you know what I mean?

649
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:49,731
And so because we don't have a Trayvon
Martin to or or a build a wall,

650
00:42:49,771 --> 00:42:54,771
kill them all kind of thing too to attach
to the Latino community or you know,

651
00:42:55,571 --> 00:43:00,571
what are we seeing Muslims
being terrorized so we can
make so people emotionally

652
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,750
get involved.
Do you think that that has something

653
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:09,270
and I think because in this country to
be American has always been to be white,

654
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,030
white miss was constructed
to say you're not black.

655
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,540
And now that the most of the countries,
Latino and Asian, how we pass us white.

656
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,430
Like sometimes I wonder within my own
Asian friends and colleagues like how many

657
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:23,710
of us actually think were white
or better than white, right?

658
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,420
Like we're not even a part of that
conversation. And now that Asian people,

659
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:28,750
and I'm saying this is an uh,

660
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,440
someone who is undocumented
and has been doing this work,

661
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,970
it's been really lonely. How even in
the own, how in the Asian community,

662
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:39,060
this has been a silent,
for the most part silent issue.

663
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,420
The fastest growing undocumented
population are Asian immigrants.

664
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:47,190
One out of seven Koreans in this country
is undocumented. One out of seven. Right?

665
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:52,020
And so the fact that we have allowed
it to be racialized as a Latino Mexican

666
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:56,040
issue, right? We've allowed it. Right.

667
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:00,180
And what I struggle with is this
idea, now what do we do? Right?

668
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:02,910
Like there was a report that said that
apparently Asian people are now the most

669
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:05,430
affluent and educated
group of people in America,

670
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,370
yet civic involvement, like
what does citizenship, I was,

671
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,410
I gave this really
uncomfortable speech in Chicago.

672
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,920
The home of like a lot of Filipinos
make us a little bit. Yeah, so,

673
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:20,700
so it was like 300 Filipinos, you
know, and you know, I can't vote.

674
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,000
I've been here for 23 years
since I grew up amount of view,

675
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,830
but I'm here illegally so I don't
have any voting power. Right.

676
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,630
So I asked the audience, Hey, let me go,

677
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:32,520
here are American citizens like 90%
how many people are registered to vote?

678
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:37,660
Out of 300 people, maybe 10 and I'm like,

679
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,630
book the Lumpia down.
You know what we'll get is it's amazing.

680
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:46,500
I'm like,
are you freaking kidding me with this?

681
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:52,020
There is more to America than buying
an ice house and driving a Lexus and

682
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:54,930
earning the money so you can send
it home to the Philippines in boxes.

683
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,450
Like how are we going
to involve ourselves?

684
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,310
This is our home and the intersection
of race and immigration. Right?

685
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,510
The first group of people that
racially got excluded were Chinese.

686
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,650
The Chinese exclusion act in this country
with an in and giving me the American

687
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:15,090
citizenship rights until 1924 I would
argue that the black lives matter movement

688
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:18,300
is all about citizenship,
but it's way beyond papers a loss,

689
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:20,760
but it's about dignity.
So to me,

690
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:25,020
I actually think the question of
citizenship of how we earned that,

691
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,000
how many people here are American
citizens? Can you raise your hands?

692
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,750
Congratulations. I'm
so happy you are. Now.

693
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:35,130
The question though is what are you doing
to risk it and what have you done to

694
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:39,780
earn it and not to the people
who have always been marginalize,

695
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:40,860
right.

696
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:45,000
I would argue that I definition of
America for me are the people have always

697
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:47,220
been excluded from it
and have to fight for it.

698
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,460
All of us have done that in our capacity,
and I'm sorry,

699
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,660
just we're going to get
uncomfortable about this.

700
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,620
The conversation is really about
whiteness and how that is always central.

701
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,280
How it's always as if we always have
to explain who we are and how we got to

702
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:02,731
where we got.

703
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:05,940
I actually think we should start a
woman trying to explain why people,

704
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:07,210
how did you get to where you got

705
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:08,823
[inaudible].

706
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,070
Why, why do you think you're
the center of the world?

707
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,910
Why is it that when white people move,
it's manifest destiny,

708
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:18,540
it's the next frontier. It's
white man's burden. When we move,

709
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,910
it's a question of
legality and criminality.

710
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,550
How can my iPhone have more
migrant rights than I do?

711
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,113
Hmm.

712
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:31,020
I think that's an
essential question.

713
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,290
And all of us who are privileged,
you know, we are in San Francisco,

714
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,000
we are here like again,

715
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:39,210
the question is what are you
doing to risk your privilege?

716
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,740
How are you going to get them comfortable?

717
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,630
How are you going to get
out of your comfort zone?

718
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,170
How are you going to learn the
fullness of American history? Right?

719
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:49,110
And how are we going to advocate for us?
So I think that is kind of where I'm at.

720
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,140
And I feel like sometimes we,
you know,

721
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,600
dupont to Ella about shape
shifting. You know, like I always,

722
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,960
when I'm in front of Conservative
tea party Republicans,

723
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:04,200
like I was just at like last week I
have to go, okay, don't offend them.

724
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:08,850
Don't be the angry illegal
person. The smile, you know,

725
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:11,920
pronounce your words like Charlie rose.
Um,

726
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,010
and you know, I, I feel as if
my life and maybe Asian people,

727
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:19,080
because of our identity,
we were always so excluded,

728
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:24,330
always excluded that maybe because of
that we've internalized that exclusion,

729
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:29,460
but now we have to insist
on being included and we
have to insist on being too

730
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:30,460
[inaudible].

731
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,360
We're going to get a quick question.
Can I know, I know you can hold it.

732
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:39,740
Is there a question from the floor? I just
wanted to say thank you. First of all,

733
00:47:39,741 --> 00:47:41,390
even the discussion was about race.

734
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:45,590
You asked everyone what their identity
was and that is really important to me

735
00:47:45,591 --> 00:47:47,120
because what I consider myself,

736
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:51,860
my identity is not really race because
I feel other people don't look at me and

737
00:47:51,861 --> 00:47:55,670
see an Indian split I've always grown up
is people look at me and see religion.

738
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:00,080
So identify myself as a
sick who is often mistaken.

739
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:01,640
For the first 15 years of my life,

740
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,930
people would call me a Buddhist and then
the last 15 years of side 11 a muscle

741
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:10,670
and that's fine. I don't mind being
mistaken, someone I would like it to be.

742
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:12,290
It makes me happy when
people recognize me,

743
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:16,070
but it's fine because I think it's
important to accept everyone who they are.

744
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:17,690
For me personally,

745
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:22,250
I don't mind if people mistake me for
someone else or some something else.

746
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:27,050
What I do want is people to accept
others for who they are just too.

747
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:29,330
They are whoever,
however they label themselves.

748
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:34,430
My question is how do we promote
just acceptance right now?

749
00:48:34,431 --> 00:48:37,010
That's the biggest thing
which I think is dividing us.

750
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,970
Even if you feel some way or
spiel someone else's raw as,

751
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:44,210
and there's a lot of people who are
angry at like the people you were saying,

752
00:48:44,211 --> 00:48:45,440
who are,
you know,

753
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:49,310
the poor white middle class who felt
marginalized and there's all people who

754
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:50,450
just didn't accept them.

755
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,990
How do we just promote
acceptance in general and
what's the best way to go about

756
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:54,824
doing that?

757
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,170
One of the things.

758
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,060
One of the things that I would say is

759
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,050
as a human race,
we really have to get back to the basics.

760
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,310
We really have to start
respecting one another.

761
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,630
Regardless of your education level,

762
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:23,730
you can't possibly look at someone
and tell if they're educated or not.

763
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,020
It's just so not important.

764
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:32,021
What's important is that they are a human
being and you should care about them

765
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,950
merely because they are regardless.

766
00:49:36,951 --> 00:49:39,370
Nobody asks to be here.
You,

767
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,030
you didn't ask your parents to be born,
you didn't,

768
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,170
and so we have to make
the best of WHO's here.

769
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,560
I just have so much to say.

770
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:57,400
It's just hard for me
to put it into words,

771
00:49:57,401 --> 00:50:00,850
but we have to get back to
the basics and that's respect.

772
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,500
It doesn't matter if, if I have
long hair, if I have short hair,

773
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:10,210
I had dreadlocks of my hair is nappy.
If my hair is blonde,

774
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,920
Brunette,
Brown hair,

775
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:17,020
it doesn't matter if I wear glasses or
don't wear glasses or I'm short, I'm tall,

776
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:20,860
whatever religion I am,
it does not matter.

777
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,850
Can you just for a second, look to
the person to your right and just say

778
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,163
hello.

779
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,080
When was the last time you
just said hello? How are you?

780
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,930
We have to get back to the basics.

781
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,620
I'm a firm believer and
that it does not matter.

782
00:50:58,621 --> 00:51:01,440
All the things that
are put into our heads,

783
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,690
and I shouldn't say it by social
media and by the media, you know,

784
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,820
it's just so
those things are not important.

785
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,713
Hmm.

786
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,550
What's important is who's here,

787
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,420
what we're doing and how
we're going to move forward.

788
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,210
It does not matter your, your, your
nationality. It does not matter your race.

789
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,580
It does not matter your religion.

790
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,610
Everybody is a human being and
we should treat them as such.

791
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:34,950
Let's get back to the basics.

792
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:40,430
[inaudible]

793
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,070
well, why don't you go, I
want to get another question.

794
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:44,510
I know that that we're going to,

795
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:50,510
both of you can have ha prepared like
30 seconds. How do you want to respond?

796
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,820
But this is helping. We have to tell each
other stories. Okay, well how have you,

797
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,790
all of you can help us think about
how to move forward. Like how,

798
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,940
what frightens me is the level of
hatred that we have so much time,

799
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,230
so many hate crimes act.

800
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:09,880
And so instead of Hillary Clinton being
sad that she didn't win, how can we, um,

801
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,600
activate those people, President
Obama, Hilary Clinton to say,

802
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:18,750
how can we make a stand that those
ask are not going to be tolerated and

803
00:52:19,091 --> 00:52:22,750
prosecuted to the highest level of
the existing law that we have now?

804
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:26,200
How can we stem the tide and
everyone who felt differently,

805
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:31,040
what can we do actively to make
that stop? Did, do you mind if I,

806
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:35,710
if I throw that to Michael,
but just some fair, no,

807
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:40,190
not to shock you, but just some various,
you know, because there's some very,

808
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,020
there's some places to go.

809
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,240
So if you can just kind of give a couple
of websites or places to go to be very

810
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:49,130
pragmatic about that.
Okay.

811
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:52,250
Very pragmatic. But I'm also
going to segue to on my own show,

812
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:56,740
I think some southern poverty
law center, right? Aclu,

813
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,200
which organizations that need help,
I'm going to give you support.

814
00:52:59,201 --> 00:53:02,290
So go to the southern poverty law
center website and Slu on that specific

815
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:03,190
question on hate crimes.

816
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:07,330
We've seen 400 plus hate crimes since
the election of Donald Trump, uh,

817
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,250
reported in this country.
Um,

818
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:13,840
and that is what southern poverty law
center has seen in six months prior to

819
00:53:13,841 --> 00:53:18,610
that. So 401 week, six months
prior and reported hate crimes. Um,

820
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,740
so sort of those two
organizations you can go,

821
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:24,240
if you could give resources your time,
your energy. I think he was a help.

822
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:27,120
Can I just say that? I think
that, uh, we talk about,

823
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,370
we're talking about race
and we also have to,

824
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,790
we have to talk about why Trump won one.
Yeah.

825
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:39,260
And I think this is the theory is that
for eight years there were white people

826
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,820
that felt like they weren't listened to.

827
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,530
They weren't paid attention to what they
felt disenfranchised to solution and

828
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:54,270
they decided to do something about
it. And it's, it's cute for me

829
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:00,300
that it's eight years
because people of color,

830
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:03,270
that's what we live our
entire lives based out of.

831
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:07,500
Our entire existence is based out
of being uncomfortable, feeling,

832
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,820
feeling left out.

833
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:14,210
And it's weird to think that so many of
them under the Obama administration felt

834
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,384
like that,

835
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:20,490
but that shows that there's a problem
because they didn't feel like they were

836
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,324
being listened to.

837
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,530
We feel like we haven't been listened to
and I know I haven't been listened to.

838
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,110
I know my people haven't been listened to.
I mean look,

839
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:33,111
we're the guy won on the
premise of building a wall
and I have people calling me

840
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:39,330
illegal and say awful things
to me everyday of my life now.

841
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,490
It's weird to think the,

842
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:45,720
the Midwest

843
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:52,640
felt like a person of color did for eight
years and they did something about it.

844
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:57,810
I think it's interesting that we're in
this room talking about hundreds of years

845
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,940
and we're still trying to catch
up in eight years. They got to,

846
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:07,560
they got to have their voice spoken and
here we are saying it's been hundreds of

847
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,430
years.
What do we do?

848
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,300
And it's weird to think that in order
to make any kind of advancement,

849
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:13,800
we really do.

850
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,300
We have to pay attention to what we're
saying because that's the only way that

851
00:55:18,301 --> 00:55:22,770
we can move forward to make
each other feel like we matter.

852
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:28,410
We have to matter. That's I think
one of the most important steps.

853
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:31,790
What do we do? How do we fight?
How do we let her voice heard? Um,

854
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:37,260
except everybody for what they're saying,
even though you may not agree.

855
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,210
I think that in order
to make any progress,

856
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:44,211
we have to make the country
very uncomfortable for a
long time now until they

857
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:45,774
listen.

858
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:46,471
All right,

859
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:51,471
talk [inaudible] we all know every,

860
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,740
everybody these

861
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,900
tradition, they tell stories and
that's what you hear someone's story.

862
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:05,100
You can't unhear it.

863
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,580
And so I want to thank you for
giving us a space to share this.

864
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:16,650
Now everyone knows a little
bit more about somebody and um,

865
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,780
there's power,
there's power in and then it,

866
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,380
even though we're all tripping
and broken and feeling crazy,

867
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:27,560
I do feel there's a lot of smart people
in this room and there is opportunity in

868
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:31,750
tragedy always. Sabrina is
testimony to that, right?

869
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,350
So take care.
I think we need to take care of ourselves.

870
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:39,570
And everybody get their
10 sessions, but, um,

871
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,940
but feel like,
be available to the opera.

872
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:46,660
There are hundreds of thousands of young
people in the street that are letting

873
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:51,400
us know something that the future does it,
the future is not comfortable.

874
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,150
Right.

875
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:56,650
So I feel very encouraged by that if we're
seeing like all these youth uprisings

876
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:59,900
and they're very mixed. They
look like this room. So, um,

877
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,760
thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.

878
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:08,810
[inaudible].
