1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,000
Beth kobliner is one of the nation's
leading authorities on personal finance.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,750
I measure this fact by the fact
that she's been on sesame street,

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,140
which I find pretty, I'm pretty
star struck now. In addition,

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,920
she also served on President Obama's
Advisory Council for financial capability

5
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:26,170
for young Americans.
So however you want to measure it,

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,040
Beth knows what she's talking about.
So please welcome Beth Kobliner.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,763
Okay.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,430
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thanks so much for, for coming.

9
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:38,020
You've been on a pretty
big book tour so far.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,430
I was in Detroit, Chicago, Atlanta,

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,290
um,
Ann Arbor,

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,130
and now I'm going for the next leg
leaving on Thursday to the west coast.

13
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:50,600
So a lot,
a lot going on.

14
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:55,601
It's fascinating to be meeting
parents with kids of all ages.

15
00:00:56,121 --> 00:01:00,950
I look at you all his
kids. Um, and so I, uh,

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,710
yeah, no, it's great. I wanted to just
say two quick things. Is that okay?

17
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:08,510
Just to start really, the first
is, um, my dad is in the audience.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,220
He's 87 years old.
Harold's Kobliner.

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,143
Okay.

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,530
And it's very cute. Cause my
dad among, he was an educator,

21
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,800
a principal then chairman of,
it's called the board of examiners,

22
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:24,740
which was the organization
that tested teachers,

23
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,110
principals and superintendents
in New York City.

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,590
And he also was a great role model about
money and he loves to this day to go

25
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:37,811
into the local supermarket and hand out
flyers about my book to anyone he meets.

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,830
He actually single handedly sold four
copies in Barnes and noble on the upper

27
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:46,520
west side yesterday. Just like talking to
parents. Oh my daughter wrote this book,

28
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,360
Simon and Schuster said we had a real
spike in south on the upper west side. Um,

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,640
and so he hands out fliers and he always
gives them to people in stores who he

30
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,320
really likes and who are helpful.
And,

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,490
and in addition to giving him like
the freshest soy milk in the back, um,

32
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,630
they also often say to him,
thank you for teaching me the secrets.

33
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,830
I didn't know these basic money issues.
Um,

34
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,890
and that's always been very touching
to him and touching to me and my mom.

35
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:20,070
And,
um,

36
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,660
I just wanted to say that the reason
I wrote the book was basically to like

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,800
share that wisdom that I grew up with
and had been writing about for 30 years,

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,510
uh, with people. So that
was the first thing. And the
second thing is, okay, yeah,

39
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:33,800
I'm, I'm, I'm old.

40
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:38,390
So I've been on Oprah and taught
Elmo about money and you know,

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,640
met with President Obama about children
and money. But the one thing now,

42
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:47,960
my daughter's 21 and my son's
18 and the little one's 13.

43
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,480
And the one thing they've
been impressed by, I'm like,

44
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,700
I'm speaking at Google today.
And they're like, no. Wow. Wow.

45
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,030
So Google,
I've never been,

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,050
it's really exciting and I
know how smart you all are.

47
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,180
Thanks. And I, we definitely do still,

48
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:10,870
I'm sure I have things to learn from this
book. Maybe one or two. I don't know.

49
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:13,810
I felt like I learned a lot reading it.
Um,

50
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,290
cause the book works off the premise that
parents should be teaching their kids

51
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:24,291
good money habits from preschool
all the way through young adulthood.

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,500
And you say in the book that a child's
basic money habits are formed by the age

53
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:29,400
of seven,

54
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,540
which I hope is not terrifying to any
parents of 10 year olds in the audience.

55
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,070
Sorry. Um, what,

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,390
what sorts of things are kids under seven
picking up on that are really locking

57
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:43,224
in those habits?

58
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,170
Well, there's some really good research
done by a woman named Corrine Holdin at,

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,940
uh, University of Wisconsin.
And I met her on sesame street,

60
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,020
I should say. I met her on the
street, sesame street. Um, but I did.

61
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,530
And she's done some remarkable research
looking at what three year olds

62
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,630
understand and she found,

63
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:06,710
they understand exchange when you
give money for something more.

64
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:10,190
Like if you give a card for something,
they get something back.

65
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,580
They see that happening. They
understand value. You know,

66
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,970
a diamond ring is more
valuable than a pair of shoes,

67
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,980
although it depends upon what
shoes you're talking about. And um,

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,210
also they understand the basic
concept of needs versus wants.

69
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,800
So if you go shopping in a supermarket
with a young child, you can say,

70
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:33,350
you know what,
we really need milk.

71
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,100
But we really want chocolate milk
or we really need vegetables,

72
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:41,090
but we really want potato chips and
we're going to spend most of our money on

73
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:45,980
things we need. And you could
play the game, need, want
game. And then, um, you know,

74
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,080
as a kid gets older, he was
like, how do we find the,

75
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,330
the less expensive brand and what are
the trade offs and all those sort of

76
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:52,730
things you could do in a supermarket.

77
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,060
But I think it's key that talking
to kids at very young ages,

78
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:59,414
like,
you know,

79
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,420
as little as three really has an impact
on having them understand these concepts

80
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:11,270
more and more. Um, which is really,
you know, I was surprised by that.

81
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:14,320
I didn't really realize
that. Um, and then the,

82
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,340
the scary one was a Cambridge University
did a study and they said by age seven,

83
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:25,961
many of those behaviors that we associate
with money habits are actually set by

84
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:28,724
age seven.

85
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,800
So I think they're talking more about
like delayed gratification and executive

86
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:38,360
function,
but it's not that it's absolutely set.

87
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,160
There's a lot of, there's a lot more to
teach an eight year olds up. Um, I think,

88
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,380
and that comes from everyday moments,
you know,

89
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,870
whether it's talking to your kid about,
okay,

90
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:53,990
I'm going to go buy a car. It's my editor.
He got my buck. And he's like, you know,

91
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:55,220
I,
I never would've thought of that,

92
00:05:55,221 --> 00:06:00,200
but I brought my 10 year old
to the dealership because
I would think actually be

93
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,450
bored. But I brought her and I
started telling her, oh, okay,

94
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:06,110
well having to buy a car, this is what
the price is. I'm gonna try to negotiate.

95
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,320
I'm gonna interest rate. Maybe I'll go
to a bank for the interest rate or mean.

96
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,970
And those conversations are, are,
and those experiences frankly,

97
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,700
are pretty meaningful
for kids. You know, it's,

98
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,620
it's with everything digital and online.
I think it's,

99
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,830
it's really essential that parents
start doing that at many ages.

100
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,260
You know,
as kids get older.

101
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,400
Yeah. To a certain extent.
That sounds like an extension
of good parenting. Right?

102
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,810
Oh, absolutely. And to your kid, why
you're doing what you're doing, right.

103
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,170
Let them into those decisions. Yeah. Um,

104
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,280
make sure that things that would otherwise
go and spoken or sort of explained

105
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:47,281
and gratified what happens to a kid
who's parents don't consciously make an

106
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:51,580
effort to teach them
about money and finance.

107
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,140
Yeah. I mean, what we're seeing
is, so two years ago, uh,

108
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,400
the government participated
in the international test
for 15 year olds at it's

109
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:05,580
called Piza is the test.
And what was ironic,

110
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,860
I was on the president's
council at the time and like,

111
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,850
we couldn't come up with a $200,000 to
participate in this test, which is like,

112
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:16,800
okay, we as a government, but we did and
we were able to take this test, you know,

113
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,910
and,
um,

114
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,210
we found that 15 year olds in
the United States are mediocre,

115
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,770
like right in the middle. So their
countries, many, many countries, uh,

116
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,800
from all over that I'm doing
so much better than we are
in teaching kids basics.

117
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,130
And we're talking basics,

118
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,400
understanding the interest
rate on a credit card or
even being able to dissect a

119
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:44,950
paycheck, like not understanding
where that money's going,
whether it's, you know,

120
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,940
social security or tax or,

121
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,260
so I have in my book a chart on
all that. Um, but I also, you know,

122
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:57,210
it's so clear that our
nation by not under,

123
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,580
you know, someone I work
with said Pr, you know,

124
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,670
financial rights are civil rights and
if you understand that it's a mistake to

125
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:09,891
get into credit card debt that's charging
you 18% or if you understand that if

126
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:12,660
you miss a student loan payment,

127
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,370
that will likely go on your credit
record for seven years. You know,

128
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,270
those kinds of things.

129
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:23,271
I've had so many people tell me I didn't
know and I want my kids to know and to

130
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:27,430
understand this, you know, at
an age appropriate ways. Okay.

131
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,690
Yeah. It's interesting where
you say, you just said that, um,

132
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,490
one way of looking at it is that,
you know,

133
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,280
financial issues are civil rights issues.

134
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,310
Cause you mentioned a
statistic in the book that, um,

135
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,470
nearly half of all Americans couldn't
pull together $2,000 for a number of,

136
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,000
and this isn't just half of all Americans
don't have $2,000 in the back plate,

137
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,350
but they wouldn't be able to
borrow it from friends and fam,

138
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,250
like they could not get
right to can even get it.

139
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,770
Like you think, Oh, use your credit card.

140
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:59,580
They didn't have access
to credit to get $2,000.

141
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,550
So it probably means that they,
we don't know exactly,

142
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:07,470
but probably means that they, they are in
credit trouble and they were no longer,

143
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,830
no longer had a line of credit.
So when you think of that,

144
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:14,070
that's pretty terrifying.
It's like financial,

145
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,020
I've heard a call financial fragility
or finance, like we're so, uh,

146
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,700
um, unsecure. We're
not financially secure.

147
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,590
And I think that is so important.
Just the concept of, you know,

148
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:32,820
saving up money and, and I,
the more I've been touring,

149
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,540
I really strongly believe,
oh, and your Google,

150
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:40,440
you could make it help me make this
happen. I think cash is cash to come back.

151
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,300
I really think that I'm not getting
any nods or like, Nah, but when,

152
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,300
you know,
when I was a kid,

153
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,360
my parents would sit at the kitchen table
and my mom and dad would pay the bills

154
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:54,750
together and there were a pile of bills
and they'd write a check and the balance.

155
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,850
How many people here balance a
checkbook? Honestly, one person.

156
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,620
So interesting. My Dad could stand up
and tell you how many over 87 years,

157
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:09,150
how many times he found errors
in the bank math. But anyway, so,

158
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,043
um,

159
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,000
and I know you're all making a decision
of like time versus money and you know,

160
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:19,080
my time is worth more than checking to
find the $10 mistake. So, but you know,

161
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:23,130
sometimes there are mistakes
and I think for kids, you know,

162
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:27,690
my favorite story in the book as a mom
going to target with her son and he was

163
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:32,310
about eight or nine and she was buying
juice boxes and she pulled out a 20 and

164
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:36,570
her kids and mommy don't pay for it. Use
the card, you know, that's the way to,

165
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,550
you get it for free if you use the card.
And I think that mindset,

166
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:46,551
particularly for younger kids and of
course now Venmo and all the ways people

167
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:49,780
are exchanging money without exchanging
money. And we know that, you know,

168
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,030
MIT did a study years ago showing that
people spend twice as much if you use a

169
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:57,550
card then if you use cash.
Um,

170
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,690
and I think the pain of paying is
something when you fork over dollars,

171
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:07,290
it feels like, oh, I'm really giving up
something that's a behavioral economics.

172
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,310
Um, uh, finding. So I think the,

173
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,460
the inability to make a connection between
I'm buying things and I'm going into

174
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:22,110
a bank and getting money instead of
it all being online or I'm, you know,

175
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,250
I think that that is something that
children are missing out on and a great

176
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:29,190
parent would say, Hey, come on
over. I'm paying the bills online,

177
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,730
but it doesn't really look like any
different to a four year old or five year

178
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:33,630
old.
And you know,

179
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:37,140
someone doing work because it's hard to
sort of make that connection versus the

180
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:38,730
concrete experience.

181
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,420
So you in the book you advocate for,

182
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:46,350
you advocate against giving, you
know, middle schoolers and teenagers,

183
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:49,130
prepaid debit cards, like
have them work on cash. Yeah.

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,200
But it sounds also like adults would
benefit from working in cash to,

185
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,570
you know, or at least modeling
it for your child. I mean,

186
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,610
that's how I learned to make change.
My,

187
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,810
I had about four jobs in high school
and one of them was working at the local

188
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:09,220
diner this spring. I'm from
Queens originally. And um,

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,610
uh, that was one of my first jobs and
no, it was an AP math. Um, but I don't,

190
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:18,700
I'm not, that was my top subject. We
both bonded. We went to Brown, so,

191
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,130
but English major, but when
I was, uh, making change,

192
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,710
I remember that somebody,

193
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,680
it would be like $3 and 84 cents
bill and they'd give me a 10.

194
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,460
So I try to like subtract it in my
head and me and my dad's like, no,

195
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,720
you just count up. If it's 34
cents a penny for 35 then you know,

196
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,890
counting up all the way to $10.
And I learned that with cash.

197
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:46,270
And I think just the counting people,
not under a little kids,

198
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:50,800
not knowing coins or dollar bills.
I think that's all part of it.

199
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:54,340
And I think that is all important.
Um,

200
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,970
not that we will get rid of our credit
cards. They're super convenient,

201
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,960
but you know, if you're of course using
a credit card and paying it off in full,

202
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,660
it's good to do that.
It's good to have a credit record.

203
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,330
But I think that that's been pushed.

204
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,190
We too early and I think
kids are missing out. Yeah.

205
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,320
You, you're, so we've already touched on
a couple of specific bits of advice. Um,

206
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,260
a big one that comes up in the book
that I thought was really interesting

207
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:27,550
because it's one that is like so
distant in my memory is allowances.

208
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,660
So what is your take on giving
kids in allowance? Like, what are,

209
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,220
what are the learning opportunities
there? What do you say about that? Right.

210
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:40,870
So this study, um, at
University of Minnesota, uh,

211
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,890
and I have to say this one wasn't
a randomized controlled study. Um,

212
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,920
but it was interesting and that they
follow children who were given chores when

213
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,410
they were little and they,
you know,

214
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:58,411
whether it's making the bed or whatever
they were doing regularly and they found

215
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:03,400
that having chores not tied to money
but just chores as part of a family.

216
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:06,550
That's your responsibility. We're
a team. We're all in together.

217
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,820
That was one predictor of
a child's success in terms
of certain milestones like

218
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:19,231
graduating from high school or graduating
from school in general or starting a

219
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:25,150
career that that experience of
doing a job as part of a family,

220
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,810
um, was quite important
to a child's development.

221
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,790
But when you put money into the equation,
you give kids money for chores.

222
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,860
It takes away from that intrinsic value
of I'm going to work hard for my family.

223
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:42,950
We're in this together and it dilutes it.
Um,

224
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,340
same with um, Roland Fryer, great guy.

225
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:48,640
He did research on giving
kids money for grades.

226
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,670
How many people got money for grades?
Like most of you,

227
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,350
not because your parents said you work
hard and they do it the way you were born

228
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,090
with it or you are instilled with it.

229
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:03,290
This is a desire to work hard for
working hard sake. And you know,

230
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:03,861
maybe they're like,

231
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:08,300
we all knew like one day I'll
get to Google and you did it.

232
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,070
But I think that idea of parents
instilling that in kids. So that's,

233
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,730
it doesn't work. Roland fryer
in a wonderfully, you know,

234
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:19,490
randomized controlled study.
So that giving kids money and saying,

235
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:20,510
I'll give you an a,

236
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,260
I'll give you 100 bucks if you get an a
or 50 bucks if you get a doesn't work.

237
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,030
Is it the same for a gift or another
another kind of reward if you are award

238
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,940
afterwards, that's different. Okay.

239
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,770
If the kid does really well and you just
want to take them out for ice cream,

240
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:36,350
that's a different thing. But if
it's given as an incentive, yeah,

241
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,860
any kind of gift or award is,
doesn't work.

242
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,570
But so the question of allowance,
so given that you want to give allowance,

243
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:49,490
you can give allowance. And I looked
into um, two dozen studies on allowance.

244
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:54,491
There were international studies and
one like one from Canada found that when

245
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:56,630
people give their children allowance,

246
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,020
the kids end up being a little more
responsible with money and they save a

247
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:00,854
little more.

248
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,060
That study from England founds when
parents give their kids allowance,

249
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,430
the kids are feeling more
entitled and they're not.

250
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,300
So there is sort of no right
one right answer with allowance.

251
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,600
But what I have found overall is you want
to be clear to your child and in your

252
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:20,780
own mind what this allowance is for.
So if it's like a really little kid,

253
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:24,980
like a 10 year olds, it's good to say,
okay, this is going to be you have,

254
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,450
you know, six Lego kits.
If you want another one,

255
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,670
it's not your birthday and it's not the
holidays and grandma and Grandpa and

256
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,513
getting it from it.

257
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,560
You have to save up for that and you and
you figure out what that would roughly

258
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:39,750
cost.
Um,

259
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,700
cause I think one mistake parents
can make is I think back I go,

260
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:44,481
when I was a kid,

261
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:48,800
I got a dollar for babysitting and now
people get $20 an hour for babysitting.

262
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,700
So sort of thinking of
what it really costs, um,

263
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and then having kids make choices and
you can buy the Doritos on your way home

264
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,930
and you learn opportunity costs or you
could put that dollar into a jar or a

265
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:05,420
piggy bank or whatever and save it up.

266
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,480
And then kids see that excitement
of building up that money.

267
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,740
So I think allowance works like that.

268
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,120
You can also give just a regular
allowance once a week. Um,

269
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,820
the rules of thumb are give a kids' age.
You know,

270
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,590
10 year old gets $10 a week,

271
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,650
but you know what I'm talking about
this in the Midwest, the moms are like,

272
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,570
I would like $520 handed to me a year.
So it really just depends.

273
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,930
Um, I think, um, you know, as a parent,

274
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,290
we really got most serious about this
when our kids were going to college and

275
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,880
said, okay, how do we come up
with the realistic amount, uh,

276
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:47,090
that they were lucky they don't have to
take out student loans and they are in a

277
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:49,740
situation where we will pay
for their healthcare and books.

278
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,700
But so if we wanted to get, you know,
they, they work, they both work.

279
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,590
But if we give them a little bit of
cash for that semester, how much,

280
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,750
you know, we should it be and
what would it be expected for.

281
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,390
So of course I'm like, oh, let's him $100.

282
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,400
And then we were thinking
about it or like, no,

283
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,480
this is money for if they want to go on
a trip with a friend or they want to go.

284
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,740
Um, so my daughter for example, when
skiing, even though she doesn't ski too,

285
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,870
kids get these days, um, she
went, uh, over winter break,

286
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,500
a bunch of friends were going to
Canada and they were driving up,

287
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,960
but she had to go later.
So she,

288
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,340
you saw her sitting there looking at
the train versus the plane and the train

289
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:34,341
took nine hours and the plane took two
hours and she made the choice to take the

290
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:39,990
train. And of course I'm thinking,
ah, we'll just let her take the plane.

291
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,600
It's a law. And then my husband
and I were talking about, no,

292
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:46,260
this was to each other. We did do this
in front of her, but that the idea that,

293
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:46,741
you know,

294
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:50,820
this is what we agreed to and this is so
good for her to be making those choices.

295
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:52,410
And she felt she had fun on the train.

296
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,680
She looked like looked out the window
and I did my homework and I read a lot.

297
00:18:55,681 --> 00:19:00,120
I read a novel. And so those, I think
at every level when you're a parent,

298
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:04,260
the hardest part is coming up with
something and then sticking with it.

299
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,950
Yeah, that consistency.
Consistency. There's a,

300
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,770
there ends up being a
big shift though around,

301
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,850
I dunno if it happens in middle school,
like babysitting jobs are in high school.

302
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,520
Once I remember just
like waiting and waiting,

303
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:22,170
waiting to be 16 so I could get
a job. I was so excited. Um,

304
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,820
but it seems like from the research
you found there, it's a mix of,

305
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,750
you know, some benefits but also some
possible sacrifices with high school jobs

306
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:34,680
especially, you know, during
the school year. Right, exactly.

307
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:38,340
There are a lot of great books in the
last few years have come out that talked

308
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:40,680
about kids are,
you know,

309
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,150
they're coddle too much and they should
be out working in high school like we

310
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:45,990
used to do.

311
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,910
And that I agree with for sure in
theory and in practice. However,

312
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,860
um, the Department of Labor Statistics
did an analysis and they found that if a

313
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,900
child is working like 12 hours,
13 hours a week,

314
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,820
then it doesn't have a negative
impact on their grades. In fact,

315
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:08,760
it may give them a teeny boosting grades
and it could be because they're using

316
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:13,710
their time efficiently are. But once
you get to that 15 hour or over mark,

317
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,900
it has an impact on grades.
So we know that when you know,

318
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:22,910
kids do less homework in math there
it's a direct correlation to their math

319
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:26,730
grades. And then of course when
we're talking about, you know,

320
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,620
thinking about college and, and not
just how great a school you get into,

321
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,880
but also,
you know,

322
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:36,690
which will give you the most aid and
opening up your opportunities to get more

323
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:41,400
aid. I think it's, it's a hard trade
off. And of course there are many, many,

324
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:46,290
many families that need their
child to work, um, when,

325
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,130
uh, to, to the family.

326
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,480
But I think it's important just to
know that number where's in college

327
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,880
interestingly,
um,

328
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:59,010
you can work up to 20 hours kids who
work up to 20 hours but work on in an on

329
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:04,390
campus job have slightly higher GPA
than kids don't. That don't work at all.

330
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,051
Yeah.
And,

331
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:11,051
and then there's also the question of
is that work important preparation for,

332
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,210
for future careers and things like
that. Right. And so you and the book,

333
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:19,510
I think you advocate for college
students working during the summer,

334
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,800
maybe trade off for working less
during the school year. Absolutely.

335
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:26,970
I think working in the summer
for high school and you know,

336
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,900
college and then that job
during high school for example,

337
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:36,900
if it's during the summer, um, it's
sort of a great way to then segue to,

338
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,290
um, with your kids to, uh, the
magic of compound interest,

339
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,880
which is a hard one to,
you know,

340
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,170
talk like talk to a 14 year old about
this is great compound interest.

341
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,590
Um,
and you,

342
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,950
and the idea is if a child is say,
you know,

343
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,040
14 and they work every summer and maybe
they earn $1,000 for that summer and

344
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:04,081
they work for four summers in a row and
if they put that money into like a Roth

345
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,530
Ira, uh, and in order to open a
Roth Ira, you need to have income.

346
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,670
So it has to be from the job. So you put
that thousand dollars in each year, uh,

347
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,360
for four years and then you stop
and never put money in again.

348
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,740
You would most likely,
if you put it in an index fund or ETF,

349
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,570
and I talk about those in my book,
you know,

350
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,310
you would have be likely to have
over a hundred thousand dollars.

351
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,640
So saying that to a kid, you know,
you do it for these four years,

352
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,140
that's how much you're going to have.

353
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:36,220
That's fairly compelling
I think for many kids. Um,

354
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,480
and also it helps if you're applying for
financial aid because colleges expect

355
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:45,481
you to contribute much more of a
kid savings then apparent savings.

356
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,070
So, but if it's in an IRA, they don't
look at that money typically, which is,

357
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:54,040
you know, a little, it's a
good thing to know. Yeah.

358
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,540
There there's so many trade offs
with, sorry. No, no, no. It's,

359
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,970
it's all really clear in the book though.

360
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:04,030
There are a lot of like little worksheets
and tables that I found really,

361
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:07,330
really helpful. Um, and you know, we were,

362
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:12,040
we were saying the book starts or includes
in every chapter ways to introduce

363
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,590
these ideas to a preschooler,

364
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,930
whether it's just like playing with
coins or talking about wants and needs,

365
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,080
but you also take all of the advice
past college into young adulthood.

366
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,780
Um, and so, um, you know,

367
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:29,560
how much input on a 23,

368
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,870
24 year olds financial life do you
think a parent should be having? Um,

369
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,150
I think a lot of guidance is needed,
uh,

370
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,010
either because they didn't talk about
it before or kids are graduating. And,

371
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,930
you know, if you don't mind
me asking one more question,

372
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:46,640
how many people here have loans
that they're still paying off

373
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,970
the brown major? We're talking
about Grad school to Grad school,

374
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,880
including Grad school.
No, you all paid it off.

375
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,580
But I think that many,

376
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:03,581
many people graduate from college with
lots of student debt and if it's federal

377
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,740
student debt,
a lot of wonderful repayment options.

378
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:09,200
And I met someone here who worked at,
uh,

379
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,800
one of these companies that will
also refinance private student loans.

380
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,480
Typically if you're from a school that
they sort of makes the list of schools

381
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:20,540
that they think those kids have a
likelihood to pay off their debt too.

382
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,780
It's interesting,
but I think that um,

383
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,460
talking about repayment options, moving
back home is something that, you know,

384
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:31,990
it's so interesting. I'm Wa one part of
the country. I said, you go to college,

385
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,460
you have to move back
home. And they're like, ah.

386
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,600
And then another part of the country,
it was, I actually spoke to these kids,

387
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:42,560
it's called um, uh, uh,
college advising core.

388
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,830
And these are kids who graduate
from high school and they,

389
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:47,060
it's like a peace corps,

390
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,650
but for working in low income high
schools that don't have college counselors

391
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,390
and these kids volunteer for two years
and they learn as much as they possibly

392
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:59,570
can about being a college counselor
and helping kids with financial aid.

393
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,590
And when I sort of said, well, move
back home, you know, kids said,

394
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,460
I'm from the Bronx and I
have four siblings and we
live in a one room apartment,

395
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:13,250
I can't move back home. So I'm like,
okay. So the perspective there can be,

396
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,490
but I do think there's so much
we can do to educate people.

397
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,031
I mean,

398
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:24,920
I have one quick story about my dad
and a lot of the book is about delayed

399
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:29,490
gratification. And you know,
the marshmallow experiment, um,

400
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,770
that, uh, Walter Michelle is a
professor. He was at Stanford,

401
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:35,700
now he's at Columbia. And he started, uh,

402
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,250
he did an experiment with five year olds
and he put a marshmallow in front of

403
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:44,270
them and then he said, look, you can
eat this marshmallow now, feel free,

404
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,080
but if you wait, I'm going to
bring you a second marshmallow.

405
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,800
And they did this when kids
are five and they found,

406
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:56,540
and then he tracked these kids for years
and years and years and now those kids

407
00:25:56,541 --> 00:26:00,530
are in their 50s. But when he did that
experiment, he'd walk out of the room,

408
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:04,800
you know, the examiner would walk out of
the room and some kids would be like, oh,

409
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,710
you know,
they eat the marshmallow right away.

410
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,980
But some kids would wait and they'd wait
and they wait and they would usually,

411
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,980
you know, whistle or try to
distract themselves. And,

412
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,890
and then they would wait for
him for 15 minutes to come back.

413
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,170
And they got that marshmallow,
that second marshmallow,

414
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,560
and they found that those kids who waited
had on average 200 points higher on

415
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:30,170
their sats.
I feel like I should start a prep course,

416
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,810
like an sat course.
With that in mind,

417
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:35,750
I don't know how someone here could
help me figure it out. Um, you know,

418
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,200
200 points higher on their sats. They, uh,

419
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,560
reported having happier lives,
better relationships,

420
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,610
and lower body mass indexes.

421
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,650
So that ability to delay
gratification is kind of incredible.

422
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,430
Is the idea that it's intrinsic or that
it's learned very early? Great question.

423
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,270
If I say this as a, as a
marshmallow, loving five-year-olds.

424
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,090
Well, that's the great
question. So what, um,

425
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,540
what we know is it wasn't that these
kids had this higher moral code or they

426
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:11,850
were even, oh, I could just
deny myself. They were,

427
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,120
it was more of a executive function.
The ability to sort of,

428
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm going to pretend that's
not really a marshmallow.

429
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm going to pretend there's a,

430
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,570
it's a picture of marshmallow or I'm
going to pretend there's dirt on it and I

431
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:25,920
don't want it anymore. Or I'm gonna
pretend I'm a superhero and I'm strong.

432
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:27,660
I could, you know, all
these different ways.

433
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,770
And now with the research is looking at
is how do we teach that? Can we teach it?

434
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,290
Um,
and you know,

435
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,610
I was brought up in an environment where
my dad was a teacher at this time in

436
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:42,120
1969 and he came home and told my mom,
okay,

437
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:47,210
New York City introduced a new pension
plan and we're going to put away a half,

438
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,770
50% of our income in this pension plan.
So we lived in Queens,

439
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,940
tiny little house.

440
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,160
My Dad earned like
$30,000 at the time I had,

441
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,540
they had three kids, a mortgage, a
car, and my mom, Shirley said, Harold,

442
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,790
what, you know, how can we save half of
our income? We have three kids in a home,

443
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,720
we can't afford it.
And my father said we can't afford not to.

444
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,200
And that sort of set the theme,
I think of how, you know,

445
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,750
he approached life and he was,
um,

446
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,320
uh, he was born a hip in poverty,
you know, he had no money.

447
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,950
Um, and uh, you know,
when he was a child, uh,

448
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,170
I just, I don't want to keep
going, but there was a, um, he, uh,

449
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,740
there's a story about him where he was
eight years old and he felt like he

450
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,800
wanted to make some money.

451
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:47,400
So he sat in the candy store right
near the tenement where he grew up.

452
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,710
And in those days people didn't have
telephones. So my dad would sit,

453
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:57,030
the phone would ring in the candy
store and he'd get up and say, oh,

454
00:28:57,031 --> 00:29:00,300
call call from Mrs. Jones, Mrs.
Jones phone call. You go out.

455
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,690
And Mrs. Jones would come down the
stairs and give him a nickel or dime,

456
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:06,420
you know, he'd get a tip
and he was in a candy store.

457
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:09,780
So we always used to say to my kids,
do you think, what did I do with it?

458
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,800
My kids are like, new Bob Candy,
all the candy. And he said, no,

459
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,070
I saved it.
And gave it to my parents.

460
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,790
And because he knew the
delayed gratification there
was his parents wouldn't

461
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,560
fight as much and they'd have bread on
the table. And that kind of, you know,

462
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,300
I,

463
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,150
I hesitate sometimes to tell that story
cause not everyone's Harold like that is

464
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:35,160
extraordinary to be eight years old.
Um, but, and, and not eat the candy.

465
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,370
But I think that that kind of thinking
for kids and even telling those stories,

466
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:43,150
kids love anecdotes. You tell
them the story, they're like,

467
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,480
oh it could be like Harold,
maybe we'll make a little Harold doll.

468
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,760
Um, we're gonna open it up to
questions in a couple of minutes.

469
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:55,300
So if you have questions you can line
up at the two microphones in the aisles.

470
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,240
But I wanted to ask you about something
else cause you actually in the book

471
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,640
normally like in general,

472
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:06,030
I often think of good parenting
advice is being based on openness and

473
00:30:06,031 --> 00:30:06,864
communication.

474
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,970
But there are some things about parents'
finances that you advocate keeping

475
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:16,590
private, which I found
especially interesting because
my parents are divorced,

476
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:20,670
which I think brings money, talk out
into the open in a very different way.

477
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:25,320
And there were, you know, in terms of
child support and who could afford what,

478
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:27,960
and it can be fraught,
but it also,

479
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,950
you hear a lot more from your parents
maybe because they're just talking through

480
00:30:31,951 --> 00:30:33,150
you instead of to each other.

481
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,870
So what are some of the things that
at different ages you think parents

482
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,910
shouldn't talk to their
kids about? Right. I mean,

483
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,950
I think that when children
are five, six, seven,

484
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,570
eight, nine, you don't have to, I mean,

485
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:51,490
telling them what your salary
is to me is just out of context.

486
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:54,100
Like they don't have anywhere to put it.
So if you're like,

487
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:58,450
I make $100,000 a year, well then why
can't I get that candy bar? You know?

488
00:30:58,451 --> 00:30:59,710
And you could explain it,

489
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,960
but I think the numbers are
meaningless to very young children.

490
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,110
I think as kids get older, you know, I,

491
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:09,250
I've been having a lot of
questions from parents.

492
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,150
My 16 year old wants to know how much
I make and should I tell her or not.

493
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,680
And in those cases, I think particularly
if you're there, you start thinking,

494
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,180
and this one mom was,

495
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,240
we were talking about it and she realized
because her daughter was nervous about

496
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:26,380
college, which you'll be able to afford
it. Would she be able to, should you know,

497
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:30,070
she tried to get into the best school
or would she just not be able to go?

498
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,170
So those kind of cool,
I think those,

499
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,480
but I think you don't have
to tell you you should. Well,

500
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,440
the ideal is not to fight in front
of your kids about money. Um,

501
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,620
they actually said that when parents fight
a lot in front there, his about money,

502
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,800
those kids are three times more likely
to have $500 or more in credit card debt

503
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:52,540
in college. Um, I think
that, uh, trying to,

504
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:52,931
you know,

505
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:55,840
you don't just talk to your kids about
is just got to be age appropriate. Like,

506
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,300
oh, am I 401k went down, you know,
they're, they don't care or, or,

507
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:04,380
right. I'm frightened about paying
for college. So there's anxiety. Yeah.

508
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,720
It can be passed along to kids. That's,
I don't think it's a healthy thing.

509
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,590
Yeah. The, the balance between being
conscientious and being anxious,

510
00:32:12,591 --> 00:32:15,860
kids pick up on that worry and definitely.
Yeah.

511
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,250
And on that wonderful happy note,

512
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,560
let's take it to the audience who
can maybe turn the things around you.

513
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,394
Wanna go ahead.

514
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,610
Yeah, absolutely. My sister. Yeah. Yeah.
Great. Speaking to it. So first of all,

515
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:32,290
I want to say thank you for being here.
Um, I would some number of years ago,

516
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:35,440
I won't say how many, uh, I
managed to get a copy of, uh,

517
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:39,620
get a financial life and it helped
me tremendously. Thank my twenties,

518
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:41,810
so thank you. Um, you know,

519
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:44,180
been flipping through the book
for the first time just now.

520
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,490
And I think one of the things like,

521
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:49,550
we can acknowledge that Google
pays ridiculously well. No,

522
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,940
nobody here deserves to make nearly
as much money as they do. So.

523
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,250
So I think a lot of Googlers
are in a fairly, yeah.

524
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,800
Um, and you know, so I see
things in your book about like,

525
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,220
don't worry about keeping up
with the Kardashians, you know,

526
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:09,480
don't buy your kid a car. I think, you
know, just my own experience. Right.

527
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,130
Those weren't options growing up.
Absolutely. And you know, it was parent,

528
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,260
my kids are 10 and 12. We're
at this point where like, Gosh,

529
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:21,220
a lot of your friends have all this
stuff and it's certainly, you know, it's,

530
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:24,400
it's a want but it's certainly like within
the range of affordability for us and,

531
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:28,920
and sort of figuring out that line
between am I denying you and making you an

532
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:32,070
outcast socially things that
you could be doing. I mean,

533
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,090
every high school kid in my
town has a car and you know,

534
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,670
the idea of not doing that.

535
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,960
So I'm sort of curious on how you
make that trade off if you have any

536
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:41,550
information on like,
you know,

537
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:45,210
teaching kids the hard lessons
versus like making them an outcast,

538
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:46,044
that sort of thing.

539
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,490
I love that question and I've heard it
in different communities and I think that

540
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,360
a lot of people who have grew
up middle class or you know,

541
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,260
really struggling or,
and then you,

542
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,870
you're at Google or you are making a
lot of money or you have a lot of money,

543
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,260
it's very difficult.
Personally,

544
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,150
I'm all about denial to my
children. Not Completely, but I,

545
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,270
my daughter was last one to get herself
bone. You know, everybody we know.

546
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,850
And I think that,

547
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,120
I think it was so ingrained in me like
these values in my head and also I'm

548
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:29,420
writing about this, but to be
fair, but I think that, um,

549
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,790
by the time,
you know,

550
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,140
if I think delaying first
of all in just as a mom,

551
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:41,141
I'm saying this in much technology is
so much better because kids are still

552
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:45,800
reading books and they're
still communicating and
talking and looking you in the

553
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:48,800
eye. And I think that, you know,

554
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:53,600
my classic story was when my
daughter, who's now 21, um,

555
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,650
when she was 13, she said, we're
going, I'm going with some friends.

556
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:00,650
We live in Manhattan. Uh, we're
going to go, can we go to Macy's?

557
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:03,710
And we were a little over protective.
She was our first child. And we're like,

558
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:06,620
okay, you can go. And she's like an,
all my friends have a credit card,

559
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,490
like their parent's credit card where
one is a debit card. And the parents,

560
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:14,690
they were good parents. They gave them a
limit. But I said, absolutely not. I said,

561
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:18,760
I'm going to give you cash. And he's like,
all right. You know, she didn't, you know,

562
00:35:18,761 --> 00:35:21,230
she's a little embarrassed. Um, and,

563
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:26,231
but she went and she
used cash and she said,

564
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:26,750
you know what,

565
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:31,700
you gave me $100 mom and it was
$103 so I had to put something back.

566
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,020
Whereas if you hand your kid a card,
a prepaid card, even, you know,

567
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:39,570
you can put it exactly the limit,
but often it's like off of your town and,

568
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,890
and if your kid comes back and spends
$120, you're like, Oh, good job. You know,

569
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,460
you didn't spend $4,000.
You know,

570
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,780
and I think that the cash and talking
about it with kids because you know,

571
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,880
it's trickier with everything now,
you know,

572
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,700
with Venmo and I just felt
up through high school,

573
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,750
up through college, they did not need
to have experiences with plastic.

574
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:09,050
And I think parents also an interesting
thing I've been hearing is that,

575
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,100
oh, but we're worried about our kids not
having a credit report or credit record.

576
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:19,101
And that to me feels very insidious
in that they're the notion of needing,

577
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,580
you will get a credit card
when you graduate from college.

578
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,270
They will not be a problem getting a
credit card. And I think they're just,

579
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:30,240
because now it's credit Karma,
which I like. You get it for free,

580
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:34,920
your credit score. But I think that
people are rushing it too much.

581
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,930
So in terms,
I think if you talk and say,

582
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,660
I know you're the last one in
your grade to get, you know,

583
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,310
a phone and that's just the way we
feel and we understand it can be hard.

584
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:48,090
I understand. But you know,
and yeah, those people, I
mean, I always hear often like,

585
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,730
oh, those people have a summer
house or those people have,

586
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,080
and it's like we have,
we have such a good family.

587
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:59,310
We're so lucky, you know, and
everybody makes different choices.

588
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,200
And this is the choice we make and
we love you just as much in those.

589
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,460
I mean, it sounds so trite, right?
And I'm um, you don't have to say yes.

590
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,180
It's like, yeah, it's
really trite now. Um,

591
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:16,290
but that idea of those
kinds of conversations, and
again, I was lucky I was,

592
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,280
when my family, we had those conversations
and I still sort of, we still,

593
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:24,420
my husband and I still have those
conversations with our kids and it just

594
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:27,990
explaining, and I have to say,
when I see the next phase,

595
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,440
and I've been interviewing lots of kids,
you know,

596
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,860
kids 2122 and talking about it.

597
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:39,630
And some of you are probably close to
that age and you know, the whole, yeah,

598
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:42,260
not really. You know your
generation, by the way, the,

599
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,680
the millennial generation has much less
credit card debt than Gen Xers in their

600
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,690
20s or baby boomers in their twenties.

601
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,740
And that's probably because in 2009
President Obama passed the card act,

602
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:57,390
which said you have to be 21 to get a
credit card in college unless a parent

603
00:37:57,391 --> 00:38:01,140
co-signs never do that, never
cosigned a credit card with your kid.

604
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,710
I've met so many parents who said,
yeah, we did my credit right breeding,

605
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,310
I could use my cart. And so
never do that. And also just,

606
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:13,790
I would say wait till junior year in high
in college before or suggest to them,

607
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,610
okay, if you have a job you can get a
credit card, pay it off immediately.

608
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,770
But personally I've seen,
you know,

609
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:23,700
freshman year they have to do laundry for
the first time, you know, not all kids,

610
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:27,390
but my kids, they have to do
laundry and there are a lot going.

611
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,111
There's a lot going on.

612
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:30,750
Freshman year they're studying hard and
they're trying to figure it all out.

613
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:34,740
And I think adding credit to the mix.
I mean I again,

614
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:39,550
when I graduated in 1986 from,
call it CDC, yeah, 86 from college.

615
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,960
Everyone I knew had lots of credit card
debt because it was handed out. You know,

616
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:46,600
someone's like, yeah, I went to a frat
party, I got a credit card, you know,

617
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,000
it's just like handed out. So I hope that
helps. Thank you very much. All right,

618
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,873
thank you.

619
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,250
I, I've been, uh, I've been trying to
figure out how to ask this question. Um,

620
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,880
and I think the marshmallow
example is probably the best
way to do it, please. Um,

621
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,410
there's probably not hard data on it,

622
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:04,610
but I was just wondering if you
had an opinion on it based on your,

623
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:07,630
your knowledge,
what's too early?

624
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,690
Like it's very tempting for my kid.

625
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:12,430
It's just very responsive to all kinds
of different things we threw at him.

626
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,440
It's very tempting to say like,
okay, you know what, you're too,

627
00:39:14,441 --> 00:39:19,380
here's a marshmallow and then see
you fail and you know, and you know,

628
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:23,140
then we'll try again in a few months.
Maybe that's a little damage.

629
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,870
And I'm wondering if you
have a thought on that.

630
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,550
That's a great, another
great real question. Um,

631
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,430
so when I was reading about the
marshmallow experiment and there were,

632
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,480
I looked at his original papers and,
and then I went online and they're like,

633
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:40,160
all these parents, here's
a marshmallow but don't eat
it. I'm like, oh my goodness,

634
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:43,970
why I want it. Um, and I,
you know, wrote in the book,

635
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,840
like you just want to go buy a bag of
marshmallows and go into the covers and

636
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:52,820
eat them yourself. You know? So I think
that, I think that's a great question.

637
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,440
If you,
I,

638
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,920
I'm happy and I pride myself on
my book being researched based.

639
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,310
But I think when you're looking
at being a parent and being,

640
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,200
sometimes it's better not to
have the research in your head.

641
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,970
And I think,
you know,

642
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:10,400
certainly my dad didn't have any
of that research in his head.

643
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,390
And it's sort of like,

644
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,900
I think with that knowledge sometimes
can come anxiety like word is my kid fall

645
00:40:17,241 --> 00:40:19,880
on the scale.
And I gotta Tell Ya,

646
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,220
this is something my mom
would say all the time.

647
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,020
There are always bumps in the roads with
kids and they'll be there. So great.

648
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,090
Oh, the teachers said they're
not paying attendant. Oh,

649
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:31,910
because they're writing math code under
the desk in second grade, you know,

650
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:35,300
whatever it is. I made that up. I
was not that good. It's like a great,

651
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,850
but I think that,
I think that,

652
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,310
I strongly believe it's good to know
this stuff and to think about it a little

653
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:47,600
bit. And it's fun. Like when it crops
up, you know, you're like, oh, you know,

654
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:51,900
but I would not be testing
kits because it will bill it.

655
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,920
Start getting a little anxious probably
or feeling that I'm being tested.

656
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,530
So I would say it's just the parenting,

657
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:04,400
the daily life of parenting.
Wow. We look at that house.

658
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:08,150
That's a beautiful house one day. You
know, maybe if we save up a lot of money,

659
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,660
maybe we'll get that house or,
yeah, yeah. We saved a lot that,

660
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:15,290
so we're going on a vacation. I'm so
excited. You know, just making it a,

661
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:18,890
not a sort of part of
everyday conversation in life.

662
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:22,490
And it does take more effort for your
generation to do that because again,

663
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:25,700
you're not saying let's take a trip
to the bank or I dunno, you know,

664
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,400
opening a bank account
is a great thing to do,

665
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,390
but I mean the interest rate
is 0.1% but that's like,

666
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,480
that's almost the point in terms of
just having that experience of going to

667
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,170
bank.
I mean some,

668
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:42,860
some banks still have passbook savings
accounts and of course make sure they

669
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:47,120
don't have fees cause your kid will put
in $10 but it's gone then that's next

670
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,940
month.
But that helpful at all.

671
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,940
Hello. So, uh, my wife
and I have a disagreement.

672
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,830
I've started paying my eight year old
for each time he practices the piano.

673
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,770
I can give him a dime each time he does
it. And if he does it for a whole week,

674
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:03,250
I give them a dollar.
Um,

675
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:07,830
she thinks it takes some of the joy out
of playing the piano because he's doing

676
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:12,090
it for money now. Perhaps it
enhances the joy. I think so.

677
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,190
So what do you think about paying
kids for chores and General? Yeah.

678
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,360
Yeah. I mean again, the research,

679
00:42:19,361 --> 00:42:23,080
when you look at sort of the idea of
doing chores now that's different cause

680
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:25,150
piano. So when you, you're
talking about chores,

681
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,570
I think it's not a good idea
to tie regular family chores.

682
00:42:28,571 --> 00:42:31,780
Like everybody has to have a job.
I used to load the dishwasher,

683
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:34,420
empty the dishwasher, you know,
and make my bed, whatever it is.

684
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:38,710
That's something I had to do. If you're
talking about one off things like okay,

685
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:42,800
you know, could you, I don't know. I
haven't lived in a house in a long time.

686
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:47,710
Would he do like get the leaves
out of the whatever, a garage,

687
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:48,170
clean up,

688
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:53,140
clean the garage I made an interesting
distinction you make in the book is to

689
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,020
that you can pay children for chores
that if they weren't doing it,

690
00:42:56,021 --> 00:43:00,070
you might hire someone to do exactly.
But the, the regular maintenance,

691
00:43:00,071 --> 00:43:03,610
regular maintenance. So where does
piano fit into that? I feel like,

692
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,480
is that like paying for studying?
It's a little like paying for grades,

693
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:12,010
which again, Roland Fryer's randomized
control study showed it to on average,

694
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:14,170
it just doesn't matter.
It doesn't help.

695
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,920
Now he also found,
um,

696
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,340
which is if you're talking
about small one off project,

697
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:25,150
so maybe it would fit into
like just completed that day.

698
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,710
If you complete it five times, I'm going
to reward you at the end of the week.

699
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,920
I mean he was saying that that can
help a child achieve a small term goal,

700
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,960
but the end of the day,
and it's funny,

701
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:41,560
my husband and I had this one because
when I was a kid I took piano lessons and

702
00:43:41,561 --> 00:43:44,200
I know now I can eight years
and now I can't play a thing.

703
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:48,640
He was more like improvisational
and played when he felt like it.

704
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,270
And I,
and you know,

705
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:54,010
two of our three kids ended up being like
that and I was sorta nervous like why

706
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:58,900
aren't they taking piano lessons? And,
but so I think that I would in your case,

707
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:03,430
probably side with your wife, sorry, we
could call her on the phone. Yes. What?

708
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,720
Um,
but in the sense that in the end,

709
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,840
the point of it is they're loving
playing piano and there and I think that,

710
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,610
um,
no matter what value you give to it,

711
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:22,750
you want the value for your child to,
to eventually come from them.

712
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:28,260
And I pretty strongly feel that in my,

713
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,700
you know, control group of
three, then my brother and me,

714
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:35,701
like when it was sort of demanded or
paid for or we weren't paid for it.

715
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:40,731
But just that maybe that probably
if your title is being paid for it,

716
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:43,920
maybe there's something else they
would pick that they really want to do,

717
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:48,420
that they would spend the time
doing. So it, it's a tricky one and,

718
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:53,570
but I would side with not
paying for playing the piano.

719
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,960
All right. Thank you.
Thank you. Okay. Sorry.

720
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:04,260
But you don't have to tell your
wife. Hey, never happened. Yeah.

721
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,670
My Dad has a question. Grabbed the
microphone for him if you want.

722
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,220
Oh, thank you. I'd like
to tell you, first of all,

723
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:18,620
I've been retired 26 years
and uh,

724
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,730
I was on a cruise

725
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,710
a few years ago and a guy
was sitting next to me

726
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,840
and he said, um, what
do you do? I said, well,

727
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:33,480
I'm an educator and schools and so on.

728
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,110
Just how long have you
been retired at that point?

729
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:41,370
I said about 23 years.
So he looked at me and he said,

730
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,850
how do you survive now the problem I
think that the country is heading in to is

731
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:54,891
the problem of people are living
longer and by living longer,

732
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,920
you're going to have need finance's
over a longer period of time.

733
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,740
And if you don't have it,
if you don't have it,

734
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,750
it's going to cause major problems.
Whether it's social security,

735
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:14,100
you don't have enough, but it'll,
it'll aggravate the situation.

736
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,560
And I think we have to address that,

737
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,240
that your children should
be educated enough to save.

738
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,320
My wife,

739
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,320
we were married 65 years and my
wife and I went on our first trip,

740
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,940
major trip to Europe,
celebrating our 25th anniversary.

741
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,010
But we would constantly,

742
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:39,420
when she said to my I by wife am I said,

743
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,820
we're going to,
uh,

744
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:46,290
we're going to take that
tax deferred annuity.

745
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,590
Now we must do it by Osaka
to jobs to supplement it.

746
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,080
I ran a college entrance coachy course.

747
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,320
Remember the Stanley Kaplan?

748
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,440
Yeah.
Here's his competitor family one.

749
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,920
He did very well, but, uh,

750
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,230
he was a teacher in New York
City school system by the way.

751
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:11,050
He was teacher of economics
and Chuck Schumer,

752
00:47:11,051 --> 00:47:16,051
the Senate Minority Leader for the
Democrats was a kid in James Madison high

753
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:22,051
school in Brooklyn and he offered to give
the kids free coaching course if they

754
00:47:24,281 --> 00:47:29,080
do his mimeograph eworks
duplicating his notes. And that's,

755
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,320
we started by the way, he was
teacher of economics. But anyway,

756
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:34,420
to get it back to this,

757
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:39,220
it's crucial for our
country's future to plan,

758
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:44,730
helping our children become
independent and not dependent.

759
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:49,660
I've had no problems
being retired 26 years.

760
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,360
Okay. And it's something
that you have to play in.

761
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,720
Well,
I didn't get that lacoss cost shirt.

762
00:47:56,721 --> 00:47:59,840
I always wanted to open
one chapter in that. Like,

763
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:04,290
I wanted an alligator shirt and then my
aunt gave us a bag of clothes from my,

764
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,860
or like wealthier cousins
and there was an alligator,

765
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:09,260
so I cut it off and so did on my sweater.

766
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,180
And of course this mean girl said
that's not a real alligator sweater.

767
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,410
You sewed that on and that was like, oh,
but I mean those things you remember,

768
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,950
but we had such a great childhood
and I only have, you know,

769
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:27,270
it's sort of interesting how that kind
of philosophy is just I think the heart

770
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:32,900
of it. All right. Thank
you so much. Thank you.

771
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,820
One last quick question.

772
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,130
Yeah. So I'm not sure if it falls under
a financial education or more child

773
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:46,760
psychology, but going back to the Pete
getting paid for piano list, right?

774
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,930
For practicing the piano.
I want to ask the other way around.

775
00:48:49,931 --> 00:48:53,860
Let's say my kid does something I really
don't like her doing and I'm willing to

776
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:55,530
pay her for not doing it right.

777
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:03,770
How would that be done?
It'd be done.

778
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:08,640
I would also say that shouldn't be done
because they have to learn. I mean, again,

779
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:13,110
I'm not a psychologist, so take it with
a grain of salt. But I think in terms of,

780
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,710
you know, the stuff I've read
that it's the same thing.

781
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,520
You don't want to say a child does.
Well if I misbehave, first of all,

782
00:49:20,521 --> 00:49:23,610
you're giving them a
perverse incentive that okay,

783
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:26,790
I misbehave and then I get money to stop
it. So at first I'm gonna Misbehave,

784
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:31,650
then I'll get paid to stop
doing it. Um, right. Does that
make sense? But also that,

785
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:36,470
um, it should be come from
within. Like I am going to not,

786
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,900
I'm not going to misbehave because it
really bugs my dad and I don't want to bug

787
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:44,340
me dad because he's a nice dad or I want
to, you know, I think those kind of,

788
00:49:44,341 --> 00:49:44,940
again,

789
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,940
you're giving an external x
extrinsic reward or you know,

790
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,200
or disincentive,
you know,

791
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:59,201
something money or whatever to do to
change your behavior I think is not a good

792
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:04,200
thing for children because that children
have to understand intrinsically why

793
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:08,550
it's good to be good or to, you know,
or to listen or to stop being bad.

794
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:13,350
And I think it confuses
it. Thanks. Thank you.

795
00:50:13,351 --> 00:50:16,770
And that's, that's all the time we have
for today, but thank you so much, Beth.

796
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:19,290
Thanks.
Thank you so much.
