1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,180
Joining us all the way
from the United Kingdom.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,160
Please give a warm welcome to poly Samson.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,121
So probably,

4
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:12,720
let's start off a little bit about your
upbringing and kind of how your career

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,570
started. So tell me about that
journey to becoming a writer.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,200
Where did you decide as a student or
the child that writing was what you were

7
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:23,040
going to pursue? Um, I,
I'd never decided, uh,

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,950
to write because I always wrote,
um,

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,430
and it wasn't until I had my own
children and some of them right.

10
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:33,000
And some of them, you know, not such ready
writers, but when I had my own children,

11
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,950
I said they aged about five and I think,
well,

12
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,951
where are all these little stories and
patterns and waiting for this eruption of

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,220
writing,
it never happened.

14
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:44,790
I then realized that it was just something
in me and it was something I'd always

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,480
done.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,560
And so there wasn't a sort of blinding
flash where I decided to be a writer.

17
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:52,200
It was just a natural
progression. Regression. Yeah.

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,310
There's bits and pieces of your family
history that shows up in both of the

19
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,350
collections and the novel as well.
Kind of,

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,810
is there a particular story that inspired
you for a certain passage or you have

21
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,350
a rich family has all learning about
it as an amateur for the audience?

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,950
It's a great, well, um,

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,630
my family history for
those who don't know,

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,720
my parents were both refugees
into England in 1938.

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,030
My mother was six at the time,

26
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:26,031
half Chinese coming from Shanghai fleeing
the Japanese and my father who was 10

27
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:31,860
at the time, um, came from
Hamburg on the Kindertransport.

28
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,600
Um, I mean obviously they
didn't meet then. They had
very different journeys. My,

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,350
my father, there was a large Jewish
family that embraced him and he, you know,

30
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,380
went on to study and become a journalist.

31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,830
My mother unfortunately ended up in an
orphanage and the age of 16 took herself

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,940
back to China to find her father.
She didn't find her father,

33
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:58,860
but she found a revolution and she joined
my mouse army and for 10 years was in

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,180
red China until eventually
she got out again. Yeah.

35
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,830
There's a lot there for me to draw on
and I don't directly right about their,

36
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,580
their histories, but it certainly
informs a lot that I do. Yeah. Um,

37
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,190
along that journey of writing between
Novelis, between short stories,

38
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,880
obviously there's a different
process that's involved, um,

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,610
mentally you need to change
the way you're going to write.

40
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,060
Can you tell me a little bit about that
transition between the different writing

41
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:31,200
styles, between lyrics, between
if there's major events,

42
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:33,820
kind of that drove you again in
one of these directions or there's,

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,660
when you decide I'm done with my first
novel and I want to work on short stories

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,010
and I'm going to try and lyrics, kind
of, how did that begin? States again,

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,980
I think every,
every story finds its medium.

46
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,640
I'm writing a short story is,

47
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,620
is it's almost simpler because you can
keep the whole idea in your head without

48
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:55,080
feeling like your brain is going to
explode. You know, it's, it's, it's, uh,

49
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,830
it's very containable. Uh, it goes
very well with having small, actually,

50
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,720
because you don't need
to write anything down,

51
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,780
but you've got this whole other secret
world and you're sort of wandering around

52
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,370
doing the rest of your life and kind of
writing and editing so that by the time

53
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,890
I write a short story,
it's like typing. Yeah,

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,000
it's at worked on it so much in my
head. But with a novel, you know,

55
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,850
your brain would explode if you tried to
keep a whole novel in your head in that

56
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:22,030
way so that you'd have to be
more in a way more rigorous.

57
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,210
You have to sit at your desk
every day and work on it.

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,090
And certainly towards the
end of writing a novel,

59
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,510
there's a sort of feeling of mounting
panic that you really don't want it to

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,830
leave your desk at all.

61
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:36,520
I can remember when I was writing
my first novel and you know,

62
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:40,410
the family kind of knew to leave me
alone in the later stages of it. And um,

63
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,000
there was a knock at the door and
it was my husband and he said,

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,030
we need to go to parents' evening.
And I said,

65
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,060
why do I have to go to parents' evening?
And he said,

66
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,990
you're a parent to that
gets a little obsessional.

67
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,630
And then lyric writing is different again,

68
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:59,530
because I'm not drawing
entirely on something in me.

69
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,950
I've got this wonderful prompt,
which is that the music comes first.

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,480
So lyric writing again,

71
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:09,481
it takes place mainly when I'm walking
much less sitting at the desk and I have,

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,900
I do one song at a time
and I have a track in my,

73
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,260
in my earphones and it's playing
and playing and playing. And,

74
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,630
and I often do that. I
think it's, you know,

75
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,690
often referred to as the Paul
Mccartney method, you know,

76
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:27,691
scrambled eggs was yesterday and I start
to make up something and then gradually

77
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,100
some sort of meaning will
emerge and yeah, so it's, it's,

78
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:35,410
it's miles on the feet for a song as well.
So even within the kindness,

79
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:38,740
I think there are entire chapters that
on their own can be a short story.

80
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:43,000
Did you find yourself picking up pieces
that you didn't include in perfect lives

81
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:47,020
or in other kind of collections you were
working on that you then incorporate it

82
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,890
in and change the characters or, no, not
really. I stash that you keep somewhere.

83
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:55,160
I wish. I really wish I did. I
don't, I, I don't actually, um,

84
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,260
the kindness started life
in a different format. Um,

85
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,960
I was feeling quite militant about
short stories because publishers,

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,220
certainly in the UK,

87
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:09,730
I think it's different in the u s
but in the UK there's a kind of self

88
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,970
fulfilling prophecy. Earl, you know,
short stories don't sell. And so I,

89
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,300
my last collection had been a
collection of linked short stories.

90
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,690
And so I thought, well, I'll take this
one stage further, I'll do a novella.

91
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,400
And at the end of the Novella,
my main character, Julian, um,

92
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,980
would have an explosion of creativity.

93
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,630
And within that he would write some short
stories that would show that he's come

94
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,480
to some sort of realization of the,

95
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,090
the events of his life that he
hadn't understood in the novella.

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,600
And so I did start the kindness by
writing his short stories and then very

97
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:45,790
quickly realized that however militant
type thoughts about short stories,

98
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,600
it was better to get the novel right and
that it needed to be a novel and things

99
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,650
find their form and that
demanded to be a novel. Yeah.

100
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,710
You mentioned about your creative process,
walking kind of you.

101
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,580
Where do you find that inspiration?
Is it just walking the dog outside,

102
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:05,390
taking in the air, sitting in your study?
You mentioned a few different things. Um,

103
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,490
well I can't sit and stare at a blank
screen because I find that really

104
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:14,150
agitating and I don't know
how anyone does that. I mean,

105
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,610
there are a lot of people who will say
writing is about fixing the bum to the

106
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,690
seat. Well, I don't really agree
with that. I think, you know,

107
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,520
I've got a really grateful dog.
He,

108
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,670
he's very keen on this idea that writing
is about doing about 10 miles walking a

109
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:28,940
day. And I think that if you walk
and you're thinking about it,

110
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:33,941
and I often do something called method
writing where I walk as my character and

111
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,660
whatever's happening, I see it through
my character's eyes and you know,

112
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,330
be quite embarrassing at times.
You know, cause you know,

113
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:45,470
my main character in the kindness
is, is a man called Julian. You know,

114
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,690
women are coming towards me and I'm
Julian and I'm giving them a once over and

115
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,520
cause I really convinced myself
that I am that character. And um,

116
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,650
by the time you get back to the
desk, it does, it flows. You know,

117
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,360
if you've put the,

118
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,210
if you've put the miles in on your feet
and you've really managed to think about

119
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:05,780
it and you've really got under the skin
of that character, there's no trouble.

120
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:07,850
Once you get back to this,
to this there,

121
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,480
I know we've talked to you right
sometimes about the inspiration.

122
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,300
Are there particular authors that
have influenced you a lot? Um,

123
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,980
a particular time period in writing,
whether it's UK literary history,

124
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,180
American literary history,

125
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,300
other parts of the world where you're
drawing short stories and fables that have

126
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:26,630
been strung together for you.
Who are those kind of, well,

127
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,940
my main

128
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,020
inspiration probably came from,

129
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:38,150
I worked in publishing in the 1980s in
the UK and I worked for a company called

130
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:41,330
Jonathan Cape,
which was the literary publisher.

131
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,840
And it was run by a total
genius called Tom Maschler.

132
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,530
And you know, I mean he invented
the Booker Prize, for example.

133
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:53,210
He published you named you
named some great authors. He,
you know, Martin Amus, IOM,

134
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:57,170
McEwen, Nadine Gordimer,
Doris Lessing, Bruce Chatwin,

135
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,840
Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, you
know, it was just ridiculous. Our list,

136
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:07,250
you know, it can wonderful place to
work. And it meant that I read really,

137
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,080
really great books for my job. It
was, you know, it was heavenly.

138
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,850
And so I think that that
period of literature has
been very influential because

139
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:21,590
I read so much of it and nowadays I
still read a lot of my contemporaries,

140
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:24,770
but I'm having a surreal moment of
catching up with the Victorians.

141
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,570
And I'm loving it. Actually. It's, you
know, it's good to go back. It's good to,

142
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:31,850
to go back. There's so much
great stuff in every period.

143
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,130
And then poetry when, when I'm
writing fiction, I don't read fiction,

144
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,350
but I start every day by reading really
good poetry and different poets for

145
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:46,160
different books. I mean a perfect
lives. I read a lot of, um,

146
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,050
Neruda Strangely and for, um, uh,

147
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:54,800
kindness. I started with one of
my favorite poets, WB eights,

148
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,040
and then very quickly realized that I
really needed to get into John Milton

149
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:03,750
because I'd made Julian Milton scholar.
So I spent a year reading paradise lost,

150
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,920
which was not a year lost to
me. It was a wonderful year. Um,

151
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,370
and then another poet who I adore is a
contemporary poet called David level,

152
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,940
who I think he's,
I don't know how well known he is,

153
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,770
but he is amazing. And I, I,

154
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:24,690
I'd say that if anyone's looking for a
contemporary poet, he lives in Texas.

155
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,180
I think he's probably
in his eighties by now.

156
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,480
He has published since the early
sixties consistently not a bad word.

157
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,230
Flows from his pen.
Just incredible stuff.

158
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,580
You just mentioned paradise lost.
I think there are overt references.

159
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,070
There are references that
you would have had to read,

160
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:48,000
the kind of whole story together for you.

161
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,210
Was that the driving factor in your,

162
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,250
I know you mentioned you don't
organize it kind of in a web,

163
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:56,700
but how did you decide where to
weave in paradise lost her are,

164
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,540
did you have a Schema and outline for
you that you said these are references?

165
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,040
I know Zephyr, I know there's Lucifer,
he's a scholar. Yeah. It just,

166
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,890
it just gave me a feeling of daily
while I was writing because it's,

167
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,410
it's kind of secret layer in the brook
because actually I think there are very

168
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:17,550
few people who really know paradise
lost. Yeah. Here it's required reading,

169
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,070
I think in middle school, high school,
and then people forget about it.

170
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:21,420
And I think in England it's,
it's,

171
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:24,420
it's also required reading and I think
there's nothing like required reading to

172
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:28,810
put people off a writer. Um, and,
um, so I was lucky, you know,

173
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,380
I,
I have no formal education,

174
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:36,381
so I came to it on my own and it was a
joy because it takes you off into so many

175
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:40,350
areas, you know, labyrinth time
kind of footnotes if you get,

176
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,350
if you get the Longman edition,
which has amazing notes,

177
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,440
I mean the classical references,
the biblical references,

178
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:51,000
it's an education all on its own as well
as being the most extraordinary piece

179
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:55,380
of writing. Um, and so, yeah.
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Sorry,

180
00:10:55,381 --> 00:11:00,300
what's the question? I think you
answered it. And along with that,

181
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:03,660
I think at the research, I know you do a
lot of research going into your novels.

182
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,120
For you, this novel took a
little bit longer to write,

183
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:08,730
kind of why did it take longer this time?
It,

184
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,950
was it the research that
we're doing differently?

185
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,690
Are you researching characters
specifically or you come
up with an idea for a

186
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,890
plot and then decide if I researched this,

187
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:21,120
it will become a lot more concrete
and descriptive. Well, I think, um,

188
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,490
I think I could blame youtube for,
for some rotten,

189
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,950
because of course it's been a, it is
the perfect writers resource. You know,

190
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,440
you don't have to go and
wander around Amsterdam.

191
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,820
You can just go onto youtube and you can
find that that street and you can find

192
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:40,260
lovely clips of it. And it, it
really does help enormously. I mean,

193
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,980
another thing that youtube was early
enough for when I was writing this novel

194
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:48,570
was there's a scene and it's quite
a pivotal scene where my character,

195
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,370
Julian gets to see,

196
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:54,190
he has a friend who's a medical student
and he gets to see his sperm under the

197
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:58,390
microscope. And I wanted to write this
piece. I wanted to write it, you know,

198
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,240
I didn't want to just write
and they look like tadpoles.

199
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:04,630
I wanted to kind of get something more
out of the scene because it's such an

200
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,640
important scene. And so I thought, well,

201
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:09,880
I'm going to have to go to a fertility
clinic, or what am I going to do?

202
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,360
And then eventually on youtube
there'll be a scientist.

203
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,810
So he'll have posted some sperm
under the microscope. So you know,

204
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,790
a little bit of trepidation,
put it in the,

205
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,920
and what came up was very
surprising and very helpful,

206
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,040
which is that a lot of young men seem to
like to make films of their sperm under

207
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:34,981
the microscope and post them onto
youtube and play a guitar solo with them.

208
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,710
So hurray for those men.
So yeah,

209
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,440
I got to write that passage with plenty
of input from youtube and it was,

210
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,363
it was great.

211
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,640
Oh,
timing is right.

212
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:47,910
I think you had other events going on
in your life that you worked on it for a

213
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:49,170
bit.
Put it aside.

214
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,710
Yeah.
And I think,

215
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,990
I think the reason it took my first
novel to first draft to six weeks,

216
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,330
and this one to first
draft took over a year.

217
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,010
And I think really the main difference
was that with my first level,

218
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:07,130
I had a lot of small children. So it
was that they look good, get it done,

219
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:07,941
I've got to get it done,
you know,

220
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:11,450
I'm really meant to be doing something
else here, got to get this done. And,

221
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,670
you know, I was able to take my time
with my second novel. And you know,

222
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,840
it's a luxury. It's a luxury
to take your time. That's good.

223
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,990
Shifting gears a bit,

224
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,170
we've talked a lot about the kindness
for the perfect lives. Kind of,

225
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,860
I found it very fascinating the
way you've structured the story.

226
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,910
It is not necessarily a linear kind
of plotline the characters, again,

227
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,260
weaving in and out of each other's lives.
For you,

228
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:35,380
kind of where did that idea
and inspiration come from it?

229
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,030
Um, it was, it was never planned. I,
nothing I ever write seems to be planned.

230
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,580
Everything takes on a life of its own and
with perfect lives. It really was that.

231
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:49,080
I wrote one story and then I wrote another
story. And what happened, for example,

232
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:52,950
the reason that the character's kept
emerging was they kept kind of a character

233
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,800
who was a minor character. And one
story I'd come to write the next room,

234
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,780
this catch me sticking their
hand up, me, me, me, right
about me. And so for example,

235
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,770
the first story I wrote
was called Barcarolle.

236
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,810
And there's about a piano tuner
who has terrible, he, he, he,

237
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:11,310
he was supposed to be a concert pianist
and then stage fright did for him.

238
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,070
And it's during his day is a piano tuner.

239
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,920
He meets a lot of pianos
and a lot of people.

240
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,540
So I'd written that story and then I knew
that the next story I wanted to write

241
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,710
was inspired by, um, on my
husband's last to the, on an island.

242
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,630
We went to Hamburg,
which is where my Jewish family were from.

243
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,080
And I was standing at the back of the
stage while the audience would sort of

244
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,830
screaming for an encore.
And I had a really unhealthy,

245
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,830
conflicted feeling. I had to
keep saying, it's not them,

246
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,570
it's not that there was something about
these people shouting that gave me the

247
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:53,480
chills. And I wanted to express that
secondhand memory thing. You know,

248
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:54,470
nothing happened to me,

249
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:57,830
but it happened to my ancestors
and they didn't do anything,

250
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,850
but maybe their ancestors did.
And it's,

251
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,360
it's a very difficult emotion.
Um,

252
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,250
and so I wanted to explore that.

253
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:10,550
And so I knew that I was going to have a
musician and I knew she was going to be

254
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:13,550
Jewish and I knew she was going to go
to Hamburg and she was going to play and

255
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:17,390
she was going to have those feelings.
And so I was thinking, well,

256
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:21,800
maybe I'll make her a pianist.
Yeah, okay. Oh, who is she?

257
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:24,710
And then I sort of thought back
to the story I've just written.

258
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,940
And then it's just a minor character in
there called who's piano was being tuned,

259
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,840
called a Raylea Lieberman. I thought
Lieberman, she's obviously Jewish.

260
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,680
And so that's really how
one emerges from another.

261
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,890
It's really not planned. And
then it gets to be fun. You know,

262
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:42,800
once you're a few stories in you, do
you start looking for them and thinking,

263
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,640
I'm going to tell your story.
It's great actually. It's really,

264
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,640
really a lovely form.
I think the link short story form,

265
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,290
I'm a huge fan of linked short stories
anyway. I mean, I love Elizabeth,

266
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,820
Elizabeth Strout, Olive Kitteridge,
and um, and I, and I love,

267
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:03,680
there's a book by Daniel Kelman could
fame, which is again, linked stories.

268
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,960
Wonderful. Yeah, it's a good form.

269
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,050
You touched upon a piano and piano tuner.

270
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,130
The Piano's seems to manifest itself in
almost every story you kind of, for you,

271
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,050
what does that symbolism as well?

272
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,650
I'm musical background that you want
to use that as the main motif for it?

273
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,510
Well, what happened was, um,

274
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,800
I had three sons and I wrote and then I
had a princess and I also knew she was

275
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,180
going to be my last baby.
So I,

276
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,650
I told myself I wasn't going to write
because of having this rather obsessive

277
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,450
personality, you know, writing kind of
blocks out children while I'm doing it.

278
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,620
And I thought I'm really going to just
enjoy my children and particularly my

279
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:46,580
last child not going to write,
I'm not going to write.

280
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,080
And a couple of my boys were learning
the piano and when they had to do their

281
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:51,950
piano practice,
you know,

282
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:55,340
like lots of boys that it didn't seem
to be anything you could do to persuade

283
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:58,970
them to sit down and do that practice.
And so I said to their piano teacher,

284
00:16:58,971 --> 00:17:02,870
would it help if, if, if I learned
and then at least I could be helpful?

285
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,950
And she said, yeah, that, that, yeah, that
sounds like a good idea. But the thing is,

286
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:10,760
I am quite a geek.
So as soon as I started learning,

287
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,450
I kind of took it on and I, I a spending
sort of hours I could have been writing,

288
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,660
learning the piano. I mean, I was
playing the piano for five hours a day.

289
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,900
The children would come home and it's, I
need to do my piano practice. Sorry. Yeah,

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,770
I'm doing mine right now.
Took all the exams. I was like
a child prodigy, you know,

291
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:28,320
rose up through the, through
the levels. And yeah,

292
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:32,930
I kept kept on taking the exams, kept on
playing the piano, but it's not my thing.

293
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,730
And so when it came to the moment when
my daughter then went to nursery school

294
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,010
and I knew that it was time
to start writing again,

295
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,050
I was just absolutely soaked in piano
and piano became the metaphor for

296
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,160
everything. I wanted to
say. There's much to do

297
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,740
with learning a musical instrument.
Yeah, that's fascinating.

298
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,500
So I think this is a good segway
for kind of our next section.

299
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,840
We just talked about your musical,
um, piano training and whatnot.

300
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,330
So let's listen to a bit of a clip from
some of the lyrics and you've worked on,

301
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,870
and then we can discuss with
you, uh, your songwriting process

302
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,390
constantly.

303
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,810
So how did this collaboration
with your husband begin? Um, he,

304
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,930
he wasn't my husband at the time.
He was my boyfriend. Um, he was, um,

305
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,670
he had gone into a,

306
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,680
into a studio and he was
jamming with Rick, right.

307
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,420
Nick Mason for the first time,

308
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:56,940
I think since the 70s that
they'd played freely together.

309
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,320
I at the time had w what's in
England called glandular fever here,

310
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:02,610
I think it's called Epstein Barr.

311
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:07,611
So I was at home with a massively high
temperature and he'd come back in the

312
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,800
evenings and play me this
beautiful music and then say,

313
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,110
I just need a lyric. Um, I was working as
a journalist at the Sunday Times. Right.

314
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:19,950
Then I had no, I had, I had
no desire to be a lyricist,

315
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,690
but I was lying there with this fever.

316
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,450
I did occasionally sort of
see some obscure thing kind of

317
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,520
ivy growing over a door and he would
write it down and then it sort of,

318
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:35,610
these things would start sort of emerging.
And so it kind of,

319
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:38,340
he'd showed me something and he'd say,
I think this would work.

320
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:41,610
And I'd look at it once I'd taken
something to bring the fever down.

321
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,400
And I think not sure that does work quite,
yeah,

322
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,800
let me have a little fiddle with that.

323
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,550
And so it progressed and then
it became more formalized.

324
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,720
And at the beginning, um,
he said that, you know,

325
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,690
that he agreed that I wouldn't
have to have my name on it.

326
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,820
And I know that sounds odd, but
I, I don't know. It was, um,

327
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,540
it was a different world back
then. Yeah. You know, it was,

328
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,350
it was a misogynist culture,
particularly rock and roll, Pink Floyd.

329
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:09,900
I don't think it had
any female contributors.

330
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,740
I had this real sort of terror.
If my name was on it,

331
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:17,460
I would somehow people would start
calling me Yoko. Oh No. Yeah.

332
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,650
And I think about that now.
And I think what would be wrong with that?

333
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:26,850
I mean, she's an amazing
artist. She's an innovator.

334
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,340
She's never stopped.
She's incredible.

335
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:34,170
She's a woman in her eighties who still
producing new art. So I now think, please,

336
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:37,480
you know, if anyone would like to call
me Yoko Ono, I'll accept. But yeah,

337
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,290
with grace and enormous happiness.
Um,

338
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,000
but at the time that seemed like kind
of an insult. And so David said, okay,

339
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:49,150
it's fine. I'll pay you. And I
thought, Yay, but um, but you know,

340
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:52,570
your name doesn't need to be on it.
And then by the time we'd finished,

341
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,800
he sort of said, I'm sorry, but you
know, you're, you're getting a credit.

342
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,330
[inaudible] name's going on it and one
day you will thank me because you know,

343
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,970
uncredited work as a horrible feeling.
And he was right.

344
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,480
Because I'm really proud of that work.
And of course now I would,

345
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,490
I would really hate it
if my name wasn't on it,

346
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:13,870
but at the time who was a shrinking
violet. And again here, I know David,

347
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:18,100
I'll often mentions you're his muse
for you. Again, when you're writing,

348
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,300
is there a muse that's spurring on a
certain lyric one way or the other?

349
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:22,751
Or again,

350
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:27,580
is it just you're walking outside with
a tune and then she goes in the news is

351
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:31,750
the tune. And so I suppose the tune has
come from David. So you know, I mean,

352
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:35,350
and to know it sounds a bit happy couple
Lee, but I'd have to say that, you know,

353
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:37,720
the Muse for the lyrics,
it's quite clearly David,

354
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,710
because the music is always first
and yeah, you know, and it's a,

355
00:21:40,711 --> 00:21:44,690
it's a wonderful thing to write a lyric
because you have this prompt, you know,

356
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,630
instead of that thing,
you know your stuff isn't it?

357
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,740
It's no blank page because it's there.
The music is there.

358
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,800
When I write a lyric,
he,

359
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,550
he scats a top line melody and the Scat,

360
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,210
it feels like it's just under the surface.

361
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:04,240
There are these words and it's just a
matter of sort of bringing them up to the

362
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,800
surface. You know, it's, it's,

363
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,260
it's a very different process from
writing something from what I think of as

364
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:11,240
scratch.
Yeah.

365
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,070
Is there ever an instance where the lyrics
came first and then the music later?

366
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,680
I think just, just once. And that
was on the last pink Floyd album.

367
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,490
Um, the endless river. And because
it was the end of the sort of,

368
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:29,460
it was put together from that
session I mentioned earlier,

369
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,210
there were so many beautiful pieces of
music and 10 or 11 of them made it onto

370
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,044
the division bell.

371
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,550
And for years we'd always been listening
to the other bits of music and they

372
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:43,060
were lovely. And so there came
a moment where it just felt,

373
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,640
but Bose pieces of music
should be released.

374
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,120
And Rick had sadly died.

375
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,780
And so I just felt awkward about imposing
lyric on something from a time when

376
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,280
Rick was alive. And so I didn't want
to write it to a piece of music,

377
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:05,281
but I knew that David wanted a song and
I knew that he wanted a song to be that

378
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,010
big full stop on the pink Floyd history.

379
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,430
So I wrote that song the louder than
words to sort of try and sum up the thing

380
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,700
to do that I'd noticed most
about the members of pink Floyd,

381
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:23,701
which is just how eloquently they speak
to each other with musical instruments.

382
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,600
But put them in a room together and it is
the most awkward thing you can imagine.

383
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,880
No one speaks. It's so, yeah. So
that's what that song's about.

384
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,790
It's about, it's about men who don't
use words to speak to each other,

385
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,430
but who had something else. Awesome. Yeah.

386
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:43,270
I think we're in listened to another clip
from the solo album, rattle that lock.

387
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,080
This one is called in tongue.
Let's get the AAV backup.

388
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,543
Just

389
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,820
it was hard way.

390
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,480
Has he done

391
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,800
so obviously some very strong war motifs,
the video itself as well.

392
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,310
Tell me a little bit about the process
behind this song and if it was any

393
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,280
different from what you just
mentioned. Yeah. Well this, this,

394
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:44,820
this was like in a way quite
a daunting song to write.

395
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,120
And it was the last one that
I wrote for rattle that lock.

396
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:53,210
And it was a piece of music that was so
suggestive of what it had to be about.

397
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,080
And I for some reason felt inhibited
by the enormity of that subject,

398
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:05,040
you know,
the wastage of war.

399
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,490
And so I spent a long time reading poetry,

400
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,720
basically what the poetry
of conscience. So, you know,

401
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,760
poetry written by people who'd
served in Afghanistan. Um,

402
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,930
a lot of different poetry. I mean, I
even read the poetry of the Taliban.

403
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:26,931
I wanted to sort of read a lot of poetry
to do with war and I kind of got really

404
00:25:28,591 --> 00:25:32,760
bogged down in it and it got to the
point where I couldn't write a word.

405
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,500
And,
um,

406
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,550
and so I read more and more of these
collections of poetry and you know,

407
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:39,990
and in the end, David had,
look, it doesn't matter.

408
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:42,870
It doesn't matter if it doesn't make
it onto the album, it doesn't matter.

409
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,060
You know, he's a very,
very good like that.

410
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,960
And I think it was kind of the
last day and I thought, oh,

411
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,540
that's such a great shoe.

412
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,890
I don't want to be responsible
for this not going on the album.

413
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,570
And I sat in the sunshine
and just thought, why am I
making such a meal at this?

414
00:25:57,571 --> 00:26:00,330
I know what I think.
I know exactly what I think.

415
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,710
And I think I wrote the lyric and maybe
10 minutes once I'd given myself a from

416
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:09,510
talking to, yeah. Yeah. Uh, I think
we want to open it up to any audience,

417
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:12,430
Q and. A if you guys
have any questions. Uh,

418
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:17,100
now's a great time to ask polyon
everything she's talked about.

419
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,700
We have some mics
that'll be coming around.

420
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,043
Yeah.

421
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,210
When you write a short
story, you say, do you have

422
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,370
a path? The whole thing in your
head when you're doing a novel,

423
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,010
are you carrying the ending
Indian? And then he, I just

424
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,220
letting the story progress
and the characters develop.

425
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:52,090
You don't really know how you're going
to get to the ending and yeah. Um, what,

426
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,933
what um,

427
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,790
it's a great question because it is very
different from a short story writing a

428
00:26:56,791 --> 00:27:00,810
novel and, and I think it's very different
for different sorts of novelists.

429
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:05,550
I have a friend who plots the whole
thing and I've quite envious really.

430
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:09,330
You go look in her writing room and
there it is, you know, chapter one,

431
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:12,990
chapter two and she knows everything
she's doing and it's just wonderful

432
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:15,510
scaffolding and she just hangs
the writing on the scaffolding.

433
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,400
But I have to admit that that would
bore me. I know who my characters are,

434
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,420
I know what their moral problems are.
I know the choice,

435
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:27,060
the moral choices they have to make.
But other than that,

436
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:30,340
I don't really know the ending and
things change. I mean this, this,

437
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,720
this method writing, that's
when things change. I mean,

438
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:38,910
walking as that person and thinking is
that person and responding to things as

439
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:42,840
that person makes the story and the,
and the,

440
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,100
and the journey to the end,

441
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,640
very different from something I might've
thought I was doing in the beginning.

442
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,600
And that's what makes it exciting
actually for me is it, you know, it, it,

443
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,150
I like the surprises.

444
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,430
I like the way that things I thought
I was going to do just change. It's,

445
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:03,090
it's, you know, it's endlessly
surprising. Yeah. Yeah.

446
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,220
We have another question in the back.

447
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,620
Hi. So I'm songwriting is something
that's always interested me, um, as,

448
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:14,250
and one of the things that's, uh,
I've always wondered is, you know,

449
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,420
after a certain point you
become famous, right? And, uh,

450
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,500
you're living a different
sort of, uh, of life than,

451
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,900
than other people and you're seeing
things that are different than other

452
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:27,570
people's and the average person.
Um,

453
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,060
and how do you still,

454
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:34,800
and yet often when artists become famous
there, their albums and not always,

455
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,650
but become better and better and
better. Okay. Sometimes worse,

456
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,660
but better and better there.
And I, I've always wondered,

457
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:43,440
how do you actually continue
to kind of be hungry,

458
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,680
continue to see things from the view
of non famous people who have a very

459
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,840
different potentially view of the world
that maybe you don't have any more

460
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:56,620
instill, connect, um, with, with people,
uh, that that's, uh, it's something I've,

461
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:58,080
I've just always wanted.
How does, how does,

462
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,320
how does pink Floyd or David or you get
down and still write a song today they

463
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:03,840
can connect with,
with us?

464
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,440
Well, thank you. Thank you.

465
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,110
I don't feel like I have a wall
anywhere built between me and anyone.

466
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,880
Um, I don't feel famous.
I mean, and I'm not. Um,

467
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:19,240
so I can't answer how it is to be
famous and, and, but I do know that,

468
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,040
you know, we live a very ordinary
life with, you know, we don't,

469
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,840
we live an ordinary life. Our
children go to school, we cook,

470
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:33,690
we, we walk, we walk our dog, our friends
and not famous people or friends or,

471
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,470
you know,
I feel very connected.

472
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,310
I don't feel my life has changed
because my husband is famous.

473
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,310
I thought answers the question

474
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,950
sort of.
I needed a sense of that.

475
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:50,320
It's not just fame, but it's,
it's a, you know, I, when,

476
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,830
when you first start writing, when you're
first writing songs, you're, you're,

477
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:54,221
you're just,

478
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:56,980
your financial position in your view of
the world and everything has got to be

479
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:00,610
very different than once you have weather.
Whether it's specifically you,

480
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:02,800
this famous, where that, that the
world that you're living, it's very,

481
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,080
very different world.
And I, I mean, I dunno,

482
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,290
like comfortably numb was written
about, you know, being on,

483
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,170
on tour or something like that. Something
like this, you know, uh, that's a,

484
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,580
that's something that most of us
don't. It's, it's a great song.

485
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:17,350
It's something most of us don't have.
I guess it's Kinda, how do you still,

486
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,630
how do you think you can
still connect to people?

487
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,200
One word answer to that and it's,

488
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:25,140
and it's the most important thing that
a writer needs to possess and it's

489
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:28,290
empathy. So, you know, it's
what I talked about. It's about,

490
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,460
it's like method writing,
you know,

491
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:33,960
it is about being able to get
under anyone's skin. And you know,

492
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,690
I don't think there's a writer alive
who hasn't got empathy as their greatest

493
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:41,970
skill. I mean, and if they
haven't, they shouldn't be writing.

494
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,900
Another question here.

495
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,380
So I'll preface this. I'm not a
published author, but I really a,

496
00:30:51,381 --> 00:30:53,330
I understand your, your method, uh,

497
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,450
writing that you were discussing that
that's kind of exactly how I do stuff.

498
00:30:56,451 --> 00:30:57,950
But when I do that,

499
00:30:57,951 --> 00:31:01,580
I find that for every one finished
product that's like good and go somewhere

500
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:04,100
that's clever and you know,
other people might want to read it.

501
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,090
There's probably at least five to
nine other things that like, eh,

502
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,790
kind of petered out. It didn't work.
So you have two published novels now.

503
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:14,180
I was wondering how many did you start
writing that just didn't go anywhere?

504
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:16,100
Or are you able to salvage them somehow?

505
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,980
Um, you've got to silence your
inner critic because you know,

506
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:22,920
you say that an 800 line and not working,
but that's,

507
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,690
that's your inner critic
is telling you that.

508
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:29,670
And maybe your inner critic is being
too harsh with you. Just a thought.

509
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,290
Um, I don't have a load of stuff that
I've started and not, I tend to kind of,

510
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,750
if I start something,
I finish it,

511
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,760
but I take a long time to start something.
I have to know that the, you know,

512
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:42,690
it's going to take time,

513
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:46,290
it's going to take energy and
it's going to be obsessional.

514
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,610
So I have to know that I'm
jumping into the right pool. Um,

515
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,720
before I take the leap.
Um,

516
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,310
I've written one novel that
didn't reach full gestation.

517
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,350
It got to about 20,000 words and my
inner critic was deafening and actually I

518
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:06,351
found it on an old drive the other day
and my inner critic on that occasion was

519
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,600
correct. It was terrible.
But um, yeah, I think,

520
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:11,490
I think it's about
starting the right thing.

521
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,080
Um,
if that's any help.

522
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,280
That kind of segues to my next question
in terms of what's next for you and

523
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:22,010
other novel and other
short story collection. Um,

524
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,810
what's next for me is another novel.
Um,

525
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,920
I've got three novels kind of flow.

526
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,780
This is the thing about
selecting the right thing.

527
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,440
There are three ideas kind
of flying around out there
and it's which one to land.

528
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,800
No idea at the moment. And I can't
wait to just pick on, cause then,

529
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:43,190
then you again, you know, you can
get into that total obsession,

530
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,260
tunnel vision and think about nothing
but that research, nothing but that.

531
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,880
And that is the greatest state. Um, and
I also want to write some more lyrics,

532
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:54,710
but I can't do both things at once.

533
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,980
I need to have just one thing
in my head at a time. So

534
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,580
at this moment, I'm not
sure if it's lyrics next or
novel next. Yeah, we'll see.

535
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,530
And outside of writing, I know photography
is a big passion. What else drives you?

536
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,950
Well, photography's a big passion
because I'm not a natural photographer.

537
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:18,100
I'd say that because I've always written
on it is the thing. I, it's, you know,

538
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:23,140
for most of my life it has defined me
writing and photography doesn't come

539
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:28,020
naturally to me. So I love something
that I have to really work at and, and,

540
00:33:28,021 --> 00:33:30,710
and I love learning.
And the piano is the same thing.

541
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,070
I like things that are incremental.
Yeah. Um, so, you know,

542
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:35,360
I've had all sorts of things,
but you know,

543
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:40,340
I can juggle and that again is a kind
of incremental learning thing and um,

544
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,780
yeah. And I still play the piano and
I play guitar. Yeah. Um, so yeah.

545
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:48,560
But my passion is writing.
Great. That's great. Uh,

546
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,270
there any other audience questions?

547
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,430
So we're gonna start off with
Pauli reading a little bit. Uh,

548
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,320
one short passage from the kindness.

549
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,080
So I'm,
I'm,

550
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,730
I'm going to simply read the first
three pages just set in August,

551
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,340
1989 this bit,
although the novel spans 23 years,

552
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,850
Lucifer flew well for her in the fading
light falling through the sky when she

553
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:16,420
summoned him and to where again,
towards a great bruising sunset.

554
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,060
She was alone on the ridge at first,
just her the bird and the wide open view.

555
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:27,160
It was one of those nervy summer days of
southern strong winds that fretted the

556
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:30,300
hawks feathers as he stared at her
from his perch on her gauntlet.

557
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,630
She was wearing a long red
shirt over jeans and sandals.

558
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,940
Her hair was breaking free of its band.

559
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,560
A leather pouch hung from her belt and
a whistle from a cord around her neck.

560
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,940
The Hawk braced his feet on her wrist,
making a leather Tassel,

561
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:47,200
swinging from the gauntlet.

562
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,400
She felt the breadth of his feathers on
her face as he departed and she watched

563
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:53,650
him go with the wind win
right under his wings,

564
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,950
scattering crows like shock drops,
shaken from an umbrella.

565
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,030
Giulia was trying her best
to get it right for the bird.

566
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,370
The morsels were small to keep him active.
A shaming 26 ounces.

567
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,110
He'd weighed on the scales that morning.

568
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,310
She called him with a whistle too
sharp bursts, and there he was,

569
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,330
a dark cupid's bow firing
straight at her from the heavens.

570
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,470
She continued along the ridge.
Lucifer steady on her arm,

571
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,010
his manic eyes never leaving her
face until she gave the signal.

572
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,290
She sent him reeling to and fro and
neither of them knew that this was to be

573
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:33,670
their last dance. The
evening, started to chill,

574
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,350
had almost forgotten that Julian was
supposed to be meeting her there,

575
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,940
or perhaps she'd just given up hope.
He was panting when he arrived.

576
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,420
Still red in the face from the run up
the hill, his bike, and it's useless.

577
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:46,470
Tire abandoned.

578
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,070
He had the air of a boy who had
cross three continents to see her.

579
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,200
His sweatshirt knotted round his waist,

580
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,940
impossibly young with hair falling
over his eyes and an uncertain Lope.

581
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,680
One leg of his jeans still tucked
into a sock. He didn't dare Kisser,

582
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,910
he said with the Hawk glaring at him
like that. From the Ed end of her wrist,

583
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,710
the Hawk shrugged his shoulders and
she sent him flying. They kissed,

584
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,740
and when Julian stopped
glanced nervously at the sky,

585
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,070
she took off her going lit
and pushed his hand inside.

586
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,720
She urged the Hawk with her whistle
moving Julian's arm up and down,

587
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,070
the gauntlets tassel dancing,
but Lucifer only soared higher.

588
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,880
The wind whispering into
his ear and deafening him.

589
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:34,881
Him to her call Julia around
Cursing Julian lolloping beside her,

590
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,250
she grabbed back the Gordon at
and as the Hawk felter his kill.

591
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,990
Julian's hands were warm on her waist and
it seemed to them both that the scream

592
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:44,730
of the rabbit went on forever.

593
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,220
It was almost midnight when she got
back to which word she just stayed at

594
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:53,910
Julian's digs until morning if it
hadn't been for Lucifer bloody bird.

595
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,530
She parked the car in the lane, coaxed
him from his crate and clipped him on.

596
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,780
Lucifer shook out his feathers.

597
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:04,050
A little irked that somebody
had carelessly creased his cape.

598
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,130
Fallen twigs cracked underfoot
to she cut through the cops,

599
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,790
the bird or resentful weight on her arm.
The accurate Atri glitter of his eyes.

600
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:16,590
He only brightness beneath the trees.
The darkness dropped.

601
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,850
The branch is stilled,

602
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,380
which would stood alone in the clearing
as unexpected as a grims brother's

603
00:37:22,381 --> 00:37:26,820
cottage with it's Wonky,
blackboards and crooked windows at once.

604
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:28,560
She could see a light was on there.

605
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,980
She was certain she'd switched
everything off her face.

606
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:35,180
Owlish white Giulia slipped through
the back gate whispering to Lucifer.

607
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:40,190
She transferred him to his post in the
shed and on a loan up the path heart

608
00:37:40,671 --> 00:37:43,710
beating a skittering
stone loose at the steps.

609
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,570
She pushed the door open with her
foot and straight into the kitchen.

610
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,340
A gasp. Mostly relief. Chris, her husband,

611
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,470
streaky hair flat to his head.

612
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,770
His giant great trainers kicked
half way across the floor,

613
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,120
tinkering his spoon in a car.
She took half the pace back.

614
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,020
Why the look of surprise?
He said, I live here too.

615
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:12,021
You know Maggie has lurcher
quivered in disgust beside him.

616
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,650
Her nose pressed to his knee,
so here I am home.

617
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,530
He made a mockery of the
word bristling with it,

618
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,030
pointing his spoon at her like a weapon.
I wasn't expecting you.

619
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,170
She hung the leather gauntlets on its
hook brain racing for an alibi and

620
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:31,080
stalling. You gave me a fright.
You could have been anybody.

621
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,770
He cursed her for the welcome
bearing teeth older than his mouth.

622
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,350
Nescafe and tobacco. What did you do? Did
you leave Lucifer in the boot while you,

623
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,190
I couldn't get the car to start.

624
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,540
He snatched the leather pouch from her
and through the leftover bits of meat to

625
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:50,050
his dog. Then pulled it inside
out. If you don't clean it out,

626
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:54,520
there'll be maggots again. He was
supposed to be away until Christmas.

627
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,730
By which time Julia
promised herself to be gone.

628
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,310
His overalls fell open to a Ramones tee,

629
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,320
so faded you'd have to already know the
name of the band and down to a belt with

630
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:09,640
a large metal buckle.
He unloaded his pockets over the kitchen,

631
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:13,840
counter tobacco, Murray,
mints, Rolling Papers,

632
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,490
doped in change.

633
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:19,630
Clattering his hair was dotted
with gray paint like flies.

634
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:23,260
Have been laying eggs in it. It's
great. You're so pleased to see me.

635
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:26,950
He said a real treat.
Likewise.

636
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,003
I'll leave it there.

637
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,440
[inaudible]

638
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:38,380
all right. I think we will segue then
to the second reader. Perfect lives. Uh,

639
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,220
everybody join me in giving
a great round of applause.

640
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,920
[inaudible]

641
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,720
so, um, the thing to say
about this as I've, I've,

642
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:53,780
I've sort of taken a few
little bits of one story, um,

643
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:59,210
and talking about real life
influencing something you might write.

644
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,750
When I wrote this story or just before
I wrote it, I had three friends,

645
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,380
my three wonderful,
wonderful women who are married to really,

646
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:12,300
really boring men and these really
boring men left these wonderful women for

647
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,120
other women.
And these women who wouldn't,

648
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:20,121
who sort of would that seem to have
tired of these boring men all became

649
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:24,840
stalkers of the ex husbands and they
would all tell me about it and it was,

650
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:29,760
the material was just too good
to waste and um, you know,

651
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:34,440
the Internet makes stalkers of all of
us, so yeah. Anyway, it's called Morgana.

652
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,003
Yeah.

653
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,340
Morgana burst into my life jingling
and Jangling armfuls of bracelets and

654
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,650
puffing thin cigarettes
that she rolled herself.

655
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,630
Silk Flowers scattered here and there
in twists of dark hair fresh from her

656
00:40:51,631 --> 00:40:54,540
crisis and still prone to sudden tears.

657
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,840
My shoulders were not the kind that
usually got cried on a bit on the tenant

658
00:40:58,841 --> 00:40:59,760
side I suppose.

659
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,260
What would Simon working all the time
and Angus and Ivan like leaky buckets

660
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,150
never fall no matter how much I poured
into them. More Ghana's Fandango.

661
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,680
What a nightmare. Things being thrown.
Hot Cups of tea across the kitchen.

662
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,780
Mike's Clothes into marine parade.

663
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,680
The photographs of their wedding day
removed from the top of the piano put back

664
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:24,000
again twice and removed again with such
force that the glass shattered in the

665
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:24,834
frames.

666
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:29,580
She was wild when he left a river of
tears washing over a fortnight's dismal

667
00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:31,890
blow jobs that fail to make him stay.

668
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,820
She put a brick through
the window at the basement.

669
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,540
He was renting one light when he
wouldn't open the door. His girlfriend,

670
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,320
Elizabeth, who he pretended it
didn't live there with him at all.

671
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:46,321
I looked up from playing her obo straight
at Morgana outside on the pavement and

672
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:48,200
laying the oboe carefully down,

673
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,980
raise to arms to release along
skein of hair from it's band,

674
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,280
sending it falling and swing down her
back like molten metal and sashayed to the

675
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:01,880
telephone to call the police.
Morgana is driving is not improved.

676
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:05,120
When she tells me about
these things I had,

677
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,210
they're not without misgiving
agreed to put my life in Morgana,

678
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:10,400
his hands a couple of afternoons a week.

679
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:15,140
She was quite bold when she suggested it.
Mike did all the driving.

680
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,410
She told me one afternoon when I'd
come with my films to the studio,

681
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:23,060
she ran from the basement of her house.
After 29 years in the passenger seat,

682
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,470
I'll be needing to brush up.

683
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,750
I never even got to touch the radio in
our car and the steering wheel was most

684
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:31,160
definitely out of bounds.

685
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,490
She said the first time she
sat clutching my car's wheel,

686
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,410
I'm sure I could drive.

687
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,540
I've definitely got a license and I can
remember taking a red mini moke right up

688
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,410
the middle of Portobello market.

689
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,390
I was in awe of her then I was nervous
when she developed my films and printed

690
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:51,710
my pictures worrying that my composition
was not good or the exposures ill

691
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:56,210
judged. She made prince for the best
of them. There was glamour to her.

692
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,530
She was for student with it.

693
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,740
All those bracelets she wore
the layers of fine fabrics,

694
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,820
the charms and old meaningful rings that
hung from her neck cluster together on

695
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:05,990
a long gold chain.

696
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,770
The hints of Rackety life once
lived up and down the kings road.

697
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,270
I called for her on Tuesdays and
Thursdays at two 30 in the afternoon,

698
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,980
so we had a clear out madame pedestrians
before I had to collect my leaky pair

699
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:20,420
of leaky buckets from their school.

700
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,580
Sometimes I could feel
my poor Persia quake,

701
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,030
a variety of stimuli could set Morgana
off and alabaster statuettes spike

702
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,370
through his window flaunting his
nakedness. A top is new desk.

703
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:38,090
Do you suppose it reminds him of her cds.

704
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,790
A book spotted lying on
the backseat of his car,

705
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,260
a thick one with an irritating title for
man on the cover looked to be in fear

706
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:49,670
of his life. She said, rattling my keys at
the ignition. Irritably what's he doing?

707
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:54,671
Reading self help books sometimes Morgana
told me she couldn't sleep at night

708
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,160
and in the darkness she
tip toed quite undetected,

709
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,160
sort of the perfumed gardens
of Elizabeth's Facebook.

710
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,090
Elizabeth seemed to have accepted Morgana.
His alter ego was a friend.

711
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,770
I said it just proved how few friends
she had in the real world bang outside

712
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:13,910
Mike's flat and into a space
either directly behind or
directly in front of his

713
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:18,170
car. Always seemed to be two Morgana to
be the perfect place to practice parking.

714
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,990
The code.
Curtains were drawn at the front.

715
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,040
They had been since the last time he'd
allowed her over the threshold and much

716
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:28,490
to Elizabeth's displeasure and more.
Ghana's later mortification.

717
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:32,160
She and Mike had ended up wrestling
on the floor like bad children.

718
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,200
Once parked,

719
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,740
Morgana was able to nip out and search
for those little sharp nuggets of

720
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,790
information that she so craved. Peering
through the windows of his black Audi.

721
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,690
I watched her with her hands against the
glass of the car that had once been her

722
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:50,691
chariot and cringed as I
imagined Elizabeth or Mike
seeing her there awaken the

723
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:54,690
giant within.
What's that supposed to mean?

724
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,670
When did he ever read books like that?

725
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:01,110
She huffed as we pulled away in a
series of ostrich jerks. Mirrors,

726
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,860
mirrors. I yelled, city little girl
must be telling him what to read.

727
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,330
Self help her bracelets. Jangled as she
thumped the steering wheel for emphasis.

728
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,760
He never had any trouble helping himself.

729
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,170
Ignoring the hooting from the car behind.
What do you suppose I did to his giant?

730
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:20,130
Any way to put it to sleep. She scraped
the gears as she changed into third.

731
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,270
Sorry. She said to me and to the man
who'd overtaken shaking his head and he's

732
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:28,030
listening to the 10 things. What was he
doing? Listening to the team meetings.

733
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,450
Thanks again, everybody. Okay.
