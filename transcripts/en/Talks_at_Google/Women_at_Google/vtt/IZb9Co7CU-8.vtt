1
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm really excited to be here with you this afternoon because the folks on this

2
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:17.610
panel,
such a wealth of experience and knowledge,
and I know they're going to,

3
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.843
uh,

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.900
give you tons of things to take away with you after you leave this afternoon.

5
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.570
Um,
I have the privilege of facilitating this panel.
Um,
and um,
yeah,

6
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.340
we're just going to dive straight in.
Um,

7
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.670
so let's start off with an easy question,

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.730
uh,
an introduction.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

9
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.500
When did you do and what issue in your opinion,

10
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.830
is impacting Asians and Asian Americans that really matters to you right now?

11
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.710
So introductions and what issue that's impacting Asians and Asian Americans

12
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:00.630
that's really important and matters to you right now.

13
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.160
<v 1>My name is Amy [inaudible].
I am a fiction writer.</v>

14
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:08.040
I've written two works of fiction.
Um,
uh,

15
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:10.470
the first is a collection of stories called we should never meet,

16
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.680
which deals with um,
the,
uh,
the,

17
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.700
there are eight stories based on surrounding the events of operation baby lift,

18
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:22.200
which was the emergency evacuation of admirations and Vietnamese orphans days

19
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:23.310
before the Vietnam War.

20
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:26.940
And my second book is a novel called the reeducation of Cherry job.

21
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.200
And it's about a multigenerational Vietnamese family living in both France and

22
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:33.630
America.
And so for both of those books,

23
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:37.650
and most of my work has been dealing with stories about people from the

24
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:38.760
Vietnamese diaspora.

25
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.890
So my books are often taught in college campuses and even high school,

26
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.090
high school campuses.

27
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.810
And the issues that often come up when I have these discussions with them is

28
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.960
about immigration and refugee experiences and how,
uh,

29
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.520
people migrate around the world and deal with the different social,

30
00:01:56.521 --> 00:02:00.870
political and cultural communities that arise from history and what we can learn

31
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:01.500
from them.

32
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.940
And so I feel like that probably is the most important issue that pops up in a

33
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:10.941
lot of my readings and panels and discussion is how do we address the current

34
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.410
immigration and the ongoing immigration issues that are happening not only in

35
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:17.520
this country,
but around the world.

36
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:21.580
How do we help other people and other countries in need?
And I think,
um,

37
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.340
especially the Vietnamese community,
we have a lot to say about it.
And we,
uh,

38
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.430
especially since our community was the last major migration of refugees into

39
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:36.660
America.
Um,
we haven't had another recent one.

40
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:40.710
And I think that the Vietnamese American community can be seen as an example of

41
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.280
the incredible benefits and richness that can happen when you are generous and

42
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:49.080
when you're a compassionate and when you're exercising empathy,

43
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:52.980
which is I think something that's really important to consider when we're

44
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:57.360
thinking about a lot of raw there are being enacted and proposed right now.

45
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.273
Thank you.
Amen.

46
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.740
<v 4>Um,
so my answer I think ties into that quite a bit,
but,
uh,</v>

47
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.623
my name is [inaudible].

48
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.390
I'm a staff attorney meet immigrant rights program at the Asian Law Caucus,
uh,

49
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.640
age.
We'll talk us as a civil rights organization and San Francisco.
Uh,

50
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.500
we've been around since 1972.

51
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.170
My work is largely representing immigrants who are facing deportation.
Um,

52
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.100
and my client base is largely Southeast Asian refugees,
Vietnamese,
Cambodian,

53
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:28.830
Long.
While Yan refugees who came here in the seventies and eighties and are now

54
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:30.220
facing deportation,
uh,

55
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.350
largely for criminal convictions and experience is really common across a lot of

56
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:38.580
these refugee communities of resettlement.

57
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:41.670
In the u s where the resell and process was really flawed.

58
00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:45.750
They were resettled in neighborhoods that had a really high rates of poverty,

59
00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:47.040
high rates of unemployment,

60
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.490
high rates of incarceration at the height of the war on drugs.

61
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.920
And a lot of them were funneled into,
uh,
the present system,

62
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.150
the criminal system when they were teenagers and now decades later are facing

63
00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:58.740
deportation.
Um,

64
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.940
and it's become a particular issue and problem as the Trump administration has

65
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.170
cracked down,
especially on Vietnamese and Cambodian communities,
uh,

66
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.430
with deportation rates.
Um,

67
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.730
and it's one of those issues which gets overlooked a lot and a lot of the

68
00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:13.710
narratives around Asian experience.

69
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.190
<v 3>Thank you.
Hi everybody.
My name's Russell.
Jen.</v>

70
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.320
I'm chair of Asian American studies at San Francisco State,
um,

71
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.950
are celebrating our 50th anniversary of the Third World Strike and the founding

72
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:28.540
of Asian American Studies.
Um,

73
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.670
I've been living for the last three decades in a low income Asian American

74
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:35.580
community in Oakland.
And I'm there,

75
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:39.780
I think I see a lot of pressing issues facing low income and working class Asian

76
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:43.080
Americans.
And,
um,
if you talk about,

77
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.840
I think you're not supposed to talk about like an oppression Olympics,

78
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.870
but I do think that people living on the margin of living on the edge do face a

79
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:54.120
lot more struggle and suffering.
And so,
um,

80
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.940
I have a lot of unhoused neighbors who are Asian American.

81
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.750
I actually have students at San Francisco State are in Asian American Studies,

82
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:04.320
majoring in Asian American studies,
living in their cars,
um,

83
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.720
and some issues of class,
um,

84
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.590
and the intersectionality with race and immigration and gender.
Um,

85
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.770
I think I really pressing for our times that a lot of the Asian American

86
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:18.150
community isn't aware of besides homelessness on a broader scale.
Um,

87
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.390
we're having mass displacement of Asian American communities could see China

88
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:23.710
towns being disappeared,
disappeared.

89
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:26.380
And you see a lot of gentrification and low income Asian American committee

90
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.480
aside.
I find that really significant.
Thank you.

91
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.370
<v 5>Hi everyone.</v>

92
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.330
My name is Mindy Chuang and I'm the former executive director now a board member

93
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:40.320
of collaboration and collaborations and nonprofit organization and a grassroots

94
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:43.890
movement to unify,
discover,
connect,
elevate,

95
00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:48.630
Asian American Pacific islander artists.
So we deal with artists,
musicians,

96
00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:53.610
dancers,
comedians,
filmmakers,
actors.
I'm also an actor now,

97
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:57.350
writer,
podcast host,
MC,
et cetera.

98
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.180
Mel multihyphenate millennial.
That is my representation on this candle.

99
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.530
And uh,
the most pressing issue that I'm interested in is definitely diversity in

100
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:10.580
Hollywood.
That is my entire universe,
especially Asian American representation.

101
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.080
I'm working and within and understanding the industry itself,

102
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:18.680
but also the implications that it has in the ripple effects of representation in

103
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:23.420
media,
in everything.
Everyone on this panel is talking about on immigration,

104
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:28.100
on politics,
on the economy,
in leadership roles,
in companies like Google,

105
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.440
um,
the bamboo ceiling,
everything.

106
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:34.340
There's such a wide diaspora of Asian Americans,
many of what most of wished,

107
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:34.491
you know,

108
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:38.630
99% of which never gets represented and is just beginning to have a voice in

109
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:41.900
mainstream media and what the dynamics of that are.

110
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.140
And now I'm working on writing films and shows so that I can contribute and,

111
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.410
and continue to talk in spaces like this to help make those connections.

112
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.410
So for me it's a understanding working in Hollywood,

113
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:58.970
also connecting that to other industries and other communities because this is

114
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:03.800
much larger of an issue and much larger strategies necessary.

115
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.490
How does diversity,
you know,

116
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:11.210
or if you want to use the intersectionality diaspora,
whatever your word is,

117
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:15.920
show up in your everyday life.
Um,
and how does this impact your work?

118
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.090
<v 3>Well,
I was gonna say,
I think every Asian American,</v>

119
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:23.810
actually every individual here will experience diversity in their families.

120
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.800
So I'm actually fifth,
sixth generation American.

121
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.870
My family has gone through,
you know,
exclusion,
segregation,

122
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.320
a lot of the racial barriers that a lot of people of color face.

123
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.010
But even within my own immediate family,
I'm married,
I'm Chinese.

124
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:43.790
Mary took Korean,
we have to foster daughters who were refugees from Burma.

125
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.200
And then my extended family are pretty multiracial.

126
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.000
And so I think everybody,
even if you're,

127
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.570
your family was of the same ethnicity and you know,

128
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:56.360
you have generational divides,
you'll have gender divides.

129
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.780
So every other than when we go out to eat and you're not,

130
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.190
you're not always eating Chinese food and rice every day.

131
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:06.191
So I think we all experienced diversity in our relationships and in our

132
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:10.970
histories and then just our day to day interactions with people at our workplace

133
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:14.390
or at our school.
So diversity is totally relevant in our,

134
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.280
in our circumstances and the u s

135
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.260
<v 5>anybody else want jump in?</v>

136
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.140
Did you want me to talk about that now or do you want me to like,

137
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:25.590
is there another question when you,
I know Mindy's nine to talk about

138
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.080
curious.
Well,

139
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.580
one of my examples of how I deal with diversity on my day to day life is that

140
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.550
there's a film coming out in August,
August 17th,
Fyi,
um,

141
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.060
called crazy rich Asians and uh,

142
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.860
John Chu who is from the Bay as am I,
um,
you know,
he's directing it.

143
00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:48.580
It's an ensemble Asian American,
it's Asian.
It's actually a global Asian cast,

144
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.100
a half of whom were Asian American.

145
00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:55.920
And that recognizing as a data point you will,

146
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.130
the fact that it's been joy luck club,

147
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:03.870
which was 25 years ago was the last like mainstream studio backed ensemble,

148
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:08.871
Modern Day Asian American family that was on screen is a big freaking deal that

149
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:10.800
it's been 25 years.

150
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.730
And the fact that there's the show like fresh off the boat and doctor Ken,

151
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:15.564
that there are these,

152
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.840
these blips on the radar about diverse representation of Asian Americans that

153
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:25.170
there so heavily weighted in terms of the gravity of like this is representing

154
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:27.060
all Asians when it's not.

155
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.980
I mean everyone here knows that they're more than 46 ethnicities and cultures

156
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:35.370
and length,
like way warm languages.
But uh,
you know,

157
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:38.880
the Asian includes so many different people and yet,
you know,

158
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.770
people are writing these individual shows are these handful of actors to be like

159
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:48.180
the end all be all representatives of diversity.
That's a lot of pressure.
Um,

160
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.800
it's a lot of excitement because diversity suddenly matters right now.
So for me,

161
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:56.310
the way I'm experiencing it is I'm choosing to look at the positive.

162
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.580
I'm choosing to look at,
um,

163
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.210
these are opportunities and gateways that if this movie does well and it does

164
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:05.750
matter that this movie does well as controversial.

165
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.780
Some people might be about this is just Chinese people and this is just about

166
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.980
Chinese in Singapore.
Did you read the book?

167
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:18.981
Like that's what the book's about and you cannot in one singular movie define I

168
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:23.550
represent all of Asian America,
but still if you,
if this film does well,

169
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.220
it does open up doors for so many other projects to get greenlit and Asians do

170
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:33.230
have a representation in Hollywood and whether this is true or not.
Yeah,

171
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.380
I don't know if this is an actual fact.

172
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.200
People will say like Asians don't support each other.

173
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.820
They don't watch each other's shows.

174
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:42.270
If we make a show or a film about Asian people,
the numbers,

175
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:44.670
like the audience doesn't reflect that.
Right?

176
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:47.220
So on a numbers in business and industry basis,

177
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.910
diversities in my wheelhouse in my life every single day in terms of not just

178
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:57.360
authentic storytelling,
but the business of the data points,

179
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.330
the who are the butts in the seats,
how are we showing up?

180
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:03.090
What kind of viewership are we giving?
Um,

181
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.990
and what does that do right for everybody moving forward in terms of getting

182
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:08.700
other projects,
other stories told.

183
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.880
<v 1>Yeah,
well let's,
let's test that right now.
How many of you know,</v>

184
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.750
crazy rich Asians is going to come out?
Okay.
Okay.
Here's the real test.

185
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:20.751
How many of you actually have it in your phone that day and you're like already

186
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:24.690
organizing your friends?
Anybody viewing party?

187
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.350
The point like representation matters,
right?
I think,

188
00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:35.160
I think that's what you're saying.
Yes.
Anything to add?
Well,

189
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:39.480
I think what's interesting is I think the community support is also really

190
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:43.920
essential when you're talking about if an Asian American movie comes out.
Um,

191
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.630
and I do understand the,
uh,
the urgent,
the,

192
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.440
the instinct to critique and to be concerned because there has been so little

193
00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:55.180
representation in the past that anything that comes out,

194
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.200
we're so fearful of misrepresentation and more,
uh,

195
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.170
miss assumptions and biases.
Um,

196
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.110
but that support and that dialogue is incredibly important for it to be fostered

197
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:07.000
and to filter out through the community.

198
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.040
I think the same applies to the literature.

199
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.370
I think the same applies to visual art and to other forms of commit,
you know,

200
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.250
communication and bringing people together through art at to be able to

201
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:23.140
articulate our experiences.
And so that diversity becomes pretty crucial.

202
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.510
And I agree that diversity happens.

203
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.410
Like the reason why I started writing was I looked around the dinner table at my

204
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:32.470
family and realize that each of my aunt and uncles and cousins,

205
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:37.471
and I have my mom and my dad and my grandparents all had a very unique migration

206
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:42.400
story from Vietnam to America.
All of them,
they had very different experiences.

207
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.610
And that's within a family,
right?
And so there,

208
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.980
there has to be a recognition and appreciation I think,

209
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.790
of that diversity and being able to listen to each other and foster that

210
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:52.624
communication.

211
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.420
<v 2>And,
and yet there's still,
this is tension,
right?</v>

212
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.600
This desire to recognize specific and individual experiences with the Asian and

213
00:13:02.211 --> 00:13:06.020
Asian American communities within also,
you know,
we're,

214
00:13:06.021 --> 00:13:09.020
we're all this past month you've been talking about how do we come together,

215
00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:12.170
how do we,
you know,
move forward together.
All right.

216
00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:15.860
So what are some examples in which you've seen?
And I'm thinking of you,

217
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.480
a new bin in particular,
right?

218
00:13:17.481 --> 00:13:21.740
You've seen people negotiate that tension and find a way to build coalitions and

219
00:13:21.741 --> 00:13:22.574
come together.

220
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.910
<v 4>So storytelling somehow,</v>

221
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.080
it's really important for us with Asian Law Caucus and Tony are client stories

222
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.160
and we're always,
you know,

223
00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:32.910
we talked to thousands and thousands of people every month,
right?

224
00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:36.570
And the question always is like,
which stories do we tell?
Right?
And so for us,

225
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.370
part of that is determining who in our communities,

226
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.840
all his diversity has privileged,
right?
Who has a spotlight,

227
00:13:42.841 --> 00:13:45.270
who has the microphone and who doesn't?
Right?

228
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.930
So we tried to use the privilege that we have,
right?

229
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.430
The spotlight that we have to tell stories that aren't being told.
Um,

230
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.481
and so,
you know,

231
00:13:54.481 --> 00:13:59.481
the stories at dig a told not just in Hollywood but also over social media or

232
00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:01.510
sort of in our communities of,
you know,

233
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.020
his arc committee leaves out a lot of people.
Um,

234
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.670
I often jokingly refer to myself as Asian Asterik,
right?
Um,

235
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.090
because South Asians are often left out of narrative,
who's been,
who's concerned,

236
00:14:12.091 --> 00:14:15.000
Asian,
right?
A Pacific Islanders,
we say Api,

237
00:14:15.001 --> 00:14:18.270
but really no one really thinks about our talks about Pacific islander is most

238
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:22.320
of the time,
uh,
experience a lot of southeast Asian refugees is also lucked out.

239
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:26.940
And you've got this very sort of East Asian centric narrative about who is
Asian.

240
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.940
Um,
and so to some degree,
I think,
you know,

241
00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:32.670
we should think about this things when we're thinking about whose stories are we

242
00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:37.330
telling the stories of South Asians and a culture at Ciena,

243
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.880
the quickie mart owner,
the cab driver and the terrorist.

244
00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:43.680
Like those are the three,
you know,
representations we have.
Um,

245
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.110
there's this Muslim ban happening,
but it's not really considered an Asian issue.

246
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.700
So I think in some degree when we talk about building these coalitions,

247
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:56.540
it's also important to recognize who and are really diverse community has

248
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.390
privilege and to what degree can they sent her.

249
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:03.260
These other stories are being bused out and help tell those stories inside of

250
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.240
occupying the spotlight with their own stories.

251
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.820
<v 2>So Russell,
um,
when,
when you're teaching Asian American studies,</v>

252
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.370
you're talking to students about this tension as well.

253
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.670
What are some of the stories that resonate with them about,
um,

254
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:20.260
the ways Asians and Asian Americans have come together as a coalition to be able

255
00:15:20.261 --> 00:15:25.000
to do things like address injustice or,
um,
you know,
the,

256
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.660
uh,
uh,
address,
you know,
maybe not even bad things,

257
00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:30.430
but just come together and coalition.

258
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.080
What are the stories that resonate with students?

259
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.240
<v 3>Well,
Amy,
of assessment involved in one,
uh,
we,
um,
one of our classes,</v>

260
00:15:36.241 --> 00:15:38.340
I'm Vietnamese American literature,
uh,

261
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:44.030
did a poetry reading around the me too movement and we found that over half our

262
00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:50.181
class could relate to the issue of domestic violence and abuse on a personnel,

263
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.440
you know,
one degree of separation level.

264
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.520
So there's a lot of concrete issues around which we could build solidarity that

265
00:15:56.521 --> 00:15:59.170
actually totally resonate and um,

266
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.980
and that we can divide up that issue as,

267
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.190
as being a racialized issue as a gendered issue.
And,
um,

268
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.140
when people are able to build,
not only feed their own families affected,

269
00:16:10.141 --> 00:16:12.870
but also developed an empathy to build solidarity with others.

270
00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:17.610
I think that's how we,
that's how my students move.
Hearing each other's stories.

271
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.060
Um,
both knowing the individual uniqueness,
that's story,

272
00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:24.930
but making those connections with others and seeing how race,

273
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.460
how transnationalism,

274
00:16:26.461 --> 00:16:31.461
how capitalism have shaped these experiences to be similar and how we have a

275
00:16:32.311 --> 00:16:36.570
common sort of target of fighting or resisting the suppression.

276
00:16:36.571 --> 00:16:38.850
I think that's what mobile license them.

277
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:46.150
<v 2>How does that,
how do you think about,
um,
the representation and then also,</v>

278
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.770
uh,
which stories to tell as you're thinking about,
you know,
the stories that you,

279
00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:53.920
yourself are writing and what you want to share with the audiences.

280
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.460
<v 1>Well,</v>

281
00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:00.380
my mother was a social worker and she worked with a lot of children who came

282
00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:02.030
over as boat refugees and so,

283
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.810
and she would work on these case files and she,

284
00:17:05.811 --> 00:17:10.811
it was really important for her to express her children that,

285
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.210
to understand the privilege that we came from.

286
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.680
The fact that we came over in the first wave and that we had an education,

287
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.190
we had opportunities that other refugees and immigrants did not have.

288
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.650
And so she was always,
she wasn't a creative writer,

289
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:27.830
but she would always be showing these stories in order,
like I said,

290
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:31.700
to increase my compassion and empathy and in gratitude as well.

291
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:34.490
Like you need to be grateful and what are you going to do with the opportunities

292
00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:36.830
that you have and what stories can you tell.

293
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:41.030
And so I think a very huge reason why I wanted to become a writer was I wasn't

294
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:43.850
reading at the time,
there were no Vietnamese American book.

295
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.290
There were very few Asian American books.

296
00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:48.910
The ones you had are burned in my memory.
I still remember a farewell to Manson,

297
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.130
remember?
No,
no boy.

298
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.720
I remember the very few books on my bookshelf that actually reflected my

299
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:59.130
experience in what I felt like to be someone in a predominantly white

300
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.060
environment.

301
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.390
And when a child especially recognizes him or herself in a book,

302
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.630
it is,
it's a validation.
It's a,

303
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.120
it's a self validation that empowers them.

304
00:18:12.121 --> 00:18:15.260
And I think that is something that literature and art can do in.

305
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.470
And so that's why seeking out those stories,
understanding them.
Like I said,

306
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:21.900
like with the me too movement,
it was part of a collective call.

307
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:25.720
She who has no masters,
it's a collective of Vietnamese,
uh,
writers,

308
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.110
women writers and gender nonconforming lighters.

309
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.380
And we want to talk about me too.
And we called it me to Vietnamese bodies.

310
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.730
What are the stories that aren't being told?
Right?
Because me to,
uh,

311
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.880
the me too movement is rooted in social media and not,

312
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.420
there are many people who are not on social media.
How do we collect the stories?

313
00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:46.440
How do we eliminate a lot of that shame?
And it's about listening.

314
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.350
It's about listening and then conveying these stories and talking with each

315
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:50.184
other.

316
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.891
<v 2>I mean,</v>

317
00:18:51.891 --> 00:18:56.891
I know for me coming to understand and appreciate my own identity as a Chinese

318
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.630
American in relation to my broader,
you know,

319
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.890
political identity as an Asian American was definitely a process,
right?

320
00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:10.850
To be able to see myself and then two to be able to see myself as part of a

321
00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:12.470
community.
Right.

322
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:17.060
What was that like for some of you to understand that,
um,

323
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.500
the sense of self identity in connection to this broader identity,

324
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.750
what is something that you want to share?

325
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.920
<v 1>I think it happened from me at least late and I think it might've been just</v>

326
00:19:29.921 --> 00:19:32.500
because I,
I the the time period,

327
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.840
like I see it happening earlier from my own children.

328
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.040
Like my daughter who's nine strongly identifies as a Vietnamese American,

329
00:19:39.041 --> 00:19:43.240
as a half Vietnamese American from me growing up with a lot of white people

330
00:19:43.241 --> 00:19:46.930
around me.
I didn't feel proud until college,
which is late.

331
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.170
But it was incredibly liberating when it happened because that was when I

332
00:19:50.171 --> 00:19:53.980
started taking the classes.
That's when the Vietnam War wasn't a,
uh,
a taboo word.

333
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:59.010
That's when there were classes on issues and histories and literature that we're

334
00:19:59.201 --> 00:20:01.180
about the people who look like me.

335
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.350
And now I feel there are more ethnic studies classes happening earlier on

336
00:20:05.351 --> 00:20:07.090
education.
They're more cultural opportunities.

337
00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.410
The Vietnamese community has been here for you no longer.
So we have,

338
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.980
and that was the younger generations teaching,
uh,
the children.

339
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.890
And so there are more opportunities when they're younger.
But for me,

340
00:20:17.891 --> 00:20:19.390
it didn't happen until college.

341
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.020
<v 4>So I grew up in the deep south in New Orleans.</v>

342
00:20:24.021 --> 00:20:27.770
I grew up in a block and Vietnamese neighborhood with very few South Asian

343
00:20:27.771 --> 00:20:32.660
people.
Um,
and so I think I learned early on that I'm not white,

344
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.620
but,
um,

345
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.700
us in terms of coming into like an Asian identity and wasn't exactly clear.

346
00:20:37.701 --> 00:20:40.070
I mean there were way more Vietnamese people then South Asian people in my

347
00:20:40.071 --> 00:20:42.770
neighborhood.
Um,
but I,

348
00:20:42.771 --> 00:20:46.970
I think I definitely learned about race in a much different way.

349
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.600
It is in California.
Uh,

350
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.580
I definitely learned about it in terms of this black white binary that existed

351
00:20:52.581 --> 00:20:55.840
and which side of the line I was on.
Um,
and so I'm still,

352
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:59.260
I think getting used to being in California and looking around the room like

353
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.940
this is not really exist in the same,

354
00:21:01.941 --> 00:21:04.120
I work at an Oregon was 30 something people.

355
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:06.600
It's amazing radical Asian lawyers there,

356
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.280
but it's still like mind boggling sometimes.
You know where I am.
Uh,

357
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.300
and it's easy to forget here that agents were only like 5% of the country,

358
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:14.623
<v 6>right?</v>

359
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.780
<v 3>I grew up in San Francisco,</v>

360
00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:23.781
so it was easy growing up in like if you're in an ethnic enclave of 90% Asian

361
00:21:24.901 --> 00:21:29.160
Americans is pretty easy to develop an Asian American consciousness and to um,

362
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.250
tie down up.
So see the patent ethnic commonalities are generational calm.

363
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.630
It was really easy because we are addressing,

364
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.080
I like listening to the same type of music.
I'm playing the same kind of sports,

365
00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:41.760
going to the same clubs.
So that's,

366
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.710
it became a cultural sub or a sub culture that shifted to a political identity

367
00:21:46.711 --> 00:21:49.650
as I began to see.
Um,
yeah,

368
00:21:49.651 --> 00:21:52.830
I'm privileged in some ways as a middle class Asian American,

369
00:21:52.831 --> 00:21:57.000
but there are other Asian Americans who are suffering a lot more people in

370
00:21:57.001 --> 00:21:59.280
Chinatown who aren't getting their wages that I need to,

371
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.500
to support given my privilege.

372
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.660
<v 5>Um,
I grew up in Cupertino,
uh,</v>

373
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.760
during the 90s and if anyone was growing up in south South Bay and bay area or

374
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:16.630
la during the 90s,
if you guys remember like the Asian pride era,

375
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.840
you see ADN price special times.
Um,

376
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.570
that's actually when my first film is about.
But,
uh,
that was definitely,

377
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:25.991
you know,

378
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:30.000
the post rise at all these academic things about the culture that I don't,

379
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.990
didn't know until really recently.

380
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:37.070
I just experienced that and like wrote and pride,
all my stuff,
my screen names,

381
00:22:37.071 --> 00:22:38.680
Anga aim,
all that stuff.

382
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.070
So I was very like immersed in that Asian pride culture,

383
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:49.270
that sub culture.
Um,
and,
but I didn't realize until I moved to Pleasanton

384
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.450
that was special.
It's different now.
But at the time when I moved,

385
00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.160
it was still like 97 98% white at the time that I moved in the 90s.

386
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:05.161
And it was a very stark realization like of being othered and it wasn't hostile

387
00:23:05.441 --> 00:23:06.071
or negative,

388
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:10.240
but I was definitely singled out and they assigned me to the other Asian girl

389
00:23:10.241 --> 00:23:14.250
too.
You should be friends with Annie.
And I was like,
oh,
okay.
And I,

390
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.920
I went with it,
you know,
I was like,
that's my Asian sister.
She's my friend.

391
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.810
It was an automatic connection.
So it was,

392
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.940
it was markers like that that made me very aware of and in a way very prideful

393
00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:28.330
about being Korean American,
being Asian American.

394
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.620
But then navigating that and coming to terms with it really happened again more

395
00:23:32.621 --> 00:23:34.720
towards like the end of high school and college.

396
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.170
Were there cultural organizations where we're talking more.

397
00:23:38.171 --> 00:23:41.650
But even in college I feel like the conversations were not nearly as

398
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:45.040
sophisticated as now.
We did not have the word intersectionality.
I was,

399
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.570
I ran the Korean American student organization,

400
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:50.210
we did community service and we partied like that was,

401
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.670
we didn't talk that much about identity.

402
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:57.671
We didn't really dig into what those dynamics where we will put on culture shows

403
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.220
as a celebration,
but we wouldn't really go in depth.

404
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.900
So I feel like it's been a very ongoing process and enjoining collaboration and

405
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.920
starting the bay area chapter in 2009 was definitely an eye opening experience

406
00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:14.690
to the,
to the wide wider diversity of Asian America.

407
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.400
And I'm continually like,

408
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:19.550
I feel like now I'm going through Asian American studies.
Like I did,

409
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:23.630
I wasn't interested in taking those courses when I went to cal.
Um,

410
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.890
and they were available for me.
I just wasn't interested,
which is bizarre.

411
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:33.410
<v 2>We won't,
we won't tell your teachers.
Yeah,
please.
So,
um,</v>

412
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.600
you know,
mid,
you started touching about touching on I think,
um,

413
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:42.500
how things have changed for you over time.
Right?
So I,

414
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.430
you know,
I want to reflect a little bit on that and think about what's,

415
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.110
what is our future,
what is the our community's future look like?

416
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:55.610
And,
um,
in terms of the diversity,

417
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.900
the identities and our ability to,

418
00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:03.350
what are we working on in terms of coming together?
So,
you know,

419
00:25:03.351 --> 00:25:07.520
what do y'all think is in our future for Asians and Asian Americans?

420
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.940
I,
when we started with collaborations,
I mean,

421
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.970
you've seen so much and to a certain extent the,

422
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:22.100
the work that you've done in collaboration is also very future future facing,

423
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.670
right?

424
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:23.780
<v 5>Absolutely.
Um,</v>

425
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.870
I've been educated more through the people I've met through collaboration

426
00:25:26.871 --> 00:25:29.270
because it was across North America,

427
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.890
including Canada and like understanding how different my upbringing in the bay

428
00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:38.450
area,
my privileged and very diverse upbringing in the bay is very different than

429
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.830
Detroit,
Michigan,
different than Atlanta,
Georgia different than Washington DC.

430
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.520
And so that has been alone,
just its own education.

431
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.680
But what I see in like my peers in,

432
00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:54.080
in the people who support us and the younger generation because of social media,

433
00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:58.040
because of Youtube,
like change the game there is,

434
00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:01.640
there's more conversation happening at a much more rapid pace that's more

435
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:03.350
sophisticated,
more nuanced.

436
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.710
And therefore I think more just motivational for young kids to learn who they

437
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:13.790
are,
love who they are and just go out and make amazing things.

438
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:18.740
They don't have the same level of self consciousness or the same self

439
00:26:18.741 --> 00:26:22.430
limitations that we've all had to navigate for different reasons.

440
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:27.430
Whether we like our geographical location or the way our parents raised us.

441
00:26:27.441 --> 00:26:31.430
I inherited my 1980 version of Korea from my parents.
You know what I mean?

442
00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:33.200
I didn't grow up with the current Korea.

443
00:26:33.201 --> 00:26:37.820
I go there and I feel like very much other there as much as I'm Korean American,

444
00:26:37.821 --> 00:26:42.590
right?
So we have these very unique stories and I'm just,
the coalitions are real.

445
00:26:42.591 --> 00:26:44.730
I,
you know,
the South Asian community,
everybody,

446
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:49.680
I honestly think this political climate is,
uh,
you know,
as awful as it is,

447
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:54.150
it is a blessing in disguise to get people to care and to move.

448
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.860
So they're saying,
okay,
fine,

449
00:26:55.861 --> 00:26:59.370
we're going at this with this like collectively marginalized community,

450
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:00.420
what do we have to do?

451
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:04.770
And that's creating a lot of urgency to put aside whatever,
you know,

452
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.910
competitive agendas and all that.
And it's like there is a lot more unity,

453
00:27:08.911 --> 00:27:10.530
a lot more strategy I feel like.

454
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.090
Cause now there's this shared goal of if we don't speak up for ourselves,

455
00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:18.210
if we don't make it a priority to fund get films greenlit,

456
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.350
to make sure to create programs like all the major studios have diversity

457
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:24.510
programs.
Now this did not exist.

458
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.380
So this creates opportunities for me as an actor that I didn't have that it was

459
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:30.630
a different playing field five,
10 years ago.

460
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.150
And now they're creating diversity programs where they're,

461
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.530
they're seeking out women of color,
Lgbtq women,
you know,

462
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.920
every one of color,
Lgbtq,
millennials,

463
00:27:40.921 --> 00:27:44.190
they're trying to get different voices in there on purpose because people are

464
00:27:44.191 --> 00:27:48.240
getting pissed off enough and inspired enough to say,

465
00:27:48.241 --> 00:27:51.510
we want to see our communities on screen.

466
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.360
You can't whitewash out of our us out of our own stories and think we're going

467
00:27:55.361 --> 00:28:00.270
to like sit peacefully by and watch this nonsense.
You know what I mean?

468
00:28:00.271 --> 00:28:01.980
So I credit social media.

469
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:06.981
That's why I'm so proud to be from the bay and to have had my roots in silicon

470
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:11.580
valley because things that are happening in this place are changing the entire

471
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:12.414
world.

472
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:16.140
So I look to that and that is the future and technology and all the platforms

473
00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:16.891
that are emerging.

474
00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:21.240
You are not relegated to like five studios running all of media.
You know,

475
00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:26.100
you have a lot more voices and people are getting scared,
which is

476
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.300
<v 3>keep them one their tough.
We did jump in with,
Oh yeah,
can I bounce off that?
Um,</v>

477
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.060
so we have more platforms.
We have more opportunities to create voice.

478
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.200
I think emerging Asian Americans will become the creative class of America.

479
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.420
If you look in academia today,

480
00:28:41.421 --> 00:28:44.420
if you look even in the world of literature and arts,

481
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.770
there's a lot of Asian Americans going into it because of selective immigration.

482
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.230
Um,
those coming in today are,

483
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.130
are educated professionals and their kids are becoming the creative class.

484
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.330
And so the creative class or those who create culture who create the discourses

485
00:28:59.331 --> 00:29:00.800
by which we sort of understand the world,

486
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.520
the danger though of Asian Americans becoming the creative class and as I see

487
00:29:06.561 --> 00:29:10.880
this,
sorry to dump on millennials is that,
uh,
please go ahead.

488
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.920
We found them digital prisoners.
Okay,

489
00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:18.090
nice Q and a on everyone's sort of trapped on their own phones and we've come

490
00:29:18.291 --> 00:29:22.910
hyper individualized and so that makes mobilizing on a collective scale a lot

491
00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:26.370
more difficult.
It's easier to do social movements through social media,

492
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:31.390
but it also divides and conquers us to be market rather than communities.

493
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:37.790
And so,
um,
as we become the creative class,
Mike,

494
00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.070
I think we could redefine what it means to be Asian American.

495
00:29:40.071 --> 00:29:44.020
Nobody thinks of Asian with that.
A history of justice necessarily.

496
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.130
An ethic of compassion.
But as we developed into this creative class,

497
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:51.760
as long as we could build those commonalities and solidarities and that empathy

498
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.440
and start working,
not just on behalf of our own self interest,
but you know,

499
00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:00.370
out of the concerns were low income people or for other marginalized groups,

500
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.000
then we can actually have possibilities of uh,

501
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.490
to create our identity that we want it to be.
You know,

502
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:11.250
Asian Americans being adjust people,
Asian Americans being of people equity.
Um,

503
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.520
so for me,

504
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:17.170
that's the hope that the term and the grouping of Asian American has all this

505
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.060
unforeseen possibility and we can eat and,

506
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.170
and people here are the people who are sort of filling in the gaps of what it

507
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:27.760
means to be Asian American.
And so that's both exciting.
But Russell A.

508
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.670
Little bit to imprison the buyer phones.
Yeah.
Can we,

509
00:30:32.671 --> 00:30:34.210
I didn't do that.
So I think

510
00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.950
<v 4>we're at a place of crisis and a turning point right now,</v>

511
00:30:36.951 --> 00:30:40.430
but whether or not we take that plunge towards being a community about justice,

512
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.960
um,
so,
you know,
we're the fastest growing community of color in the country.

513
00:30:44.961 --> 00:30:48.120
Never still only like I think five and a half percent.
Um,

514
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.160
and I think the country's in a state of crisis right now,
right?

515
00:30:52.161 --> 00:30:55.820
And there's war happening over white supremacy,

516
00:30:55.821 --> 00:30:58.160
which has been happening in this country for centuries,
right?

517
00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.140
But right now it's out in the open.

518
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:05.120
And so I think the Asian communities at this place where it needs to pick it

519
00:31:05.121 --> 00:31:06.740
sides,
um,

520
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.430
and it's for a really long time and by intention,

521
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:15.260
we've been used as a weapon against black people,
against people of Color,
right?

522
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.370
Our immigration system is set up,
um,

523
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.620
so that it's only educated Asians that are allowed to easily come to the US,

524
00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.280
right?

525
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.020
And so we were always like held up by white supremacy as the good immigrants,

526
00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.310
right?
We come here legally,

527
00:31:28.311 --> 00:31:31.010
we're not like a Latina in front set across the border.

528
00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.790
We're held up against black people is,
oh,
you know,
there are people of color,

529
00:31:34.791 --> 00:31:35.510
but you know,

530
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:39.860
they have really high graduation rates and their incarceration rates aren't
high.

531
00:31:39.861 --> 00:31:42.080
Why can't black people be like Asians?
Right?

532
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:45.560
And that started almost immediately after the civil rights movement was that we

533
00:31:45.561 --> 00:31:49.430
were pitted against other communities of color.
And to a large degree,
we've,

534
00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.070
a lot of our communities of times have played into that.

535
00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.560
Sometimes that was survival,
you know,

536
00:31:54.561 --> 00:31:59.240
of we're going to try and be respectable and be the good immigrants and it'll

537
00:31:59.241 --> 00:32:02.600
get us as close to whiteness as we can,
right?

538
00:32:02.601 --> 00:32:05.660
There's this hierarchy where we're never quite going to have the rights of white

539
00:32:05.661 --> 00:32:07.220
people open.
Maybe it'll get us close.

540
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:12.490
And I think there this decision by some communities at certain times to go along

541
00:32:12.591 --> 00:32:15.680
with that because they needed to survive as immigrants in this country.

542
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.040
But in the end it's becoming clearer and clearer that that isn't going to

543
00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:22.970
protect us.
Right?
Uh,
the Muslim ban doesn't care if you're respectable or not.

544
00:32:22.971 --> 00:32:27.380
It doesn't care how a Phd,
um,
it doesn't matter.
Right.
Um,

545
00:32:27.381 --> 00:32:30.710
so I think we're at this juncture if we need to decide about whether we're going

546
00:32:30.711 --> 00:32:32.570
to be silent by white supremacy,

547
00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.010
quietly sort of planes and respectability or Castro lot with other communities

548
00:32:37.011 --> 00:32:39.960
of color.
Um,
and I think there's a window that we

549
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.890
<v 1>now have as community and making these decisions.</v>

550
00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:44.550
<v 6>Okay.</v>

551
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.600
<v 1>Yeah.
Maybe.
Um,</v>

552
00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:51.480
I'm very aware that any success I have is due to community organizations.

553
00:32:52.121 --> 00:32:53.680
Like I,
um,

554
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:57.910
the organization's I credited to become a writer are the Asian American Journal

555
00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:58.360
Association,

556
00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:03.010
the Diaspora of Vietnamese artist network and Asian American studies departments

557
00:33:03.011 --> 00:33:07.330
around the country that helps support my writing and help support my book.

558
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.010
And so I,

559
00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:12.040
it was always built into me that if it wasn't for these people who had been

560
00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:15.510
successful and we're looking to cultivate the younger generations,

561
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.810
I wouldn't have what I had.

562
00:33:16.811 --> 00:33:21.430
And so I think that made me much more appreciative of how important a community

563
00:33:21.431 --> 00:33:25.240
organizations are in terms of influencing generations and allyship.

564
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:29.320
And that certainly applies to this current political climate.

565
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.080
And I realize that sometimes social media can feel like a bubble.

566
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.240
Like you're only talking to the people who are like you.

567
00:33:34.241 --> 00:33:38.050
But I do see since the election,

568
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.190
more political activism and how are we going to use the resources we have?
Like,

569
00:33:42.191 --> 00:33:42.820
what's,

570
00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.260
what superpowers do we have to fight against the things that we're really

571
00:33:47.261 --> 00:33:50.650
concerned about.
And so I see,
you know,
graphic novelist,

572
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.830
a drying and depicting,
uh,
uh,

573
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:58.240
cases of undocumented immigrants,
right?
I see more writing,

574
00:33:58.241 --> 00:34:00.760
I see more editorials,
I see more art.

575
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.870
And these are fostering conversations and helping create dialogues so that,

576
00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.400
that threat of,

577
00:34:06.401 --> 00:34:09.520
especially for Asian American munies to look inward and only protect themselves,

578
00:34:09.521 --> 00:34:11.020
can't necessarily happen anymore.

579
00:34:11.021 --> 00:34:16.021
And I think constantly reminding and being reminded of the fact that this

580
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.570
happened to us just 40 years ago,
right?

581
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.630
Just a little over 40 years ago where everything was taken away.

582
00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.940
It can happen to any of us.
So what are we going to do?

583
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:26.350
How are we going to help each other?

584
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:31.380
And I think reminding ourselves about that allyship and community spaces

585
00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.793
important.

586
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.480
<v 2>Thank you so much.
Um,
I think between,
um,</v>

587
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
calling actually like calling us into this discussion about where are we going

588
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:47.000
to stand,
what are we going to do and how are we going to come together?

589
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:51.320
I think each of you in your own way,
you know,
talked about that.
So.

590
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.200
All right,
so do your turn.

591
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:58.430
Now we've heard such rich conversation up here.

592
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:02.480
I want to make sure that you all have an opportunity to ask questions to engage

593
00:35:02.481 --> 00:35:05.990
with the panelists as well.
If you have a question,
please step up.

594
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:10.030
There's a migrate here,
right in front of me.
Um,
please do that.
Uh,

595
00:35:10.031 --> 00:35:13.130
so that we can get you on and we can hear you.

596
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.430
Come on baby.

597
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:23.491
I didn't,

598
00:35:23.491 --> 00:35:27.270
I didn't preset any questions so I don't have any plants in the audience,

599
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.500
so yeah.
Okay.
We have a question right here.
Come on up.

600
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.190
<v 5>Name is grace.
You,
uh,
Professor Chung had a pet,</v>

601
00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:42.180
some thoughts,
you know,

602
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:46.440
he had thought the phone was making our generation the hyper individualized and,

603
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.370
and that,
that we needed to move forward.
Uh,
you know,
and,

604
00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.760
and that Asian Americans,
hopefully it would be sort of this just community.

605
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:58.800
So granted that phones aren't going to go away.
Um,
I had a question for you,

606
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:03.390
Professor John.
Um,
you know,
how can we use the phone?

607
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.480
I mean,
I mean the phone,
I'm an 80 you,
you suggested that,
um,

608
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:12.210
the phone in in some sense has sort of galvanized and organized folks.

609
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.080
So I guess the question make her everybody is how can we use technology?

610
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:19.260
It's not going to go away anytime soon and people will have their phones.

611
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:23.220
How can we use technology in a way that brings together community and,
and,

612
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:27.540
and to,
um,
moocs,
our community along towards justice?

613
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.650
Great question.
Yeah,
I want to jump in.

614
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.940
<v 4>So in my work,
uh,
we actually use social media quite a bit to,
uh,</v>

615
00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:39.480
organized and it's not by itself.

616
00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:41.670
There's lots of organizing happening on the ground in communities,

617
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:46.180
but social media is really critical for a lot of the advocacy we do.
Um,

618
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:51.150
I mean,
I remember,
you know,
Muslim ban 1.0,
that first weekend,
right?
All right.

619
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.260
Um,
were it got signed Friday night and you know,

620
00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:00.440
we started working that very night and then I was blown away by the number of

621
00:37:00.571 --> 00:37:02.930
people that we are able to mobilize and we have not,

622
00:37:02.931 --> 00:37:05.400
we're not able to do that without the Internet.
Right.
Uh,

623
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:09.870
over standard way of mobilizing for an action is fliers and word of mouth and

624
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.820
that would not have turned out,
you know,

625
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.810
thousands of people at every airport in the country within a few hours.
Right.
Um,

626
00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.710
often we run anti-depression campaigns and you were mentioning artists are

627
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:23.400
really stepping up in,
you know,
helping tell stories through artwork.
Uh,

628
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.300
deeply who's a really amazing graphic novelist,
um,

629
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:29.620
has been helping us with a lot of our NTT British campaigns and making artwork,

630
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.020
uh,

631
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:34.080
for unlike petitions which have an enormous amount of impact and getting people

632
00:37:34.081 --> 00:37:37.800
free from detention and also telling their stories.
Um,

633
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.660
we use it to pass legislation.

634
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:43.590
We do call and actions are all using social media using Facebook and Twitter.

635
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.380
I'm sorry it's hip plug,
Google's competitors.

636
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.710
<v 5>But it is really a critical thing.</v>

637
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:52.040
<v 4>Part of our work.
Now</v>

638
00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:58.570
<v 5>what do you,
what are you seeing mindgeek in terms of the innovative ways?
Um,</v>

639
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.790
performing artists are using technology.

640
00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:06.900
I think it's been happening organically and with being in a generation that has

641
00:38:07.811 --> 00:38:12.280
grown up in a lot of our formative years and then with a new generation where

642
00:38:12.281 --> 00:38:17.281
they just are born out the womb knowing how to like Hashtag um,

643
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.590
people get savvier by the day.

644
00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:24.790
And I think youtube itself for Asian America period,

645
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.200
everyone credits youtube for changing Asian America because the youtubers,

646
00:38:29.201 --> 00:38:34.201
there's a specific generation specifically between 2006 and 2012 the content

647
00:38:34.421 --> 00:38:34.661
creators,

648
00:38:34.661 --> 00:38:37.870
because we're not inundated with content at that point and there is still early

649
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:38.710
adopters,
right?

650
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.020
The celebrities that emerged out of that youtube generation still make a living

651
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:45.040
off of that today.

652
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:50.490
It created a gateway for Asian Americans to influence a whole other generation

653
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.380
of younger Asian Americans to see themselves.

654
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.410
Because there's a lot of kids out there who will look at youtube as a bigger

655
00:38:56.411 --> 00:39:00.310
deal than like network television.
They can identify their youtube stars,

656
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:04.300
they cannot identify,
you know,
Jimmy Fallon or whoever.
Right?

657
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.650
And so it's just really interesting because that gave people confidence and it

658
00:39:08.651 --> 00:39:11.140
makes that ripple effect.
I really believe in the power of art.

659
00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:15.640
Like a book of song or a Skit,
like it's so random,

660
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:20.080
but it really gives a kid or an older whoever,
whoever watches it,
they're like,

661
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:24.010
oh,
they get me,
they get my story.
Oh.

662
00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:26.320
And then they start messaging each other.

663
00:39:26.321 --> 00:39:29.830
They share it like the sharing of videos and there's tweeting and all that.

664
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:34.330
It has massive ripple effects.
You don't know what kinds of seeds that plants.

665
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.840
Right.
And um,
so I think the Internet is incredibly powerful.

666
00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:40.480
It can galvanize people,
it motivates people.

667
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.210
It pisses people off because they're like,
oh,
you made that skip.

668
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:46.660
But that was funny.
But it was at the expense of these people right there.

669
00:39:46.661 --> 00:39:50.050
I've seen these conversations happen where like young Asian American kids would

670
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:54.730
kind of make a gay joke and then that would cause a whole conversation about the

671
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:59.350
issues within the Asian American community about not acknowledging the Lgbtq

672
00:39:59.351 --> 00:40:00.190
community.
Right.

673
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.510
And so then someone would go out and make their own skit to like re,
you know,

674
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.330
that's kind of the age that we live in.
There's tons of content out there,

675
00:40:07.331 --> 00:40:09.160
but I think that that's what needs to happen.

676
00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:12.640
It's not just theory and our thoughts we've got to do and we got to say we got

677
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:15.800
to speak and that's going to keep maturing the conversation.

678
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.910
That's what's going to make content creators get better at what they do.

679
00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.070
Like I can sit here and say I'm a writer,

680
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:25.270
but if I never put words on a piece of paper on a s,
you know,
type it out,

681
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.590
I'll never get better.

682
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:29.740
And I think that's a lot of the things that I've seen in Asian America is like

683
00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:32.800
that self limitation,
this fear of rocking the boat,

684
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.780
this fear of like shaming our families.

685
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:38.320
I can't air my family's dirty laundry cause all our stories are so personal and

686
00:40:38.321 --> 00:40:41.600
very deep.
Um,
but if we don't do that,
then we come,

687
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:45.070
we're just going to stay invisible.
You know what I mean?
So that like if you're,

688
00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:48.130
if you're a generation of kids and you can actually say,

689
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:52.030
I don't like the scarlet Johannson casting,
that's great.

690
00:40:52.031 --> 00:40:53.410
Like the world needs to know that.

691
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:56.920
And then Hollywood reporter can write an editorial on that about the problematic

692
00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.800
nature of whitewashing and they'll bring up Mickey Rooney.

693
00:40:59.801 --> 00:41:01.750
They'll bring up everything,
you know,

694
00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.410
Bruce Lee and clean everything and then we can start having those conversations.

695
00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:09.940
So sharing I believe in every individual and here just cause you're not an actor

696
00:41:09.941 --> 00:41:13.630
or writer or a theory or producer,
whatever.

697
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:18.070
Everyone through their power,
their phone has the power of influence those dates.

698
00:41:18.071 --> 00:41:19.690
Somebody is looking at that data.

699
00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.920
Somebody who's making decisions based off of that,
right?
Like viewership.

700
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.700
There are artists that are independent that make their living off of youtube

701
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:32.701
viewership and get hired to speak at colleges or like do a little music.

702
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.420
They make their living off of that.
So those views,

703
00:41:35.421 --> 00:41:37.490
I know for a fact count so much.

704
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.050
So I I like don't ever like take yourself out of the running of your own

705
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:43.750
influence.
Russell.
Amy,

706
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.190
<v 3>quick last thoughts.
You have a lot of thoughts.</v>

707
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.630
Technology isn't necessarily organic and the development,

708
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:57.200
it's capitalized and it's funded and people are making money off of technology.

709
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.280
And I would argue that technology has become the opiate of the masses,

710
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:06.360
that Asian Americans are so concerned about their representation and how they

711
00:42:06.361 --> 00:42:09.030
are seen and whether we're invisible or who does what to who.

712
00:42:09.031 --> 00:42:10.720
I see my family every day.
I see you.

713
00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.000
<v 5>I know them by name visible to me.
I know there's,</v>

714
00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.450
<v 3>sorry they don't have to tell me their story.
They're not the voiceless.
So,</v>

715
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.190
but we're still concerned about representation,

716
00:42:21.191 --> 00:42:25.090
but we're not concerned about repo real people living in real conditions.

717
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.350
And so it's both.

718
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.370
And it is that our representations need to affect how we care about people and

719
00:42:30.371 --> 00:42:32.770
their material conditions.
Are they poor?

720
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.460
Do they have health care access to Kelly's speak to a doctor in their language.

721
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:41.200
So I'm sort of concerned that for Asian Americans who are so concerned about

722
00:42:41.201 --> 00:42:42.011
representation,

723
00:42:42.011 --> 00:42:46.780
they got to get out side of technology and start dealing with real people in

724
00:42:46.781 --> 00:42:51.330
real situations and develop a sense of compassion and heart to.

725
00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.950
So it's not just about telling a story,

726
00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.550
it's about alleviating the injustices and the poverty.

727
00:42:57.551 --> 00:42:59.700
And the struggle is that a lot of people are going through it.

728
00:42:59.701 --> 00:43:03.280
Now a lot of Asian Americans who look like you and me,

729
00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:07.210
if you're Asian American who could be like your grandparents are going through

730
00:43:07.211 --> 00:43:10.390
really hard difficulties.
And if all we care about this representation,

731
00:43:10.391 --> 00:43:12.310
I think they're just like,
oh,

732
00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.790
I'm going to just watch another youtube video to de stress.
Right?

733
00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.920
Social media is causing,

734
00:43:17.921 --> 00:43:20.830
Asian Americans have higher rates of anxiety and depression now in this

735
00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:25.590
generation than ever before.
So it has its good things,
but we have to be aware

736
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.250
<v 5>that's also a residual from actual Asia.
I mean,</v>

737
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:33.280
Koreans have the highest rate of suicide in the world and alcoholism and plastic

738
00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:37.960
surgery.
And like that's a documentary I would like to make to talk about.

739
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:41.060
They don't want to talk about it though.
So like I,
I completed that.

740
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.210
I am learning so much.
Um,
I really want to talk to you

741
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.990
and it was this,
this is great though,

742
00:43:47.991 --> 00:43:51.110
but because I feel like there's just this difference because the people that I'm

743
00:43:51.111 --> 00:43:52.760
around,
the artists that I'm around particular,

744
00:43:52.761 --> 00:43:55.310
they care about everything about that.
So there's,

745
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:59.030
there's always going to be pockets and different arrange of people who care.

746
00:43:59.031 --> 00:44:02.270
I'm just like a beauty blogger just to send me all the sponsored products and

747
00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:03.500
that's all they care about.
Fine,

748
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.620
but they have influence on like when they start talking about body image and

749
00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:10.700
anxiety and like dysmorphia,
Anorexia,
like eating disorders,

750
00:44:10.701 --> 00:44:14.360
whatever and then you can have the people who are very socially social justice

751
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:18.050
minded because when they see that only the things that people are talking about

752
00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:21.230
are things about looking pretty and your Instagram filter there,
it's going to,

753
00:44:21.231 --> 00:44:24.830
it's going to cause a rise out of people who like what about refugees?

754
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:29.030
What about poverty?
And they'll get motivated to make those stories shine too.

755
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.130
I mean there's tensions,
right?
Amy,
you have the last word.

756
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:36.730
<v 1>Well I think it's the content in social media that is making us anxious.
Like I,</v>

757
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:40.940
I,
there is a lot of noise but I think people can also become really good about

758
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:44.170
listening to what's important.
A lot of those stories,

759
00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.880
we wouldn't know about them if they were not social media.

760
00:44:46.881 --> 00:44:50.510
And I do think the reason why representation is important,
it becomes a gateway.

761
00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.480
Like those stories are important for us to feel.

762
00:44:53.481 --> 00:44:57.470
Most people are feel,
uh,

763
00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.700
they are motivated by their emotions rather than by facts.

764
00:45:01.701 --> 00:45:06.380
Like I didn't really understand or I didn't really feel the impact of so many

765
00:45:06.381 --> 00:45:10.120
historical events until I read about it,
about even fictional characters,

766
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.330
experiencing that emotion,

767
00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.160
going through these feelings of shame or anger or frustration or alienation.

768
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.280
And that is how we create compassionate with other people.

769
00:45:19.281 --> 00:45:21.800
And that's how other people learn our stories and then they try to make a

770
00:45:21.801 --> 00:45:25.010
difference.
But if we don't have those stories available,

771
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:28.790
then we're not going to have people curious to be able to hear more and listen

772
00:45:28.791 --> 00:45:33.260
and pay attention to the very real issues of the fact that there is an

773
00:45:33.261 --> 00:45:37.130
incredible diversity in Asian Americans in that we have,
uh,

774
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.180
we have the opportunities to help each other to help all income levels of Asian

775
00:45:41.181 --> 00:45:45.770
Americans and see where we're coming from and where are we supposed to go?

776
00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:48.640
Well,
I want to thank

777
00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:53.740
<v 2>each of you,
Amy,
a Noob Russel mangy for contributing to a really,</v>

778
00:45:53.741 --> 00:45:57.580
really rich conversation.
Um,
Kelly say thank you to them.

779
00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:01.070
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>
