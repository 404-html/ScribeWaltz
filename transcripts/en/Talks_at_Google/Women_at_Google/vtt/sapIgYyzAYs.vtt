1
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.410
Hi everybody.
Uh,
I guess I'm the one that gets,
did,

2
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:11.460
do the introduction here.

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.650
So we were just talking a little while ago about how science fiction in

4
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:22.440
particular is a genre with a couple of competing,
uh,

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.360
uh,
qualities about it.
On one hand,
good science fiction is about,
you know,

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.240
the time and place it's written,
not,
you know,
thousands of year in the future,

7
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.170
but on the other hand,
you're not supposed to think.
So while you're reading it,

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.670
I,
and the author that you're here to see today,

9
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.780
I am lucky is extremely good at both sides of that coin.
Right?

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.380
So let's hear her talk about her new book.

11
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.730
<v 0>Oh,
hello.
It's good to see everybody here.
Look at you all.
This is wonderful.
Um,</v>

13
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.870
I guess I'll start,
uh,

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.100
if everybody is agreeable with the reading a little bit from the new book.
Yeah.

15
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.880
Uh,
so this book is in a lot of ways,
uh,

16
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.800
it's set in the same universe as the trilogy,

17
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:09.590
but it's a rather different from the trilogy.

18
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.520
I felt like I needed kind of a break from that intensity.
Uh,

19
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:16.550
and so I wanted to write something a little more of a romp,

20
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.020
a something a little more relaxing after that.
Uh,
so,
uh,

21
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:25.490
I'm going to start not at the very beginning,
uh,
but a little in and,

22
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.550
uh,
what's happening is the main character in gray,
uh,

23
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.070
she has spent literally every space penny she has,

24
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.290
uh,
trying to,
uh,

25
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.190
spring and notorious criminal from the euphemistically named prison,

26
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:45.140
compassionate release,
compassionate removal.
Please excuse me.
Uh,

27
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.310
and uh,

28
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.340
she has done this and this person has been delivered to her in a crate in a

29
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:53.610
suspension pod,
uh,

30
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.350
which in some ways is a relief to her because she doesn't have to explain what

31
00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:00.350
she's doing to them quite yet.
Uh,
and,
uh,

32
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.090
she's taken the crate to the ship that she has booked to take her back home and

33
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:09.140
the captain,
uh,
is having none of it.
He does not want to take anyone,

34
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:13.340
a board who is not like conscious and able to say,
yes,
I want to go somewhere.

35
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.060
Right.
Captain Nuzeen stared at her over the crate.

36
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.930
<v 1>Okay,</v>

37
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.190
<v 0>I am on the very edge.
He said finally of refunding your passage,</v>

38
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.970
both of the births you've paid for and asking you to leave this bay.

39
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.510
I haven't made up my mind yet,
but I'll tell you one thing.

40
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.870
There's no way you're bringing that person.
Paula Boudreaux came.

41
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:37.580
You said a board my ship still in that suspension pod and considering you

42
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:39.890
expected to meet him awaken on frozen,

43
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.190
you won't have any objection to throwing 'em out now I presume.

44
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.420
<v 0>Will you take us aboard then I'll consider taking you a board then Paula</v>

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.440
Boudreaux Keem can do as he likes.
A moment's thought.

47
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.010
If he doesn't want to come aboard,
I'll refund you are fair.

48
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.380
It could've been in race opposed.
It was some sort of chance.
Anyway,

49
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.180
captain is Iin.
Put his other hand on the crate.
Step back.
Excellency,

50
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.260
you don't want your foot caught under this in gray.
Stepped back in the crate,

51
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:12.700
settled to the floor with a funk.

52
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.290
Do you know if this person has ever been in suspension before in gray?

53
00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:22.540
Picked up her jacket and bag and sandals off the crate lid.
No.
Why?

54
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.220
Captain is Iin.
Touched the crates,
latches and carefully slid the lid aside.

55
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.340
He might panic if he doesn't know what to expect.

56
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.990
A little help would be nice in grade,
dropped her sandals and bag,

57
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.890
pulled her jacket on and then helped brace the lid as captain Dezeen tilted it

58
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:41.110
and let it slide down to rest against the crate.

59
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.430
Captain is he and looked for a moment at the smooth black surface of the pod.

60
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.210
Then slid open the pods control panel.
Everything looks good.

61
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:52.240
He said as a giant black spiders scuttled out of the airlock.

62
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.620
Nearly a meter high.
A rolled up blanket clutched in one Harry appendage.

63
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.940
Weirdly,
disturbingly graceful.
It's skittered up to captain as iin and stopped.

64
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.200
Turned one of it's far too many stock dies toward in gray.
No,

65
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:08.530
it wasn't a spider.
It was something else.

66
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.410
Um,
setting gray.
That's is that a spider?

67
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.270
She didn't know why the back of her neck was prickling.
She didn't mind spiders,

68
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.890
but this thing was so unsettling.
It's legs were jointed wrong.

69
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:27.730
She realized,
and it's,
I stock sprouted right out of its blob of a body.

70
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.600
There was no waste,
no head,
and something else was wrong though.

71
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:34.450
She couldn't quite see what.
Of course,

72
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:38.470
it's not a spider replied captain busines still frowning at the suspension pod.

73
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.420
You don't get spiders with half meter bodies are two meter legs bans or you
know,

74
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.590
not an augmented ones,
but this isn't a spider.
He looked up,

75
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.950
but it's kind of like a spider.
I'll grant you that.

76
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.850
Do you have a problem with spiders?
Excellency?
They're not.

77
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:56.080
Spider's body trembled.

78
00:04:56.081 --> 00:05:00.160
Gelatinous Lee stretched to become oblong rather than round and for extra legs

79
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:02.800
lit out to touch the bay floor.
Does that help?

80
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.810
Seeing the thing change shape was somehow even more disturbing,

81
00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:12.400
but she refused to step back even though she wanted to.
Not really.

82
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.240
And I don't mind spiders at all.
It's just this looks so,

83
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.680
so organic except in a wrong,
squishy,
itchy sort of way.

84
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.400
Well,
yes.
Said Captain Dezeen Standing Square,

85
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:28.900
install it by the open crate entirely unbothered by the spidery thing beside
him.

86
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.130
A lot of it is.
Some people find it unsettling and apparently you're one of them,

87
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.120
but it's just a Biomek.
You'll get used to it after a few days or if you don't,

88
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:38.170
I'll keep it out of your way.

89
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.520
He touched the control panel and the smooth surface of the pod broke open with a

90
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:45.620
click and slit aside for just an instant in gray,

91
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:47.770
saw a person lying naked and motionless.

92
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.220
Submerged in a pool of blue fluid unevenly cut hair,

93
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:54.640
a tangled mass over half of our sharp featured face,
thin,

94
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.990
thinner than she remembered.

95
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:59.600
Pictures of Pallet Boudreaux came the long well to the scar along your right

96
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.434
flank.

97
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.580
Then the smooth glossy surface of the preserving medium rippled and below it is

98
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:09.260
the person opened their eyes and sat convulsively up choking one out thrust arms

99
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:13.070
smacking hard into in gray,
captain newsy and grabbed her other arm.

100
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.670
It's all right.
He said,
boy,
still calm and serious.

101
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.660
The person continued to choke as blue fluid poured out of your mouth and nose.

102
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.550
She did away from your body back into the pod.
It's all right.
Everything's fine.

103
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.413
You're all right.

104
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.750
<v 3>Okay.</v>

105
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.900
<v 0>The last of the fluid drained away from the person's mouth and nose.</v>

106
00:06:30.901 --> 00:06:35.901
Any gave a breathy shaking moan first time as captain azine reaching down for

107
00:06:36.181 --> 00:06:40.630
the blanket,
the spider Mac still proffered the naked person in the pod closed.

108
00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:44.040
Her eyes gasped a few times and then our breathing settled.

109
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.550
Are you all right?
Asked in gray in volunteer this time.

110
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.510
The most commonly spoken language in waste system though she was fairly sure

111
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:54.580
Pallette Boudreaux came would have understood year,

112
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.260
which captain nuzeen had used.

113
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.820
<v 3>Okay.</v>

114
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.030
<v 0>Captain oozine shook the blanket out and laid it around the naked person's</v>

115
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:01.864
shoulders.

116
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

117
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.930
<v 0>Where am I?
He asked in [inaudible] voice.</v>

118
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:08.450
Rough with cold or fear or something else.

119
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.460
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

120
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.130
<v 0>we're on Tier Sila station in tier system setting.</v>

121
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:14.050
Ray and then to captain nuzeen.

122
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.140
He asked where he is and I told him we're on [inaudible].

123
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.640
<v 3>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.410
<v 0>How did I get here?</v>

125
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.370
As the person sitting in the suspension pod in [inaudible] by now,

126
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:28.000
the blue fluid had all drained away to some reservoir in the pod itself.

127
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.060
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.960
<v 0>I paid someone to bring you out setting gray.
I'm in gray.
Out schooled.</v>

129
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.870
<v 3>Okay.</v>

130
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.490
<v 0>The person opened their eyes then</v>

131
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.033
<v 3>who?</v>

132
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.020
<v 0>Well in gray had never really met.</v>

133
00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:43.980
Paula Boudreaux came in person and he was 10 or more years older than she was

134
00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:47.370
and not likely to have noticed a very young oak gold foster daughter.

135
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.490
Not Likely to have known her name when she had still been a child,

136
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.900
let alone her adult name,

137
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.290
which she'd taken only months before he'd gone to compassionate removal.

138
00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.390
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

139
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.210
<v 0>I'm one of Natano [inaudible] children sitting in gray.</v>

140
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.270
<v 3>Okay.</v>

141
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.650
<v 0>Why he asked or voice gaining strength would one of representatives,</v>

142
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.020
our schools,
children bring me anywhere.

143
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:08.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

144
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.320
<v 0>In grade,
tried to think of a simple way to explain and settled.</v>

145
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:14.230
Finally for your palate,
Beaudry came,

146
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.150
it gave a little shake of your head,
a frown.

147
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.613
<v 3>Who</v>

148
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.860
<v 0>in race suppressed to start is another spider.</v>

149
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:24.570
Mac came skittering out of the airlock.

150
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.240
This one held a large cup of steaming liquid,

151
00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:31.380
which it passed to captain is before it spun and returned to the ship here.

152
00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:35.400
Excellency,
he said in year offering it to the person's still sitting in the pod.

153
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.560
Can you hold this here?

154
00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:40.650
Said the first spider Mac in a thin thready voice in [inaudible].

155
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.820
Can you hold this?

156
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:43.550
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

157
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.740
<v 0>Orange.
You Paula Boudreaux.</v>

158
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:49.100
Keem asked in gray feeling strangely numb except maybe for an unpleasant

159
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:53.390
sensation in her gut as though she was not capable of feeling any more despair

160
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:57.980
or fear than she already had today.
The facilitator had said this was Palade.

161
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.880
No,
it said it examined the payment and the merchandise and both were what they

162
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:07.470
should have been,
but surely that was the same thing.
No.

163
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:11.610
Said the person sitting in the suspension pod,
I don't even know who that is.

164
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.410
He noticed the Cup captain is Ian was proffering thank you.
He said and took it.

165
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.250
Cup did in our hands as captain azine stopped the blanket from sliding off your

166
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:24.690
shoulders.
Drink.
Some said captain busines still in year.
It's Serb at.

167
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.890
It'll do you good drink.
It said the spider Mech and Vania.
It's served at.

168
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.330
It's good.
A nutritious.
What if there had been a mistake?

169
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.070
This person looked like Paula [inaudible] team,
but also in a way he didn't.

170
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.330
He was thinner.
Certainly an ingrate had only seen him in person once or twice,

171
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:45.880
and that was years ago.
You're not politic woodworking?

172
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:47.401
No.

173
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:52.230
Said the person who was not Paulette Boudreaux Keem I already said that he took

174
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:56.680
a drink of the Serb bat.
Oh,
that's good.
Really.

175
00:09:56.681 --> 00:10:00.820
It didn't matter.
Even if this person was Palade,
if he was lying to her,

176
00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:01.900
it made no difference.

177
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.160
She couldn't compel him to go with her back to way and not just because captain

178
00:10:06.161 --> 00:10:08.800
is iin would refuse to take them unless he wanted to go.

179
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.820
Her plan had always depended on Paula being willing to go along.

180
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.890
You look a lot like Paula Boudreaux.
Keem in gray said,
still hoping do.

181
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:23.390
I asked and took another drink of surveys that I guess someone made a mistake.

182
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.150
He looked straight at in gray then and said,

183
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.260
so when a Buddha Keem goes to compassionate removal is only for show,
is it?

184
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.050
They send someone to fish them out behind the scenes.

185
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.870
Air Expression didn't change,
but her voice was bitter in grade.

186
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.360
Dude drew breath to say indignantly.
No,
of course not,

187
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.220
but found herself struck speechless by the fact that she had herself gotten a

188
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.760
Beaudry key amount of compassionate removal.
No,
she managed finally.

189
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.150
No,
I,
you're really not poet Boudreaux came.

190
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.520
I'm really not.
He said then who are you as the spider Mac?

191
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.320
They'll captain Dezeen hadn't said anything.

192
00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:04.940
Allowed the person sitting in the suspension pod took another drink of survey

193
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.990
then said,
you said we're onto your seal us.
Yes.

194
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:11.870
Said the spider Mac in gray found she couldn't speak at all.

195
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.380
I think I'd rather not tell you who I am.

196
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.880
He looked around at the suspension party,
sat in the crates,

197
00:11:18.881 --> 00:11:23.090
still surrounding it at Captain Dezeen at the spider Mac beside the captain

198
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.990
around the bay.
I think I'd like to visit the incomers office.

199
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.170
Why asked in gray?
Almost a cry.

200
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:33.320
Unable to keep her confusion and her despair out of her voice.

201
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.150
Unless you have financial resources were unaware of said the spider Mac.

202
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.180
You won't be able to do more than apply for an indenture.

203
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.360
You may or may not get one.
And unless you have contacts here,

204
00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:46.910
you very probably won't like what you get.
If you do,

205
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.150
I'll like it better than compassionate removal.

206
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.640
He drained the last of our beverage.
Look on the bright side.
Captain is Ean,

207
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:58.420
said himself to Ian Gray in year as he took the cup from not Paula,

208
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.160
I'll refund you or passage and you'll be able to eat actual food for the next

209
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.993
couple of days.
Oh,

210
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.580
so,
uh,
usually at this stage I take questions.
Sometimes I say a,

211
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:16.540
I could maybe sing and dance,
but I'm very bad at those things.
So,
uh,

212
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.340
if anyone has any questions,
I know there are mics in the aisles there and a,

213
00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:23.500
I will be happy to answer questions or talk about whatever people would like me

214
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:24.334
to talk about.

215
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.420
<v 4>All right.
This is kind of a generic question,</v>

216
00:12:27.421 --> 00:12:31.740
but like what does your like writing setup look like?
And you know,

217
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.680
what do you do when you,
you know,

218
00:12:34.681 --> 00:12:37.900
find it hard to write or kind of stuck creatively?
Yeah.

219
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.960
<v 0>So,
uh,
my,
I have a couple of places that I tend to write a,</v>

220
00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:45.110
I have a nice little office in the basement that my husband put together for me.

221
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.640
Uh,
I have two nice big monitors,
which are the best for editing,
uh,

222
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.810
uh,
and,
uh,
a nice ergonomic keyboard,

223
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.180
which I love my ergonomic keyboard.
Uh,

224
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.840
sometimes that doesn't suit where I'm at.
Uh,

225
00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:04.250
so I will take a laptop out to the back porch or to a coffee shop or whatever.

226
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.970
Um,
when I'm stuck very often I will spend an hour or two,

227
00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:10.390
like basically banging my head on the desk,
uh,

228
00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.200
trying to figure out where the sentences are that need to come.
Uh,

229
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.590
and then very often I'll give up and go upstairs to take a shower and there's

230
00:13:18.591 --> 00:13:19.760
something in the shower water.

231
00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:23.310
Usually that's when I realized what I needed to have written a,

232
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.110
if that doesn't work,
I will go for a walk.
And if the walk doesn't work,

233
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.950
I know it's time to go to the library where I will just walk down the history

234
00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:33.830
and anthropology shelves and pull off anything that seems appealing.

235
00:13:33.831 --> 00:13:37.130
And nine times out of 10,
that first stack of books will have something in it.

236
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.040
That was what I was looking for.
Cool.
Thank you.

237
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.500
<v 4>Hi.
Uh,</v>

238
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.070
could you talk about your decision to use the specific pronouns rather than the

239
00:13:46.071 --> 00:13:46.904
female pronoun?

240
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.130
<v 0>Ah,
well I do use,
I do use she in this book,
uh,
but not default,
right.</v>

241
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.540
As I,
as I do in the trilogy,
uh,

242
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.790
I'm very proud about my choice in the trilogy.
Uh,

243
00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:03.450
I'm really pleased with the effects that it had.
Uh,
but I also,
uh,

244
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.890
listening to conversations about that,
uh,
among other people.
Uh,

245
00:14:06.891 --> 00:14:09.230
some folks pointed out that that usage,

246
00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:12.680
while it does cool things also sort of erases a bunch of different identities.

247
00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:13.281
Uh,

248
00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:16.490
and I said that's an interesting point and maybe I want to think some more about

249
00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:20.930
that.
So,
uh,
when it came to this book,
uh,
is very much like the trilogy.

250
00:14:20.931 --> 00:14:23.120
It's very much not what the book is about.
But I said,

251
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.860
what if I had a society that doesn't think of gender as being obviously a
binary?

252
00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:31.100
The way our culture tends to think of it.
Uh,
this society thinks,

253
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.270
obviously there are three genders,
right?
There are men,
women and Nemon.
Uh,

254
00:14:35.271 --> 00:14:37.190
and it's a he and she,

255
00:14:37.191 --> 00:14:42.191
and he and I chose this Vivec pronouns in particular because there are lots to

256
00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:42.950
choose from.

257
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.330
There are just many that folks have suggested and come up with.

258
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.000
Uh,
and,
uh,
but as it happens,

259
00:14:50.001 --> 00:14:54.950
I actually know some who use those as their pronouns.
And I thought,
well,

260
00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:57.890
that'll be kind of fun because then they'll get to open the book and say,
Oh,

261
00:14:57.891 --> 00:14:59.600
look,
there's my pronouns.
Right.
Being used.

262
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:02.900
There's people there who I could think of are,
are like me in a way.
I mean,

263
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:06.110
I probably don't capture their identities because that's a complicated thing.
Uh,

264
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.133
but it's kind of,

265
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.340
it's so rewarding and important to be able to see that on the page.

266
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:13.040
So that's why I made that specific choice.
Yeah.
Thank you.

267
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.350
<v 5>Um,
I know that lots of,</v>

268
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.180
some authors have talked about how they write very out of order.
While I've,

269
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.440
I've heard some who were able to write more,
uh,

270
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.300
in line and I was curious how that goes for you.
Are you,
are you,
uh,

271
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:32.010
in line with the uh,
timeline or is it all over the place?

272
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.360
<v 0>I pretty much can't write out of order.</v>

273
00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:39.310
I haven't been able to write out of order,
uh,
partly because I don't outline,
uh,

274
00:15:39.311 --> 00:15:43.090
and very often,
although I do have an idea of where I'm going with the story,

275
00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:45.880
I know where I want to end up.
I often know some signposts,

276
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.340
but the specifics of how a scene works,

277
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:52.000
I can't envision until I've got what comes before it.
Uh,

278
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.230
because so many tiny little nuances of conversation or action will inform that

279
00:15:56.231 --> 00:15:58.430
next scene.
Uh,
so then it,

280
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:02.230
I don't have any ground to write the next scene from.
So,
uh,

281
00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.410
I have never been able to write very much out of order at all.

282
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.800
I'm very envious of my friends who outlined very,
a very,

283
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.510
at a very detailed level.
They write so much faster than I do.
Uh,
but,

284
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.330
and one of these days,
maybe I'll manage it,
but I've never been able to do it.

285
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.150
Yeah.

286
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.871
<v 5>To what extent,</v>

287
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:22.220
if any did in m Banks's culture series and their ascension ships sort of

288
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:24.110
influence,
uh,
you know,

289
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.620
your choice to sort of feed Sherif ascension ship has a protagonist and the

290
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.580
insularity trilogy

291
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.630
<v 0>actually not at all because I had not read banks until I was very far along in</v>

292
00:16:33.631 --> 00:16:36.180
ancillary justice.
Uh,
when I did read banks,
I was like,

293
00:16:36.181 --> 00:16:39.780
this is awesome and I love that there's actually like,

294
00:16:39.781 --> 00:16:42.920
somebody will buy stories with,
sent you the chips.
Right.
Um,

295
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.280
but,
uh,
my work frequently gets compared to banks,

296
00:16:47.281 --> 00:16:52.080
which is a tremendous compliment but not a particularly accurate assessment of

297
00:16:52.081 --> 00:16:53.170
my influences.
Yeah.

298
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.490
<v 2>Every writer we'll like choose some parts of the world to focus on and pay less</v>

299
00:16:57.491 --> 00:17:02.080
attention to other parts.
In your work,
I noticed you use a lot of,
you know,

300
00:17:02.081 --> 00:17:05.500
off the shelf Scifi technology,
um,
shuttle.

301
00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:07.740
We'll get your lively from one place to another,
but you don't relate,

302
00:17:07.741 --> 00:17:11.710
dwell on how it works,
the cracks,
it will heal an injury.
Um,

303
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.670
was that a conscious decision to focus less on the attack,

304
00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:17.080
more on the social aspects or whatever?

305
00:17:17.081 --> 00:17:18.520
Can you talk about your thought process there?

306
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.930
<v 0>Uh,
it very much was a conscious decision.
Uh,</v>

307
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.930
in some cases actually I've worked out for myself what my rationalization is for

308
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:30.020
some of the sort of magic tech.
Uh,

309
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.370
but I feel like that's not the focus of the stories as such.
Uh,

310
00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:38.450
I like working with the implications of it more than with the actual details of

311
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:42.290
the tech.
Uh,
so,
so yeah,
that was definitely a conscious choice.

312
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.690
How fast do you write?
It really depends.

313
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:52.350
Ideally,
in theory,
in theory,
I write at least a thousand words a day.

314
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.940
That's ideally,
uh,
some days I can do much more than that.

315
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.110
Some days I'm lucky to get five words.
Uh,

316
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.750
some days I'm in the stage of creating where actually what I need to do is read

317
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:05.640
and think.
And no words are coming at all.

318
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:07.860
And those days are very scary and frustrating,

319
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.950
but I've discovered that they're an important part of the process because it

320
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:13.280
doesn't move forward without those days.
Yeah.

321
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.670
<v 6>So is it radically different when you're actively working on a book versus,</v>

322
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.410
you know,
breaks in between?

323
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.980
<v 0>Oh,
absolutely.
Very,
very different.
Um,
and I can,
when I'm between large projects,</v>

324
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.650
I will go a month or two without having written anything at all and then I'll

325
00:18:27.651 --> 00:18:32.450
get super paranoid and have to remind myself that actually it'll be okay.
Yeah.

326
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.420
I'm actually still working on something even if there aren't words.
Yeah.

327
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.140
<v 6>So I'm,
I'm delighted to be back in the,</v>

328
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.880
in the same universe and especially in a different part of it.

329
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.180
I haven't read the book yet.
Um,
w when I got to the end of the trilogy,

330
00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:45.860
I was a little distraught at the,

331
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.060
at the idea that I might never actually find out what's going on inside the

332
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:54.290
Dyson sphere that's in the middle of everything.
Um,
and I'm wondering like,

333
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.660
you know,

334
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.160
do you know how much of the of the map of this university are eventually going

335
00:18:58.161 --> 00:18:58.701
to write about?

336
00:18:58.701 --> 00:19:02.930
And will we see the inside of that Dyson sphere with the gloves off at some

337
00:19:02.931 --> 00:19:04.130
point in the future or,

338
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.460
<v 0>um,
clubs off that's very improper.
Uh,</v>

339
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.990
um,
I obviously know a lot more about the Dyson sphere than ever ended up on the

340
00:19:13.991 --> 00:19:18.670
page.
Right.
Uh,
as to whether or not I'll write about it.
I might,
uh,

341
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.980
I have to admit I'm easily bored.
Uh,

342
00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:24.550
and I'm in a place right now where I'm fortunate to be able to just take off

343
00:19:24.551 --> 00:19:28.870
after whatever's shiny.
Uh,
and so if that feels shiny to me,
I might,
uh,

344
00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:31.570
so I don't know for sure there aren't concrete plans to do it,

345
00:19:31.571 --> 00:19:35.770
but there aren't concrete plans not to as well.
So I make no promises.

346
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.030
<v 6>So in terms of your influences in fiction,</v>

347
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.490
what are your influences outside of science fiction

348
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.580
<v 0>outside of science fiction?
Oh,</v>

349
00:19:45.581 --> 00:19:49.660
the inside of science fiction as much easier to answer,
isn't it?
Uh,

350
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:55.170
I honestly don't know.
Uh,
well,
I do a,
I do read quite a lot of,
uh,

351
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.220
history and anthropology almost at random.
Uh,

352
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.300
I find that a real human cultures are more varied and nuanced than anything I

353
00:20:05.021 --> 00:20:06.860
could ever put on the page.
Uh,

354
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.380
and if I want to create something realistic,
uh,

355
00:20:11.381 --> 00:20:14.600
I can't go wrong by looking at what already exists.
Uh,

356
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.220
in history of course is full of amazing stories that often don't end up in

357
00:20:18.221 --> 00:20:19.750
school because there's,
you know,

358
00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:22.600
you don't hear about them when you're taking your western Civ course or
whatever.

359
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.910
Uh,
and there's just some amazing stuff to use their,
uh,

360
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.760
so I will read things like that.
Uh,
I also find,

361
00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.290
uh,
I really enjoy historical fiction for some similar reasons.

362
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.550
Uh,
when I'm not working on a,
on a project in particular,

363
00:20:39.551 --> 00:20:43.240
often I will go and read like some very light historical romances just as kind

364
00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:47.680
of a mental break.
I don't know how much those influenced my,
uh,
my writing.

365
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.890
Uh,
I do know,
uh,
when the second book in the trilogy came out and,
uh,

366
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.820
a bunch of people were like,
wow,
this is really weird.

367
00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:56.110
It's very different from the first book.

368
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:59.650
And it was one person in particular who DMD me and said,
you know what?

369
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:01.840
This really reminds me of this Patrick O'bryan.

370
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:02.780
<v 3>Okay,</v>

371
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.051
<v 0>nice.</v>

372
00:21:03.051 --> 00:21:07.100
And actually I main lines that entire series right before I sat down to write

373
00:21:07.101 --> 00:21:11.900
this.
So
influences come in odd places.
Yeah.

374
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.740
So it's influences within science fiction is easier.

375
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:22.090
What are your influences within science fiction?
So the obvious answers,
uh,

376
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.240
to influences within science fiction would be as a child,

377
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:29.500
I read way more Andre Norton that could possibly be healthy for a single person.

378
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.880
Uh,
I suspect that Norton is a writer who she doesn't get talked about very much

379
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:35.080
critically.
Uh,

380
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.740
but I suspect she's had a profound impact on the field because a lot of us grew

381
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:42.010
up reading her work.
Uh,
and,
uh,
I'm,

382
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.780
I couldn't point to where,

383
00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:48.610
but I don't doubt that her work has influenced mine very strongly.
Uh,
also,

384
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:51.210
uh,
especially in the past 10 or 15 years,
uh,

385
00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:55.240
I have become a huge CJ cherry fan girl.
Uh,
those of you who,

386
00:21:55.241 --> 00:21:58.600
who's another writer who's a major figure in the field and maybe doesn't get

387
00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:00.010
talked about as much.
Uh,

388
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:03.400
I mentioned her at every opportunity because I think that should probably change

389
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.530
a,
those of you who have read her foreign or series,
which I love,
it's up to what,

390
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:10.570
18 books now.
Um,

391
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.040
we'll probably have noticed there are actually some deliberate Easter eggs in

392
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:19.750
the trilogy that are deliberate hat tips to Cj Cherry.
Uh,
uh,

393
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:24.070
I just,
I love her work so much.
I also,
uh,
when I was first starting out,

394
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.420
seriously writing,
uh,
and I realized my visuals left something to be desired,

395
00:22:28.421 --> 00:22:33.060
I went back and reread a large amount of Jack Vance who's work I just admired

396
00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:35.420
tremendously on a sentence level,
uh,

397
00:22:35.421 --> 00:22:39.970
just beautiful writing a really gorgeous visuals and are a real,

398
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.750
almost sort of anthropological knack for,
uh,

399
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.910
creating tiny little sort of some nail sketches of bizarre human cultures that

400
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:51.310
feel absolutely real where you say,
wow,
that's really weird.

401
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:53.580
And I totally believe that human beings would do that.
It needs,

402
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:56.440
or just little like little sort of decorations along the way.

403
00:22:56.441 --> 00:22:59.860
Just sort of ornamental stuff.
Uh,
his work is really fabulous.

404
00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.470
<v 7>You talked about when you just mentioned,
you know,</v>

405
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:04.180
when you first started seriously writing,

406
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:09.160
and so was there when you're writing a first book,

407
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.810
like is there a moment that you sort of go from,
this is something I'm doing to,

408
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:17.590
this is going to be a trilogy in a universe.
Like how do you,

409
00:23:17.591 --> 00:23:21.470
how do you get from not writer to writer?
Like,
what is,

410
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:26.090
<v 0>was that transition like what was that transition like for you?
Like it's,</v>

411
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:31.340
it's,
it's almost one of those things where you suddenly look up and realize that

412
00:23:31.341 --> 00:23:33.530
you've passed a transition.
Right.
Um,

413
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:37.250
and I'm going to be flipped and it also not flip and say the way that you become

414
00:23:37.251 --> 00:23:40.220
a writer is to write that sound.
It's like not a helpful answer.

415
00:23:40.221 --> 00:23:44.000
And if when I was at the stage where I was a beginning writer and a writer would

416
00:23:44.001 --> 00:23:47.340
say,
the way you become a writer to write and be like,
oh,
thanks.
Right.
Uh,

417
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:52.730
I didn't know that.
Uh,
but it actually does.
Uh,
what I,

418
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.390
what happened with me and I think is fairly typical as I have actually written

419
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:58.120
two or three other novels,
uh,

420
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.510
that no one in this room will ever see because they are dreadful.

421
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.000
Um,
and uh,
and they're,
they're put away in a drawer.

422
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.530
But that was part of the process.

423
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:12.020
So that by the time I came to ancillary justice,

424
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:17.000
I had already built up a level of skill and confidence that I was able to say,

425
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.570
oh,
this is going to be a trilogy.
Before I started to write a,

426
00:24:20.571 --> 00:24:22.220
I didn't say that about my first novel,

427
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:25.190
partly because it was a nano rhyme on novel.
And partly because I was just,

428
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:28.610
I had no idea what I was doing.
Uh,
and uh,

429
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:32.060
and it just kinda comes with time and continuing to do it.

430
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.410
If you're going to be a writer,

431
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:36.650
you kind of have to be sort of bloody minded about it.
Uh,

432
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.910
because you're not going to get validation from outside.
You're not going to get,

433
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.010
barring certain special circumstances.

434
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:46.070
You're not going to get a certificate that says,
now you're a writer,
uh,

435
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.400
and you can do everything right and write the most beautiful,

436
00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:54.230
gorgeous work and never have much in the way of success.
Uh,
there's no,

437
00:24:54.231 --> 00:24:56.780
so it's just,
you just have to sit down and do it.

438
00:24:56.781 --> 00:24:59.690
And after a while you do it long enough that it's sort of part of what you're

439
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:02.390
doing right.
And you say,
Oh,
now I'm a writer.
Yeah.

440
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.500
<v 4>So you,
you said earlier that you don't,
you know,</v>

441
00:25:08.501 --> 00:25:10.420
plot or outline too far ahead.

442
00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:14.260
So then how do you know that this is going to be a trilogy and not to books or

443
00:25:14.261 --> 00:25:15.850
four books or 10 books?
Huh.

444
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.290
<v 0>I knew where the trilogy was going to end up.</v>

445
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.100
I knew where the trilogy was headed and I knew I couldn't do that in one novel.

446
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.890
Uh,
but the only,

447
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.070
the only specific signposts I had where for the first novel,

448
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:32.450
like a couple of scenes that I knew I wanted to hit a,
if I look too far ahead,

449
00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:34.520
it would just become way too daunting.
And that's,
you know,

450
00:25:34.521 --> 00:25:38.810
it's like you're up outside of a hundred story building,
like don't look down.

451
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:42.950
Right.
You can't do that.
Uh,
so,
uh,
so that's basically,

452
00:25:42.951 --> 00:25:44.960
I can't start writing unless I know where I want to end up.

453
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.480
So that was how that happened.
Yeah.

454
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.710
<v 4>Yes.
There was a kind of like,
you hit some point and you're like,
okay,</v>

455
00:25:50.711 --> 00:25:55.630
this is enough words for a first book or enough progression in the plot.

456
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.280
Somewhere in between.

457
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:02.410
<v 0>It's a little bit more,
uh,
once I say to myself,
this is a trilogy,
right?</v>

458
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.580
Then I say,
uh,
then I said to myself,
than I need to make,

459
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:11.590
each book has its own arc,
right?
Because I think they should be illegal.
Actually,

460
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.540
you know,
when you pick up a book and you read it,

461
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.270
it's the first in a series and it ends on a cliffhanger and the next book's not

462
00:26:16.271 --> 00:26:19.630
out till next year.
That should be illegal straight up.

463
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.470
And I understand why it happens,

464
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:27.490
especially when you've got a really big work and the publisher is like,
yeah,

465
00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:29.590
this is too big for one volume.
Let's split it in half.

466
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.940
It should still be illegal.
Um,
so,
uh,
so I said,
well,

467
00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:35.170
I know it's a trilogy,

468
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.320
but I also know that I can write and write and maybe never even sell the first

469
00:26:38.321 --> 00:26:43.030
volume.
So I'm going to carve out a story that's itself,

470
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.040
that's complete,

471
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.640
but also that can go on to the rest of the trilogy that I wanted.

472
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:49.410
And that was what I aimed at.
So,

473
00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:50.990
<v 8>um,</v>

474
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.600
so something I was wondering about earlier when you were talking about sort of

475
00:26:53.601 --> 00:26:56.660
how many,
how much you write in a day or how many words or whatever,

476
00:26:56.661 --> 00:27:00.830
how much do those words sort of evolve between the first time you put them down

477
00:27:00.831 --> 00:27:03.410
on like a digital page and the book's publication.

478
00:27:03.411 --> 00:27:07.010
And do you ever like go back and change how the details of something worked out

479
00:27:07.011 --> 00:27:08.620
after you write the next parts are

480
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.770
<v 0>oh yes.
Almost always.</v>

481
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:15.771
I will often start my days writing with going back over what I wrote the day

482
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.540
before.
Uh,
if nothing else to get kind of a running start on what I did.
Uh,

483
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.820
but I'll always be like adjusting sentences and changing things.
And it,

484
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.630
of course,
it also happens that like,
I'll be on the shower in the shower and go,

485
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:31.740
oh my gosh,
five chapters ago,
I need to change this detail.
Right.

486
00:27:31.741 --> 00:27:35.250
And then I'll have to run downstairs and change the thing and hopefully I didn't

487
00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:38.550
drip too much on the keyboard and you know,
uh,
so,
uh,

488
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.820
so there is a fair amount of changing,
but I also,
uh,

489
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.420
I do work very slowly moving ahead.
Uh,

490
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:49.650
so I don't do quite as much ripping out and completely changing things as I did

491
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:52.740
when I first started out.
When I first turned out I was nano rhyming.
Right.

492
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:56.130
So it was like plunge right ahead.
Don't stop,
don't think,
just keep typing.

493
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.600
And that made for a lot of,
yeah,
that whole,
you know,
60 pages has to go right.

494
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.890
So A,
I'm a lot more careful,
but there,

495
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.910
there's always lots of tweaking and adjusting and deleting and adding.

496
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:10.160
<v 4>I have a question about sense and nonsense.
Maybe pseudoscience made mainly the,</v>

497
00:28:10.161 --> 00:28:12.800
uh,
the press corps translators and the tech ambassador.

498
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.490
I is that hard to write fun to write both?

499
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.920
<v 0>It's both.
It's both.
That was,
they were so fun to write.
I loved riding them.</v>

500
00:28:20.921 --> 00:28:23.740
I knew that they were going to be kind of absurd.

501
00:28:23.741 --> 00:28:27.700
But when translated leaky came on stage and the,

502
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.510
and uttered her first couple lines and then I was like,
oh,

503
00:28:31.511 --> 00:28:33.760
this is going somewhere really weird.
And I was like,
yeah,

504
00:28:33.761 --> 00:28:37.930
I'm just going to lean into that.
Right.
And it was a lot of fun.
Uh,
and actually,

505
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.590
uh,
I guess this is potential spoilers.
Uh,
I was,

506
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.510
when I realized how brief a time she was going to be on stage,
uh,

507
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.820
I was very unhappy and I said,
well,
I'm just going to have to change this.

508
00:28:48.821 --> 00:28:51.940
And I tried to change it and it was going to break the book.
Uh,
and I said,

509
00:28:51.941 --> 00:28:54.580
I can't do it.
So I said,
well,
when in the third book,

510
00:28:54.581 --> 00:28:56.170
I know translators Ayotte's coming,

511
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.950
so I'm going to have her on stage every minute I can and get all the fun.

512
00:28:59.951 --> 00:29:03.850
I cannot have her.
Uh,
so they turned out to be such a delight to write,

513
00:29:03.851 --> 00:29:05.380
but it was also very difficult,
right?

514
00:29:05.381 --> 00:29:08.950
Because that's the kind of thing that you can kind of get wrong if you,

515
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.490
it's like a tight rope.
You step to either side and it falls flat.

516
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.490
<v 4>Did you find yourself having to get into to a particular mind space to write</v>

517
00:29:16.491 --> 00:29:17.324
them?

518
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.710
<v 0>Yeah,
kind of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was kind of an odd space.
Yeah,</v>

519
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.600
they were a lot of fun.
They were.
I really,
I missed them.
Of,
of all the,
yeah.

520
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.640
<v 4>Fair enough.
And were there any specific inspirations for those?</v>

521
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.450
<v 0>Um,
I didn't think there were,
but somebody messaged me at one point and said,</v>

522
00:29:34.451 --> 00:29:39.160
did you read Lloyd Alexandra's Prydain chronicles?
I see you all nodding.

523
00:29:39.161 --> 00:29:43.690
You know exactly you're thinking or do or when an and I said,
oh,
I did.

524
00:29:43.691 --> 00:29:46.720
I loved those books.
I read them so many times.

525
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:49.570
I have them practically memorized right when I was a kid.

526
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.380
So it's probably that,
that's probably where this came from,

527
00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:55.480
but I was not conscious of that at all.
Which is,

528
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.230
that's kind of the funny way that the things that you read kind of influenced

529
00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:00.064
you without your knowing.

530
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.770
<v 6>I was wondering if they were a CG cherries,
methane breathers,
but yeah,</v>

531
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.370
<v 0>there was that too.
Yeah.
Cj Cherries.
Methane breezers are fabulous.
Yeah.</v>

532
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.740
<v 3>Awesome.
Thanks.</v>

533
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.010
<v 6>So who sees your stuff while you're writing it?</v>

534
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:14.770
Do you have a writer's group that you work with?
Do you have Beta readers?

535
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.410
<v 0>I,
uh,</v>

536
00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:19.640
I used to have a writers group in town and then a couple of people moved out of

537
00:30:19.641 --> 00:30:20.420
town.

538
00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.830
Now I have a couple of friends who live in town who when I'm feeling super

539
00:30:24.831 --> 00:30:28.070
insecure,
which totally happens,
like the first couple chapters.
And I'm like,

540
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.940
is this even worth writing?
This is just a thing that writers have,
right?
Uh,

541
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.690
sometimes new writers are like,
this means I'm not any good.
No,

542
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:39.170
it means you were a writer.
Uh,
and,
uh,
so then I go to them and I go,

543
00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:42.500
these are my first three chapters.
Is this any good?
And they're like,
yeah,

544
00:30:42.501 --> 00:30:45.190
just go finish it.
Right.
Which is what I need to hear.
Uh,

545
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.400
and then I will give them the manuscript and they'll make comments.
Uh,

546
00:30:49.401 --> 00:30:53.870
I don't always,
and any of y'all who are aspiring fiction writers,

547
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.290
uh,
people who give you comments there were thinking about,

548
00:30:57.291 --> 00:30:59.360
and trying to think about where those comments came from,

549
00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.660
but do not just take the advice that they give you because nine times out of 10,

550
00:31:02.661 --> 00:31:06.260
they're wrong.
When they say,
when they say,
oh,
this isn't working,

551
00:31:06.261 --> 00:31:09.500
you need to explain this more.
Actually,
nine times out of 10,

552
00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:13.550
you need to take away the sentence that makes them ask the question.
Or,
uh,

553
00:31:13.551 --> 00:31:16.790
you know,
this character is not realistic and you're like,
but they should be,

554
00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.780
there's one tiny sentence like two chapters back that is leading the reader

555
00:31:20.781 --> 00:31:23.780
astray somewhere.
So don't just delete things when your,

556
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.510
your commenters say delete something or whatever.
Uh,

557
00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.880
but I find that fairly important,

558
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.760
but I don't rely on it as much as I did when I was just starting out.

559
00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:33.913
<v 3>Thank you.</v>

560
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.040
<v 9>Uh,
I wonder,
so as a fairly inexperienced parent,
uh,</v>

561
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:44.720
I'm wondering how you carve out time and the ability to have complex thoughts
and

562
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.280
how do you do it while there's a tiny human throwing blueberries at you?

563
00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.540
<v 0>It's difficult.
Isn't it?
Or,
uh,</v>

564
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.840
my son had a thing for pushing buttons and plugging and unplugging things

565
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.860
I learned to save frequently.
Yes.
Uh,

566
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.040
it's much easier when they go to school,

567
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.880
which I knew was kind of the cop out answer,
but also to a certain extent,
uh,

568
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.720
I started writing seriously in earnest,

569
00:32:12.721 --> 00:32:15.360
partly because I was home with the children,
uh,

570
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:19.770
who my children probably like your children were the most adorable small

571
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.600
children in the history of small children.
Right.

572
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.210
I will fight anybody who tells me to the contrary.
Uh,

573
00:32:24.211 --> 00:32:27.630
and it was great to be home with them,
but,
uh,

574
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.840
they did not provide very intellectually stimulating conversation.
Uh,

575
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.940
I could talk all I wanted about Tele Tevyes right.
Uh,

576
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:40.940
teletubbies were big in my house,
Barney.
Uh,
but,
uh,

577
00:32:40.941 --> 00:32:43.460
eventually I felt like my brains were leaking out my ears.

578
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:48.440
And so to a certain extent that kind of thinking about stories,
excuse me,

579
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.080
uh,
was sort of self defense to begin with.
Uh,

580
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.940
I didn't actually do much in the way of writing until my daughter was away at

581
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:58.640
school during the day and my son could take naps.

582
00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.680
My husband worked nights at the time,

583
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:05.570
and so I would lay my toddler son in bed,
uh,
next to his dad,

584
00:33:05.571 --> 00:33:10.400
and then I would go to Starbucks.
Uh,
and then eventually I came back,
uh,
to,
uh,

585
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.310
consistently discover my son playing in the living room by himself,

586
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.680
and then I enrolled him in preschool so that I could continue to write,

587
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.660
uh,
just a couple of hours in the morning.
Uh,
but I'm not going to lie.

588
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:26.690
It's really hard when you've got the little folks at home because you're lucky

589
00:33:26.691 --> 00:33:29.260
to have a shower by yourself.
Right.
Uh,

590
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:33.110
and you can't give full attention to other things because those little kids

591
00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:35.270
getting a lot of trouble.
Right?
Yeah.

592
00:33:35.271 --> 00:33:38.390
There was also the keys in the outlet the one day,
I mean,
yeah,

593
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:43.450
the whole house went dark.
Yeah.
It was amazing.
Um,
and,
and,

594
00:33:43.451 --> 00:33:45.460
and my kids were pretty good kids,
right?
You have to,

595
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.410
but you have to kind of keep track of them.
Uh,
so it's,

596
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.240
it's the most amazing thing when your kid,

597
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.970
when your youngest finally goes to kindergarten,
you're like,
I'm free.

598
00:33:52.971 --> 00:33:54.950
I can actually think about things and do things.

599
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:59.630
So my advice would be while they're little,
store up,
all the thoughts,
you know,

600
00:33:59.631 --> 00:34:02.080
the random little thoughts that you have,
keep them in a notebook,

601
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:03.910
keep them in the back of your mind.
Uh,

602
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.070
and then when you do get to the point where the Kiddos are at school or daycare

603
00:34:08.071 --> 00:34:10.400
or whatever,
then take advantage of that time.
Don't,

604
00:34:10.401 --> 00:34:15.110
don't worry about the freaking laundry did anything like that.
Uh,
you know,

605
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.860
the clothes aren't gonna explode if you don't wash them today.
Uh,

606
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.870
so just like walk out of the House and sit down and work on whatever,

607
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.360
uh,
because that's important.
Right?
You need to,

608
00:34:26.361 --> 00:34:28.430
you need to get your brains working back again.
Yeah.

609
00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.450
<v 5>So I haven't read the new book yet,</v>

610
00:34:31.451 --> 00:34:35.140
but I'm kind of curious what percentage of the book is sort of dedicated to

611
00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.630
discussion,
preparation and consumption of tea?

612
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.780
<v 0>I would say 0%,</v>

613
00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.760
except there's one character who does arrive and complains that she cannot find

614
00:34:48.761 --> 00:34:53.200
a good cup of tea.
Right.
Uh,
but I wanted very much,

615
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.950
uh,
the,
the other night at a bookstore event,

616
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.230
a person said to me,
you know,

617
00:34:59.231 --> 00:35:02.350
this main character is almost like the complete opposite of Breck.

618
00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:04.480
How much of that was just,

619
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:08.260
you wanted to write something that was totally unlike the trilogy and I said

620
00:35:08.261 --> 00:35:11.710
pretty much all of it,
right.
So I just,
I was like,
all right,

621
00:35:11.711 --> 00:35:14.890
this is going to be different.
So no t for tagging,

622
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.150
this is going to be very different.

623
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.910
<v 5>Yeah.
It is ti something you drink a lot of while you're riding?</v>

624
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.290
<v 0>Oh,
yes.
Tea is something I drink a lot of,
uh,
one of the,</v>

625
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:25.760
I love traveling and meeting people,

626
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:28.790
but one of the downsides is it's very difficult to find a good cup of tea while

627
00:35:28.791 --> 00:35:32.030
you're on the road.
Right.
Because it's not a thing that Americans typically,

628
00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:33.590
it's becoming more,
which is awesome.

629
00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.800
Tea is kind of becoming more fashionable and you can find more places that serve

630
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:40.320
it.
Uh,
but hotel rooms do not necessarily provide you with good tea.

631
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:43.020
So I'm looking forward to getting home and being able to sit down and have a
cup.

632
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:43.920
Yeah,
yeah.

633
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:45.340
<v 6>So I haven't read,</v>

634
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.040
I'm actually any of your work and I'm looking forward to it now.

635
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.090
I'm going to read this one first because it's what,
what's in my hands?
Yeah.

636
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.460
So given what you were just saying about how this is the opposite,

637
00:35:54.461 --> 00:35:58.420
or you were sort of trying to lean the other direction from the previous
trilogy,

638
00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.670
when I finish this one,
if I go to pick up your trilogy,

639
00:36:00.671 --> 00:36:02.050
what would you say to prepare me?

640
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.350
<v 0>Oh,
that's,
so,
uh,
the trilogy is much more serious and intense,</v>

641
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:08.700
particularly the first book.

642
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.570
The mood is very different and the protagonist is very different and,
uh,

643
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.540
presents a far more in a farmer grim way.
Uh,
so,
uh,

644
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.320
that would probably be the biggest,
the biggest difference.
But other than that,

645
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.570
I think if you enjoy this,

646
00:36:24.571 --> 00:36:27.810
which is meant to be a standalone for precisely that reason,
uh,

647
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:30.690
you could probably enter into the chilled you pretty easily,
I would imagine.

648
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.240
<v 6>So.
You're not going to warm me off of it completely.</v>

649
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.860
<v 0>Oh,
no.
Ha.
Buy and read all my books please.</v>

650
00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:38.550
Yeah.

651
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.383
<v 1>Okay.</v>

652
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.810
<v 6>So,
uh,
what are you working on next?</v>

653
00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.690
<v 0>Oh,
I'm not at the,
I am working on a thing,</v>

654
00:36:44.691 --> 00:36:48.200
but I'm not at the point where I really can talk about it yet.
So,

655
00:36:48.201 --> 00:36:51.710
but I will as soon as I can.
So something,
something.
Yeah.

656
00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:53.420
I am working on another book.
Let me put it that way.

657
00:36:53.421 --> 00:36:55.700
Cause if I say I'm working on something,
it sounds like I've got,

658
00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.880
I'm working on a movie,
I'm writing comic books.
No,
I,

659
00:36:58.881 --> 00:37:01.100
it's nothing that are shattering.
I am working on another book.

660
00:37:01.101 --> 00:37:03.020
It's just too early to talk about yet.
Yeah.

661
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.850
<v 4>What is Serbia?</v>

662
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:06.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

663
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.110
<v 0>What is her back?
So it's not tea,
it's not tea</v>

664
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.380
<v 4>almost,
but not entirely on late teens</v>

665
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.770
<v 0>almost,
but not entirely unlike t.
There's actually a real world drink.</v>

666
00:37:15.771 --> 00:37:18.860
I named it after,
uh,
there's a,
a drink.

667
00:37:18.861 --> 00:37:23.200
I found it in the international grocery at home called Sir about [inaudible].
Uh,

668
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:27.120
and it's an instant thing.
Uh,
it comes in little packets,
uh,

669
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:32.200
and it's got sugar and like cloves and black pepper and ginger and it makes a

670
00:37:32.361 --> 00:37:35.270
nice little hot drink.
And I said,
well,
okay,

671
00:37:35.271 --> 00:37:38.690
it's not t and I'll use that because it's actually kind of good tasting.
So.

672
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.240
<v 4>And do you survive by bringing your own tea with you on tour?</v>

673
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.221
<v 0>I often do.</v>

674
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:47.070
I haven't this time around I actually have a little travel tea kettle.

675
00:37:47.071 --> 00:37:49.050
That's how desperate I am a,

676
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.350
but I did not bring it on this tour because it's so long.
Uh,

677
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.040
and I packed with extreme efficiency and there was no way that little kettle was

678
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:56.830
getting in there.

679
00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.660
<v 4>Cause if you're looking for some,
there's a t bar through.</v>

680
00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.660
<v 0>Oh,
thank you.
Thank you very much.</v>

681
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:03.043
<v 1>Does</v>

682
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.720
<v 0>I think we have time for another question?
Yeah.</v>

683
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:08.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

684
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:10.420
<v 4>All right.
So you have a book,</v>

685
00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:15.040
your first book with literally justice in the title and are fairly active about

686
00:38:15.041 --> 00:38:19.900
social issues on Twitter.
Uh,
how does that kind of affect both,
you know,

687
00:38:19.901 --> 00:38:22.390
your writing and your professional life?

688
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:27.390
<v 0>So,
uh,
I actually,
I,
you're right,</v>

689
00:38:27.391 --> 00:38:29.990
I am active with social issues and stuff on Twitter.
Uh,

690
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.300
lately it's a lot of angry re tweeting,
but,
uh,

691
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.410
I don't start out saying I want to write a book about this social issue.

692
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.160
Um,
I always start out saying,
I want to write a book with,

693
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.850
with this fun thing with the spider Max in it with a,
you know,

694
00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.120
a ships to take over human bodies with space battles,
right?

695
00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.240
Because who doesn't love space battles?
And,
um,

696
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:56.580
and then because I am frankly easily bored,
uh,

697
00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:00.820
I need to have something to really think about while I'm working on a project.

698
00:39:00.821 --> 00:39:04.510
I get very unsatisfied with things that are just lots of noise.
You know,

699
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.780
sometimes that's what you want to read.
But if I'm going to write a book,

700
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.610
I need to have more to think about.
Uh,

701
00:39:09.611 --> 00:39:14.440
and it's then at that point I start digging into the motifs and the things that

702
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:19.270
I'm writing about.
And it's difficult for me not to think about,
uh,
my politics,

703
00:39:19.271 --> 00:39:22.360
right?
How that intersects with what the story is saying.
Uh,

704
00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:27.450
I personally believe that narrative is extraordinarily powerful,

705
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.850
uh,
because it's a basic mode of human thought.

706
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.390
It's how we analyze the world around us and the narratives that we have in our

707
00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:37.510
inventory influence how we're going to respond to the world.

708
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:40.060
We see a thing and we're like,
we need to make a pattern out of that.

709
00:39:40.061 --> 00:39:42.910
Here's a pattern.
Here's a template.
All right?
Everything fits.

710
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:46.750
And then you act according to that.
Uh,
and sometimes if you,

711
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.600
you can pick a template that can literally end up with somebody getting killed.

712
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.160
Uh,

713
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.840
and I would never tell writers to write particular kinds of stories,

714
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.610
but I feel that as a writer,

715
00:39:57.611 --> 00:40:00.910
it's very important to think about the stories that I'm putting out because

716
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:02.950
those are potentially people's templates.
Uh,

717
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:07.750
and I don't want to be saying something that I would regret having said.
Uh,

718
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:11.020
so I do think very hard about those things when I write the story,

719
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.740
but I don't sit down to write a story that tells somebody about my political

720
00:40:14.741 --> 00:40:18.550
beliefs about something,
if that makes sense.
Sure.
Thank you.
Thank you.

721
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.500
<v 1>Thank you.</v>
