1
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.373
Thanks a million.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.080
<v 1>I haven't been looking forward to seeing you all week.</v>

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.820
So it's Friday and I've been waiting all week.
Hello.
How nice to meet you.
Right.

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.660
I'm Marianne.
I'm in,
you're probably thinking,
wow,
two chiefs in your title.

5
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:20.730
That's pretty cool.
Um,
you know,

6
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:24.780
did chief judge of Google science fair part of it is by far the most fun part of

7
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:25.830
it,
most awesome part of it.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.470
So I hope you will think about the Google science fair.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.540
But let me talk to you for just a minute.

10
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.740
About the hundred and 70 years of scientific American part and scientific

11
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:37.650
American was started right here in New York where you guys all are.

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.810
And I'm the guy who started,
had this great name,
Rufus porter,
which I loved,

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.490
and he had offices here where scientists and inventors would actually come to

14
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:52.080
visit.
So,
um,
you will all know what your,
your,
you know,
your,

15
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:55.840
your,
um,
your iTunes or wherever you're listening to your music.
Um,

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.040
the first time voice was ever heard outside of the labs of Thomas Edison who

17
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:06.150
raise your hand if you've heard of this Guy Thomas Edison light bulb.
Right,

18
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.631
right.

19
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:10.350
But he also invented this thing that in the time was called the phonograph and

20
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.740
he brought it to scientific American and you could probably imagine like the

21
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.260
editors are probably thinking,
what's this giant box this guy has?

22
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.360
He puts this a cylinder on it and it plays and it says hello,

23
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.490
how do you like the talking box?

24
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.220
I was pretty surprising and awesome and he did that using science.

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.610
Um,
and it took him a long time to do it and he worked away at it.

26
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.060
And then Thomas Edison,
a lot of other and vendors made a lot of other things,

27
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.870
a lot of which we're all using right now.
This microphone,

28
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.860
the phones that you're not allowed to tweet and snapchat on and everything else

29
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.640
on that we'd been told about that.
The building.
We're in,
all of this stuff,

30
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.380
all of this stuff was invented,

31
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:54.381
improved through the process that we call science because science is not

32
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:59.220
something you read about in a history book like we might read about Thomas

33
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.790
Edison.
No,
it's a way we think it's the way we do stuff.

34
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.210
It's way we ask a question.
How could we,

35
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.230
how could we hear stuff from people when they're not in the room?
Well,

36
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.630
phone graph,
later phone,
microphone.

37
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.390
How could we cure diseases?

38
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:18.510
How could we solve problems for people?

39
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.090
So scientists all about that and,

40
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:25.860
and it's about a way of exploring and discovering and anybody can do it.

41
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.390
So maybe they think that's something that people do in a lab where you have to

42
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:34.050
be genius.
Like Thomas Edison,
maybe you will like,
no.

43
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.590
Let me ask you this question.
Raise your hand if you've ever met a scientist.

44
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.280
It met one can I see a lot of good hands,

45
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:43.980
but actually everybody put your hand up.

46
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.680
Everybody was born a scientist.
Everybody here was born a scientist.

47
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.320
How do I know that?
Because I told you,

48
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:55.080
science is a way of looking at the world and thinking,

49
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.350
think of a baby in a highchair.
Do you ever watch your baby in a highchair?

50
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.530
There's a meatball there.

51
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:04.531
This cheerio maybe goes watch what happens or the Cheerio,

52
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.480
cheerio goes down different if they have a feather,

53
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.040
feather falls differently still.
That is a baby scientist running an experiment.

54
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.800
And you all can do that.
You,
oh everybody does that.

55
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.220
Everybody does it every day.
You just don't think of it like that.

56
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:25.960
You just don't call it that.
But that is science.
And so I encourage you,

57
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:28.390
and by the way,
this thing of,
of science,

58
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.420
I told you I'd make inventions and so on for the grownups in the room,
um,

59
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.480
between World War II and now about a third to a half of all of the U S is

60
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:41.500
economic growth is from basic research that led to inventions like the ones

61
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:42.580
we're all enjoying today.

62
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.590
And so let me just tell you to tell you guys who are listening to me ask the

63
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:51.670
question,
ask a question and ask something you want.
Apply to testing.

64
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.380
Find out what happens and when you find out what happened,

65
00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:57.250
you should really think about entering the Google science fair.

66
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.890
So now I'd love to introduce you to one of my favorite scientists.
Um,

67
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:04.380
Sri,
who you've heard a little bit about.

68
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.390
And I first met Shri in 2011 when I was the first time chief judge of the Google

69
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.730
Science fair and I was inspired by her questions as Sri saw a problem she had

70
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:16.340
her,

71
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.350
I feel really awful about her grandfather dying of cancer and she had a question

72
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:24.370
of why do some,
why do some therapies not work anymore with cancer?

73
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.390
And she worked on that question and she kept working on it and has done so many

74
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:30.010
other amazing things since.

75
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.690
So I know you're all so lucky as I am to meet her here and to hear what she's

76
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.660
going to tell us all and I can't wait to hear it myself.
So welcome.

77
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:38.494
Pleased to Shriek.

78
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.990
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

79
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.950
<v 2>right.
I am really excited to be here today guys.</v>

80
00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:48.170
Like so excited.
Um,

81
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.060
I am really excited about doing something a little bit different today.

82
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.060
So instead of just talking at you guys,

83
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.980
I want to make sure you talk back at me.
All right?
So be sure,

84
00:05:00.981 --> 00:05:03.540
please interact.
Please engage if he,

85
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.540
if there's something that doesn't make sense to you,

86
00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:09.410
typing questions and ask me whatever you want to.
All right?

87
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.970
So I'm a scientist,
which means I'm trained to ask questions.

88
00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:16.400
That's how everything I've done started.

89
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.640
So during this talk,

90
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.640
I want you guys to channel your inner scientist,
okay?

91
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.890
And whenever you think of a question,

92
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.310
I want you to go to this length that's going to appear on the screen and just

93
00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:33.080
type it in so I can see it.

94
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.450
And throughout my entire talk,
I want you guys to keep asking those questions.

95
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.480
So by the end we can answer them and see what matters to you guys,

96
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:48.420
what you guys care about,
and we can get some answers going.
All right?

97
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.060
Is everyone going to do that?
Yeah.
Okay.
Awesome.
Well,

98
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:57.300
I told you guys I like questions,
right?
Well,

99
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.580
I wasn't,
um,
I wasn't kidding about that.

100
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.060
So I want to answer the types of questions that can change the world.

101
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.530
But when I was that little kid,
I wasn't really always liked that.
I mean,

102
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.770
at the time I was really a self centered science geek.

103
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.850
Well,
what does that mean?
Right?

104
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.880
Well that meant that I liked thinking of problems that I had.

105
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.500
I liked playing with science to make my life better.

106
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.730
And that led to some pretty crazy projects.

107
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:37.190
I'm not gonna lie to you in third grade.

108
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.080
I literally did my first science project because I didn't like eating my

109
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:45.020
vegetables.
So quick show of hands.

110
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:49.490
How many of you guys like spinach?
Whoa.

111
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.150
How many of you guys don't like spinach?
All right,
I'm with you guys.

112
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:56.570
I'm with you haters.
All right.
So when I was in third grade,

113
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.920
I decided that I wanted to make spinach more exciting to eat,

114
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.210
so I was going to turn it blue.
Sounds great,
right?
Blue Spinach,

115
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:09.020
that's something you'd eat.
Um,
so my parents,

116
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.040
bless their souls,
went out,
bought me a spinach plant,

117
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.370
some blue food coloring and a syringe.

118
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.690
You should not give a syringe to a third grader for the record.

119
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:26.410
But I took this blue food coloring and I proceeded to inject it into the spinach

120
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:29.990
plant.
And then I forgot about it for two months.

121
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.930
And I remember on the day of this science fair,

122
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:37.931
I pulled out this dried withered gross spinach plant with like Blatch's of blue

123
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:40.454
on it.

124
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.670
And I took that in as my very first science project and I wish I could say like

125
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.840
got better from there,

126
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:53.110
but my next projects I literally did because I didn't like taking out the trash.

127
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.080
In fact,

128
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.080
I hated the idea of rolling that giant garbage can to the curb every week so

129
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:04.760
much that I decided to build a remote controlled the garbage can.

130
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.520
I mean,
how lazy is that?
Um,

131
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.610
and I remember I built this little model of a trashcan and it was like a tiny

132
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:17.360
little replica.
And on the day of the science fair,

133
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:20.720
I took it in and the science fair was held in our gym.

134
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.520
And I remember I just spent the day piloting this little trashcan around other

135
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:29.810
people's projects instead of actually presenting it.
And these were,

136
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.830
these were fun times,
right?
They were fun projects.
Everyone was laughing.

137
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:34.670
It was a lot of fun,

138
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:39.671
but I wasn't really asking the types of questions that can change the world.

139
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.620
In fact,

140
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.620
I really didn't ask the important scientific questions until I turned 15 years

141
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:51.260
old.
And then I became,

142
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.560
I went from this kid who was doing silly science to a kid who wanted to cure

143
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:01.440
cancer.
When I was 15,
my grandfather passed away.

144
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.460
My grandfather was one of the most organized people I've ever met.

145
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.240
He was the kind of person who would save hundreds of horribly taken pictures

146
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:18.660
from like family road trips that were blurry and awful and he would label them

147
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:20.970
and keep them in photo albums for years.

148
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.300
And he had these file cabinets that were just full of chronologically ordered

149
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:30.660
national geographic magazines that were 30 years old.

150
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.120
But that wasn't the man I saw towards the end of his life.

151
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.700
My grandfather had become bedridden.
He was dependent.
Um,

152
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.850
he wasn't the same grandfather I had grown up with and that was hard.

153
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.890
That was really hard to see and to,
he wasn't alone in that experience.

154
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.810
I mean a lot of people all over the world are affected by cancer.

155
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.260
Maybe some of you guys,
maybe some of your family members.

156
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.470
I mean by the numbers there are millions,

157
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.990
but usually it just takes one to really want to make a difference.

158
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.221
And for me,

159
00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:16.221
my grandfather was my one and I knew I had to do something.

160
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.480
So what do you do when you have a lot of big questions and very few answers?

161
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.550
Well I,
I did what any 15 year old would do and I googled it.

162
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.780
I started reading everything I could get my hands on.

163
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:36.240
I read scientific articles,

164
00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:41.241
I read blog posts from cancer patients who are going through chemotherapy.

165
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:46.440
I even read some like pretty nutty conspiracy theories about cancer.

166
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.910
And I remember I learned,
I learned a lot.

167
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.800
I was learning every day.
And I would go,

168
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.650
I would learn outside of class and then I would go into the classroom and we

169
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:02.550
would see these diagrams of how cancer supposedly happened.

170
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:08.030
And I remember one day sitting in class seeing this diagram of this piece of DNA

171
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.740
and there was a tiny lightning bolt hitting it.
And my teacher said,

172
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.780
that's how cancer happens.
It's just jeans getting damaged.
That's it.

173
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.150
And I remember staring at that,

174
00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:24.150
staring at that tiny little lightning bolt and thinking,

175
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.390
this is just not enough.

176
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.480
And so all of the reading I was doing,

177
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.940
all of the information that I had gathered,

178
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:36.360
all of the questions I was asking that I was getting answers to,

179
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.120
all of it was building to something bigger.

180
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.690
At some point I realized the questions that I was asking were actually listed as

181
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:50.781
questions on the research goal pages for professors and universities and

182
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:52.110
graduate labs.

183
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.260
The same questions I was asking as a 15 year old were questions that the entire

184
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:04.150
scientific community was asking and that was incredible,

185
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.540
right?
Like that was the stepping stone.

186
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.260
And I realized at that point that I couldn't have the sort of impact I wanted to

187
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:17.440
make a loan.
I had to find help.

188
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.080
So in a similar way to how you would find a restaurant to eat at tonight by

189
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.830
searching a few keywords on Google,
I found professors,

190
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.430
I started emailing hundreds of professors at local labs and universities and I

191
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:39.310
started off all of my emails with the first line saying,

192
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.010
hi,
my name is shree Bose.

193
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.510
I'm 15 years old and I want to do cancer research.

194
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.670
Sounds insane,
right?
Well,
all of the professors I emailed,

195
00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:55.671
it must've thought so because I got rejected by all of them.

196
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.600
I mean,
it got to a point where the rejections almost didn't faze me anymore.

197
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.190
It was almost like my kneejerk reaction to one rejection would be,
okay,

198
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:10.150
we're onto the next professor.
The next opportunity,
the next chance.

199
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:16.110
I was on a mission and I wasn't going to stop until I found somebody to take me

200
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:20.350
on.
So fully expecting another rejection.

201
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.690
I emailed Dr. Logan on the Bosu,

202
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.610
a professor at the University of North Texas health science center,
same email,

203
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.980
and for the first time I got a response that wasn't,
Oh,

204
00:13:32.981 --> 00:13:37.780
you're too young,
or,
oh,
please don't contact me again.

205
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.370
It was come into my lab and we can chat,

206
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.290
we can see how,
why you're excited about this,
what makes you tick.

207
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.780
And so I remember on this beautiful spring day in Fort Worth,

208
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:53.440
Texas,

209
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.440
I made my mom drive me to a graduate lab and I remember I was sitting in this

210
00:14:00.641 --> 00:14:03.490
graduate lab,
there are researchers next to me,

211
00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:06.640
they're like pouring buffers and doing cool looking stuff.

212
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.800
And that was before I knew the science.

213
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.520
And I remember sitting there shaking.

214
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I was physically shaking because all I wanted to do was to work in this lab.

215
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.710
I was so scared.

216
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.610
And I remember at the time the email I was writing to all of these professors

217
00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:29.170
actually had like an idea for a project that I kind of thought might work.

218
00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:34.171
And it was like a cool idea and Dr boss who walks into the slab and one of the

219
00:14:34.661 --> 00:14:37.540
first things out of her mouth is,
you know,

220
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:40.900
I read your proposal and it didn't make any sense.

221
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:46.510
It would never work.
And I remember all of my muscles tensed up.

222
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.690
I was like,
Oh God,
here comes to the rejection.
Here we go.

223
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.800
And then she went on and she said,
but I like the way you thought through it.

224
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.110
I liked where you were going.

225
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.890
I liked the way you questioned this entire problem.

226
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.940
And so if you want,
you can come work in my lab for the summer.

227
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.480
And that was it.
That was where it all started.

228
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:13.481
After these months of absolutely making a fool of myself and just writing

229
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.310
nonsensical ideas to these professors who knew so much more than me,

230
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:24.730
it was really that that gave me the chance to do something amazing.

231
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.450
So don't be afraid to ask for help.

232
00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:33.530
Don't be afraid to reach out when you realize that you can't have the sort of

233
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:38.240
impact you want alone,
because it's one of the most powerful things you can do.

234
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.700
For me,
I started working in this lab as a freshman in high school.

235
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:47.600
As just finished freshman year of high school,
I was working in this lab.

236
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.520
I got this,
I was assigned this project on drug resistance in breast cancer.

237
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.240
So basically understanding why some cells stop responding to a truck.

238
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.240
And for the first summer I remember I just bumbled around.

239
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:10.540
I broke glass where I like dropped experimental results that took days to Redo.

240
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:17.410
I annoyed literally everybody in this lab all the time asking the dumbest

241
00:16:18.621 --> 00:16:22.520
questions.
And I remember along the way I learned,

242
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.970
I learned a lot of really,
really,
really cool things.

243
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.100
And I remember as I was learning,

244
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.900
I kind of fell in love with research.
It was incredible.

245
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:37.901
I felt like it was just so powerful to be able to think through a problem and go

246
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:43.751
from beginning to end and have an experimental result that could tell you

247
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:48.851
something about a cancer patient who might be suffering from breast cancer or a

248
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:52.850
patient who's being told that the breast cancer has come back.

249
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.440
And that was incredibly powerful to me.
Also,

250
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:01.070
I never looked like that in lab.
That's a very intense picture.

251
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.490
Um,
but I,

252
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:09.530
I remember at the time I was so excited about what I was working on and I wanted

253
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:13.460
to share it with everybody who would listen to me.

254
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.620
And I remember at the end of the summer we had this project,

255
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:22.430
I had finished this complete project.
It was on drug resistance,
breast cancer,

256
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.180
and I was ready to enter it into another science fair.

257
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.100
And I mean this is a science fair.

258
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:32.480
I've been competing in since I was a little kid and this project is better than

259
00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:35.210
blue spinach and remote controlled garbage cans.
Right.

260
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.810
And I remember I went to the science fair,

261
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:44.140
I presented my project and at the award ceremony I won nothing.

262
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:50.370
I remember I walked out of this room and I was empty handed.
I was sad.
I,

263
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.050
I had a feeling like I never wanted to do research again.

264
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:59.910
I mean I had fallen in love with biology and medicine and I thought it was the

265
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:00.960
coolest thing ever.

266
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:06.590
And it turned out I kind of sucked at it and that that was dark.

267
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.430
That was a crushing,
crushing sort of feeling.
And I,

268
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:16.431
I remember at the time I decided I would turn my attention away from research.

269
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:17.550
I would stop doing that.

270
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:21.720
I was going to focus on poetry and moping those.

271
00:18:21.721 --> 00:18:24.000
We're going to be my two things.
That was it.

272
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.410
And I kept it up for quite a few months.

273
00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:33.411
I remember I felt just so downtrodden by everything that had happened,

274
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:38.751
but after three months I was still sitting in biology class and still what I was

275
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:43.170
learning still was not enough.

276
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.980
And I remembered the reason I had joined a lab in the first place was because I

277
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:52.140
wanted to make a difference.
I wanted to understand,

278
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.380
I wanted to know how this disease that had killed my grandfather worked and how

279
00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:02.370
we could make it better for everybody else who was suffering.

280
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.680
And so I went back the next year,
I remember I had,

281
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.910
I was given the choice,

282
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.860
I was given the choice to either work on this old project on breast cancer or I

283
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:17.580
could come up with a new project on ovarian cancer.

284
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.690
I just jumped at that opportunity.
I was like that,
I'll do that.

285
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.020
And so I,
over the course of the next summer,

286
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:30.021
I actually developed this really cool project on drug resistance in ovarian

287
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:31.710
cancer along with my mentor.

288
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.520
And so basically what that meant is we wanted to understand why some cells died

289
00:19:38.281 --> 00:19:42.570
when we gave them a chemotherapy drug and why some cells didn't.

290
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.680
And so that basically would correlate.

291
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:51.710
That would mean that we could understand better why some patients stopped

292
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:55.530
responding to some medicines,
really big stuff.

293
00:19:55.531 --> 00:20:00.240
And we discovered a really cool thing basically that this one energy protein

294
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.480
that's involved in how cells process energy is actually really important in how

295
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:07.800
that switch happens.

296
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.690
And so I remember at the time I did this really cool project.

297
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.940
I really wanted to share it with the world,

298
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:17.940
but it was science fairs and I was kind of scared.

299
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.160
And one day I got a call from my dad and my dad said,
hey,

300
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.880
have you been on the homepage of Google today?
There's,

301
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.670
there's something right under the search bar that I think you would be

302
00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:31.980
interested in.
So I said,
no.

303
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.820
And then I went online and right under the search bar it said,

304
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.890
introducing the first ever Google global science fair.

305
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.710
And I thought,
you know,
I wouldn't have done any of this without Google.

306
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.070
And I want to share what I have figured out with the world.

307
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.030
So all of my work,
all of my passion,
all of my excitement,

308
00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:00.180
I put that all into this really cool website and I sent off the link and a few

309
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.000
months later I found out that I was going to mountain view.

310
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.800
So I was one of 15 global finalists,

311
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.140
which meant that when I went to California,

312
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.440
I was with 14 other kids who also were doing projects that could change the

313
00:21:17.891 --> 00:21:20.410
world and that,

314
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:24.610
I mean I remember at one point we had to have these public booths where you like

315
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.690
brought stuff and showed it off to like the public who would come in and want to

316
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:29.980
like know about your project.

317
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.850
And they told us to bring in something that was either representative of us or

318
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:38.851
representative of our project and I worked with cancer so you can't really bring

319
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:41.050
in cancer cells.

320
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.770
So I decided since I'm from Texas,

321
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:49.810
I would bring in a cowboy boot and a statue of a cowboy,

322
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:54.550
which is a great idea.
If you think about it,
it's great.
Only problem.

323
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:59.830
Only problem was that at some point in transit,

324
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.290
the cowboys head came off.

325
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:08.340
So on my table I had a headless cowboy statue and the kid next to me had a fully

326
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:15.520
functional robotic lego arm.
And at that point I was like,

327
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:19.510
all right,
we're done.
We're done here.
Like we're not winning.
We're okay,

328
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.373
it's fine.

329
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.000
And so I remember it just knowing that made me so much calmer.

330
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.170
So when I went in to talk to the judges,
I was honest.

331
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.700
Mariet was one of my judges and I remember I was brutally honest.

332
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.790
There were points I would talk about messing up in lab and getting rejected and

333
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.720
why I was so excited to be able to work on a project like this.

334
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:49.530
And when I won the Google Science Fair in 2011 it didn't feel like I was winning

335
00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:51.100
just because of the work.

336
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:56.670
It felt really like it was an award for my passion for how determined I was for

337
00:22:59.081 --> 00:23:03.910
how excited I was to be able to work on this thing that had affected me so

338
00:23:03.911 --> 00:23:04.744
closely.

339
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.200
It felt like it was really an award for all of the kids who have ever been told

340
00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:16.261
that they're too young to do something or that or kids who have told themselves

341
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:21.721
that they can't do something because of age or gender or opportunity.

342
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.560
It was an honor to win the Google Science Fair.

343
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.280
And after that I got to do a lot of really,

344
00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:35.281
really cool things including getting to meet President Obama twice.

345
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.693
Um,

346
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.720
and then there was just something about seeing a such a powerful person who was

347
00:23:40.721 --> 00:23:45.560
so passionate about getting kids excited about science and technology and

348
00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:46.850
engineering and math.

349
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.350
That just made me excited to be able to share my mentorship with the entire

350
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:52.184
world.

351
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.400
And over the past few years I have gotten to do a lot of really exciting things.

352
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.030
I mean,
I've made some of my best friends at Harvard.

353
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:07.330
I started a company to help kids get started with building technology and

354
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:10.610
learning about engineering hardware.

355
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:15.860
I was one of Glamor Magazine's top 10 college women where they put a lot of

356
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:20.060
makeup on you and make you look a lot better.
Um,

357
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:24.770
I've gotten to do research at Harvard Medical School and I'm going on to do,

358
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.550
to start my career in medicine and research.

359
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:33.620
And it's been a really,
really exciting journey.
But you know,

360
00:24:33.621 --> 00:24:38.621
I never thought of myself as an inventor or a scientist or an entrepreneur.

361
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.981
Honestly,

362
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:47.870
I just asked the questions that mattered the most to me,

363
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:53.350
whether that was how to turn spinach blue or how to cure cancer.

364
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.250
And so today I want you to do something with me.

365
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.270
I want you to think about the problems that matter to you.

366
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.700
The world is this giant,

367
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:09.410
beautiful place and there's so much left to explore and discover.

368
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.390
So let's think about it for a second.

369
00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:13.790
What are those questions that matter to you?

370
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:19.600
And now I want you to go do something with that because that's where everything

371
00:25:19.971 --> 00:25:23.660
I have done so far has begun with the question.

372
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.550
And that's where I want your stories and your journeys to begin as well.

373
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.830
So today I want you to find your questions,

374
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.180
make your opportunities,
and create your own answers.

375
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:43.280
Because together I know we can do incredible things in this world.

376
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.830
If we only began to ask

377
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.810
<v 0>how.
Thank you guys.</v>

378
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.840
[inaudible]

379
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:03.380
<v 2>all right,
so you guys did a really great job with asking questions.</v>

380
00:26:03.381 --> 00:26:07.250
So I'm going to go to these questions.
Ooh,
we've got a lot.

381
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.330
Oh yes.
Um,
all right.

382
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:15.530
Let's go with the top voted one from Layla who asks,

383
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:18.830
making the world better sounds hard.
How do I even start?

384
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.420
And I love this question because it's not something you really think about.

385
00:26:23.421 --> 00:26:27.120
You don't start off by saying,
well,
I want to change the world.

386
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.460
You start off by saying,

387
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.970
this is something that bothers me and I want to figure it out.

388
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.740
And then you find out that this thing that bothered you actually bothers a lot

389
00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:40.850
of people.
That's how it all starts.
So,
okay.
You asked,

390
00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:43.130
how do you even start?
Could a question.

391
00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.620
I want all of us to take one second and think about a problem that you've run

392
00:26:48.621 --> 00:26:53.150
into too.
Um,
today,
just today,
maybe it's not even your problem.

393
00:26:53.151 --> 00:26:56.780
Maybe it's a problem that your parents ran into,
or a friend or somebody else,

394
00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.990
but let's think of that problem.
All right,
got it.

395
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.360
Okay.
No,
I want you to think about how you would solve it.

396
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.970
Is there an easy way to do that?
We'll start with that.

397
00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.900
That's how you start changing the world.
That's how everything begins,

398
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:22.050
is really finding a problem that impacts you and then trying to come up with

399
00:27:22.541 --> 00:27:24.880
solutions that can matter to everyone.

400
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:30.370
But that's a really great question and thank you Layla.
Um,
all right.

401
00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:34.000
So second question is,

402
00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.210
what was it like to meet President Obama?
Oh,

403
00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:42.730
so I was so starstruck.
I remember this,
I was so star struck,

404
00:27:42.731 --> 00:27:46.960
they had us in this little waiting area outside the Oval Office at the very

405
00:27:46.961 --> 00:27:51.250
beginning.
And the Oval Office has a lot of hidden doors.
So it does,

406
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.810
there's no like really blatant doors anywhere.
And so I remember I was standing,

407
00:27:55.811 --> 00:27:59.890
I was facing somebody else talking and there was a wall behind me and I turned

408
00:27:59.891 --> 00:28:03.220
around and all of a sudden the wall was gone.
It was a door.

409
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.210
And President Obama is standing there and he,

410
00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:11.200
he goes in for the handshake and I'm so panicked at that point that I just bear

411
00:28:11.201 --> 00:28:12.034
hugged him.

412
00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.680
So it was amazing to me,
President Obama.

413
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.130
Um,
but absolutely,

414
00:28:21.131 --> 00:28:25.570
honestly it was incredible to really see somebody who is in such a high position

415
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:30.520
who very evidently cared so much about getting kids started in science.

416
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.760
That's a really powerful thing and I think it sets a tone for how we approach

417
00:28:35.771 --> 00:28:38.320
stem in this country.
And that's incredible.

418
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.440
And that's something all of us will benefit from.
All right,

419
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:46.630
so we ha thank you Stephen for that wonderful question where I got to share my

420
00:28:46.631 --> 00:28:51.220
bear hug with Obama.
All right,
we have our next question is from dre.

421
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.460
How can we bridge the gap with the lack of women of color in science and stem?

422
00:28:56.921 --> 00:29:00.910
So Science,
technology,
engineering and math.
And that is a really,

423
00:29:00.911 --> 00:29:03.310
really good question because I,

424
00:29:03.311 --> 00:29:07.390
that's something I'm especially passionate about.
I mean,
I grew,

425
00:29:07.391 --> 00:29:08.320
I was really lucky.

426
00:29:08.321 --> 00:29:12.970
I grew up in a household where it didn't really feel like I couldn't do

427
00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:17.170
something that really wasn't a big thing.
So when I wanted to start research,

428
00:29:17.171 --> 00:29:21.250
it didn't feel like there were any barriers to making that happen.

429
00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:26.940
And so actually when I was first starting this tech company with my co founder

430
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.230
who happens to be a man,

431
00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.770
we ended up going to this tech conference and I,

432
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.980
our boxes actually look like they're made out of wood.

433
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:40.600
So they look kind of just like regular boxes that you might carry snacks around

434
00:29:40.601 --> 00:29:43.990
in.
And this tech conference was full.

435
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:45.670
It was mostly 80% men.

436
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:51.100
And I remember we were walking around and I was holding the box and I got asked

437
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:55.090
three times if there were cookies in the box.

438
00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.220
And after the third time I was like,
this is weird.
This is definitely weird.

439
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:05.170
So I handed it off to my co founder and for the next hour he carried it around.

440
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.220
The questions he got were what cool piece of tech is in that box.

441
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.680
So you,
I am not,

442
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.400
it's really hard to say that these gender divides don't still exist and they do.

443
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:22.830
And I think one of the most powerful things we can do to bridge that gap that

444
00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:25.510
you're talking about here is actually better mentoring.

445
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.900
I think that's the key to letting amazing thoughts and amazing people come to

446
00:30:31.181 --> 00:30:35.140
the forefront and giving them the chance to really do what they want to do.

447
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.430
My entire journey started with mentoring and I think it's a very powerful thing.

448
00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.040
Alright,
so thank you dre.
Um,

449
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.480
okay.
My next question is from,
oh,
sorry.

450
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.870
Here we go.
Um,
is from Steve who asks,

451
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.040
how did you figure out how to get started with your cancer research?

452
00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:01.320
And this is an awesome question because honestly I didn't have sort of applauded

453
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.620
outweighed to do things.

454
00:31:02.621 --> 00:31:07.621
I sort of started reading and reading everything I possibly could and then just

455
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:11.710
proposing nonsensical ideas to people who knew a lot more than me.

456
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.330
But I would say the first step to getting to my journey on getting started with

457
00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:18.430
cancer research was by finding a mentor.

458
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.940
And so for a lot of use students out in the audience and even actually for

459
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:23.140
parents and Googlers,

460
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.620
I think one of the most powerful things you can do when you want to change

461
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:28.150
something or make something better,

462
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.580
it's to find the people who can help you and to not be afraid to reach out to

463
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:36.700
those people.
Make a fool of yourself if you have to.

464
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.380
But eventually that's what makes the difference.
That is it.

465
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.740
Going out and doing something is the very first step,

466
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:48.580
whether that's reading and then figuring out that you need to find mentors or

467
00:31:48.581 --> 00:31:51.850
just reaching out and talking to people who might be able to help you.

468
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:57.460
So really great question.
Thank you Steve.
And okay,

469
00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:02.980
so I,
my next question is from

470
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:06.641
anonymous,

471
00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:11.410
who asks any tips for anyone who wants to apply for the Google Science Fair?

472
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.430
This is a really good question because the Google science fair is about to open.

473
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:19.390
Okay.
Show of hands,
how many of you guys are going to apply now?
There we go.

474
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.860
There we go.
All right.

475
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:31.230
So my tips are for the Google Science Fair would be to get your projects in

476
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.033
early.

477
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.600
So make your websites before it's due in a week,

478
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.450
which is what I,
um,

479
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.150
but seriously actually go online and start making your sights as soon as

480
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:48.710
possible.
If you have yet to do a project,
start finding mentors,

481
00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:53.300
ask questions that matter to you and really follow the templates that are given

482
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.840
for the Google Science Fair on how to think through those questions because

483
00:32:56.841 --> 00:33:01.640
they're really a good starting point if you don't know how to go about things

484
00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:02.474
yet.

485
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:07.250
So those are probably one of the best tips I can not give actually.

486
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.880
Um,
so,
um,

487
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.430
my next question as as you guys are voting,

488
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:18.320
it actually pops to the top.

489
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.230
So I get to see in real time what you guys are like,

490
00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.990
what you guys care about and that's an incredible thing.
Ooh.
Um,

491
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.430
so the next,
I love this question.

492
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.430
What's the next question you'd like to answer with science?

493
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:38.840
So I think I've done a lot of really cool things over the past few years from

494
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:44.290
starting the company to doing research to getting to talk to kids and figure out

495
00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:49.571
like how to mentor and how to really create networks that matter.

496
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:55.040
And so the next question I'm really excited to answer with science is actually

497
00:33:55.310 --> 00:34:00.310
about my initial passions for cancer for understanding how cancer cells process

498
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:04.550
energy in different ways,

499
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:09.551
the normal cells and whether we can figure out a better way to target cancer

500
00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:12.230
cells by understanding those differences.

501
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.500
So that's sort of the next big question.

502
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:19.270
I'm going for our right and I,

503
00:34:19.271 --> 00:34:22.790
I think I have time for one last question.
Um,

504
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:28.370
and let me find it.
Let's see,
a couple more.
Oh,

505
00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:32.000
sweet.
Yeah.
Couple more answers.
All right.
So,

506
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.140
um,
I love this question.
Okay.

507
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:41.030
What was your most inspiring learning memory in school and outside of school?

508
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.520
So this is from Jonathan.
Thank you,
Jonathan.
Um,

509
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:46.760
I think in school,

510
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:51.940
one of my most inspiring learning moments was actually with my biology teacher

511
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:53.810
when I like I at,

512
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:57.230
at one point when I wasn't understanding what was happening in class,

513
00:34:57.231 --> 00:35:01.130
I went in and I talked to her and I said,
you know,
this doesn't make sense.

514
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.210
And she was one of the first people who said,
if this doesn't make sense,

515
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.490
try to find some higher level things.

516
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.500
And I remember at the time the things I was reading didn't really make sense,

517
00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:16.280
like the scientific articles or were full of jargon.

518
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.900
So I went from having to Google every like other word.

519
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.520
And as I read more,

520
00:35:22.521 --> 00:35:25.970
I would have to Google every fifth word and that was progress.

521
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.890
But that was one of my most inspiring moments was this teacher really telling me

522
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:34.760
that,
you know,
learn outside of just this classroom,

523
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:39.790
learn as much as you possibly can and use all of the tools you have to figure

524
00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:44.170
out what information you want to get.
Um,

525
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.230
outside of school actually is one of my earliest memories with science that

526
00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:53.910
actually like sort of solidified why I was excited about science.

527
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:59.160
Um,
I,
I grew up with an older brother.
He's two years older than me.
Super Cool.

528
00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.570
And when we were little,

529
00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:05.571
I remember he would come home every day and since I was younger and the only

530
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:08.250
person he could boss around,

531
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:13.110
he would make me sit down and he would explain everything he learned in science

532
00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:14.780
class.
And I remember it,

533
00:36:14.781 --> 00:36:19.781
he had this like spark in his eye and there's just something magical about being

534
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:25.080
taught by somebody who,
so obviously excited about what he's saying,

535
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.950
that just,
I,
I remember looking at him and thinking,

536
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.930
I want to be that excited.

537
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:35.490
I want to be that excited about atoms and molecules and cells and things that I

538
00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:36.630
didn't even understand,

539
00:36:36.631 --> 00:36:40.770
but let us break apart the world and put it back together again.
Um,

540
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.770
and so I think that was one of my most inspiring,

541
00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:48.771
just general memories in life has been sort of the influence of my older brother

542
00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:53.280
and having him teach me and still teach me throughout my entire life.

543
00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:57.390
All right.
Okay.
A few more questions.
Um,

544
00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:02.560
so let me go up.

545
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.540
I really like this question because it's actually very relevant to all of the

546
00:37:08.541 --> 00:37:11.840
students in the audience.
So Cathy,
thank you.
Um,

547
00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:17.300
how did you balance schoolwork with being a scientist?
And that's hard.

548
00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:20.850
You know,
I did a lot of these projects during my summers.
I,
uh,

549
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:25.010
my friends were out sort of having a good time and we would meet up and they

550
00:37:25.011 --> 00:37:29.300
would tell me about this like cool amusement park they went to or like the time

551
00:37:29.301 --> 00:37:30.860
they went out to coffee and I'd be like,

552
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.890
do you want to hear about breast cancer though?
I think you do.

553
00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:39.350
And then I would proceed to explain my project.
Um,
but I mean it's,

554
00:37:39.351 --> 00:37:41.480
it's a level of balance.
It really is.

555
00:37:41.481 --> 00:37:45.020
And when I was working on as a college student,

556
00:37:45.021 --> 00:37:48.560
I did research while doing classes at the same time.
And it's,

557
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.390
it ends up being a juggling act.

558
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:55.450
But I will say what made that possible is the fact that I loved every single

559
00:37:57.711 --> 00:37:58.850
thing that I was doing.

560
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.860
So when I was doing research and when I was doing class work really late at

561
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.800
night,
it wasn't because I had to be doing it.

562
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.870
It was because I wanted to be.

563
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.980
And I think that if you can find the things that you love,

564
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.710
that balance becomes so much easier.

565
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.760
But it is a balancing act and it really requires a level of organization that I

566
00:38:19.761 --> 00:38:24.320
think you will definitely develop when you find what you love and you're working

567
00:38:24.321 --> 00:38:26.960
on it.
Okay.
All right.

568
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.770
Few more questions.
Um,

569
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.733
<v 0>w</v>

570
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.220
<v 2>sorry.
Um,
okay.
This is from anonymous.</v>

571
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:41.980
What was the most enjoyable part of your research?

572
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.580
I oddly I,

573
00:38:44.581 --> 00:38:48.850
I've told you so many experiences of like messing up in lab,
right?

574
00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:52.930
Like I told you about breaking things and like messing up results and asking

575
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:54.310
questions that made no sense.

576
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:59.670
But I think my most enjoyable part of research was actually getting results that

577
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:03.160
made sense.
I mean,

578
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:08.161
I remember there was a moment in lab where I actually got this like film like

579
00:39:08.891 --> 00:39:13.750
this and the result came out as like this film and it just had blobs on it.

580
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.680
And for anybody else looking at this result,
it would make no sense.

581
00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:20.080
It just looks like blobs on this like film.

582
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.560
And I remember I was standing in lab,

583
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.070
I was looking at it and one blob was bigger than the other and that meant

584
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:31.510
something that meant something for why cancer cells weren't responding.

585
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.350
And I could,

586
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:37.350
I was holding these results and I was thinking of patients who like would be

587
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:40.150
impacted by the results that I was getting.

588
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.160
And just that feeling of being able to think through from beginning to end and

589
00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:47.140
get something that mattered.

590
00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:51.460
It was one of the most powerful feelings I've ever had.

591
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.340
And that's been my most enjoyable part of research.

592
00:39:54.341 --> 00:39:58.390
And it continues to be even many years later when I've been doing research for

593
00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:01.330
many more years.
Um,
so if you ever start research,

594
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:03.760
I hope you or research or anything really,

595
00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:08.410
I hope you hold on to that sort of passion and that sort of excitement for what

596
00:40:08.411 --> 00:40:09.244
you do.

597
00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:10.663
<v 3>MMM.</v>

598
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.320
<v 2>All right.
Uh,
last question.
Okay,
let me pick a good one.</v>

599
00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:17.773
<v 3>MMM.</v>

600
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.210
<v 2>Oh,
so many.
You guys did a good job.</v>

601
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.680
<v 3>Um
Hum.
I really,</v>

602
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:31.350
<v 2>this is an important question and thank you to see something for asking it.</v>

603
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.620
Did you,

604
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.190
did your friends ever make fun of you and call you a nerd for being so into

605
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:39.910
science?
So hands up.
How many of you guys,
is that a concern for you?

606
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.880
Yeah.
Yeah,
it definitely is.
Right?

607
00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:51.010
And I think that's why things like the Google science fair are so important

608
00:40:51.011 --> 00:40:55.240
because they make it into this platform.
That's awesome.

609
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:59.920
Like you,
you come back as a rock star and that's an incredible thing.

610
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:04.060
But I mean,
yes you will.
You might get called a nerd.

611
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:08.560
You might get called a geek.
You might get cold.
A lot of names along the way.

612
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:14.130
And what you always have to remember when that happens,

613
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.300
when that ever happens,

614
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.740
is that you are doing things that matter.

615
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.770
What you are doing is something you love.

616
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.430
And the questions you are asking will be,

617
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:31.810
the question will be the sorts of things that you solve and the solutions will

618
00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:35.960
matter to the world.
And in 10,
20 years,

619
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:38.750
I know the whole it gets better.
Thing is cliched,

620
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:44.210
but I want you to remember that that love and that passion that takes you into

621
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:48.830
science is stronger than any name you will ever be called.

622
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.310
And as long as you always remember that,

623
00:41:52.311 --> 00:41:56.630
and as long as you have people in your life,
including me,

624
00:41:56.631 --> 00:42:00.800
who are willing to look at you and say what you are doing is amazing,

625
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.580
and the scientists that you are is incredible,

626
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:08.390
I think you're never going to find yourself wanting to go away from science

627
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:11.720
because it's truly an amazing thing to be a part of,

628
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.180
and it's truly the way you can change the world.

629
00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.080
So I think that was my last question.
All right.

630
00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:23.330
<v 0>[inaudible] so much.</v>

631
00:42:23.611 --> 00:42:25.770
She,
that was so good.
Everyone.

632
00:42:25.771 --> 00:42:27.950
Can we please give a big round of applause for sure.
