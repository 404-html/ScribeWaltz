1
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.780
Well thank you [inaudible] for having me.
Thank you,
Google for having me.

2
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:15.260
Thank you for coming.
Lean out.
As I said,

3
00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:18.190
our official pub date is September 3rd.
Uh,

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.260
so this is really getting an early start and I think it's Kinda Rad that Google

5
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.880
had me here considering what the book is about.
Uh,

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.600
so I've called this conversation,
leaning out Google,

7
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.880
lean out and here's my information.
Uh,

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.710
I'm extremely friendly as Josh and Co's can attest too.

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.860
They've known me since college.
Uh,
and now you know me.

10
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.500
So feel free to stay in touch with me on Twitter.

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.900
And this is a little about me.
I'm the editor of this book,

12
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:55.901
lean out and I'm also organizing a security conference in New York and I run a

13
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.640
privacy company.
If you decide you want more books,

14
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.970
they're on or books or Amazon or just yell at me on Twitter.

15
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.110
So it's pretty Rad that you invited me here today considering what this book is

16
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:18.000
about.
Uh,
I told a friend that I was invited and he said,
well,

17
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.950
they haven't read your book.
I implying of course,

18
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:27.500
if,
if you knew what I was doing,
you would not have me here.
But,
um,

19
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.460
I actually think that's not true.

20
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:33.900
I think it's a reflection of what Google's about that,

21
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.400
that you're welcoming me in to have this conversation.
Uh,

22
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.100
so one of the chapters in this book is Ericka Joy.

23
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.550
She published this first on medium and agreed to let us republish it,

24
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.000
which I was very grateful for.
It's called the other side of diversity.

25
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.610
And it's about,
among other things,

26
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.690
her negative experiences as a black woman at Google.

27
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.520
So,
you know,
that's real,
that's a thing that happens.

28
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:07.020
But I'm optimistic about Google and,
or shall I say Alphabet Inc.

29
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.980
I see a face palm in the front row.
I'm all for it.
I mean,

30
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.700
this way they can spin things out and avoid lawsuits between divisions.
It's,

31
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.290
it's smart.
Um,

32
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.250
I was at the lesbians who Tech Event and I saw Megan Smith and I just became

33
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.580
such a fan girl,
not only for Smith,

34
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:34.581
but for Google's efforts towards gender inclusion and people of color.

35
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.940
Megan Smith is saying here in this Jif that the importance of diversity,

36
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.520
that the problems we face as humanity,

37
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.170
I mean she's thinking really big,

38
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.290
that they're so big that we need to activate everyone.

39
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.210
We need everyone involved because how else are we going to solve the world's

40
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.590
deepest problems?

41
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.700
And here she was at the helm at Google and she spoke at the lesbians who tech

42
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:08.701
event about the efforts Google had made to attract and hire women.

43
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.100
And,
and I believe that she was very sincere.

44
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.370
So I know that within Google these efforts have been made and that they're real.

45
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.850
And so I come here today,
you know,
all friendly,

46
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.540
like not hostile despite what's in this book.

47
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.880
I really appreciate that Google's a really big company and that you've brought

48
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:36.160
in some of the best thinkers on this and that there are people here who are

49
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:36.994
trying hard.

50
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.620
And so that's the spirit that I want to have this conversation today,

51
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.920
that you know,
we're all here.
We want to make this better,

52
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.720
we're going to acknowledge what's wrong.

53
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.790
And also acknowledge that Google has a lot of potential to be part of making

54
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:55.930
things better.
Uh,
so to start,

55
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.550
uh,
first,
a lot of feminists have me blocked on Twitter.

56
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.230
So you know,

57
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.231
I may be kind of a surprising person for you today and I have doubts about the

58
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.400
efforts to recruit women and underrepresented groups.

59
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.120
That's because women Lgbtq and people of Color in my network are struggling to

60
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:25.171
be funded and promoted and report sometimes shocking harassment.

61
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.920
So I worry about bringing in new people before we figured out how to retain and

62
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:36.850
advance the people who were here at the same time.

63
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.960
I just heard Megan Smith speak about how it's so urgent that we bring in

64
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:45.760
everyone.
And so all of these things are here and real and,
and it's really hard.

65
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.880
<v 2>Part of what</v>

66
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.140
<v 0>lean out does is it describes the shape of the problem as many of us experience</v>

67
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:01.510
it.
But it's really just a start.

68
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.120
I'm still figuring out what the solution looks like and that's one reason why

69
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.150
I'll want to open this up pretty quickly.

70
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.130
And so a conversational format because I think a lot of us are trying to figure

71
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:17.110
out what those solutions look like.

72
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.880
But kind of understanding the shape of the problem is a really good start.

73
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.230
So recruitment a company like Google doing recruitment doesn't necessarily mean

74
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:34.480
hiring or promotion.
Uh,

75
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:39.190
and this is all the more true when it's things like teaching kindergartners how

76
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:40.260
to Code,
right?

77
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:45.261
Like all that does is increase the possibility of applicants that a company like

78
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:46.870
Google might bring in.

79
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.140
But it doesn't come with any responsibility to actually support funds or promote

80
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.170
all of those people who now know how to code.

81
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.160
It doesn't mean going to get jobs or they're going to get funded.
Uh,

82
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.650
so that's one of my reservations.

83
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.990
Being a qualified woman does not necessarily lead to being hired,
promoted,

84
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.280
funded,
or respected or treated well once you land somewhere,

85
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.110
which is part of the herd problem that we're figuring out now.

86
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.630
Something else they'll go into,

87
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.900
cause I'd like to read a little bit from lean out is that I love all the

88
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:31.061
additional opportunities and resources that are coming now with recruitment

89
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.180
efforts for women.

90
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:37.040
But I just want to take a lot of care that we don't say that women need special

91
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:37.874
programs.

92
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.780
I've never felt that I needed something special to be interested in tech.

93
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.200
And I think that's true for many women and people of color and Lgbtq.

94
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.830
I'll focus specifically on women,
but uh,

95
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.920
in lean out and in this preface now really we're talking more broadly about all

96
00:06:57.741 --> 00:06:59.060
underrepresented groups.

97
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.970
I think it's not that women need special programs,
so we just need,

98
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.280
you know,
respect.
And

99
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.450
so how well I'll get into it to be very clear.

100
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.550
Women,

101
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.540
Lgbtq and people of color are already here and we are already awesome.

102
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.780
So feel indulge me.

103
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.770
I'm going to read a little bit from the chapter that I wrote and then open this

104
00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:37.600
up and we'll all,
we'll see what you have to say and what your questions are.

105
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.590
That's good with everyone.
Yeah.
Okay,
cool.

106
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.700
My chapter is called the pipeline isn't the problem,

107
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.040
the pipeline problem and narrative that states that the reason big tech

108
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:55.900
companies have poor track record for hiring and promoting women is because there

109
00:07:55.901 --> 00:07:59.320
are too few women interested in or skilled in stem.

110
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.010
The idea that tech has a pipeline problem,

111
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.200
one that can be solved by teaching five year old girls to code infuriates me.

112
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:09.970
It's awkward to say,

113
00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:14.971
so I need to tread carefully here lest I be accused of bad feminism.

114
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.990
I can see the headline now,

115
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.470
lady boss against stem education for girls also secretly hates puppies.

116
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.130
I don't hate puppies but I'm allergic.
So you know,

117
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.250
I am of course in favor of teaching girls to code and it is true that there are

118
00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:37.900
more men than women applying for jobs and programs in Silicon Valley.

119
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.300
But the reason why we don't have more women in tech is not because of a lack of

120
00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:44.440
stem education.

121
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:50.010
It's because too many high profile and influential individuals and subcultures

122
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.290
within the tech industry have ignored or outright mistreated women,

123
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:59.820
applicants and employees.
To be succinct,
the problem isn't women.

124
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.870
It's tough culture.
That's the issue that needs to be addressed.

125
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.040
The work that I aim to do here is clarifying the nature of the women in tech

126
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.770
problem to the extent that we agree something is wrong.

127
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.260
The women who work in tech agree that the problem is harassment,

128
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.790
discrimination and a generally hostile work environment.

129
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.230
Many sight difficulties being hired,
promoted or getting funding.

130
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.450
An overwhelming number of the highest profile technology companies have had a

131
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:38.451
sexual harassment scandal that has made headlines many within the next,

132
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.330
the last year.

133
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.320
It is unsurprising that these companies have difficulties hiring women.

134
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:52.250
In 2012 I was told by a senior manager at Youtube that I was not qualified for

135
00:09:52.981 --> 00:09:53.814
Google.

136
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:59.150
Some context here is that I had actually been in SAP since 1997 and I had a lot

137
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:01.860
of technology jobs.

138
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.080
I was told Google only hires the best.
That's you guys.

139
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.900
Despite spending many days add youtube,
been at Google.
I was never recruited.

140
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.320
I would go there to visit my housemate,
my friends,

141
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.480
or to meet with business contacts I did in lunch at the youtube HQ,
Google,

142
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.000
Cambridge and Google mountain view.

143
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.150
There was a time when I was quite the Google fan girl.

144
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.050
I would have loved to have worked on Google plus back when that product was

145
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:31.980
still promising.

146
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.510
I am known for having a lot of self confidence.

147
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.520
Claire Cane Miller of the New York Times described me as having entrepreneurial

148
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:44.880
Breo.
I do not have a confidence problem,

149
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.530
but I definitely integrated the idea that I would not be hired at Google.

150
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.540
In retrospect,
I may have had opportunities if I had fought for them,

151
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.800
but Google is espousing the idea that women are nowhere to be found.

152
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.820
I was on campus frequently and what have been an easy recruit.

153
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.810
Google and every other big tech company can't ask for much more than for

154
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:12.270
potential female hires to walk right onto campus.

155
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.720
As I did frequently in 2011 and 2012 I have brilliant female friends who have

156
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:23.820
applied for roles at Google and other tech companies and I've also been
rejected.

157
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.360
I am very curious to understand why.
Then I go on,

158
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.430
so let's stop saying that women aren't here or that they aren't skilled.

159
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.510
Let's instead look at why we're not seeing hiring,

160
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.430
promoting funding,

161
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.520
respecting the women who are as Ali or Ramen tweeted at the lesbians who Tech

162
00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:46.904
Conference.

163
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.400
I believe the best way to hire women and people of color is to hire them.

164
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.840
Sometimes.
I think it really is that simple.

165
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.200
The best way to hire more women is to hire them.

166
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.860
We were already here and we are already awesome.

167
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:06.683
Thank you.

168
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.890
So I think that's enough to open things up.
Um,

169
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.630
let's say questions and,
and take it from there.
Can you hear me?

170
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.800
I see costs getting a mic.

171
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.763
<v 1>This movie.</v>

172
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.750
<v 3>Hi.
I was hoping for a clarification when you said that we're already here.</v>

173
00:12:24.751 --> 00:12:26.880
We're already awesome.
Um,

174
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.520
so the criticism was that big tech companies aren't hiring.

175
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.810
One of the criticisms was one of the big tech companies aren't hiring women

176
00:12:33.811 --> 00:12:36.210
applicants who are already there.
Um,

177
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.210
is that because there's an implicit bias?

178
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:44.450
Is it because they're not sort of choosing to hire more women?

179
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.880
Um,
so,
so what do you need the root causes?

180
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.400
If there's women who are here who are awesome,

181
00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:54.060
who can be hired and tech companies or at least saying they want more women,

182
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.770
where's the gap between the two?
Like what is the cause of that not,

183
00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.800
and I'm not being hired.

184
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.480
<v 0>I think we're all trying to understand that right now.</v>

185
00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.540
And I give Google a lot of credit.

186
00:13:05.541 --> 00:13:10.541
It's my belief that many of the upper management in Google are also working on

187
00:13:11.211 --> 00:13:13.070
this.
Uh,
so with that in mind,

188
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.160
I think some of it is not seeing the potential applicants.

189
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.640
Uh,
I'll use myself as an example.
I'm never recruited ever,

190
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:28.420
maybe like once every 60 days and I fairly prominent.

191
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.120
So companies are saying they can't find women,

192
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.220
but are they actually really looking?
Uh,

193
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:39.950
so I think that's the first part.
Like women are hearing the ecosystem,

194
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.460
but we're not necessarily showing up where you're hoping to find us.

195
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.060
For example,
I'm part of a female founders group.
There are a ton of women there.

196
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:55.060
Many of them would probably be really happy to get a job at Google.
Um,

197
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.900
right now I'm pretty busy.
I have this book out,
have a conference,

198
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:00.890
I have a company,

199
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.750
but six months ago that was not the case in anyone could have hired me and I

200
00:14:05.751 --> 00:14:09.890
begged my friends to hire me as my startup was shutting down and my friend hired

201
00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:11.870
me.
Uh,
and that was great,

202
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:17.200
but it goes to show that we're here and we're not necessarily being seen by the

203
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.973
companies.

204
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.490
<v 4>I mean,
one thing I'll point out is that recruiters will often ask,</v>

205
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.970
who do you know?
Right?
Who can we go and talk to and recruit?

206
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.870
And if the people that you know are very much like you,

207
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.680
then that's going to be a problem,
right?
Like there's network effects,

208
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.240
which is one small part.

209
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.290
<v 0>That's a really important point.</v>

210
00:14:42.291 --> 00:14:47.291
And that's often cited when you have organizations that are led by a white men

211
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.950
and many of the employees,
white men,

212
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.830
and then they're asked to go recruit their friends.

213
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.000
They're going to go and recruit people from their network.
Uh,

214
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:03.010
so we have this problem of how do we get outside our network and find all these

215
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:06.120
other people who are going to think differently.
Uh,

216
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.310
and I think that's actually very important.
I'm not a social justice warrior.

217
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:14.300
That's not the police I'm coming from.
I mean,
I care about that a lot,

218
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:18.320
but I'm worried about how we're going to solve all these problems without

219
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.300
bringing in everyone's perspectives.

220
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.850
<v 5>So I'm in my mid thirties,</v>

221
00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:27.770
and I'd been in technology about as long as you have through the back door and I

222
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:30.830
feel like I'm entering or I read that I'm entering,
uh,

223
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.750
the big washout period for women in technology and looking around.

224
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.760
I actually don't see many women much older than me and I'm curious

225
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.320
a few,
and you guys were very gracious.
Thank you.
Um,

226
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.570
but I,
I really do wonder,
like,
it's not just the pipeline issue.

227
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.010
It's not that the women are here,

228
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:55.890
it's also that women are choosing to leave technology companies.
Uh,

229
00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.110
and in my own experience,

230
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:59.690
I think that culture actually does have a lot to do with that.

231
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.360
The higher you get,
the more the Duke's come out,

232
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:07.370
the more aggressive and assertive,
the more you really can't cry,
you know,

233
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:08.204
like,

234
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:12.560
what do you think about that mid career female technology path?

235
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.090
<v 0>I think it's not only for women,</v>

236
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.990
but that there's this fetishization of youth.

237
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.560
Now I'm a tail mentor.
I am very,

238
00:16:23.561 --> 00:16:27.850
very excited that young people are being given the opportunities they are,

239
00:16:27.851 --> 00:16:29.590
that they're being taken seriously.

240
00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:33.470
And I love the work being done by innovative young people.
Um,

241
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.190
but I also love the work done by older people.

242
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.850
We do a different kind of work in general.
Uh,

243
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.410
the people involved with me and my company are all older than me.

244
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.710
We're building an enterprise security company.

245
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.090
We're building stuff that needs to scale,
that cannot fail the counter,

246
00:16:52.091 --> 00:16:56.840
have vulnerabilities that you can't build over a hackathon weekend.
And

247
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:04.230
sometimes older people in our ecosystem aren't valued as much as I'd like to see

248
00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:10.240
them being valued.
And that's true for men and women.

249
00:17:10.241 --> 00:17:15.241
But these issues become exacerbated for women because we're already facing so

250
00:17:16.421 --> 00:17:17.254
much.

251
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.030
<v 6>Yeah.
Just to put a stat on that,</v>

252
00:17:21.031 --> 00:17:25.080
I believe I saw something about the dropout rate for women after 10 years and
in,

253
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.720
in tech is about 50%.
Um,
but agreed.
Um,

254
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.420
since I'm in that group,
uh,
it's wonderful to be,
you know,

255
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.540
there was all the sexism that one had to deal with and now it's,
oh,

256
00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:40.380
ages and plus x Simpson.
Awesome.
Um,
uh,

257
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.530
I have a question about just the title of your book.

258
00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.410
The title,
you know,

259
00:17:46.411 --> 00:17:50.670
lean out is invoking obviously a reference Sheryl Sandberg's

260
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:55.530
<v 0>book.
And I was,
I,
I was wondering,
um,</v>

261
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.280
in what,
how has your message directly addressing her message?

262
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.500
Not as much as you would want.
Kind of wondering what,

263
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.200
I didn't hear as much of it here and I was wondering in what you've talked about

264
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:11.330
so far and I was wondering whether there was more in the,
well,
there is actually,

265
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.460
and it comes through when you read the book as a collection.
Uh,

266
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.270
so I'm very grateful to Sheryl Sandberg.

267
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.100
I think that she's been a trailblazer for women in tech and in business.

268
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:27.390
It was really impactful when her book came out to see someone of her stature

269
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:29.520
taking on feminism as an issue,

270
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.030
encouraging women to be leaders and we needed that.

271
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.660
And that's why this book has been a best seller since it launched,

272
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:41.661
but three years later leanin just isn't enough and it doesn't speak to all of

273
00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:43.620
us.

274
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.620
What lean out does that I'm so proud of is it brings together so many different

275
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:54.510
voices from so many different people and like I'm not on the cover.

276
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.550
The book is about,

277
00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:01.850
it's an effort to encapsulate the experiences of as many people as possible in

278
00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:10.191
the industry and to speak to what it's like to be someone who isn't white and

279
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:14.700
overeducated and reasonably pretty.
And uh,
you know,

280
00:19:14.701 --> 00:19:17.160
I'm too close to that demographic,

281
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:22.161
which is why there's so many collaborators in this text and it speaks to,

282
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.510
you know,
being a person of color,
being Lgbtq,
being in gaming.

283
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.920
And there's something really powerful about that.

284
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.240
I think we all see that,

285
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:36.990
that it's time not only for more voices to be heard,

286
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:39.780
but for more approaches.
Right?

287
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.990
Like one of the chapters in lean out talks about not drinking the Koolaid and

288
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.930
just one approach really doesn't fit all.

289
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:54.140
I was just on Twitter and Sam Altman was giving advice and it was like mad,

290
00:19:54.771 --> 00:19:59.771
like this works for the 20 people who you're mentoring right now and just all

291
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.760
those of us who don't,
who aren't fitting into that mold.

292
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:07.890
Like we need to start doing things our way.

293
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:13.940
And the book hints at that and explores that in different chapters.

294
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:15.450
Uh,

295
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:20.450
I think one example I like to give is how it's harder for women and people of

296
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:25.380
color to get really early stage funding.
You know,

297
00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:27.480
it's always hard to get early stage funding.

298
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.050
I have a lot of white guys coming to me and they're like,
Alyssa,
can you help me?

299
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:36.030
You know,
so like the ecosystems hard on a lot of people right now,

300
00:20:36.031 --> 00:20:40.590
but it's,
it's like almost impossible for women and people of Color.
Uh,

301
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.850
so Melanie Moore,
his advice in the book and I met going,

302
00:20:44.851 --> 00:20:48.560
that is to build a business with customers.
You know,

303
00:20:48.561 --> 00:20:53.050
we'll try and like go around these obstacles,
try and find ways to,

304
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.410
you know,
silicon valley,
is it working for you?

305
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.940
We need to figure out another way.
Maybe it means building,
you know,

306
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:05.050
a lifestyle business,
but maybe that shouldn't be stigmatized.
You know,

307
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:09.820
silicon valley VC firms are not giving a return back to their investors.

308
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.830
A startups are failing.
Like the default is that VC firms and startups fail.

309
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.150
So it's time that we stop stigmatizing these like profitable,

310
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:24.151
stable lifestyle companies with people who are actually building businesses with

311
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:25.024
real customers.

312
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.380
<v 7>There's a very good,
um,</v>

313
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.250
op Ed piece in the New York Times today about the,
um,

314
00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.720
what the gender gap in pay.
And I'm,

315
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:41.360
one of the things that it points out is that the UK now requires large companies

316
00:21:41.361 --> 00:21:44.390
to publish their gender gap figures.

317
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.170
When price Waterhouse coopers in the UK did this,

318
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.500
they discovered that almost the entire pay gap was due to lack of women in

319
00:21:54.171 --> 00:21:55.430
higher positions.

320
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.390
And so they studied it and they found out that indeed there was a serious

321
00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:04.220
promotion problem.
Just backing up your,
your point,
uh,
now,

322
00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:04.641
uh,

323
00:22:04.641 --> 00:22:09.641
I know that Google has internally studied promotions in the last few years.

324
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.920
I don't,
it's been a while since I looked at those figures.

325
00:22:12.921 --> 00:22:15.590
I don't remember what the conclusion was.

326
00:22:15.591 --> 00:22:19.940
I don't remember that there was a huge gap and promotion rates,

327
00:22:19.941 --> 00:22:24.190
but I may be totally misremembering.
Maybe other people do.
Let me,

328
00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.290
so that would be one thing if somebody would answer,
but I,

329
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.170
two of the really common reasons that are now cited for this problem,

330
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.170
um,
basically put the onus on women.

331
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.330
One is that women take more time off than men of course,

332
00:22:41.331 --> 00:22:44.000
to have families and so forth.
And just in general,

333
00:22:44.001 --> 00:22:48.620
once they have families are not willing to work the crazy hours that men are

334
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:53.150
because they want to devote more time to their families.
And as a result of this,

335
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.560
they don't get promoted.

336
00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.420
The other thing that people often say is that women are simply not aggressive

337
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:04.280
enough in pursuing both promotion and higher salaries.
They don't ask for them.

338
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:08.210
And when they do ask,
they don't ask for as much as men do.

339
00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.770
So I'd be really interested in your response to those two things,

340
00:23:12.771 --> 00:23:17.771
which one now sees just about everywhere sited as the two of the really main

341
00:23:17.961 --> 00:23:18.794
reasons.

342
00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.640
<v 0>So I,</v>

343
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.310
I understand how people could look at that data and say,
well,

344
00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:27.150
it's fair,

345
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.830
but I actually think that it's bs because you have a system that was created by

346
00:23:31.831 --> 00:23:34.590
men for men and now women are coming in.

347
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.970
And the thing is men are now saying they want women here.

348
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:44.300
Whether that's because of political and social pressure or because they actually

349
00:23:44.431 --> 00:23:47.960
see the of women in the workplace.
Nonetheless,

350
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.410
we have the leadership at companies saying,

351
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.680
we want women here in our companies.

352
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.950
We want to retain them and we want to promote them.

353
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:03.220
So we need to find ways to do that without placing all of the onus on women.

354
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.990
And we know that women negotiate differently than men.

355
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:14.350
Why is our system for promotions based on this set up that makes sense for men

356
00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:17.540
and not for women?

357
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:21.500
When women are now coming in the workforce and we're saying that we want to

358
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.570
integrate them in a meaning full way,

359
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:28.550
I think that's the lens that's useful to look at.
This,
uh,
like yes,

360
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.260
women aren't playing the game the way men are expecting them to,

361
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.800
but if we want women to be at our companies and stay and be happy and be

362
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:45.220
promoted,
that's on all of us to figure out how we changed things.
And,

363
00:24:45.221 --> 00:24:50.090
and that's part of what lean out means to me.
You know,
lean in was saying,

364
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.141
all right women,

365
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:55.160
like this is how you behave like mad to get ahead and get that seat in the

366
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:59.690
boardroom.
And that's,
that was a step forward.

367
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:03.800
But now it's time.
Now that men are saying they want women here,

368
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.620
now it's time to say,

369
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.340
how does the workplace accommodate women?

370
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:14.840
How do men stirred to change their behaviors to welcome us here?

371
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.130
That's the conversation I want us to start having.
And it's hard

372
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.570
in the back.
Yeah.

373
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.180
<v 8>One thing that you brought up did,</v>

374
00:25:27.181 --> 00:25:30.090
it took me a while to internalize is when you said funding,
uh,

375
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.880
because I have friends in academia and so originally I thought you were talking

376
00:25:32.881 --> 00:25:33.780
about academic funding,

377
00:25:33.781 --> 00:25:36.330
but I believe you're talking about things like VC funding.
Is that correct?

378
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.460
<v 0>Right.
I'm talking,</v>

379
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.140
I'm coming from the startup community and I have a bias in my language towards

380
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:45.530
that.
I'm very interested in academia,
but I don't know much about it.

381
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:47.410
<v 8>Yeah.
And then,
yeah,</v>

382
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.020
we just came from two different worlds and now I'm getting it.

383
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.320
And it's interesting because I wonder to what extent that that feature of the

384
00:25:56.141 --> 00:25:57.280
tech world right now,

385
00:25:57.281 --> 00:26:02.281
the fact that the kind of one of the images of the very,

386
00:26:02.621 --> 00:26:05.160
very successful person in our world is,
is,

387
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.880
is someone who has come up with an idea,
gone in front of investors,
said,

388
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.130
here's my idea.
Do you believe in my idea?

389
00:26:12.131 --> 00:26:16.270
Do you believe in me to execute that idea?
And that's,
you know,

390
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.030
the startup founder,
as you know,

391
00:26:19.031 --> 00:26:24.031
there are many other fields of business in which that is not nearly as prevalent

392
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.170
a model.
You know,
someone might,

393
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.520
many more people in that field of business might be someone who came up through

394
00:26:33.521 --> 00:26:38.380
the ranks in a very established company and that's seen as being one very valid

395
00:26:38.381 --> 00:26:42.520
way of being successful.
I'm curious whether that,
you know,

396
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:48.110
if the dynamics of that you think are somewhat holding tech back compared to

397
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:52.440
other fields of business,
that feature of,
of the economics of the business?

398
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.650
<v 0>I think tech is doing great actually.</v>

399
00:26:55.651 --> 00:27:00.651
I think that we're seeing tremendous innovation in technology.

400
00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:01.863
Uh,

401
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:07.190
people like Vivek Wadhwa critique technology for not necessarily focusing on

402
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:13.560
important enough problems.
And I think there's something to be said for that.

403
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.490
But uh,

404
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:19.080
of all the industries you look at technology and the pace of innovation is just

405
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.831
incredible.

406
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:24.831
And I look in my own life and like the quality of my own life has improved so

407
00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:31.350
much due to technology just in the last few years and much of that technology

408
00:27:31.351 --> 00:27:32.970
has come out of silicon valley.

409
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.970
So as much as I'll stand here and criticize some aspects,

410
00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:39.390
I do think there's something there that's working really well.

411
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.600
What I worry about with funding is how much of that ends up being about

412
00:27:45.271 --> 00:27:47.700
camaraderie or believing in someone.

413
00:27:47.701 --> 00:27:52.230
And I'll give an example that I may regret later given that this is a live feed,

414
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:54.750
but I think it's important.
Uh,

415
00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:59.810
I was fundraising last year with my cofounder pacs Dickenson and we had between

416
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:05.280
10 and 20% week over week traction with the teenage market.

417
00:28:05.281 --> 00:28:10.281
We were able to go into a school and get any target group off snapchat using US

418
00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:14.100
instead.
Uh,
so we had a lot going for us.
Um,

419
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.450
but we have problems as well.
Uh,
some of which are pretty well known.

420
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.960
What's interesting is the VC response,

421
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:27.590
some of the feedback I've gotten was that Alyssa is too confident.

422
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.910
She gave two high evaluation.

423
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.930
The other feedback is Alissa is not confidence enough.

424
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:39.710
So there was this kind of intense scrutiny around my confidence level and I'm

425
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:46.080
not sure if that's gendered or not.
That's part of the problem we deal with.

426
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:49.860
That's why it's helpful for us to have these kinds of conversations,

427
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.240
talk on social media,

428
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:56.241
discover if there's a commonality of gender is that commonality and a lot of

429
00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:58.200
experiences people are having.

430
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.680
But I suspect that my gender may have had something to do with that.

431
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:07.440
Why was everyone so focused on my confidence level?

432
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.940
We have really great traction.
Yeah.

433
00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:15.420
<v 9>So I also have a question which is one thing that I've heard a lot in the past</v>

434
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.080
couple of years is that part of the problem with recruiting women who are

435
00:29:23.601 --> 00:29:28.601
already here and able to code is that the very small number of women in the

436
00:29:30.561 --> 00:29:35.420
company is part of the problem.
And it's also part of the problem for retention.

437
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.830
That is those who are already in the company are more likely to leave because of

438
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.190
the culture in which are very

439
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.023
<v 4>few women.</v>

440
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:48.030
So I wonder what you think about the interplay between retention and recruiting

441
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:51.460
and pipeline and how maybe each one of them affects the other.

442
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:52.990
<v 0>That's interesting.</v>

443
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:58.470
I've been hearing a lot from women involved in diversity outreach efforts within

444
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:05.461
their own companies and it seems to be very draining for them.

445
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.970
I don't know anything about this.
Uh,

446
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.760
I kind of became like this accidental feminist and like carry on Manal like

447
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:16.660
obviously like I'm in it.
But when I started glimpse with packs,

448
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:19.240
we just hired the people who we could,

449
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.810
we are grateful that we could hire anyone at the time.

450
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:27.811
And we hired a bunch of white boys because that's who we knew and that's who

451
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.050
worked for us.
And we weren't thinking about it very hard.
Uh,

452
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:37.110
and so I actually have never been in that corporate setting where someone's

453
00:30:37.781 --> 00:30:40.750
asked me to take this on.
But,
uh,

454
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:45.310
I think that companies need to be very aware that,
uh,

455
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.570
women,
feminists,
civil rights activists,

456
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.930
they consider that to be unpaid emotional work and,

457
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.690
and are not necessarily happy about it.

458
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.860
I think the companies look at it as a favor.
Like I,
uh,

459
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.820
like here we are at this big tech company and we're going to care about the

460
00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:08.350
thing you care about.
So here go do 20 hours worth of work.
Um,
I think,

461
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.320
I think if the companies made it like a really important position in the company

462
00:31:13.321 --> 00:31:16.750
and really well paid and,
uh,
you know,

463
00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:21.751
I think if there was more benefit and prestige and tangible reward attached to

464
00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:25.660
doing that work,

465
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:31.320
then that would help retain the women who are in the company and bring in New

466
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.550
People.
Um,
but we could talk about this all day.
It's a really,

467
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:37.630
really hard problem.

468
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:42.550
And I suspect that those of you who are actually here at Google probably have

469
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:45.910
more insight than I do,
although I'm studying this pretty hard

470
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.243
in the back.

471
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.940
<v 4>So I have two questions,
but I'll stick with one for now.
Um,</v>

472
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.950
I'm a proud Harvey Mudd alumni and daily love.
Yes.
Um,

473
00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.500
they've done a bunch of stuff that's been incredibly successful in getting women

474
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:02.050
into computer science by making small changes.

475
00:32:02.051 --> 00:32:04.600
And I've talked with them a little bit about their theories about why it works

476
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:07.530
and there's some interesting stuff there.
Um,
and they've also done a whole bunch,

477
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:10.960
um,
even more recently to bring in underrepresented minorities.

478
00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:15.370
And like one of the things that change the average acceptance rate from below

479
00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:19.930
the overall mud acceptance rate to higher than that was just having faculty,

480
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:24.280
which like self organized on a mailing list,
call every accepted student and say,

481
00:32:24.281 --> 00:32:26.540
hey,
we like you and we would like you to be here.
Um,

482
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:31.250
and that small change made a big effect in,
and now the like,
the,

483
00:32:31.251 --> 00:32:34.090
the new student rate is much improved and like it,

484
00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.740
it makes a big difference on campus.

485
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:39.950
Do you have thoughts on things that tech companies can actually do that might

486
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:42.290
make similar like substantial changes?

487
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.300
<v 0>I think that's right.
I have a friend who,
uh,</v>

488
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.900
did work at Google and actually she still works at Google.

489
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:53.730
She's been very successful here.
And,
uh,
Facebook tried to steal her away,

490
00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:54.230
uh,

491
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:59.100
and Sheryl Sandberg herself called her on the phone and encouraged her to lean

492
00:32:59.101 --> 00:33:02.790
in and said like,
we want you here,
I want you here.

493
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.140
And that was very meaningful.
Uh,
and,
uh,

494
00:33:07.141 --> 00:33:09.570
this friend of mine ended up staying at Google,

495
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:15.410
but she's also deeply wanted here and she knows that.

496
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:20.450
I think there's something really powerful about knowing that a place wants to.

497
00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.770
Uh,
I recently joined the mock 37 cyber security accelerator.

498
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.330
I don't know how much I'll have,
you know,
about the infosec industry,

499
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.360
but especially in DC,
it's not only why the mail,

500
00:33:33.361 --> 00:33:34.950
it's white and male and military.

501
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:40.730
So it's not a place that I would have thought is net,

502
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.720
like naturally my place.
But I knew that they really wanted me.

503
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.840
And then when I got there,
it was really nice.
Uh,

504
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.430
and we were part of the first class of women and there was,
you know,

505
00:33:55.470 --> 00:34:00.390
some learning for everyone around that,
but I didn't care that,

506
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:03.720
you know,
this program was run by white men.

507
00:34:03.721 --> 00:34:06.470
Most of the alumni and the connections were white men who was like,

508
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:07.561
we're all hackers.

509
00:34:07.561 --> 00:34:11.910
We have that in common and they want me and I talk about that in the book too

510
00:34:11.911 --> 00:34:13.890
and lean out and you know,
everyone was here.

511
00:34:13.891 --> 00:34:15.600
It gets a free coffee so you can read it.

512
00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:21.210
When I got into computer science it's because they wanted me,

513
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.950
you know,
that that was very impactful.
I was getting recruited left and right.

514
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.280
The computer science department was really warm and friendly.

515
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.930
Everyone wanted to teach me how to code and I think that has a lot to do with

516
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:39.470
where I am now in tech where like I love it and all of this like sexism just

517
00:34:39.901 --> 00:34:41.070
feel so foreign to me.

518
00:34:41.071 --> 00:34:46.071
Like it's this thing that's happened that I can't even believe happen because

519
00:34:46.171 --> 00:34:51.120
when I got into technology that that was not my experience at all.
And

520
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:57.540
I think that that's a big step for us to let people know that they're wanted.

521
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.840
<v 4>Maybe one followup thing is that I think a lot of people at Google Austin feel</v>

522
00:35:01.841 --> 00:35:04.090
imposter syndrome and I think that there's,

523
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.000
there's gendered aspects to that in general.
But I also think there's this,

524
00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.950
am I really good enough and here I am doing this hiring and what I passed this

525
00:35:11.951 --> 00:35:13.480
hiring interview can,

526
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.630
can lead to doubt about whether you're really qualified in general and with that

527
00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.850
am I really wanted or would somebody else be better?

528
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.250
Which I don't think is necessarily only gendered,

529
00:35:21.251 --> 00:35:23.980
but I think it plays into the where else are you getting signals about being

530
00:35:23.981 --> 00:35:24.750
wanted,

531
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:29.280
<v 0>right.
And,
and it's been talked about very widely,</v>

532
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:33.870
but it's worth reiterating here that women will only apply for a job if they're

533
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.990
like super qualified.
Whereas men will apply.

534
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:42.140
Like they'll just apply and I'm trying to learn that lesson myself and I mean I

535
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:45.810
should have just applied to Google plus one.

536
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:48.360
I thought that was like the most badass thing ever.

537
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.720
And I did it because I didn't because I didn't think I didn't as confident as I

538
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:55.920
am,
I didn't have it.

539
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.910
So when we do our,

540
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.300
when we do our recruitment process,

541
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.960
we need to know that if we actually really want women,

542
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.090
we need to recruit for

543
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.233
<v 1>women.</v>

544
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.060
<v 10>I think there's an also is an aspect of if there's a culture of a leadism,</v>

545
00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.400
you have to actually tell people at some point you're okay.

546
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:23.650
<v 0>Yes.
Yeah.
Like you're here,
you're one of us,
you know,</v>

547
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.450
for better or worse.
And you're not the only one who's figuring out your job.

548
00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.820
Any other questions?
Yes.

549
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:39.300
<v 10>This isn't a question so much as to respond to your point about what small</v>

550
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:40.920
concrete actions could be taken.

551
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.980
I just wanted to share something that I know my previous company did.
Um,

552
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.810
they're called ThoughtWorks and they actually do pretty well in terms of hiring

553
00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:53.490
women and minorities.
And one thing they do in the interview process is for one,

554
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:57.450
they always make sure there are two people interview and they also treat certain

555
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:00.270
things like smells.
When an interviewer says,

556
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.810
I don't think they're going to fit in,
or I don't think they're like me,

557
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.830
they immediately throw that out because that will just encourage a company that

558
00:37:07.831 --> 00:37:10.710
has certain culture to keep hiring people who are similar than them.

559
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.990
And it's a very natural human thing to do.

560
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.710
But they explicitly make sure that as part of the interview process,

561
00:37:16.711 --> 00:37:18.330
they don't want that to factor in.

562
00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.190
<v 6>Just to tie together these two comments,
um,</v>

563
00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.590
about the rate of promotion at Google.
So,
uh,
when they did the study,

564
00:37:27.591 --> 00:37:31.430
they found that at every level,
um,
that as you go up,

565
00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.980
the number of women at that level have,
um,

566
00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.210
and so what did you get to a certain level?
They're very,

567
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.500
the percentage of women is very low.
Um,
and that is the truth.

568
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.830
That's the case in Cambridge as well as elsewhere.
Uh,

569
00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.070
and when they did that study,
uh,
several years ago that concluded,

570
00:37:49.071 --> 00:37:51.340
the reason they noticed that when women asked,

571
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.420
when the women went up for promotion,

572
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.740
they were promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts,
but they were,

573
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.960
um,
going up for promotion,
trying to go up for promotion half as often.

574
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:04.160
Um,

575
00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.160
and the sad part about that was the conclusion was that women weren't trying to

576
00:38:10.131 --> 00:38:11.660
get promoted.
Uh,

577
00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:16.740
and there were many of us who I think at the time were upset about that because

578
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.560
usually people go up for promotion when they get a signal from their boss at

579
00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.300
that that's going to go through.
Um,
and,
you know,

580
00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.730
so there are signals about feeling wanted,

581
00:38:28.731 --> 00:38:33.380
about feeling accepted that maybe we're not getting through or simply the bosses

582
00:38:33.381 --> 00:38:36.160
were not telling the,
the,
the were not telling,

583
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.210
<v 0>indicating,
uh,
beforehand.
Well,
I think you should try to go up.</v>

584
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.710
I think that's right.
And that there's just,

585
00:38:44.711 --> 00:38:46.750
there are so many elephants in the room.

586
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:50.470
There's so much that we don't talk about.
Uh,

587
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.280
I was in a conversation and a closed Facebook group recently that delved into

588
00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:02.740
some of the concerns that hiring managers have about women.

589
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.300
Uh,
and in this case,

590
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:09.280
some of those interviewers and hiring managers had made their concerns explicit

591
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:14.230
without realizing they were expressing illegal or like just kind of offensive

592
00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:17.860
things,
including trying to assess out if,
you know,

593
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.770
the women were about to make babies,

594
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:25.680
are interested in making babies and just all the presumption that women,
uh,

595
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.710
after a certain age,
that age being I guess,
I don't know,
17,
um,

596
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:35.200
are,
are going to at some point drop their careers and go and make babies.

597
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.600
Uh,

598
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.600
and that's very frustrating for the women who feel that by showing up to

599
00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:46.030
interview or by showing up to ask for capital,

600
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:50.920
they're saying that they're in it,
you know,
and,
and that's my feeling.

601
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.780
Like if I show up and I said,
I'm going to do it,

602
00:39:52.781 --> 00:39:54.670
I want you to take that at face value.

603
00:39:55.030 --> 00:40:00.030
So I worry about that with some of these issues that the hiring managers may

604
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:02.104
assume,

605
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:07.240
like there may be both implicit and explicit bias there.

606
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:12.170
Uh,
and also if I may and had the stage so I can,
uh,

607
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:18.720
women will say that they're leaving for family or for babies or for all these

608
00:40:19.871 --> 00:40:22.270
reasons.
And that's not always why.

609
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:27.510
And I say this as someone who has leaned out and left so many times and it's

610
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:33.750
only now that I'm more self aware and that I'm aware of these issues in the

611
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:38.970
industry that I can look back and say,
Oh yeah,
you know,

612
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.870
that time that I left the country,
like I quit my job and left the country.

613
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.070
It's because I felt like I'd run out of options at my current company.

614
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:51.820
I didn't understand how I could improve my career.

615
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.720
Back in 2005,
I was thinking maybe Grad school,

616
00:40:55.721 --> 00:41:00.250
but that felt very amorphous and I ended up in ex pat and then I ended up

617
00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:04.180
married and like,
you know,
years of adventures and,
and,

618
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.130
and why did that happen?

619
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:11.131
It happened because like what I really wanted was to be a vice president at

620
00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:16.030
everyday health.
I didn't know how to get there.
I mean,
now I do,

621
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:21.010
I don't plan to leave.
I'm pretty busy.
But that's one reason,
right?

622
00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:24.430
Like women are just,
and I see heads nodding like women just,

623
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:28.330
they don't want to leave but they,
they don't want,
they can't stay.

624
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:33.750
The other reason is the real elephant in the room and it's even harder to talk

625
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:35.684
about,

626
00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:41.350
which is women end up sometimes with very intense harassment.

627
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:47.390
My book describes a woman who's describing rape at work.
Um,

628
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:48.361
the,

629
00:41:48.361 --> 00:41:53.361
the things that people experience sometimes are deeply traumatic and you can't

630
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:56.690
talk about it,
you know,
it doesn't,

631
00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.740
I think it's really important to read Katie Levinson's article on whistle

632
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:01.760
blowing if you can.

633
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.900
Sometimes women can't talk about what happened to them because it's not going to

634
00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:09.980
help them personally and they're already struggling to deal with what's happened

635
00:42:09.981 --> 00:42:13.130
to them.
They're not in a position to be an activist or to be a martyr.

636
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.680
They need to get on with their lives and figure things out.

637
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.600
And so when we assume that women are leaving to make babies,

638
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.160
I just don't think that's the reason why a lot of women are leaving.
Yes,

639
00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:29.450
women leave for family,
but we often can't talk about why we left.

640
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.400
<v 5>I would just like to point out the Vic Gundotra is supposedly spending time with</v>

641
00:42:33.401 --> 00:42:36.370
his family right now and uh,

642
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:40.510
Lucy made this wonderful snarky point right behind me a second ago that when men

643
00:42:40.511 --> 00:42:42.640
leave to say they're spending time with their families,

644
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:46.450
especially if they have just led the company through a giant multi year
disaster,

645
00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.480
we all roll our eyes like how sure you are.

646
00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.810
But if a woman says it,

647
00:42:52.811 --> 00:42:55.800
for some reason we believe her and like what the fuck's up with that?

648
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:59.250
<v 0>Yeah.
Women,
it's just the easy thing to say.</v>

649
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.430
You can't say I'm leaving because,

650
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.570
and then fill in the blank with something that would like be a Gawker headline.

651
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.550
No one wants that for themselves.

652
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.910
<v 5>You know,
it's just an anecdote.</v>

653
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:14.990
I had my babies and I've made it clear to every single manager since then that

654
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:20.150
no two is enough.
Um,
and at my last company,
I made it explicit,

655
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.590
extraordinarily explicit,

656
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:26.710
every single review that I was looking for leadership and my CEO told me that he

657
00:43:27.411 --> 00:43:29.630
did not think of me as a leader.

658
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.590
Please notice the x company part of that.
Right.

659
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.010
But it would have been way easier,
so much less conflict,

660
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.720
so much simpler for me to either dodge hide,

661
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.590
you know,
use an excuse,
stay low,
hide my head,

662
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.040
just keep working hard and wait to be noticed.
Um,

663
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.890
and I really started to feel like my point,

664
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:56.510
it was actually less about sexism than mid career ism where you're looking for

665
00:43:56.511 --> 00:44:00.560
those first jobs as a manager,
as a leader,
as a person in the company.

666
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:05.120
Other people look to for answers and uh,
the people above you say,

667
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.550
I'm sorry,
I just,
I don't think of you like that

668
00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.070
<v 0>and that is why I'm a startup founder,</v>

669
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:18.630
but I would be very interested in figuring out and understanding a way for

670
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.650
people to make that happen in corporate life.
Uh,

671
00:44:23.651 --> 00:44:26.560
and if anyone has ideas,
I would love to hear them.

672
00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:32.130
<v 5>I have,
I'm not sure if it's a question or an observation,
but regarding the,
the</v>

673
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.630
<v 9>rates of promotion at Google,</v>

674
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:37.890
Google is a little weird and that in most companies,
um,
you know,

675
00:44:37.891 --> 00:44:40.860
a manager says,
Hey,
I think you could do it,

676
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:43.500
this other rule and they promote you and then you do it.

677
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:48.501
And Google kind of looks to you to have started working above your level already

678
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.560
and there could very well be gendered barriers to doing that,

679
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.010
but they might be very different from the kind that block promotion at other

680
00:44:59.011 --> 00:45:00.600
companies.
It may be,

681
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.440
maybe it's a reluctance to work above your level when you haven't been blessed.

682
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.880
Maybe it's resistance from other people to taking your leadership when you

683
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:12.660
haven't been promoted yet.
Maybe it's lack of encouragement.

684
00:45:12.661 --> 00:45:13.710
I don't know what it is.

685
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.130
<v 5>That is really interesting.</v>

686
00:45:15.131 --> 00:45:18.520
I want to speak to that really briefly because in this one particular way,

687
00:45:18.521 --> 00:45:22.780
I'm a very stereotypical woman so I can speak to the like totally girly side.

688
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.690
And I've been at Google for eight years now and I've been uh,

689
00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:30.100
eventually through two promotions and I am one of those people who won't apply

690
00:45:30.101 --> 00:45:32.350
for the job unless they have every single bullet point.

691
00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:35.620
And I also will not go for the promotion until I have every single bullet point.

692
00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.400
And for that reason I think it's actually kind of Nice that Google lets you work

693
00:45:39.401 --> 00:45:41.200
at that level before you take the title.

694
00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:44.590
Because I would not go up for the title until I had actually done those things

695
00:45:44.591 --> 00:45:47.320
because I would say I don't know if I will try those things and fail.

696
00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:52.770
So I actually think it's a very also feminine style friendly way to do it that

697
00:45:54.521 --> 00:45:55.354
Google is doing

698
00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:55.751
<v 0>well.</v>

699
00:45:55.751 --> 00:46:00.751
I'm glad to hear that and I'm really optimistic about what women are going to

700
00:46:02.681 --> 00:46:03.514
build.

701
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:08.700
That's part of the message that I hope will come through with lean out is that

702
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.850
it's really hard relying on systems that are already made that other people

703
00:46:15.851 --> 00:46:16.684
made.

704
00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:22.300
I think that some of the change that we're going to see in silicon valley is

705
00:46:22.301 --> 00:46:25.570
going to come from just creating our own institution.

706
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.710
And making new ways to do things.
And I think it's time for that.

707
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:33.400
<v 7>Yeah.
Well,
just to expand on that,</v>

708
00:46:33.401 --> 00:46:38.401
how much of the problem is just a pervasive culture that rewards individualism

709
00:46:40.511 --> 00:46:45.310
and aggression?
Um,
for example,
um,
you know,
when,

710
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:49.270
uh,
people in the whole tech industry talk about the kind of person they want to

711
00:46:49.271 --> 00:46:53.890
hire,
they often use the term rock star.
I hate that term.

712
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:58.510
I hate that term.
I think it should be completely banished.

713
00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:03.810
My associations with rock stars are almost completely negative and not the kind

714
00:47:04.631 --> 00:47:08.020
of people that succeed or that you would want in your company.

715
00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:13.290
Why can't we have such a system that promotes cooperation?

716
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:19.090
Um,
you know,
um,
the communication,
uh,

717
00:47:19.091 --> 00:47:23.080
those are the kinds of things that I find most lacking among many of the males

718
00:47:23.081 --> 00:47:27.610
that I work with.
And they're extremely important.
I mean,
that,
you know,

719
00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:32.611
companies I think in that can promote those traits actually probably are more

720
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:37.150
successful than groups that don't it,
you know,

721
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:42.180
there's just so many aspects of this culture that every day promote the kind of

722
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:48.160
individualistic aggressive traits that stereotypical males have.

723
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:52.520
<v 0>Let's take three more questions.
And yes,
100%.</v>

724
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:56.690
I think that the best people on tech teams in my experience are the ones who are

725
00:47:56.691 --> 00:48:00.770
like glue who somehow make everything go right.
Like yes,

726
00:48:00.771 --> 00:48:03.710
there are those engineers who are 10 times better than everyone else.

727
00:48:03.711 --> 00:48:04.521
I've seen that.

728
00:48:04.521 --> 00:48:09.290
But in a team that's not always what it's about.

729
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.650
Uh,
and yeah,
100%.

730
00:48:12.651 --> 00:48:17.000
I think we need to focus on collaboration.
And in my personal experience,

731
00:48:17.001 --> 00:48:18.140
just for me personally,

732
00:48:18.141 --> 00:48:23.141
the worst experiences I've had at companies have been with people whose egos

733
00:48:23.571 --> 00:48:26.480
were threatened and who,
you know,

734
00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.260
maybe we're threatened by me or threatened by someone else in the organization.

735
00:48:30.261 --> 00:48:35.210
And uh,
I'm personally very interested in genuine meritocracy.
We just,

736
00:48:35.211 --> 00:48:37.490
something that I don't see a lot of,

737
00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:42.610
but I believe personally that if we found a way to have less like egocentric ego

738
00:48:43.911 --> 00:48:46.970
threatens and competent people in teams,

739
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:52.070
that it would be better for women,
Lgbtq,
people of color.

740
00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:55.790
I know it would be better for me when I come in somewhere as a strong woman and

741
00:48:55.791 --> 00:48:59.480
I'm excited and I'm ready to like do my part and I'm being treated like an

742
00:48:59.481 --> 00:49:03.590
expert.
Like there's that one person who's like,

743
00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:07.520
she's figured out that I don't know what I'm doing.
Like,
look,

744
00:49:07.521 --> 00:49:09.580
I'm not here to take you down,
but like

745
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.920
they get up in my grill and that's,

746
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:16.690
that's that lack of cooperation.

747
00:49:16.691 --> 00:49:20.440
I think the best people are thinking how we move the whole team ahead.

748
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.310
<v 5>Um,
switching gears a little bit,</v>

749
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:29.340
I was hoping you could expand a little on your statement that the pipeline

750
00:49:29.411 --> 00:49:31.570
problem is not the problem.
Um,

751
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.340
because I think it's hard to deny that it is a problem given that,
you know,

752
00:49:36.341 --> 00:49:41.320
graduating classes of computer science majors have,

753
00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:46.330
you know,
20% something like 20% women and 80% men.

754
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.950
Um,
and while I acknowledge all of the problems that,

755
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.980
that you are your pointing to as definitely genuine problems in the industry

756
00:49:56.321 --> 00:49:59.250
itself.
Um,
yeah.

757
00:49:59.251 --> 00:50:03.160
I could you just expand on that statement and what you think we could do better

758
00:50:03.161 --> 00:50:06.450
as opposed to having,
um,
special programs for

759
00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:07.860
<v 0>yeah,
for sure.
Uh,</v>

760
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:12.980
so part of what I'm really trying to show in my chapter the pipeline problem is

761
00:50:14.431 --> 00:50:19.431
that we all agree there's a woman in tech problem or a man problem as Claire

762
00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:25.590
Cane Miller put it.
Uh,
but it's a question of perspective,
right?

763
00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:26.191
Uh,

764
00:50:26.191 --> 00:50:31.191
the problems female founders and for female developers are different from the

765
00:50:32.451 --> 00:50:35.150
problems faced by hiring managers.

766
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.540
Now hiring managers have a pipeline problem.

767
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:44.080
Hiring managers have a problem that social justice warriors are yelling at them

768
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.810
when they don't have enough women in their organizations and they need to bring

769
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:52.700
in more women.
But that's hard because the women are not showing up at the door.

770
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.970
I'm not that worried about that problem.

771
00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:00.710
Like if the executives at Google have trouble hiring people and meeting,

772
00:51:00.711 --> 00:51:05.030
they're like bottom line.
Like I'm a CEO,

773
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.940
I'm an adventure capitalists.
Like I'm down.

774
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:12.120
Like I understand why they care about that and I'm sympathetic.
Uh,

775
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:17.170
but I think that that's the problem of executives in the technology industry and

776
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:22.040
of shareholders.
And that's not who I'm worrying about right now.

777
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.670
The people who I'm worrying about or very specific demographics,

778
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.030
I'm worried about the women,
the people of Color,

779
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.570
the Lgbtq people who are already here,

780
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:37.730
who are already qualified and they're having like a nightmare of a time.

781
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.210
And those are the people I'm worried about.

782
00:51:41.211 --> 00:51:45.710
So I worry about what happens if we're going to create more of that.

783
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:50.830
Like why do we want to bring in more people to an environment that isn't ready

784
00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:55.190
for them?
And I worry,
okay,

785
00:51:55.191 --> 00:51:58.310
so one of these organizations are trying to have one token woman,

786
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.190
they're already say 10 women for that job right now.

787
00:52:01.191 --> 00:52:03.290
So you're going to bring in another 30 okay,

788
00:52:03.291 --> 00:52:07.910
so now I have 39 unemployed women that that's what I'm worrying about.

789
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:12.410
I'm not saying that there isn't a problem of having women in these companies,

790
00:52:12.411 --> 00:52:17.411
but I don't see how we bring more women into where we are now.

791
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:23.510
I think we need to make some changes and welcome women.

792
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:28.480
And the way to do that is to hire and funds and promote and respect women or a

793
00:52:28.481 --> 00:52:31.490
here.
And then we'll go,
we'll be evangelist,
right?

794
00:52:31.491 --> 00:52:35.240
Like if I go and I sell my company for $1 billion,

795
00:52:35.241 --> 00:52:39.650
or like maybe we never sell,
we IPO and like are my friends,
right?

796
00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:44.090
What maybe my friends go and they all get like fantastic jobs and they become

797
00:52:44.091 --> 00:52:47.330
vps and they get funded.
What are we going to do?

798
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.120
We're going to recruit women to our companies.

799
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:53.210
We're going to become angel investors and fund them.

800
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.690
So that's the path that I think is interesting.

801
00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:01.730
Like what if we just took the women are here and we empowered them and we gave

802
00:53:01.731 --> 00:53:05.510
them resources and we made them really successful and we put them on the covers

803
00:53:05.511 --> 00:53:07.190
of magazines.
All right.
Now,

804
00:53:07.191 --> 00:53:11.900
like now you're organically going to get people saying,
Oh,

805
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:16.160
you know,
those are role models that I kind of relate to them.

806
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.920
So I think that you can solve that problem organically.
And,
um,

807
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.890
there's one more thing that I think is really interesting that we don't talk

808
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.530
about enough,
which is Steve Jobs,
Mark Zuckerberg,

809
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:32.790
all of these young white men faced a certain kind of discrimination when they

810
00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:35.580
got started too.
They weren't taken seriously.

811
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:39.900
They did not look like what people thought and executive should look like.

812
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:45.180
Steve Jobs faced a lot of that and then they went and became super successful.

813
00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:48.600
And now we all think that's what,
you know,
a founder looks like.

814
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:52.140
That's what an executive looks like.
He looks like a 19 year old Harvard dropout.

815
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:57.150
So I think that I'm going to venture capitalist,

816
00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:59.910
I'm a free market feminist.
I think that if we

817
00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:06.480
empower women and we put them on stage and we make them successful and they're

818
00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.970
already awesome.
So I don't think that that takes a lot,

819
00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:15.900
then all of this bias will go away on its own.

820
00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.550
That's,
that's what I think.

821
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.910
<v 4>So I have a somewhat related question.
Um,</v>

822
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:25.570
why is technology the place where it's so bad?
Um,

823
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.750
and I think that there's maybe a couple of tight and things like there are a lot

824
00:54:28.751 --> 00:54:32.020
of industries you can look at medicine,
you can look at law that have similar,

825
00:54:32.021 --> 00:54:35.570
like they're very competitive,
the women weren't,
were excluded and then they,

826
00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:40.060
they're now like they're in record numbers and there's these graphs where it's

827
00:54:40.061 --> 00:54:41.710
like,
oh,
the,
the entrance looked like this.

828
00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:45.040
And the women in cs sort of kind of dies off.

829
00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:48.010
And a lot of the problems we talked about,

830
00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:50.050
like we're talking about these sort of basic,

831
00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.900
I don't want to say basic human nature things cause I,

832
00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:56.680
but like societal structural problems that aren't necessarily unique to

833
00:54:56.681 --> 00:54:57.514
technology.

834
00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.390
Why is it that we're having so much more of a problem with this than other

835
00:55:01.391 --> 00:55:01.991
industries are?

836
00:55:01.991 --> 00:55:05.740
Or is it just because we're so visible because technology is booming right now?

837
00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.690
<v 0>Well,
visibility is certainly one aspect,
right?
Uh,</v>

838
00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:14.300
because you're seeing these big IPOs and there's so much money in silicon

839
00:55:14.301 --> 00:55:19.040
valley.
What happens here is of tremendous interest.
And there's a lot of,

840
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:23.570
you know,
glamour and fantasy in the way that the media portrays silicon valley.

841
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:27.590
Although you know,
you know what coding actually looks like,

842
00:55:27.591 --> 00:55:29.600
it's not that exciting.
Um,

843
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:34.910
so what are the reasons why we do have these cultural problems?

844
00:55:34.911 --> 00:55:39.470
Because I do believe that technology does have problems that we're not seeing in

845
00:55:39.471 --> 00:55:40.610
medicine.
In Law.

846
00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:44.480
I have a friend who was a doctor and when she was a doctor,

847
00:55:44.481 --> 00:55:45.890
she was given a lot of respect.

848
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:49.850
Then she became a startup founder and suddenly people are questioning her when

849
00:55:49.851 --> 00:55:53.420
she was adopted,
she graduated law school,
I mean medical school.

850
00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:58.040
So she had that credential.
Whereas with startups,

851
00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:02.870
it's become very fashionable,
be the startup founder to be a programmer.

852
00:56:02.871 --> 00:56:07.390
And so
we don't always take people at face value.

853
00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:11.950
So that's one aspect.
And then there's no HR,
right?

854
00:56:11.951 --> 00:56:15.070
You have these young companies and young founders,

855
00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:18.860
they're being given millions of dollars or in some cases not so young.
Right?

856
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:21.070
You have a company like Google that's really grown up,

857
00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:26.100
but they're to maintain this youthful culture and uh,

858
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:30.970
be HR is different.
I think that's a big piece of it has been,

859
00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:35.200
uh,
intentionally trying to have,
you know,

860
00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:40.270
agile environments.
And then you look at who our leaders have been.
You know,

861
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:42.250
if you read Paul Graham's writings,

862
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:47.020
he talks about how to have a successful company and he's saying that you need to

863
00:56:47.021 --> 00:56:51.550
have your own culture and you need to be able to kind of square and be Raunchy.

864
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:56.910
So some of the thought leaders in Silicon Valley have in their own ways

865
00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:02.980
encouraged an environment that,
you know,

866
00:57:02.981 --> 00:57:07.780
you don't see that same kind of encouragement and medical school.
Uh,
yeah.

867
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:11.980
Uh,
so I'm going to stick around for about 10 minutes and sign books.

868
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:16.660
I'm really very appreciative for Google to have this conversation.

869
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:19.990
I recently gave a talk against,
uh,

870
00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:25.050
how the FBI and the government prosecutes hackers and I was really grateful to

871
00:57:25.181 --> 00:57:28.630
be able to give that talk and publicize it.
And I'm still here,
I'm not in jail.

872
00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:31.120
I kind of feel that way about giving the stock at Google,

873
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:36.121
like giving that talk about law enforcement reflects the freedom of speech we

874
00:57:36.151 --> 00:57:37.060
have in America.

875
00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.530
And giving this talk here at Google today reflects what I believe is a genuine

876
00:57:41.531 --> 00:57:43.900
commitment at Google to make things better.

877
