1
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.580
We want it to really kick it off with a taste of what the magazine is like.

2
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.910
So we're going to hear a quick reading from Gary over here who was a contributor

3
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:16.890
to the first issue.
Um,

4
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.850
and he's going to read you a part of his contribution to the magazine.
Woo.

5
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.213
<v 0>Well,</v>

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.150
I'll be reading expert excerpts from my piece.

7
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:33.950
Call it depression on the art that safely

8
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.310
I was 14 when I first felt the urge to and my own life.

9
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.180
Most mornings I would wake up feeling cold and unwanted.

10
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.570
Even in the spring when the Dogwood tree outside my window blossomed.

11
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.710
I struggled to find beauty in the world to motivate myself to get out of bed.

12
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.110
Although there are spurts of happiness,

13
00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:56.870
my teenage years were haunted by the desire to call it quits.

14
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.650
I struggled with my emotions,
but more importantly,
I struggled with why.

15
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.150
Why did I feel those urges?
Why was I unhappy?
For years,

16
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:09.080
I tried answering these questions.
I'm wondering if my parents,
rocky marriage,

17
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:12.320
where my failed two week middle school relationship factored into my depression

18
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.020
as I,
as I entered high school,
however,

19
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:17.210
I began to realize that these contortions of the mind,

20
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.110
we're rooted and an internal struggle with my race and my identity.

21
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.970
I grew up in a predominantly white community.
Why?

22
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.520
I surrounded myself with white friends.

23
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.260
I ignored our differences in race and fundamentally our differences in culture.

24
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.030
I and I sacrificed and an important part of myself to blend in among my peers.

25
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.610
I ate different foods at home than I did at school.

26
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.060
I was annoyed when my parents mispronounced basic English words.
Yeah,

27
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:45.560
I would shamelessly laugh when white students made mocking impersonations of

28
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:49.490
other Asians.
I wondered whether my true self was the person I was at home,

29
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.650
the person I was at school or neither.

30
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.720
I remember a time when I was flipping through movie channels and lingered on a

31
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.440
Jackie Chan film,

32
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.890
a scene where he was distressed and exclaimed and a heavy accent.
Who am I?

33
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.690
What's branded in my mind for years?

34
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.380
Who am I and major challenge of my depression was desensitization in order to

35
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.240
cope with suicidal thoughts.
I large largely ignored them.

36
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.410
I sat my emotions aside and put on a plastic smile wherever I went.

37
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.580
Over time,
not only did I become an expert at hiding how I felt inside,

38
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.960
but I also became incapable of letting my emotions flow for years.

39
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:26.210
I never cried despite how desperately I begged to,

40
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.560
I lost the sensation of being human and felt completely out of touch with my

41
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:33.350
emotions.
One summer during high school,

42
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.730
my dad dropped me off on the National Mall in Washington DC.
Go explore.
He said,

43
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.240
has he drove off to work?
I load the experience.

44
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.630
I wanted to spend my summer at home playing call of duty or aimlessly scrolling

45
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:48.470
through Facebook.
After a few days wandering through museums,
natural history,

46
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.640
airplanes and design.
I eventually stumbled into the Hirshhorn,

47
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.670
a Smithsonian Museum dedicated to modern and contemporary art on view was an

48
00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:01.750
Yves Klein retrospective highlighted by monochromes and blue impressions of the

49
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.490
female body pulled across canvas.

50
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.840
Searching for meaning in these paintings sparked a sense of curiosity and what I

51
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.060
would later discover to be a sense of purpose.

52
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.230
I devoted the remainder of my high school years to pursuing my fledgling

53
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.680
interest in the arts to see how far I could take it.
Fortunately,

54
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.130
my parents supported this move because they thought it would make me a unique

55
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:25.030
candidate when it came time for college applications.
In fact,

56
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.600
the focus shifted from making sure I had good grades and Calculus and
Statistics,

57
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.340
so allowing me to curate my identity around the arts in order to stand out from

58
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:35.170
the Asians who had perfect sat scores.

59
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.210
I roll enrolled in AP art history and subsequently an independent study,

60
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.570
but something was still missing.
Academia bored me.

61
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.040
I was never satisfied simply reading about it.
Plus,
for however much I loved art,

62
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.370
studying art at a suburban high school for the jocks still ruled supreme.

63
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.690
It was perceived as less than cool.
I continued living as an outsider,

64
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.840
not fully in the Asian community and not fully in any other.

65
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.420
Even as I pursued what I loved,

66
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.750
I still felt alone at Duke University.

67
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:08.110
That sentiment persisted into my sophomore year.
It was the only,

68
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.070
I was the only male art history major and the only minority in my class.

69
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.520
Even though I had found a group of likeminded individuals,

70
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.230
I couldn't get over how different I was on the surface searching for an escape.

71
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.530
I proceeded with the only millennial thing to do and I created an Instagram.

72
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.060
It became my diary.

73
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.950
My Instagram at art drunk began as a means to document artwork I liked,
hated,

74
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.290
and everything in between.
Ultimately,

75
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:34.870
I realized there was an outlet for communicating my emotions,

76
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.010
but I posted in this digital world often reflected how I felt in real time and

77
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:41.830
in real life.
Posting a Lucho Fontana,

78
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.970
Italian artists known for slashing into canvases reflected one of my troubled

79
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:49.450
moments and my connection with the rawness of breaking and otherwise perfect

80
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:51.070
surface posting.

81
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:54.730
A Richard Serra and American sculptor known for massive expanses of steel

82
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.810
reflected how I enjoyed feeling human again under a towering walls of metal and

83
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:03.400
knowing that it would exist centuries beyond my life as my Instagram following

84
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:05.530
grew,
so did my sense of purpose.

85
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.490
Although the challenges of being Asian American and a white community and the

86
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:13.210
additional struggle of being a minority in the arts have made me feel different.

87
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.310
I believe that my race does not define me.

88
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.430
It is only a part of my identity rather than the whole of it.

89
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.800
I continue to engage with my heritage,

90
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.190
learning about different Asian teas and being proud to hear Taiwan become the

91
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:28.330
first Asian country to legalize gay marriage,
but through our,

92
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.230
I'm empowered to push beyond stereotypes as helped me create an identity for

93
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:32.800
myself,

94
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.610
not restricted by the color of my skin or the way my eyes squint when I smile.

95
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.850
My battle with depression lasted seven years,

96
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:42.580
which transformed the way I viewed the world and the people around me.

97
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.790
There was seven years,
took me down a road where I thought the darkness,

98
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:46.750
we never turned to light,

99
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.200
but eventually there's seven years brought me into my foremost passion.

100
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.150
Through the struggle I found art and in a very real and literal sense,

101
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.070
art safe me.
Without it,
I would still be lost.

102
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:01.520
Trying to understand what it means to be different and what it means to be me.

103
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.533
<v 3>Thank you.</v>

104
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.113
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

105
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.450
<v 2>thank you so much.</v>

106
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.410
That was awesome reading and we're going to get to hear from Gary about that

107
00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:18.244
piece

108
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.210
<v 0>an upset.
Okay,
perfect.</v>

109
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.070
<v 2>All right,
I'm excited to introduce our panel here today.</v>

110
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.420
I'm just going to do some quick bios.
We have some context.
Um,

111
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.940
directly to my right

112
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.570
is uh,

113
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.850
our two founders Catarina and Christy Catarina is a product status strategists

114
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:46.770

115
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.540

116
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.190
startups.
She's passionate about music,
um,

117
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.410
about topics like making topics like race and identity,

118
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.060
easier to talk about in our everyday lives and has a bachelor's of arts in

119
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:04.040
English and music from Cornell.

120
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.850
Christy is a creative strategist at Landor a global brand consultancy and serves

121
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:15.380
on the national advisory board of answer a sex education nonprofit that provides

122
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:19.610
pro bono consulting services to women led organizations.
Uh,

123
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:24.410
she is an avid storyteller who hopes to one day perform at the moth and hold the

124
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:28.810
dual degree in business administration and public health from UC Berkeley.
Um,

125
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.290
Tessa is actually the creative,
sorry,
what was the marketing director?

126
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.830
Head of digital head of digital?
Yes.
Sorry.
Head of digital.

127
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.220
The person who like knows what Instagram photos are coming up from this event.

128
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.160
Essentially.
We planned that out earlier.
Um,

129
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.080
she spent the last five years here at Nyc putting her marketing degree to use.

130
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:50.660
We actually talked at lunch about how she's the only one of us who actually used

131
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:54.220
the third degree.

134
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:04.880
digital efforts at slanted.
Um,
also perfecting column making skills,

135
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.900
which was pretty awesome.
He just heard my Jewish husbands.
Yeah.

136
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.390
Yeah,
I will.
I personally know that Asian Jewish pairing is let's Drago and

137
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.950
um,
and then Gary,
who we just heard from is a business analyst at,

138
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.930
for the CIO at Fiserv lending solutions and an aspiring art collector.

139
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:30.110
As you heard from his peace,
you can also follow him on Instagram at,

140
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.650
at art drunk.
Uh,
so check that out afterwards as well.

141
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.210
But I think I wanted to kick it off kind of a hearing first of all from our two

142
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:41.930
founders here about sort of what you,

143
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.830
how you would define like what slanted is and what inspired you to found it.

144
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.920
Yeah,
I can sort of tell the origin story.

145
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:53.570
So slanted is a media company that celebrates Asian American identity through

146
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:56.070
personal storytelling.
And it came

147
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.820
<v 4>about because Kristy and invited me to a Facebook group called project boat,</v>

148
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.750
which was just a place for people to Asian Americans to post about what's going

149
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:08.370
on in the news,
ask for advice and just have a community of likeminded people.

150
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.010
And I saw all these amazing stories happening,

151
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:13.410
but they were happening in this private Facebook group and I was like,

152
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.860
this needs to be out into the world.
So I was like,
Hey Chrissy,

153
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:18.020
you want to start a magazine?

154
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.200
And we had like a humble spreadsheet where people were just dropping an ideas of

155
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:23.970
what stories they might want to contribute.

156
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.420
And then from there we launch our Kickstarter campaign in June,

157
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.570
which got such amazing support and that funded the issue one which is on sale

158
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:37.650
today.
Um,
and then for the launch party for issue one,

159
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:40.710
we really felt just such an amazing sense of community.

160
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:42.570
Like we had a sold out launch party.

161
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.900
The energy and the support was just so incredible.

162
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.770
And at that moment we were like,
this is way bigger than a magazine.

163
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:54.771
So we decided to be a media company and explore new forms of media in 2018.

164
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.380
<v 2>Awesome.
And a big part of that too is a,</v>

165
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:02.550
I went to a book talk with Eddie long about six months before a slanted became

166
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:06.210
something and he said that if spaces don't exist for you,

167
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.500
kick the door down and create them.
Um,

168
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.870
and at that time we didn't even know this was going to be a thing.
Um,

169
00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:13.110
and when cat reached out to me,

170
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:16.410
it just felt like the right opportunity because we didn't see ourselves in media

171
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.760
or in mainstream media.

172
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.030
We wanted a place where we could share our stories from everyday people.

173
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.510
So one of the big things about slanted is that it's not celebrities who write

174
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:28.230
for us.
You know,
it's not published writers per se.
It's people like you,
me,

175
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:29.130
your brother,
your sister,

176
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:32.850
your cousin who just have a story to tell and they just want a place to share

177
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:35.300
that and to connect with other people.
So Santa,

178
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.430
it's really supposed to be a community building creative outlet for all of us.

179
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.470
Um,
all of us were friends when we started this.

180
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:43.950
So I think that's what makes it extremely special.
Definitely.
And so,
I mean,

181
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.700
touching on that point of the idea of like building a community.
I mean,

182
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:51.480
I feel like one thing we talk about with the Asian Googler network a lot is that

183
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:55.550
there is very little consensus on what it means to be Asian American.
Um,

184
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:55.861
you know,

185
00:10:55.861 --> 00:11:00.861
that term encompasses in theory like hundreds of different like ethnicities and

186
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:03.480
languages.
There's also the question of,
you know,

187
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:08.481
citizens and noncitizens residents of the US who are impacted by issues that

188
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:10.420
affect the community,
but you know,

189
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.010
may not have been here as long or may not be here forever.

190
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.840
How do you guys sort of define that idea of American Asian American identity?

191
00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:20.730
For the purposes of the magazine?

192
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.280
<v 4>So for the magazine we define Asian American as anyone who has come from Asia,</v>

193
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:27.720
so including East Asian,

194
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:32.721
southeast Asian and South Asian and there are a lot of different groups and our

195
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:36.630
goal is not to sort of lump everyone into one category.

196
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.050
It's more to celebrate the differences that we all have and the shared

197
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:41.550
experiences that we do have.

198
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.500
I think one thing that the Asian American movement is getting better at is being

199
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:50.490
in solidarity with each other because in the past we've been very separated.

200
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:54.310
Just thinking about our history in America,
coming to America,

201
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.570
no ethnic group wanted to associate themselves with another ethnic group that

202
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:02.650
had already come because they want it to not face those same,

203
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.300
the same discrimination.

204
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:09.610
But now like I feel since the 90s and coming into the two thousands we're really

205
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:13.630
starting to come together and a realizing that together we are stronger and we

206
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:17.500
can make a difference as a,
as a one whole collective.

207
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.141
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

208
00:12:18.141 --> 00:12:21.980
And being this like hyphenated culture has been an interesting thing for us at

209
00:12:21.981 --> 00:12:25.250
slanted because,
uh,
when we edit a lot of the pieces from issue,

210
00:12:25.251 --> 00:12:28.670
one of very common theme was straddling two worlds.

211
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.480
So straddling what it's like to be Asian,
what's like to be American,

212
00:12:32.481 --> 00:12:34.640
not fitting in either place.
Um,

213
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.760
and that's something that I think we wrestle with individually and collectively

214
00:12:37.761 --> 00:12:40.340
as a community.
So when we look for contributors,

215
00:12:40.341 --> 00:12:44.090
we're looking for people who are exploring this question of what it means to be

216
00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:48.500
Asian American.
Um,
it's not at 50,
50 split,
it's just an ongoing journey.

217
00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:51.470
And everyone on this team is also going through a sense of self discovery in the

218
00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:52.304
process.

219
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.920
<v 4>So when you were crafting this first issue of the magazine,</v>

220
00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:02.250
how did you go about sourcing different voices and different parts of the Asian

221
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.100
American community?
So it was a pretty grassroots effort.

222
00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:09.670
We had a Google form that we just sent out to friends and family.

223
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.000
Great way of collecting information.
Um,

224
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.020
and from there we made sure that every piece had a mission,

225
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.470
that the author had something that they wanted to say to the community.

226
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.050
And the theme of our first issue was beginnings.

227
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:28.140
So whether that's a spiritual beginning or self awakening or the start of

228
00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:32.560
something new,
we wanted to make sure that every piece related to the theme

229
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.310
<v 2>and we purposely tried to keep it very open.
Um,
you know,</v>

230
00:13:37.311 --> 00:13:40.850
it's a very interpretive for each person and we looked to sort of get people

231
00:13:40.851 --> 00:13:44.120
from all over the country.
So although we're in New York City right now with,

232
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.230
you know,
on this event,
our contributors come from all across the country.
Uh,

233
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.770
we had 21 for this first issue and we actually only need seven of them

234
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.320
beforehand.
Um,
we don't know how they found us.

235
00:13:54.321 --> 00:13:55.610
I think it was through word of mouth,

236
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.710
but that speaks to the solidarity of our community.

237
00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.670
Just looking for a place to share their stories.
Hm.
Interesting.

238
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.350
<v 4>Um,
Tufts,
I know we were talking earlier about,
you know,</v>

239
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:10.540
balancing the fact that you guys have put so much work into launching this while

240
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:14.410
also having these amazing careers in tech and marketing and all of these other

241
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:17.620
things.
So I'd like to hear from all of you,
I guess about,
you know,

242
00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:21.850
what it's been like balancing a passion project and starting a new media company

243
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:24.250
with having these full time at other jobs.

244
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.090
<v 5>Yeah,
I mean it's a lot</v>

245
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.530
like the journal was going through a Reorg at the time that things were really

246
00:14:30.531 --> 00:14:34.130
ramping up and like I was planning my wedding and we were launching this and it

247
00:14:34.131 --> 00:14:37.340
was like,
there were times where I was like very stressed out.

248
00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:41.840
But I think that this is a situation in which the phrase passion project is

249
00:14:41.841 --> 00:14:46.841
really very applicable because like some of my friends and I have like started

250
00:14:47.241 --> 00:14:52.010
projects where we were really into them,
but like they never really went because

251
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.400
<v 4>you know,
like if things came up it kind of took a back seat.</v>

252
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:59.570
But this is like the kind of project where for me it meant something very

253
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:00.404
personal.

254
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.770
So I was able to kind of prioritize it over certain other things because it

255
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:10.790
meant so much to me and it meant so much to everyone else who is doing it.

256
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.490
<v 2>Um,
I was actually talking to Gary about this this morning.
Um,
I feel very lucky.</v>

257
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:18.800
Then I hit my quarter life breakthrough,
uh,

258
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:23.660
shortly before starting slanted where up until then I kept thinking my job had

259
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:27.010
to be my calling,
had to be my passion.
How did you met everything?
Um,

260
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.230
and then I realized that it didn't have to be that it didn't have to put so much

261
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:34.400
pressure on my job being something bigger than what it really was.
Um,

262
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:38.420
and so I happened to land a job a nine to five that truly was essentially a nine

263
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:41.000
to five.
Um,
and I love what I do.

264
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:44.810
I love doing branding and the company is really supportive of me doing side

265
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:45.710
projects like this.

266
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.300
And so the epiphany of having a job that supports me in the way that allows me

267
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:54.380
to do something like slanted or pursue a passion project is really pivotal.
Uh,

268
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:56.820
we joked that slanted is like a second job.
Um,

269
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.080
and I definitely would not have been able to do it if it wasn't for us,

270
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.600
<v 4>for my current company.
It was a good pivot there cause I was like,
oh,
she's like,</v>

271
00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.910
oh yeah,
it's not really a passionate of mine.
Nine to five,

272
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.120
five to nine for sure.

273
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.290
<v 2>A very,
very loving piece of like my five tonight.
Right.</v>

274
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.840
I can't imagine any other team to do this with either.

275
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:17.600
I think the passion that we all have,
the personal drive is right.

276
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.580
<v 4>A really big factor.</v>

277
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.450
So what kinds of things have you done to sort of raise awareness of the magazine

278
00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:26.230
and go out and spread the word that there is this new voice in the landscape?

279
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.980
I think right now most of it has been word of mouth,

280
00:16:29.981 --> 00:16:34.000
which just is a testament to how strong the community is.
Um,

281
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.770
our biggest channel right now,
it's Instagram.
I think us being millennials,

282
00:16:38.771 --> 00:16:42.460
it was a natural outlet for us to speak directly to our audience.

283
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.770
But in the new year,
in 2018,

284
00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:48.110
we're going to be looking at events hopefully across the country.
Um,

285
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.960
more marketing on social media channels and paid advertising as well,

286
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.840
<v 2>and also just cocreation or collaborative events,
um,
or even initiatives.</v>

287
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:02.220
So,
uh,
we've been very active about going to other events,
meeting people,

288
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.520
not just Asian Americans,
but other communities of color,
uh,

289
00:17:05.521 --> 00:17:07.590
to see what types of events they're interested in,

290
00:17:07.591 --> 00:17:09.450
what kind of dialogue they want to be a part of,

291
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.610
and how we can really raise awareness in that way.

292
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.510
Because something we discovered at the launch party was that this isn't just for

293
00:17:15.511 --> 00:17:16.350
Asian Americans.

294
00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:19.830
Like we are a platform specifically to elevate the Asian American narrative,

295
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:24.260
but it's a broader immigrant story.
Mm.
Um,
and in that sense,
I think we have

296
00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.270
<v 4>power to really make a stronger impact by collaborating with others.</v>

297
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.430
So has your idea of like,
what representation looks like changed as,

298
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.490
as you formed the magazine?
Or what,

299
00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:39.491
what do you see yourselves highlighting or we're really elevating thematically

300
00:17:39.811 --> 00:17:41.400
in the future?
I think so.

301
00:17:41.401 --> 00:17:45.510
So one thing that was an interesting shift is when we first started slanted,

302
00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:49.290
we thought we would create a community to bring like minded people together.

303
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.830
And then after the election happened and seeing the divisiveness within our

304
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:58.560
country,
we realized that we don't need to bring similar people together.

305
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:02.550
We need to bring different people together and people with different
experiences,

306
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:06.810
cultural backgrounds and perspectives and show that even though you are

307
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:09.030
different,
you can still be friends.

308
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:14.031
And in the end we all share the same fundamental stories of being a human.

309
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.350
<v 5>I think it's also kind of like a cultural movement that's happening that we are</v>

310
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.540
just a part of.
Um,

311
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:25.290
I think that you can see that and like Hollywood where the people speaking out

312
00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:29.490
against like the white washing of Asian roles and traditionally Asian movies or

313
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:33.720
like the Hawaii five o casts like walking when they weren't paid equally.

314
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.790
Um,
just all sorts of things like that are really coming to the surface now.

315
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:43.230
And I think that's what makes our platform especially relevant and especially

316
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.160
like needed.

317
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.820
<v 4>Yeah.
Has that been like a big reaction from people?</v>

318
00:18:48.821 --> 00:18:53.770
Is that specifically they talk about Hollywood whitewashing or representation in

319
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.280
media when they talk to you guys about what they want to see.

320
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.040
We do get a lot of questions,

321
00:19:00.041 --> 00:19:04.690
like anytime we talked to press about things going on on a media,
um,

322
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.280
but it's interesting because we,
it's not just about that,

323
00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:13.420
like the story is so much larger and we're just one piece of the puzzle that

324
00:19:13.421 --> 00:19:15.910
needs to happen in order to push the movement forward.

325
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.670
<v 2>Also,
because we're rooted in personal storytelling.</v>

326
00:19:18.671 --> 00:19:22.550
So the questions that we get are the topics that we get fished for,
um,

327
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.130
are a little bit deeper than that.
I mean,

328
00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:28.060
they definitely cover representation in media or lawsuits per se.
Um,

329
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.070
but one of the things that really struck home for us was,
um,

330
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.770
a lot of reaching out from families who adopt Asian kids and to their families.

331
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.420
Oh,
and that's a story that personally I haven't explored yet.
Um,

332
00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.320
I would love to explore in future issues,

333
00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:44.110
but just these open questions about what do we do?

334
00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:48.100
How do we talk about race and identity with our kids who grew up looking

335
00:19:48.101 --> 00:19:52.660
different than us?
Um,
and so it's a very sensitive piece to talk about.
Um,

336
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.190
but I think that's something that we can do.

337
00:19:54.191 --> 00:19:56.320
We can create a safe space for that conversation to have.

338
00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.300
<v 4>That's really interesting that that's kind of the audience that's surfaced for</v>

339
00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:02.460
you guys.
Do you have,

340
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.970
do you feel like you have a response for that or is there kind of a sense of

341
00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:10.320
like,
well we can't define for you what your child's like Asian identity,
right?

342
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:12.390
Obviously that's a very big role to fill,

343
00:20:12.391 --> 00:20:15.150
but I do think these everyday stories can help.

344
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:16.980
Like I'm thinking of when I was growing up,

345
00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:20.970
did I have a magazine that I could pick up and read about other Asian American

346
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:25.350
experiences?
Um,
I didn't really have anything like that.
So this could be slanted,

347
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:29.760
could be something for that loan kid in Arkansas who might not have a community

348
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.960
that looks like him or goes through the same experiences that he does for him to

349
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:35.100
pick it up and say,
wow,

350
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:39.030
there are other people that can relate to what's happening to my experience

351
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.080
<v 2>as long as act as a resource.
So like we're definitely not the authority on it,</v>

352
00:20:43.081 --> 00:20:46.870
anything like the Asian American narrative per se,
but,
um,

353
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.200
every time we talk to someone they get so excited and want to connect us with

354
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:51.460
five more people in the community.

355
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:54.610
So maybe we can't speak about that story in particular,

356
00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:57.610
but maybe we can connect them with someone who can put them in touch with

357
00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:59.170
someone else or share their own story.

358
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:03.070
<v 4>Definitely.
So in that sense,
what has been your vision of like,</v>

359
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.820
I know you were saying you actually decided to become a more full rounded media

360
00:21:06.821 --> 00:21:10.060
company rather than a magazine.
Is that where the idea comes from?

361
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:11.410
Is creating resources?

362
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.720
<v 2>Um,
not necessarily just for resources.</v>

363
00:21:14.721 --> 00:21:18.500
I think it's to expand the reach and realizing that stories come in many

364
00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:20.920
different shapes and sizes and forms.
Um,

365
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.400
we've gotten so much clamor about digital.
Um,
I am a die hard paper Fan,

366
00:21:25.401 --> 00:21:28.880
but I do recognize that in the 21st century,
digital is really critical.

367
00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.490
They can both work together,
they can work together.
Um,

368
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.640
so figuring out how we can create more platforms for storytelling because we

369
00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:38.870
were created to fill a need and we can't just fill that need with paper or with

370
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.380
print.
Right.

371
00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:44.360
Also the fact that we want to create a community that has a two way dialogue.

372
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.620
So whereas putting out a magazine and having someone consume it is more of a one

373
00:21:48.621 --> 00:21:49.580
way conversation.

374
00:21:49.581 --> 00:21:53.450
We really want to create spaces where people can interact with the content and

375
00:21:53.451 --> 00:21:55.440
interact with each other.
Um,

376
00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:00.290
and start to talk about these issues that are so complicated in nuance that

377
00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:04.550
really need discussion around it in order to move things forward.
Yeah,

378
00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:05.690
I think that especially today,

379
00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:09.680
like if we are trying to reach that lone kid in Arkansas who like doesn't have

380
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.470
any Asian friends or like an Asian Asian community,

381
00:22:12.471 --> 00:22:17.471
like an online presence that's robust and really a community in itself is so

382
00:22:18.081 --> 00:22:18.914
important.

383
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.890
<v 4>Right.
So it sounds like you guys do an amazing job of,</v>

384
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.780
of kind of giving a voice to people like that who don't feel they have a

385
00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:28.490
community currently.
But on the flip side,

386
00:22:28.491 --> 00:22:30.950
like I was talking to a friend recently who mentioned that he really thinks of

387
00:22:30.951 --> 00:22:34.790
himself more as Asian rather than Asian American and that,
you know,

388
00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:37.520
if he wanted to see himself represented in the media,

389
00:22:37.521 --> 00:22:41.750
he could watch Chinese movies and read Chinese books.
Um,

390
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:47.000
and do you see like a divide there between the experiences of more recent Asian

391
00:22:47.001 --> 00:22:51.680
immigrants or maybe even non like non permanent residents who you know,

392
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.840
who are in the states for now?
Um,

393
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.430
versus like sort of American born or American raised,
um,
Asian Americans,

394
00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.713
Asians.

395
00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.000
<v 0>I think there's actually,
from my experience has been quite,</v>

396
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:08.210
quite a difference where I want to go into a school like Duke University.

397
00:23:08.211 --> 00:23:11.330
There are a lot of international students and of course some from China,

398
00:23:11.331 --> 00:23:13.190
some from Korea.
So I'm from the Middle East.

399
00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:18.191
But I think the very nature of being international and not coming into a country

400
00:23:18.621 --> 00:23:21.110
and having to find people that are like you,

401
00:23:21.111 --> 00:23:24.800
they sort of group themselves off very quickly and they formed their own

402
00:23:24.801 --> 00:23:29.630
communities.
And so whereas for me,
like being Asian American growing up,
um,

403
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:34.580
growing up in predominantly white communities,
uh,
I was much more,

404
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:35.990
not to say that they're not open to that,

405
00:23:35.991 --> 00:23:39.050
but I was already sort of in those groups and in those communities.

406
00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:41.810
Whereas there's definitely that divide between the two.

407
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.570
And I think for me as an Asian American,
it's almost difficult to,

408
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.380
to connect with other Asians from actually from Asia or born in Asia.
Yeah,

409
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.870
<v 5>thank to that point.
And interesting chat,</v>

410
00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.270
like not a trend but a pattern that's emerged I think in our conversations and

411
00:23:57.271 --> 00:24:01.950
in the stories that we hear is that like you have this unique position where

412
00:24:01.951 --> 00:24:04.890
you're kind of like two Asian to be American,

413
00:24:04.891 --> 00:24:09.090
but you're like too American to really be Asian to actual agent or to people who

414
00:24:09.091 --> 00:24:09.661
live in Asia.

415
00:24:09.661 --> 00:24:14.220
So being Asian American is this really interesting place to be.

416
00:24:14.221 --> 00:24:16.110
And like for me personally,

417
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.200
when I was younger I like didn't want to have anything to do with it.

418
00:24:19.201 --> 00:24:23.340
So I would like ignore all my Chinese homework and I like hated my Chinese

419
00:24:23.341 --> 00:24:26.850
lessons.
And now I don't know how to speak Mandarin,
which I really regret.

420
00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.510
So if I were looking for more Asian representation in media,

421
00:24:30.511 --> 00:24:34.500
like I wouldn't be able to watch Chinese movies or like read Chinese books,

422
00:24:34.501 --> 00:24:34.950
I would just,

423
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:39.660
I'm looking for Asian representation like in American media.

424
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:45.290
So I think it's a really unique thing to you and like how deep your connection

425
00:24:45.871 --> 00:24:48.310
is to your Asian heritage.
Okay.

426
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.840
<v 2>I think part of the divide,
the sum of the cause potentially could be,</v>

427
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.250
we gravitate towards people who give us a sense of belonging.
And so,
um,

428
00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.170
as Asian Americans,

429
00:24:58.171 --> 00:25:01.290
maybe we'd gravitate more towards Asian Americans because we get the traditions

430
00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:03.950
after observing or the food that they're eating.
Um,

431
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:05.220
and people coming from another country,

432
00:25:05.221 --> 00:25:08.580
potentially they can't speak the language and they feel a sense of belonging

433
00:25:08.581 --> 00:25:09.580
within a specific group.

434
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.190
And so it almost feels like a sense of survival tactic in this in a way.
Um,

435
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.010
I would love to break down that divide and we've talked about the hierarchies

436
00:25:17.011 --> 00:25:19.130
within Asian American culture.
Um,

437
00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.660
that's something we definitely want to explore because again,

438
00:25:21.661 --> 00:25:23.790
Asian American isn't just East Asian.

439
00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.880
And so what does that hierarchy look like and how we can start to break that

440
00:25:26.881 --> 00:25:29.090
down and to really connect on a more human level,
right.

441
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.210
<v 4>Beyond race.
Yeah.</v>

442
00:25:30.211 --> 00:25:33.240
And I think that would be the ultimate goal is to break down that barrier

443
00:25:33.241 --> 00:25:37.950
between Asian Americans and Asians.
Because if we're all living in,
in America,

444
00:25:37.951 --> 00:25:42.690
then we can all benefit from having a more solid community.

445
00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:48.520
Do you see any value then in doing like multilingual content or you know,

446
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.320
having people from lots,

447
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.090
all these different ethnic and language groups who are contributing,

448
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.400
doing stuff that's maybe like translated in both languages or anything like
that?

449
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.820
<v 2>That would be amazing once we have the resources to test this point.</v>

450
00:26:04.221 --> 00:26:06.870
Like I personally can't read Mandarin Chinese.

451
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.670
I would love to be able to another regret also going to 10 years of Chinese

452
00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:11.900
school and not studying hard.

453
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.620
I would love to able to translate that cause we've gone and actually inquiries

454
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:18.100
from folks who don't live in the u s oh,
interesting.

455
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.820
So we were trying to figure out as a startup,

456
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:21.870
like how do we ship to another country,
um,

457
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.540
how do we translate things in other language?

458
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:25.070
But that would be amazing if we could do that.

459
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.240
<v 0>I think to,
to that question,</v>

460
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.480
I don't know if any of you guys saw the most recent show at the Guggenheim.

461
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.540
So it's an exhibition on Chinese art.
Um,

462
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:38.580
and I think as someone who appreciates art and has studied art in school,

463
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.080
I was really surprised to find how different it was to look at art.
That was,

464
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.550
you know,
we,
we see a lot of tech start,

465
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:47.370
but tech start that was Chinese Chinese-based and based off of Chinese

466
00:26:47.371 --> 00:26:49.760
characters.
And that gave me a really new approach,

467
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.870
a new found appreciation for what art could be.
And uh,

468
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.770
if we did have stories in different texts,

469
00:26:55.771 --> 00:27:00.520
obviously at different languages have different nuances to the actual,
uh,

470
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.950
word.
Uh,
like there are a lot of words we can't express,
uh,

471
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.630
in Chinese that we do it express in English and vice versa.

472
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.290
And so if there are ways to actually integrate that,
that'd be great.
Okay.

473
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.650
<v 4>Yeah,
no,
that's really interesting.
I mean,
I definitely see the challenge.</v>

474
00:27:14.651 --> 00:27:16.840
I also don't seek any checks.

475
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.290
<v 6>The editors,
it's like,
how do we edit this in a different way,
right.</v>

476
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.280
<v 4>Very big deal in my family that I took Japanese in college and stuff,
so.</v>

477
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.260
<v 6>Right.
Don't you have a Hashtag</v>

478
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:33.803
hashtag about it.

479
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.000
<v 4>Um,
Gary,
kind of like speaking to,
you know,
your art experience and stuff.</v>

480
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:42.270
Like how did you actually like first come to get involved with slanted and like

481
00:27:42.271 --> 00:27:44.910
how did you choose that piece?
I was like,

482
00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:47.040
what you wanted to contribute for this first issue?
Yeah.

483
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:51.560
<v 0>So,
so my sister Lena,
she,
she's actually involved with the founding of slanted.</v>

484
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.410
I think she was the partnership director.

485
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.940
<v 6>She's a hustler and chief handled a lot of the partnerships that we had.</v>

486
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.550
<v 0>Yeah.
And so she,
I guess when they,
they're looking for contributors a nationally,</v>

487
00:28:01.551 --> 00:28:05.570
she just reached out to me.
Um,
and I signed on.
That's,

488
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.010
that's the story for that.
But,
uh,
in terms of the actual piece,
uh,

489
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.670
initially I was going to write about being a minority in the contemporary art

490
00:28:13.671 --> 00:28:15.830
world where there are honestly aren't that many,

491
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.680
especially in scenes like New York and London.

492
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.980
It's hard to find Asians who are at the top of the gallery chain or at the top

493
00:28:24.591 --> 00:28:28.760
of being good collectors.
Uh,
so that's what I thought about,
but I mean tests,

494
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:29.900
sorry,
Kat.

495
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.800
Kat and Chrissy can really attest to this where I really struggled with that

496
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.980
topic and I spent two months writing it,

497
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:40.140
sending back drafts and missing deadlines here.
Uh,

498
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.670
and eventually I wanted to write something a little more personal.

499
00:28:42.671 --> 00:28:43.940
And this piece was sort of,

500
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.680
had always been on the back of my mind of accepting that I had a mental illness.

501
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:53.390
And I think writing it down really,
uh,
was that way of,
you know,
expressing,

502
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.060
you know,
this is who I am,
so be it.

503
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.200
I want to share that story and uh,

504
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.500
really try to just share it with other people who might connect it with.

505
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.370
<v 4>And I thought that was an amazing shift because it was actually a completely</v>

506
00:29:08.371 --> 00:29:10.650
different piece than what we were first working on.

507
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.730
And mental illness is something that really isn't spoken about in Asian

508
00:29:14.731 --> 00:29:15.361
communities.

509
00:29:15.361 --> 00:29:20.361
So we have a couple pieces on depression and overcoming mental illness,

510
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:25.790
um,
in a very traditional household in issue one.
Yeah,

511
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.630
I completely agree.
I mean it's just not,

512
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.260
it's not considered acceptable and a lot of ways.
Yeah.

513
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.460
So have you had any specific reaction from readers about those pieces in

514
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:36.294
particular?

515
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.160
<v 6>Oh,
about the mental health stuff?
A definitely a few folks.
Um,
one</v>

516
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.590
<v 2>of my old roommates actually is she,</v>

517
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:47.710
she's very open about mental health and she's actually thinking about going into

518
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.590
becoming a psychotherapist.
Um,

519
00:29:49.591 --> 00:29:52.510
and she read that piece and was really happy that she saw that piece,

520
00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:56.890
like solid Gary's piece because she is excited about the prospect of people

521
00:29:56.891 --> 00:30:00.310
coming to terms with that and being able to openly share that maybe they're not

522
00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:04.250
done overcoming it yet and that they're starting to seek help.
Um,

523
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.450
and just seek a community to have that conversation with was really interesting.

524
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.960
Um,
but there are other seems within the first issue that really resonated with

525
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:13.870
folks to,
um,
there's one in particular about,

526
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.220
I'm an Indian American woman who renounced her Indian citizenship to take on US

527
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:19.660
citizenship.
Oh,
interest.

528
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:22.150
And she talks about that struggle all her life growing up,

529
00:30:22.151 --> 00:30:24.280
wanting to be American and wanting to go to prom.

530
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.100
I owe it to driving a range rover with their friends going to the mall.

531
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:30.700
And then finally when it comes down to it and she has to renounce her Indian

532
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:31.960
citizenship,
uh,

533
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:35.770
she feels this overwhelming sense of sadness that she has to let go of a part of

534
00:30:35.771 --> 00:30:39.730
a culture,
a part of herself that for a long time she was pushing aside.
Um,

535
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.290
and it doesn't matter what race you are.

536
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:44.440
Like being able to let go of something from the past to handle a lot of

537
00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:46.060
something in the future is really interesting.

538
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.020
<v 4>Yeah,
definitely.
I mean,
I already wanted to read this because like,</v>

539
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.240
that's something my family actually went through.

540
00:30:52.241 --> 00:30:56.580
My mom was originally Malaysian and after my sister was born,
she was like,
Oh,

541
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.423
I guess I'm staying,

542
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.460
but had to renounce citizenship for that.
Um,

543
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.670
so in terms of,
you know,

544
00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:10.950
the more beyond like community building,
I feel like,
you know,

545
00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:15.040
it's almost like a political act to create an Asian American magazine because

546
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:19.420
there has been so little media attention around like the Asian American

547
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:24.340
community.
Um,
do you guys see yourself as like a political force in some way?

548
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.930
That's an interesting question because when we first founded it,
I would say no.

549
00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.680
But now I would say it's inevitable.
And I personally,

550
00:31:32.681 --> 00:31:37.681
and I know a lot of the people on the slant and team has been really aware of

551
00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:39.910
just the words that we use,

552
00:31:39.911 --> 00:31:42.550
making sure that everything we say is politically correct.

553
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:47.020
Being educated and reading up as much as we can on Asian American history and

554
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:50.060
what our people have been through.
Um,

555
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:53.170
it's just inevitably tied to the political sphere.

556
00:31:53.171 --> 00:31:57.640
And so I think all of us are on that journey to becoming more politically aware

557
00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.720
and president.

558
00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.640
<v 2>Hm.
Yeah.
And everything is political these days,</v>

559
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.390
but they're not as much as you say something or don't say something.

560
00:32:05.391 --> 00:32:07.850
It's political.
Um,
and I think,
you know,

561
00:32:07.851 --> 00:32:12.590
our name is really bold and I think that's important to recognize because we're

562
00:32:12.591 --> 00:32:14.750
going to be unapologetically bold about these stories.

563
00:32:14.751 --> 00:32:17.750
And I think in year two we're really looking to do that a little bit more,

564
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.990
you know,
finding stories that really pushed the conversation,
uh,

565
00:32:20.991 --> 00:32:25.340
to be a platform for Asian Americans,
not just about Asian Americans.
Uh,
so yeah,

566
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.460
I would say that we could be a political force and the community behind us to do

567
00:32:28.461 --> 00:32:28.750
that.

568
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.200
<v 4>Right.
Do you find the community sort of divided?
I mean,</v>

569
00:32:31.201 --> 00:32:34.150
I think my impression of the Asian American communities like the,

570
00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:39.140
we have so many different issues.
Like you know,
for instance,
you know,

571
00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.940
Southeast Asian members of the community face very different issues in terms of

572
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:48.350
like racial profiling and stuff than East Asian.
Has it been hard to,

573
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.490
to create like a unifying force or a unifying voice in that sense?

574
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.480
I think that's something that we're going to be working on for years and years

575
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:58.580
to come.
Like,
we're still not there.

576
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.110
And it's about both celebrating all these differences and the different maybe

577
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:05.770
stereotypes that each group might face.
Um,

578
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:10.190
the different experiences that we all might go through and saying that even

579
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:11.840
though we have all these different experiences,

580
00:33:11.841 --> 00:33:15.560
we can still relate to each other.
Um,
can you talk a little bit about,

581
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:20.240
you mentioned the,
the choice of the name for the magazine.
Yeah.

582
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:24.290
It's funny because we didn't think it was so controversial until we actually

583
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:29.240
pushed it out there and we get comments about it all the time.
Um,
but there's,

584
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:30.920
there's a couple different meanings behind it.

585
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:34.270
One that I love to talk about is we really want to shift people's perspective.

586
00:33:34.271 --> 00:33:37.730
So putting a slant on something or putting a tilt on something and getting

587
00:33:37.731 --> 00:33:41.870
people to see things in a new light is really what the name saint it is about.

588
00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:45.380
And the fact that it's unapologetically bold and we want to spark those

589
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:46.131
conversations.

590
00:33:46.131 --> 00:33:50.240
Our Name is definitely a conversation starter and something that leads to deeper

591
00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:51.320
conversations.

592
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.410
<v 2>Um,
another thing you had touched on earlier,</v>

593
00:33:53.411 --> 00:33:56.530
it's like the nuance and the diversity of the Asian American communities.

594
00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.060
So the term slanted is often used as a blanket term,
uh,

595
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.530
to characterize all Asian Americans.
Uh,

596
00:34:02.531 --> 00:34:05.890
but that's not fair because the origins actually come from East Asian features.

597
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:06.371
Um,

598
00:34:06.371 --> 00:34:10.060
so what we wanted to do was reclaimed this term and to actually make it a term

599
00:34:10.061 --> 00:34:14.200
that we can celebrate.
Um,
and so that's a little bit about what we are about,

600
00:34:14.201 --> 00:34:16.700
which is celebrating Asian American diversity and identity.

601
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:20.470
So we wanted a name to characterize that and when we first started actually half

602
00:34:20.471 --> 00:34:24.610
the team was not onboard with this name.
Um,
there we had funny names,

603
00:34:24.611 --> 00:34:28.570
we had it all cutesy names,
a lot of food related related ones.
Um,

604
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.470
and now I don't even think twice about it.
Now.
I love that term so much.

605
00:34:32.471 --> 00:34:34.330
I don't even think about the derogatory nature of it.

606
00:34:34.331 --> 00:34:35.780
And I think that speaks a lot to what

607
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.840
<v 4>we're trying to accomplish.</v>

608
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.850
Did you follow it all that there was a lawsuit related to this name?
Yeah.

609
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.070
Does anyone want to explain more context on that?

610
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:49.130
<v 5>Essentially there is like this Asian American rock band called the slants and</v>

611
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.520
they were trying to trademark their name and um,

612
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:56.450
the patent and trademark office wouldn't allow it because they said it was

613
00:34:56.451 --> 00:35:00.560
discriminatory,
discriminatory towards Asians and they were like,

614
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.230
but we're Asian and we want it.

615
00:35:03.231 --> 00:35:07.760
So like isn't this a freedom of speech situation?
And eventually,

616
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:12.140
and it weirdly happened to be at the same time of launch,

617
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.490
the supreme court ruled in their favor and the favor of the slants so that they

618
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:21.350
could have that name trademarked and take back ownership the way that we are.

619
00:35:21.351 --> 00:35:23.900
But it was so funny cause everyone was like,
have you heard,

620
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:25.850
is this from the same thing?
And we're like,
no,

621
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:29.360
it's like purely coincidental but I think,
you know,
it kind of,

622
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.380
it just even,
it provides even more support for it because it's,

623
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.980
it's just like the universes.
Yeah.
The university in that favor.
And actually

624
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.890
<v 2>it was funny because we want to say that we're friends with them now because we</v>

625
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:43.260
support each other.
We talked about them on our Instagram.

626
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.880
They gave us a shout out as well.

627
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.210
I think it's again speaking to the power of the communities that when you find

628
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:52.290
something or people who understand what what you're going through or they just

629
00:35:52.291 --> 00:35:54.930
get it,
um,
there's like an unspoken relationship

630
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.110
<v 4>ship there that I think keeps blossoming.
That was interesting.</v>

631
00:35:58.111 --> 00:36:01.710
I remember thinking of the case itself is really interesting as well because you

632
00:36:01.711 --> 00:36:03.930
know there was this freedom of speech idea of like well are you allowed to

633
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:04.800
reclaim this term?

634
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.430
But I did see someone bring up alternatively that because the supreme court

635
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.320
decided in favor of that band that also the Washington Redskins get to keep

636
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:16.500
their name as well.
I have a double edge.
Yeah.

637
00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:20.570
<v 5>It's interesting cause I was like rewatching this Trevor Noah segment on it last</v>

638
00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:24.290
night where the patent office basically told the slants like if you weren't

639
00:36:24.291 --> 00:36:27.380
Asian you would be able to trademark this name.

640
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.680
But because you're Asian it gives the con the discriminatory context and the guy

641
00:36:33.081 --> 00:36:34.730
who was like hosting the segment,
it was basically like,

642
00:36:34.731 --> 00:36:39.731
so in saying that like this is a,

643
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.370
like they're trying to protect you from racial discrimination.

644
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.370
They discriminated against racially.

645
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.410
How does that make sense?

646
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.430
<v 4>Yeah,
the world's a crazy place.
Right?</v>

647
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.550
It's so funny.
Um,
so what about um,
you know,

648
00:36:57.551 --> 00:37:02.551
kind of transitioning from the Redskins away from horrible UN-PC things too.

649
00:37:03.941 --> 00:37:07.120
Like how do you guys feel you've been trying to reach across the aisle to maybe

650
00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.370
other minority groups and stuff as well?

651
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.240
So I think that's where our partnerships partnerships come in.

652
00:37:13.241 --> 00:37:17.090
We've been going to a lot of events and meeting other people of color in this

653
00:37:17.091 --> 00:37:22.091
space and figuring out what we can do next year to create more community spaces

654
00:37:22.271 --> 00:37:24.610
that are inclusive of all races.

655
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.800
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

656
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.820
Specifically I was telling the team over the weekend about people of color and

657
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:33.360
solidarity storytelling event that I had been to in Brooklyn of course Brooklyn,

658
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.950
um,
two weeks ago.

659
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.400
And it was interesting to have a conversation of what people of color really

660
00:37:38.401 --> 00:37:40.980
means a traditionally,
and these personally,

661
00:37:40.981 --> 00:37:44.250
I never felt like I fit into that category of a person of color.

662
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:49.290
And it was actually hosted by folks who have Latin American roots and they had a

663
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:53.070
very interesting take on this too.
They were quiet for a lot of the session,

664
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.490
a lot of the storytelling session.
And one of them came forward and said,

665
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.170
I'm sorry,
I'm so quiet.
Um,

666
00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.100
it's because for the first time I'm realizing that I wasn't including Asian

667
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.390
Americans in this conversation.

668
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.600
I wasn't including them in this conversation of what people of color really

669
00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:10.380
means.
Um,
and I really appreciated that honesty and that vulnerability.

670
00:38:10.381 --> 00:38:12.030
And that's something that we believe in too.

671
00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:15.060
And I think it's good for us to keep ourselves accountable and honest.

672
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.280
And when we say Asian American,
what does that mean?

673
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:19.830
And when we say immigrant story,
what does that mean?
Um,

674
00:38:19.831 --> 00:38:23.280
I think it's going to be a constant learning opportunity for us and a great way

675
00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:25.080
for us to see honest with ourselves.

676
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:29.610
<v 4>Do you see that separation of the Asian American community from other people of</v>

677
00:38:29.611 --> 00:38:34.611
color as like imposed on us by other groups or something we impose on ourselves?

678
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.670
<v 2>Um,
I imagine it's both.
Yeah.
I think,
you know,</v>

679
00:38:39.671 --> 00:38:41.710
there's all the stereotypes about Asian Americans,
right?

680
00:38:41.711 --> 00:38:44.320
That were quiet that we don't like to speak up for things.

681
00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:48.050
We stay in the foreground or the background.
Um,

682
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.560
I'm seeing every day that that's changing.
I mean,
and again,

683
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:51.970
there's a piece in our issue,

684
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:54.970
one that talks about the political uprising of Asian Americans were,

685
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.970
a lot of times folks in the government ignore us as a voting group.

686
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
They don't think that we like to vote,
um,
that we have a voice.

687
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:05.020
And so they oversee us or they neglect us.
Um,
you know,

688
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:07.840
so some of it may be true a little bit where we're not going to be speaking up

689
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:09.970
as much as we would like,
but I think that's changing.

690
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.690
And I think given the election and this fire that we've all been lit underneath

691
00:39:13.691 --> 00:39:16.480
us to do something is really changing that course.

692
00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.650
<v 4>Tell us a little bit about like,
you know,</v>

693
00:39:18.651 --> 00:39:21.410
you chose this theme of like beginnings for the first issue.

694
00:39:21.411 --> 00:39:23.760
I'd love to hear a little bit about,
you know,

695
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:27.230
what that means to you and also what you kind of see as being the next theme

696
00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:28.064
going forward.

697
00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.530
So beginnings was a natural theme for us because it was issue one.

698
00:39:33.531 --> 00:39:37.070
So this was sort of the beginning of what slanted was,

699
00:39:37.071 --> 00:39:38.570
but I think for a lot of the team,

700
00:39:38.571 --> 00:39:42.590
it slanted was a creative outlet for us to explore our own identities.

701
00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.000
I know for me personally,

702
00:39:44.001 --> 00:39:47.840
I grew up in a predominantly white community and I didn't start thinking about

703
00:39:47.841 --> 00:39:50.270
my Asian American identity until after college,

704
00:39:50.271 --> 00:39:55.220
which is crazy because all of my formative years have already passed.
So for me,

705
00:39:55.221 --> 00:39:59.000
slant has been a personal awakening of discovering who I am and my cultural

706
00:39:59.001 --> 00:40:02.600
heritage.
And I think a lot of the team was along the same vein.

707
00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.060
They were discovering something about themselves too.

708
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.500
<v 3>Okay.</v>

709
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.220
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean,</v>

710
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:10.910
beginnings for me was interesting too because I grew up in the opposite

711
00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:13.880
situation where my neighborhood was predominantly Asian.

712
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.990
My high school was 64% Asian growing up.
So I never felt like a minority.

713
00:40:17.991 --> 00:40:20.480
I went to Berkeley,
which was also full of Asians.

714
00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:24.130
It wasn't actually until I moved to New York about three years ago,
uh,

715
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.380
that I felt like an other,
or I felt like a minority,

716
00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.700
which to I guess not New Yorkers seems kind of crazy.
It's such a diverse place.

717
00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.670
Um,
but you know,
the conversations I was having with friends,

718
00:40:34.671 --> 00:40:36.410
a lot of whom are in the audience today,

719
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.280
I'm talking about our different experiences really made me realize that all of

720
00:40:40.281 --> 00:40:41.450
our beginnings are so different,

721
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.230
but we share a lot of values and I really wanted to explore that with this

722
00:40:45.231 --> 00:40:46.064
project.

723
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.310
<v 5>Yeah.
I think also the theme as you'll like read the pieces and the issue,
uh,</v>

724
00:40:51.311 --> 00:40:54.150
beginning mean something different to everyone.
So it's not even,

725
00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:58.590
it's not even necessarily like the beginning of you like welcoming your heritage

726
00:40:58.591 --> 00:41:01.830
or realizing that you know,
you do fit in or you don't fit in.

727
00:41:01.831 --> 00:41:06.831
It's like beginning to form a tight relationship with your mother or like the

728
00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:09.510
beginning of when you first immigrated to America.

729
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.940
It means something different for everyone.

730
00:41:11.941 --> 00:41:15.600
And I think to be able to explore that was really cool to see how everyone

731
00:41:15.601 --> 00:41:16.434
interpreted it.

732
00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:22.180
<v 4>Have you ever had any negative feedback from people?
Yeah,</v>

733
00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:27.430
definitely.
Um,
as you said,
like whether we intend for it or not,

734
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:31.600
everything is political.
So we've gotten negative feedback about our name,

735
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.793
um,

736
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.820
<v 2>pushing the envelope.
Um,
but you know,</v>

737
00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:37.940
even it's not as much negative as it is constructive criticism.

738
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:42.530
So we are very open to feedback and we definitely ask people that we talked to

739
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:46.480
as mentors,
as visors,
as friends,
and tell us how we can up our game.
Um,

740
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.120
and so with a content perspective,
people really liked how relatable it was,

741
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.610
but they were like,
well,
given how bold your name is,

742
00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:54.810
could you push the content a little bit further?
Um,

743
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.750
are there any other topics that you could explore?

744
00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.500
And I think that's great because we're so new and we're so open to the evolution

745
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.110
and just,
you know,
we've only been around for less than a year,

746
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:05.120
so I can only imagine what's going to happen

747
00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.450
<v 4>years two to five.
Yeah.
And that's,</v>

748
00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:12.160
that's another thing that I would love for slanted to work on is the fact that

749
00:42:12.161 --> 00:42:17.161
we do get constructive criticism shouldn't stop anyone from talking about race.

750
00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.360
Like it is very scary to talk about race.

751
00:42:19.361 --> 00:42:21.760
You always need to be politically correct.
You know,

752
00:42:21.761 --> 00:42:23.920
you need to be educated about what's going on,

753
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:28.420
which oftentimes prevents people from being open about talking about it.

754
00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.210
But if we don't talk about it,
we're not going to get anywhere.

755
00:42:31.211 --> 00:42:34.480
So we really need to make it more accessible for people to talk about these

756
00:42:34.481 --> 00:42:39.130
really difficult things and just be confident in where they are in their own

757
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.810
journeys.
Definitely.
Um,
let's take a question from over there.

758
00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:47.050
<v 2>Thank you guys so much for coming.
It's truly inspiring.</v>

759
00:42:47.051 --> 00:42:49.600
I will 100% be purchasing.
My first issue.

760
00:42:49.601 --> 00:42:52.270
I was just thinking is the perfect gift for my little sister.

761
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.580
She's also half Asian,
so like similar to me.
Um,
no really.

762
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.070
Um,
but um,

763
00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:05.860
my question is kind of about the right at the story gathering piece and how you

764
00:43:05.861 --> 00:43:09.910
guys actually get,
um,
stories.
Do you guys,
you know,
just wait for them to come in.

765
00:43:09.911 --> 00:43:14.470
Do you guys put certain posts out and you know,
on top of that,
how does it,

766
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.500
um,
choosing the stories to go with a certain three theme?

767
00:43:17.501 --> 00:43:18.550
What does that process like?

768
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:20.890
<v 4>You want me to start?
Sure.</v>

769
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.870
<v 2>Um,
so,
you know,
like Kat said,
we love Google.</v>

770
00:43:23.871 --> 00:43:25.760
We literally live and die off of Google.

771
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:29.530
So we use a Google form to collect story ideas.
Um,

772
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.390
a lot of the stories actually didn't end up the way they started,

773
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.480
which we think is a really beautiful process and we want to do more of that next

774
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.260
year actually workshopping the stories with people.
Um,
but we asked for an idea,

775
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.110
we ask again for their objective,
what they want to achieve with it,

776
00:43:42.111 --> 00:43:45.740
what's the key message.
Um,
and to get the word out,
it was friends,

777
00:43:45.741 --> 00:43:50.630
family and fools and posting it in community groups on Facebook.
So,
you know,

778
00:43:50.631 --> 00:43:54.500
going into Asian American interest groups,
posting on there,
you know,

779
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:58.400
project boat,
which we initially started as a support group,
alumni networks,

780
00:43:58.401 --> 00:44:01.950
basically anyone that we thought would,
might be interested.
Um,

781
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.470
the first two weeks were very slow.

782
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.650
We were really worried that we weren't going to get anyone to contribute.
Um,

783
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.440
and I don't know,
something just happened.
I think word of mouth,
you know,

784
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:14.420
it's a very grassroots movement.
And again,
out of the 21 contributors,

785
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:18.640
we only need seven of them beforehand.
So it's,

786
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:22.280
we're hoping that next year is probably a little bit more strategic in that

787
00:44:22.281 --> 00:44:22.611
sense.

788
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:25.730
Hopefully our name is a little bit out there and we can come out to events like

789
00:44:25.731 --> 00:44:29.090
these and meet more people who'd be interested in sharing their stories.

790
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.040
Definitely.
Thank you.
How should reach you if

791
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.720
<v 4>they see this talk for example on our youtube channel and they want to be a part</v>

792
00:44:36.721 --> 00:44:37.501
of it.
Yeah.

793
00:44:37.501 --> 00:44:41.850
So you can visit our website@slanted.media and we're opening the submission

794
00:44:41.851 --> 00:44:43.920
window for issue two in January.

795
00:44:43.921 --> 00:44:47.220
So you can either send them to our newsletter to get an update or just find us

796
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:50.760
on social media.
We'll be very loud when the window opened.
And so,
you know,

797
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:53.220
to come and submit your story.
Is it all,

798
00:44:53.221 --> 00:44:58.221
I'm like sort of personal essay pieces or are there like poems,

799
00:44:58.561 --> 00:45:02.850
journalistic pieces,
anything like that?
It's a variety.
So we have short stories.

800
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:05.550
Just kidding.
We don't have short stories.
We have short pieces.

801
00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:09.960
We have how it tree photography,
art.
Um,
it's,

802
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.490
it spans all genres.
Anything that can be printed.
Awesome.

803
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:17.140
Um,
what about over here?
Yeah,

804
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.430
<v 7>I just want to say thank you again for sharing your piece.
Gary.</v>

805
00:45:20.431 --> 00:45:21.810
Like I was very touched by it.
Um,

806
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:27.110
I'm a Chinese psychologists so I feel very strongly about raising awareness for

807
00:45:27.211 --> 00:45:27.970
Asian American.

808
00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:32.970
So I was wondering if you guys have any like plans or needing contributors or

809
00:45:33.421 --> 00:45:37.590
like,
you know,
um,
ways to kind of bring the awareness to the general community.

810
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:41.310
Cause I,
you know,
I think we all know that,
um,
Asian Americans tend to,
um,

811
00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.690
solve problems in their own house and like,
I think,
um,
needing to reach to them,

812
00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:47.580
it's still like there's still a huge gap.

813
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.890
So it was wondering if you have any thoughts on that?

814
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:54.360
<v 2>Uh,
yeah.
I mean,
I think we're exploring that,
but again,
we're a creative platform,</v>

815
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:57.750
so how could we explore the difficult topics of mental health from a creative

816
00:45:57.751 --> 00:46:01.230
perspective?
So could we host writing workshops or,
you know,

817
00:46:01.231 --> 00:46:03.810
town hall discussions about this?
I think,
uh,

818
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.480
we can't do it alone and we're definitely not experts in this field.

819
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:09.510
So we would love to partner with people who have experience in the mental health

820
00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:13.440
space to help us create some,
a place that's safe.
Um,
you know,

821
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:15.480
that's irrelevant and meaningful for these people.

822
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.010
<v 0>Yeah,
I feel like being,
being so involved with the arts,</v>

823
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:23.690
I've realized there's a lot of artists and a lot of creative types that have

824
00:46:23.691 --> 00:46:28.280
mental illness and I,
I don't know if they go hand in hand,
but,
uh,

825
00:46:28.281 --> 00:46:30.320
when I first posted my story on Instagram,
I've,

826
00:46:30.321 --> 00:46:34.680
I was really surprised by the outpour outpouring of support,
uh,

827
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:39.110
an interest in these sorts of stories and a lot of direct messages just saying,

828
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.980
Hey,
this is,
you know,
thank you for sharing this.
Uh,

829
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:46.490
I've dealt with depression myself.
My sister's dealt with depression,
depression,

830
00:46:46.491 --> 00:46:49.280
whatever it may be.
They all had their own stories.
And again,

831
00:46:49.281 --> 00:46:52.840
I think this is a great platform to,
to actually get the word out and,
uh,

832
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.230
with peripheral topics like mental illness,
this is again,

833
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.040
a good grounding and foundation for,
for those discussions.
I have a car,

834
00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:06.260
<v 8>couple questions about,
uh,
contributing.
The first one is,
uh,</v>

835
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.820
I just visited an Asian American lit class,
uh,

836
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:15.620
at a high school yesterday and they were all really engaging writers.

837
00:47:15.621 --> 00:47:18.830
So I want to know if there's an age limit to being a contributor.

838
00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.140
<v 4>We have not put an age limit.
Um,</v>

839
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:24.810
it's something we could consider,

840
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:28.770
but right now anybody is open to con to submitting.

841
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.250
And then so along

842
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:30.641
<v 9>with that,</v>

843
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:34.690
does that mean that you have to identify as Asian American to contribute?

844
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.090
That might be an obvious question,
but maybe not.

845
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.710
<v 4>So all of our issue,
one contributors were Asian American,</v>

846
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:46.711
but we would be open to all any race contributing as long as it aligns with our

847
00:47:48.011 --> 00:47:51.470
mission.
And aligns with the theme of issue too.
There.

848
00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.620
I think it depends on what the narrative.
Yeah.

849
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.770
<v 2>Hmm.
And I think too,
you know,</v>

850
00:47:55.771 --> 00:47:59.770
you bring up a good point about talking to potentially a younger audience.
Um,

851
00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.790
the team struggled too.
We tried to figure out who is our target audience.

852
00:48:02.791 --> 00:48:05.040
You know,
Asian American is so big.
Um,

853
00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:07.860
so millennials were obviously an easy target because we're all millennials.

854
00:48:07.861 --> 00:48:11.020
But there are so many interesting stories coming out,
um,

855
00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:12.900
from high schoolers and even younger.

856
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.900
And so how could we go into universities and high schools to have this kind of

857
00:48:15.901 --> 00:48:16.591
conversation?

858
00:48:16.591 --> 00:48:20.010
So we would be really interested in meeting people and the younger demographic

859
00:48:20.011 --> 00:48:23.280
to see what issues they're dealing with and how can we give them a space to

860
00:48:23.281 --> 00:48:24.114
share that.

861
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.080
<v 9>All right.
Thanks for being here.
And uh,
good luck on your,</v>

862
00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:30.480
on all do the work you're going to be doing.
Um,
so the,

863
00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:35.300
the topic about translating submissions reminded me of a story of my grandfather

864
00:48:35.301 --> 00:48:39.200
started an academic journal in Korea about I guess nearly 50 years ago now.

865
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.560
And when he started it,
he just simply wanted,
um,

866
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:47.660
people to submit articles written in English so that people outside of Korea,

867
00:48:47.661 --> 00:48:51.530
academics,
I'll set a Korea,
could read it and understand what's going on.
Um,

868
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:56.680
so I guess it just brought one thing is that there's so many different agent,

869
00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:01.760
uh,
I guess American languages that English is just happens to be a uniform,

870
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:04.460
something that is in common.
So,
um,

871
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:08.690
I guess sometimes things get lost in translation and maybe the,

872
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.530
if the submission is written in the language they're most comfortable with,
um,

873
00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.750
and,
but,
uh,
that might be ideal,
but I hope,

874
00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:19.930
I guess for maybe the majority of people it would be,
I guess just English.
Um,

875
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.400
and,
um,
the second question I had,

876
00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:25.510
do you guys do anything with like the museums,

877
00:49:25.511 --> 00:49:28.700
like the Museum of Chinese American and things like that in this city?

878
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:32.040
<v 4>Yeah,
we actually had our launch party at the Museum of Chinese America and we're</v>

879
00:49:32.041 --> 00:49:33.150
stock there as well.

880
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.660
And we're definitely looking to partner with other museums and other Asian

881
00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.800
American organizations.

882
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.340
<v 2>Yeah.
And,
um,
came,
what was your first question?</v>

883
00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.340
<v 9>Oh,
it wasn't more of a question hearing about,
yeah,</v>

884
00:49:43.341 --> 00:49:46.720
just how like is simply my grandfather also started,
I guess,

885
00:49:46.721 --> 00:49:50.440
something like a Zeen back in jail for political science articles.
It's,

886
00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:55.400
it's called a Korea observer and it's like,
you know,
all the articles in English.

887
00:49:55.401 --> 00:49:59.090
So that's his,
cause he wanted the audience to be broader than just,
you know,

888
00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.570
people and create,
just so you know.
So everybody,
yes.

889
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.410
<v 4>I think that,
um,</v>

890
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:06.590
topic of translation has really interesting and like obviously something that

891
00:50:06.591 --> 00:50:08.870
we're excited about exploring,
but we don't want to,

892
00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.390
we want to be able to do it right.
We,
you know,

893
00:50:11.391 --> 00:50:15.140
we want to be able to do the pieces justice because if it is lost in translation

894
00:50:15.141 --> 00:50:16.890
then like what's the point in it?

895
00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.410
<v 9>I'm doing good.
Good luck with it.
Thank you.</v>

896
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.020
<v 2>Awesome.
Um,</v>

897
00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:28.790
<v 4>I think we didn't actually touch on like thoughts for the issue like Oh</v>

898
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.530
<v 2>yeah,
yeah.
Um,</v>

899
00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.930
funny you ask because we just had our kickoff over the weekend to start thinking

900
00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:38.200
about issue too.
Gotcha.
Um,
we haven't narrowed on a theme yet,

901
00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.140
but our creative team did a really great job in the prompt.

902
00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.900
So the prompt was wishes and wonders.
Um,

903
00:50:43.901 --> 00:50:47.590
so thinking about reflecting on this past year or almost a year,

904
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:49.840
what do we wish we had covered?
Um,

905
00:50:49.841 --> 00:50:52.540
what are we wondering about still today about race and identity?

906
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.720
And there were a whole swath of different options.

907
00:50:55.721 --> 00:50:58.730
We had stuff that was very universal to like what they call,

908
00:50:58.731 --> 00:51:03.280
like the dark horse theme.
Very,
very niche,
very,
very specific.

909
00:51:03.281 --> 00:51:07.600
And a little bit controversial.
Hmm.
Um,
I think,
Huh?
Your rock,
your wax,

910
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.053
what?
Yeah,

911
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.910
it's a wide range and I think we're going to land somewhere in the middle.

912
00:51:12.911 --> 00:51:14.470
I think,
um,
you know,

913
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.280
we want a theme that's universal enough that people can interpret on their own

914
00:51:18.281 --> 00:51:21.970
and make it their own.
Um,
but we also want something that's not generic.

915
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:27.280
<v 4>And I think two things that we're looking for in this next round is as Christy</v>

916
00:51:27.281 --> 00:51:28.930
mentioned,
pushing the envelope a little bit.

917
00:51:28.931 --> 00:51:30.640
So because these are everyday stories,

918
00:51:30.641 --> 00:51:34.870
how can we elevate them and make sure that they're worth the buzz and worth

919
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.270
sparking those larger conversations.

920
00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.300
And another thing is making things a bit lighter.

921
00:51:40.301 --> 00:51:45.301
So is one was leaned on the more heavier side,

922
00:51:46.451 --> 00:51:50.750
which is normal because the experiences that we've had that we face,

923
00:51:50.751 --> 00:51:53.170
so the Asian Americans are on the heavier side.

924
00:51:53.171 --> 00:51:57.760
But how can we bring a sense of fun and playfulness back into talking about

925
00:51:57.761 --> 00:52:02.470
these really heavy topics will be interesting for us to explore.
Yeah,
definitely.

926
00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.800
Um,
we're almost at time.
So my last question is going to be,
you know,

927
00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:10.090
we obviously want to sell us on those magazines in the back.
You guys,
um,

928
00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.030
how would you pitch the magazine to a non Asian audience?

929
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:14.870
<v 3>Oh,</v>

930
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:15.720
<v 2>it's a great question.</v>

931
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.080
<v 5>I mean,
I feel like</v>

932
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.220
part of the appeal is that it's fun.
I don't know,

933
00:52:25.221 --> 00:52:28.400
like I'm not explaining myself right,
but I think that like,

934
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.490
so my inlaws are not Asian,

935
00:52:31.491 --> 00:52:36.170
but they were just so excited that I was doing something like this with my

936
00:52:36.171 --> 00:52:39.800
friends and they were like telling all their friends and like they were buying

937
00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:40.521
all these books.

938
00:52:40.521 --> 00:52:45.521
And I think that just the fact that it's part of a movement that has pieces that

939
00:52:46.821 --> 00:52:48.080
like everyone can relate to,

940
00:52:48.081 --> 00:52:51.950
I think everyone can relate to at some point feeling like they don't belong

941
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:56.951
somewhere or wishing that they were different or connecting to their heritage.

942
00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:02.600
I think that everyone has some sort of connection with what we're doing,

943
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.660
which in a way like helps sell itself.

944
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:09.460
<v 2>I think it's anchored in human emotion.
Um,
you know,</v>

945
00:53:09.461 --> 00:53:14.320
there's themes about sacrifice,
about love,
about realization,
actualization.

946
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:18.790
Like these are themes that transcend race.
Um,
so I would say it's just a fun,

947
00:53:18.791 --> 00:53:22.810
creative outlet for people to read stories and learn something about themselves

948
00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.040
or learn something about another culture.
And who doesn't want to do

949
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.810
<v 6>that in this day and age,
given what's going on.</v>
