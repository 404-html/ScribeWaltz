Thank you.

23
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.890
<v 1>Thanks.
Hi everyone.
Thanks so much for coming.</v>

24
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.310
Um,
so I'll begin a little bit with my story.

25
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.140
I was 22 years old when I graduated from college.

26
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.940
I was living in New York City and working in Deutsche Bank and I was doing

27
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:54.230
fairly well for myself,
but I wasn't satisfied.

28
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.840
I couldn't exactly pinpoint what it was,

29
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.800
but I felt like I was missing something.
So everyday during lunch,

30
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.790
in between meetings,

31
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:07.230
I would go on Wikipedia and I'd start reading about my favorite artist,

32
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.980
who they were,
where did they start,
what were their struggles,

33
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:16.120
where are they now?
And their stories will always inspire me.

34
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.590
I wanted to do something different,
but I was worried about changing careers.

35
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.480
Is it all right?
Is it too late?

36
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.160
These were the kinds of questions that were occupying my mind and even though I

37
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:31.840
was part of the corporate world,

38
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.620
I could not stay away from the music and entertainment industry.

39
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.130
So I decided to be a parttime entity and [inaudible] reporter for a couple of

40
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:44.850
leading for actually one leading South Asian channels in New York.

41
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.690
And my day job would be working on Wall Street and during evenings and weekends

42
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:54.970
I would cover all kinds of entertainment events in New York,

43
00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:59.260
ranging from movie premiers to concerts to festivals.

44
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.350
I loved into being great artist and I loved learning about their journeys.

45
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.100
So I got a chance to interview some amazing artists like Ara man Suneet each Aha

46
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:13.030
and recover the Raj,

47
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.380
she [inaudible] Shabana Azmi and three hours of walking at Deutsche Bank I

48
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:23.320
realized that,
um,

49
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.800
I got this red award red employee award and I figured I'll probably be promoted

50
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:31.780
soon.
And then guess what I did,

51
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.850
I quit and accomplishment led me to pull back.

52
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.621
Now everyone,

53
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:43.621
including my family thought it was a ridiculous move because let's think about

54
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:44.111
it.

55
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:49.111
I had just quit a golden career on Wall Street to pursue a dream that wasn't

56
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:54.040
even clear to me and I didn't know what I wanted to do,

57
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.620
but I certainly knew what I did not want.

58
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.520
So I had quit to discover my passion and once I quit I was like this coil

59
00:04:03.381 --> 00:04:06.400
spring.
I wanted to be everywhere and do everything.

60
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.580
So I tried a lot of different things.

61
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.810
By that time I was an entertainment reporter for a couple of South Asian

62
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:17.680
channels in New York.
I was an audio book narrator.

63
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.440
I started writing and composing for short and independent feature films and I

64
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.870
went to graduate school to study media.

65
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.920
So it was a very exciting and a very chaotic time.

66
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.320
And during this time I was interviewing Mira and I are who I'm sure many of you

67
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:39.940
know,
she's an Oscar winning film director,
known for movies like namesake,

68
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.250
monsoon,
wedding Salaam Bombay.

69
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.810
And I got a chance to be her music intern.

70
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.300
She was working on monsoon wedding,
the musical,
a Broadway show in New York City.

71
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.580
And when I was working with are,

72
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:59.581
I realize that passions are supposed to be pursued full time if you're doing it

73
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:05.530
on the site and it's just a hobby.
I was passionate about,

74
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.420
you know,
music and Bollywood,

75
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.430
but I was running away from it because I thought it was a different world.

76
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:13.720
It's a distant dream,

77
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.430
but my husband was very supportive and so I packed my bags and I took off to

78
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.140
Mumbai to try my luck in Bollywood.

79
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.400
I had only two friends in Mumbai.
Yeah,

80
00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:29.980
I didn't know anyone in the music industry,
but I was like,

81
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.450
let's see what happens.
So for the next four years,

82
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.460
I did a lot of back and forth between Mumbai in Chicago and it was very

83
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:43.240
stressful.
I have a shuffling between two continents.

84
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.680
I have to completely different identities,
completely different lives,

85
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.900
completely different group of friends.

86
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.510
And I remember it was a hot summer afternoon and I was riding and Eric shower,

87
00:05:55.511 --> 00:06:00.511
which is a a way good without specify doors or windows.

88
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.320
And I'm coming back after meeting of Bollywood film producer and as usual I'm

89
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.490
stuck in traffic and outside.

90
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.110
I could see these kids playing on the street now,

91
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:16.380
the games that people playing with the games that I used to play in India when I

92
00:06:16.381 --> 00:06:17.730
was growing up in Delhi,

93
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.510
and it was so nostalgic that I just started singing this melody and the lyrics

94
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:25.140
just flowed with it.
Yeah.

95
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.910
So I quickly took out my iPhone and in the midst of Mr. Moon [inaudible]

96
00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:34.830
traffic,
I started singing the song as it was being created in my mind.

97
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.360
Okay?
And that's how the song,
but when happened,

98
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.510
the word budge fund means childhood.
Okay?

99
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.680
And this song talks about all the fun games used to place kids in.
However,

100
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:49.810
Edd was filled with fun and laughter.

101
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.320
<v 3>Okay,
cool,</v>

102
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.970
<v 4>buddy.

103
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.443

104
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.580

105
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.160

110

Yay.

111
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.993

112

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.600
<v 4>Gotcha.

114
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.680

Yeah.

123
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.580
What'd you find [inaudible]

124
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.640
to play?
Oh,

125
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:52.690
fun to play it.
Love.

126
00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.473
<v 6>Thank you.</v>

127
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.910
<v 1>So when I was in Mumbai,
I did get some success.</v>

128
00:11:03.911 --> 00:11:08.200
I go to compose for two prestigious digital studios.
Why films?

129
00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:09.890
Which is part of Yerf.
Yeah.

130
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.360
Chage fins and Dvf the viral fever.

131
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.483
<v 6>Yeah.
Okay.</v>

132
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.120
<v 1>I also compose for the National Award winning film director,
Nila Ma.</v>

133
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:21.360
The founder was known for his film I am column.

134
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.400
<v 6>Okay.</v>

135
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.690
<v 1>But I was spending more time networking than actually creating music and it</v>

136
00:11:26.691 --> 00:11:28.640
wasn't creatively satisfying.

137
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:29.680
<v 6>Okay.</v>

138
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.930
<v 1>So I decided to move back to Chicago.</v>

139
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.680
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

140
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.910
<v 1>And be with my husband.</v>

141
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:35.340
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

142
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.460
<v 1>no.
During these four years between Mumbai in Chicago,</v>

143
00:11:38.461 --> 00:11:41.880
I had created a lot of songs and these songs.

144
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:45.110
What about my personal life?
About my Jelonese,

145
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.180
my expediencies being in Mumbai,
in staying there,

146
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.190
and these were not really songs that I was pitching to Bollywood and producers.

147
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:56.800
These were just songs that I created for myself.

148
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.220
I knew that Chicago has a great jazz scene and these songs,

149
00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.410
I had created a nice swing to them,

150
00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:08.100
so I forgot maybe they could work well with jazz.

151
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.930
So I posted on Facebook that I'm looking for jazz musicians in Chicago,

152
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.690
and a bunch of people replied.

153
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.730
And through them I got connected to folks in the jazz community.

154
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.170
Initially the idea was just to take two songs,

155
00:12:25.171 --> 00:12:27.740
put them out there and see what happens.
Still,

156
00:12:27.741 --> 00:12:29.450
I figured out what I want to do next.

157
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.890
So the first song that I'd created was much fun,
which you just heard.

158
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.590
And the second song was lovely.

159
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.130
I had created lovely for my love for Chai in TNT,

160
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.620
unless you would shy lover.

161
00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:48.210
And I think it's something that makes me really happy and I feel if I get my

162
00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:52.310
morning cup of Chai,
today's going to be a good deal.
So,
uh,

163
00:12:52.311 --> 00:12:53.520
so I had created the song,

164
00:12:53.521 --> 00:12:58.440
which talks about cherishing this little moments in life and seeking happiness

165
00:12:58.441 --> 00:13:00.690
in them.
And that's what lovelies about

166
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.460
<v 4>Chell cable,</v>

185
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:40.780
<v 5>Yeah.

186
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.500
Yeah.
Oh,

187
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.260
Oh,

188
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.393
<v 9>No.</v>

189
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.253
Yeah.

190
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.950
<v 5>Hello.
Hi.
You lovely.</v>

191
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.600
Yeah,

192
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.150
<v 4>no g kidding.</v>

193
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.680
Who's that?

194
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.840
Who's that Giddy?

195
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.140
<v 1>So once these songs came out,</v>

196
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.930
I got such a good response that I decided to go back to the studio and release

197
00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:35.730
some of the other songs that I'd written.

198
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.060
And one of these other songs that I'd written is called,
Oh gosh,

199
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.410
the word [inaudible] means in Greece.

200
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:49.100
And this song talks about being at a special moment with your special someone.

201
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.970
When you're with someone who you love,
you just one time to stop.

202
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.600
You don't want to think about chores or responsibilities,

203
00:17:57.601 --> 00:18:01.920
you just want to hold onto them and being there in Greece.

204
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.260
And that's what our go,
she's about

205
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:10.613
<v 6>three.</v>

206
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.173
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

207
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.790
So mean.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.343

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:27.983

<v 4>Got It.</v>

215
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.453
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

216
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.463

217
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:56.760
<v 7>Oh Shit.

218
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:57.963
Yeah.
Huh.

219
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.153
Hmm

220
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.673
<v 3>hmm.</v>

221
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:39.783
Yeah.

222
00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.030
<v 4>Oh Man.</v>

223
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.040
<v 10>Oh</v>

224
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.423
<v 7>yeah.</v>

225
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

226
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.340
<v 7>Josh Eagle.</v>

227
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:52.203
<v 4>Mine.</v>

228
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:01.243
Good.

229
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:11.900
<v 7>Oh Shit.</v>

230
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.260
<v 4>K.</v>

231
00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.480
Oh,
she became,

232
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:53.763
<v 1>thank you.</v>

233
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.520
So once these few songs released,

234
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.380
I'd only a few songs out.
And before I knew it,
I got my first gig.

235
00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:09.460
I own Indian Organization in Chicago wanted me to perform at their annual

236
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:10.444
festival.

237
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:16.530
And this was the first time that I performed publicly with my band in September,

238
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.830
2016 and the performance was well received.

239
00:23:20.831 --> 00:23:25.831
And after that I started getting more gigs and someone asks me,

240
00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:30.790
you such good songs,
why don't you create an album?
And I thought,
yeah,

241
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:31.683
why not?

242
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:37.610
So just last year I released my debut album Tan and my album release show was

243
00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:44.060
hosted at the old town school of folk music and it was cosponsored by the Co

244
00:23:44.581 --> 00:23:47.150
presented the Jazz Institute of Chicago.

245
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.200
The show was both a part of the popular world music,

246
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:55.700
Wayne's d CDs and the official jazz two 2017

247
00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:02.230
and since then I performed at a lot of venues all over the u s including New

248
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.130
York,
San Francisco,
Indiana,
Texas,
Minnesota,
Baltimore,

249
00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:11.780
DC.
And of course Chicago.
In May of this year,

250
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:15.800
I was selected as one of the five artists to be featured on the Emmy Award

251
00:24:15.801 --> 00:24:18.260
winning annual series Asian influences.

252
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.780
And I was the only artist who was invited to perform at the ABC seven studio

253
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:28.760
Chicago.
And the best thing is that they found me and reached out to me.

254
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:35.410
And just last month I performed at the prestigious Kennedy Center and it was

255
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:40.571
nothing short of a dream come true because if two years ago someone would have

256
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:45.791
told me that my debut album would be COPD presented by the Jazz Institute of

257
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.300
Chicago,

258
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.300
I would perform at the Kennedy Center at the South by southwest music festival,

259
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.560
give a Ted talk and speak and perform here at Google headquarters.
Today.

260
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.140
I would have laughed at them because I,

261
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:04.940
I never considered being a singer songwriter as a viable career option.

262
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.700
But it all happened so organically and so fast is none of it was planned.

263
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.120
There was of course a lot of hard work into play,

264
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:19.121
but most importantly it was all heart and it was all about and believing in

265
00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:21.680
yourself and what you stand for.

266
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.840
And I have a lot of belief in my songs because I,

267
00:25:25.841 --> 00:25:30.841
I genuinely write about what I feel and I try to be as vulnerable and as

268
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.010
transparent about my feelings as I can.

269
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.950
And,
uh,
I really feel that I'm a,
I'm a good songwriter because I,

270
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:44.350
I genuinely and passionately believe in it and I think that's what it's about
in,

271
00:25:44.351 --> 00:25:47.300
in believing in what you do and in feeling that passion.

272
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.240
This was December,
2016 and I was in India,
in Delhi.

273
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.490
And as some of you might know,

274
00:25:55.491 --> 00:26:00.080
the Indian government had announced the demonetization of the Indian currency

275
00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:00.914
note.

276
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.960
And what that meant was that certain Indian currency notes were banned from the

277
00:26:05.961 --> 00:26:10.670
economy and the Indian government had done this pretty much overnight.

278
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.320
The idea was to eradicate black money and corruption.

279
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.420
But what ended up happening was that there was an acute shortage of cash.

280
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.530
There will be these long lines going to the ATM machine and it would start at

281
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:28.130
7:00 AM in the morning,

282
00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:32.930
go on until 2:00 AM the next morning and then start again in a few hours.

283
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.430
And I was in India during that time and as a songwriter,

284
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.170
I wrote a song about it.

285
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:45.180
And so this next song is called Mallarme.
The word [inaudible] means cured.

286
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.280
And the song talks about finding a cure to heal society.

287
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.373
Okay,

288
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.550
<v 3>come on.</v>

289
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.210

<v 4>Nope.</v>

293
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.550
Good enough.

294

Just,

313
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.850
just snow garbage.

314
00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:07.483
They just

315
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:16.580
love it.
Her Dad

316
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:08.563
<v 5>Mckee.</v>

317
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:17.563
Nope.

318
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.350
God.

319
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.800
<v 4>Just sell.
Just sell.</v>

320
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.570
Just sell.
Gabi.

321
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:58.190
Just say,
just say,

322
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.063
Oh God.

323
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.040
<v 9>Hey Dad,</v>

324
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.460
<v 4>dad,
dad,
Dad,
Dad,</v>

325
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.670
Dad,
Dad,
dad.

326
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.553
Dad.

327
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:44.750
<v 1>Always get a little lost in the song.</v>

328
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:52.160
I think there's always a battle between the mind and the heart.
And in my case,

329
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:54.230
it's like the hard always wins.

330
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:59.450
It's almost like my heart has a mind of its own,
has its own agenda.

331
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.020
And in the beginning I would try to resist it.

332
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.340
And so it took me three couriers to realize that I wanted to be a singer

333
00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:10.970
songwriter.
But once I realized it,

334
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
I just let my heart do its thing and it took me on this amazing rollercoaster

335
00:33:16.681 --> 00:33:17.514
ride.

336
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:23.310
My musical journey and my debut album have been a very unpredictable experience.

337
00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.570
Something which might care free play,
full and naughty hearted planned for me.

338
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:34.130
And hence the name of my debut album is this carefree,
playful and naughty heart.

339
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.960
All chat on bill.

340
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.500
I want to leave you guys with two thoughts.
Firstly,

341
00:33:41.501 --> 00:33:45.010
I think it is all right not to have a plan.
In fact,

342
00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:48.520
I'd say maybe it's better not to have a plan because then your mind is free and

343
00:33:48.521 --> 00:33:50.230
you get a chance to follow your heart.

344
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.520
And so I can lead is really important to just keep trying.

345
00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:00.850
I heard this beautiful thing that goes like this in [inaudible] he will die.

346
00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:06.890
Just not,
oh sheesh.
Carnevale the van.
So in other words,

347
00:34:06.891 --> 00:34:09.230
if you keep waiting for things to happen,

348
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.500
then you will only get what the hustlers of left behind.

349
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.690
So keep trying new things.
Think outside the box,

350
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.770
follow your heart because unconventional changes the world.

351
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.350
And I'm so thrilled to announce that I'm,

352
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.270
I'll be releasing the first single of my second album.

353
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.330
The single will be out next Friday,

354
00:34:33.331 --> 00:34:36.600
which is September 14 on all digital platforms.

355
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.790
It's called Gloria.

356
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.400
The second album is going to be a very easy listening album,
which is vocals,

357
00:34:43.401 --> 00:34:47.850
guitar and drums.
And the single is called Gloria.

358
00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:52.350
And the word Korea means dog.
And what the song talks about,

359
00:34:52.351 --> 00:34:56.690
it's about a girl who's getting married and she's telling her mom that she's

360
00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.390
ready to be a bride and she's ready to take on a new role,

361
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.860
enter a new journey in her life and make new relationships.

362
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.580
And the song also touches upon all the Indian traditions,

363
00:35:08.581 --> 00:35:10.980
which are part of such auspicious occasions.

364
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.490
So we wanted to end on a happy note and here is Korea

365
00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.770
<v 4>such
as</v>

366
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:11.560
the juggle.

367
00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:21.390
Yay.

368
00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:34.250
Oh boy.
Duty

369
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:13.243
Shan.

370
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.583
Tell him

371
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:41.970
put your keys.

372
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.113
No

373
00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.350
to barking.

374
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:28.913
Yeah,

375
00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.370
no,

376
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.063
yeah,

377
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.863
yes.

378
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:26.683
Whoa,

379
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.103
Duh.

380
00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:04.663
<v 11>Thank you.</v>

381
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:08.080
<v 1>Yeah.
And uh,
that's it.
Thank you guys for listening.</v>

382
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:11.690
<v 11>I would lets me her depo.</v>

383
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.811
<v 1>So will be,</v>

384
00:40:14.811 --> 00:40:17.870
can you tell us a little bit about your journey and how you got into jazz

385
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.600
specifically and how do you get along with it now?

386
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.400
<v 11>Yes.</v>

387
00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.420
<v 1>Uh,
you know,
I have ghost.</v>

388
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:29.570
I of course had heard jazz like when I moved to Chicago and I knew Chicago is so

389
00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:32.030
awesome for Jasmine.
Um,
so I,
you know,

390
00:40:32.031 --> 00:40:35.210
I'd been to the green moves and Andy's jazz showcase,

391
00:40:35.211 --> 00:40:39.500
and I also went to the Monterey jazz festival in New Orleans.

392
00:40:39.501 --> 00:40:42.020
And so clearly I think as an artist,

393
00:40:42.021 --> 00:40:46.370
jazz was there in my subconscious mind somewhere.
But I had,

394
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:51.050
I'd never imagined to do dive into jazz.
Like that wasn't even a plan.

395
00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.710
But after,
uh,
after I moved back from Mumbai,
yeah,

396
00:40:54.711 --> 00:40:59.030
I just knew that Chicago is so good for jazz.
And I think it was just,

397
00:40:59.031 --> 00:41:02.900
I just took a John's like,
I think buch bone and lovely,
and they all had a,

398
00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.770
had a very nice swing.
So I was like,
you know,
let's try it.

399
00:41:06.771 --> 00:41:11.150
And initially it was just two songs.
And,
um,
and then I've,
you know,
I,

400
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.870
I enjoyed it and I think it was a very,
uh,
challenging,

401
00:41:14.871 --> 00:41:18.020
it's an AA challenging John Doe in general,
but for me,

402
00:41:18.021 --> 00:41:20.330
because I come from an Indian background,

403
00:41:20.331 --> 00:41:24.410
I'm used to Indian music or Bollywood jazz was they different.

404
00:41:24.411 --> 00:41:27.260
So for me to I to learn about jazz,

405
00:41:27.261 --> 00:41:29.900
I had to learn about improvisation and foam,

406
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:33.950
which improvisation is very new to me because as pop,
you know,

407
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:36.860
you don't really improvise.
It's just,
you know,
the intro is,
and you know,

408
00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:39.230
the music interviews and you come in when you have to come in.

409
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.830
So I think all those things where it was,

410
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:47.120
it was a very fun experience and a,
and so initially it was just two songs.

411
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.470
And then like I said,

412
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:52.070
I just started getting gigs and I didn't even have enough songs to do the gigs.

413
00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:55.820
And,
and then I,
I started proactively getting involved and,

414
00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.830
and with my album being a co Co presented by the Jazz Institute,
that was like,

415
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:05.810
yes,
you know,
and then I just got more into it and I'm,
I'm still learning jazz.

416
00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:09.200
So let's see,
I have a quite a way to go with it.

417
00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:13.800
<v 2>Thank you.
Awesome.
Um,
with our last song,</v>

418
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:17.580
it brought good memories to my own wedding and how emotional it gets with your

419
00:42:17.581 --> 00:42:21.180
family around you.
And honestly,
those were Indian weddings are big,

420
00:42:21.181 --> 00:42:23.850
like the few hundred people and they bring in the emotions with them.

421
00:42:23.851 --> 00:42:26.570
So it was amazing to bring back good memories.
Um,

422
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:29.580
so I hope you guys enjoyed the show.
It was very beautiful.

423
00:42:29.581 --> 00:42:31.230
It was a great start to my weekend.

424
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.410
It's very unconventional that I go to music gigs like these,

425
00:42:34.411 --> 00:42:38.640
but short inspires me to,
you know,
achieve my own dreams.
I do have some,

426
00:42:38.641 --> 00:42:39.510
I will get there.

427
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:44.480
And then she has these really unconventional story she brought in,
uh,

428
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.520
all her own wisdom along with her.
So I hope this,

429
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.610
this lines up straight up for some thinking for your weekend as well.

430
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.550
But I line up,
um,
like I was saying,
you can line up for questions over here.
Uh,

431
00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.470
but I'll get to my next question.
So what's next for you?

432
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.330
You mentioned that you have a second album.

433
00:43:00.331 --> 00:43:04.170
Can you describe a little more of the team,
uh,
your thoughts along with it?

434
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.250
<v 1>Sure.
So,
um,
I actually want to explore other genres.</v>

435
00:43:08.251 --> 00:43:10.980
And the first album was pop jazz.

436
00:43:10.981 --> 00:43:15.840
So for the second one it'll be like an acoustic album with vocals and guitar.

437
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.800
I think I'm going to dive more into folk.
Um,
I'm Punjabi.

438
00:43:19.801 --> 00:43:24.570
So I also want to dive into Punjabi music.
And a Hindi is of course,

439
00:43:24.571 --> 00:43:27.990
so it's going to be a folk pop and a very acoustic,

440
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.420
easy listening album with more focused on vocals.

441
00:43:30.421 --> 00:43:33.990
And I'll try to bring in some of my improvisation from jazz,

442
00:43:33.991 --> 00:43:38.640
whatever I'm learning and kind of mix it with folks.
So that's the plan.

443
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.830
<v 2>Thank you.
So we have a question here.</v>

444
00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:47.860
<v 15>Thanks.
It's really very impressive.
I mean,</v>

445
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:51.890
and your voice is fantastic.
Um,
I'm curious,
uh,

446
00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:57.180
it sounds like there's an influence of Brazilian jazz.

447
00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.650
Um,

448
00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:02.970
so I wanted to ask if there was anything that kind of drew you toward that,

449
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:08.360
a category of jazz.
And then secondly,
I was curious to ask,
uh,

450
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:13.520
have you ever pursued or received a formal training,

451
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:18.090
um,
voice training,
compensation training?
This is,
it's really,
really good.

452
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.670
Or is it just come?
It just comes.

453
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.320
<v 1>Uh,
so the first question with resilient jazz,</v>

454
00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:28.850
I would like to give credit to the cards for this one because he's actually,

455
00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.613
um,

456
00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:35.160
I was initially doing just jazz with my band,

457
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:39.210
with my jazz and my band were all jazz musicians in Chicago and that was just,

458
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:44.310
um,
Chicago jazz fuse with Indian music.
And that sounds very different.

459
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.870
I met because,
because I was introduced to him by t Alexander,
who's a really,

460
00:44:48.871 --> 00:44:51.270
really popular jazz artists in Chicago.

461
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.920
And because his style I think has a lot of Brazilian jazz to eight,

462
00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:59.670
if I'm not wrong.
Yeah.
And,
and so when,
when,
um,

463
00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:03.610
when the idea came to take my songs and we're working as a duo,

464
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.440
I think it really opened my ears to that style of jazz.

465
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:10.670
And so I think there was a lot of give and take.
Like I,

466
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.240
I learned from the way he was playing on how to phrase my,

467
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:19.140
my lyrics or how to work around my songs.
And so that influence I would say,

468
00:45:19.141 --> 00:45:23.390
comes a lot from,
from the exposure I've had by working with because,

469
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:28.920
um,
and for the second question,
which was about formal training.
So,

470
00:45:28.921 --> 00:45:32.610
um,
I grew up in Delhi and I moved to the states when I was 15.

471
00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:37.611
So I received about eight years of Indian classical training in India.

472
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.280
And when I moved to the states,
I didn't have a guru when I couldn't,

473
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.510
I couldn't find anyone.
So I didn't continue that.
And then I,

474
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.580
I had vocal coaches at abroad.

475
00:45:47.581 --> 00:45:51.810
We coach and as an a coach who was working on Broadway.
And so my,

476
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.490
I was part of the choir.

477
00:45:53.491 --> 00:45:57.930
I used to sing Christmas carols at senior citizen centers and Events and

478
00:45:57.931 --> 00:46:00.630
festivals.
So I think my,
um,

479
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:05.330
my style isn't a Indian classical anymore.
It evolved.
And,
uh,
I'd,

480
00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:08.430
I'd like to say it's kind of like indoor western.
It's a,

481
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:10.130
it's a kind of like a mix.
Uh,

482
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:14.450
and that's purely because of geographical reasons because of being in the US.

483
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:19.320
And,
uh,
and I think I've,
right now my coach is an opera singer,

484
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:22.650
so I'm also learning techniques that way.

485
00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:26.480
So it's been a blend of a lot of different styles.
Uh,

486
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:31.260
so that's what it is in writing.
I've been writing ever since I was in school.

487
00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:35.970
So the lyrics and everything are just from what I observe,
I just write it down.

488
00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:40.560
So thank you.
Since you sound awesome.

489
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.370
Like imagine chasing your childhood dreams from writing to singing and now

490
00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:48.660
learning from an opera singer.
She's more inspiring by the minute she talks.

491
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:53.760
So we have a few minutes.
If there are no questions she can sing a cover for us.

492
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:57.830
Um,
so we feel comfortable.
We can do one more song.
Shane,

493
00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.560
keep the show running if you guys want to hear it.
Sure.
Okay.

494
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:06.270
Um,
so this,
uh,
discover that we'll do it.

495
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:10.620
It's called an India Arie and uh,
in India means sleep.

496
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:15.060
And this is actually a lullaby where this guy is a calling,
sweet,

497
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:17.620
sweet sleep to come and,
um,

498
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:22.830
help him fall into these dreams and into his fantasy world.
And um,

499
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.360
this is a coke studio song.
If he's released on Coke Studio,
Pakistan,

500
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.750
the artist who had composed the song,
his name is [inaudible],

501
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:35.670
she's a Pakistani artist.
And I absolutely love his work.
And,
uh,

502
00:47:35.671 --> 00:47:37.990
so this is our rendition of his song.

503
